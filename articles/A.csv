There were stocks that saw price drops over 50% during the plunge in February and March and some of those same stocks have more than doubled off of their March lows. Trading stocks like that can certainly be exciting, but it can also be stressful.I took note of a stock recently that has been far more stable than the overall market and that is Agilent Technologies (A). Yes the diagnostics and research firm saw its stock decline, but not nearly as much as the overall market. From the S&P’s closing high on February 19 through the low on March 23, the index fell 33.7%. During this same stretch, Agilent fell 25.8%.That might not seem like a huge difference, but if a stock drops 25.8%, it needs to rally by 35% to get back to where it was. A stock that drops 33.7% needs to rally by 52% to get back to where it was before the decline.Agilent has rallied off of its March low, just like the market has, and at this point it is only down 3.5% from where it closed on February 19. The S&P is still down approximately 16% from its February 19 closing price.The company is set to release its fiscal second-quarter earnings results after the closing bell on Thursday and it is expected to see a decline in earnings compared to last year. Analysts expect Agilent to earn $0.61 per share for the quarter and the company earned $0.71 in the second quarter of 2019. This marks a drop of 16.4%Revenue is expected to come in at $1.21 billion after coming in at $1.24 billion in the second quarter of 2019 and that is a decline of 2.4%.Over the last three years, Agilent has seen earnings grow by 15% per year and they increased by 7% in the first quarter. Revenue has increased by 7% per year over this same time period and it was up by 6% in the third quarter. For the year, analysts expect earnings to drop by 3% overall while revenue is expected to increase by 2.2%.Agilent sports a return on equity of 21.2% and a profit margin of 23%. Both of these figures are above average. From a valuation standpoint, the stock is trading with a trailing P/E of 33.6 and a forward P/E of 24.2.Prior to the big selloff in most stocks, Agilent had been moving higher within a trend channel that went back a couple of years. The stock broke above the upper rail in January and then it broke below the lower rail in March.The rally over the last few months has moved the stock back within the channel, but it’s unclear if the channel will remain relevant at this point. The stock has moved back above all three of the moving averages I like to use and that is encouraging. The 13-week moving average has moved below the 52-week at this point, but it remains above the 104-week moving average.We see that the 10-week RSI reached oversold territory in March and has since been moving higher. The weekly stochastic indicators didn’t quite reach oversold territory and they made a bullish crossover in March. The oscillators are moving toward overbought territory, but aren’t there quite yet. Looking back at 2017 we see that both the RSI and the stochastic indicators remained in overbought territory for extended periods of time while the stock continued to climb.Looking at the sentiment indicators for Agilent, we see that there is a slight bearish skew toward the stock. There are 17 analysts following the stock with eight “buy” ratings, eight “hold” ratings, and one “sell” rating. This gives us a buy percentage of 47% and that is well below the average stock.The short interest ratio is at 2.1 and that is slightly below the long-term average, but would appear to be in line with most ratios at this time. I have written about Agilent on two previous occasions, and the ratio was lower in one of those instances (8/19) and slightly higher in the other one (11/19).The option sentiment is a little more bearish than the average stock with a put/call ratio of 1.08. There are 11,722 puts open currently and 10,770 calls. The ratio is quite a bit higher than the 0.85 reading in February when Agilent last reported earnings, but it is slightly lower than the 1.12 reading we saw last November.Looking at the three sentiment indicators as a whole, I would say there is a little more skepticism toward Agilent than there is toward the average stock, mainly due to analysts' ratings and buy percentage being so low.I remain bullish on Agilent for the intermediate term. I can see the stock continuing to trudge higher over the next six to nine months. The fundamentals are solid, the chart shows an overall upward trend, and there is just enough bearish sentiment to meet my contrarian standards.As for the earnings report, Agilent has a history of beating estimates and has done so in seven of the last quarters. The company barely beat in February, but the stock rolled over and dropped pretty sharply. Of course, the last earnings report was on February 18 and that was the day before the S&P’s peak on February 19.The stock was trending higher when the company reported in November and the trend continued from there. The stock had slipped a little last August and then rallied after the earnings report. Last May, Agilent gapped lower after its earnings report, but the decline took it down to its 104-week moving average and then the stock rallied for a month and a half after that.If you own the stock already, I don’t think you need to take any action ahead of the earnings report. If you are looking to buy the stock, I don’t think you have to buy before the earnings report. The stock has only gapped higher on a couple of occasions out of the last eight earnings reports. The more common reaction to earnings has been a rather steady move higher after the earnings report.Agilent might not be the sexiest stock and it might not jump 30% to 40% in a few months, but it does appear to be more stable than a lot of other stocks. Sometimes, especially in a volatile market, stability is a nice trait."
4368143,20715,2020-08-12T17:26:17-04:00,"Agilent is set to report fiscal third-quarter earnings results on Tuesday.The stock has performed well over the past year, outpacing the S&P by a wide margin.Sentiment toward the stock is modestly skewed to the bearish side, especially the overall analysts' ratings.","Over the last year, I have written about Agilent (A) on three occasions and that makes up one-third of the articles that have been written about the stock here on Seeking Alpha during that time. I’m not sure why the stock doesn’t get more attention — it trades 1.5 million shares per day and the market cap is over $30 billion, but it doesn’t get much fanfare at all.Agilent has performed well as a company and the stock is up 45.2% since I wrote about it last August, far outpacing the S&P 500’s 16.3% over the same period. The company is getting ready to release fiscal third-quarter earnings results on Tuesday and analysts expect a small decline from the same period last year.The current consensus estimate is for earnings of $0.66 per share and that is down from $0.76 last year. Revenue is expected to come in at $1.21 billion and that is 4.9% below the revenue of $1.27 billion last year. Earnings were flat in the second quarter, coming in at $0.71 in 2020 and 2019. Revenue was also flat in the second quarter.The global economic slowdown created by the COVID-19 virus has slowed Agilent a little, but it hasn’t hurt the company as much as others. Over the last three years, the company has seen average annual earnings growth of 14% and average revenue growth of 7%. Analysts expect earnings growth of 14.7% and revenue growth of 16.4% for 2021.The company’s management efficiency measurements are above average with a return on equity of 21.2% and a profit margin of 23%. The trailing P/E is 44.5 and the forward P/E is 27.5.Being in the diagnostics and research arena of the healthcare industry should help insulate Agilent from any continued economic slowdown. The areas that Agilent specializes in won’t likely get a boost from any COVID-19 business, but it shouldn’t have a detrimental effect either.One of the ongoing items I have been watching for in Agilent is a trend channel on the weekly chart. The stock has moved above the upper rail of the channel in the last month or so. The stock has also entered overbought territory based on the 10-week RSI and the weekly stochastic readings.The blue arrows on the chart mark the timing of my past articles and I was bullish in all three instances.The stochastic indicators have spent long periods of time in overbought territory, so that isn’t a big concern. The RSI just entered overbought territory and the stock hasn’t stayed there for very long over the last few years. We see that the stock pulled back in the first half of 2018 after the RSI exceeded 70. It happened again in the first half of 2019. The one time the RSI remained in overbought territory for a few months was from November ’19 through January ’20.Looking at how the stock has performed after the RSI enters overbought territory, I am more cautious on Agilent at this time. While I doubt the stock will drop all the way back down to the lower rail of the trend channel, I do think a downward cycle in the overall upward trend is likely. The trend channel could be out of date going forward.When I first wrote about Agilent last August, the sentiment was skewed to the bullish side. The sentiment made a gradual shift to a more bearish stance with analysts becoming far less bullish and the short interest ratio increased ever so slightly. Option traders are slightly more bullish this time around than they have been in my previous three reports.At this time, there are 15 analysts covering the stock with seven “buy” ratings, seven “hold” ratings, and one “sell” rating. This gives us a buy percentage of 46.7% and that is well below average. It is particularly low for a company with fundamental indicators as good as Agilent’s. The buy percentage was at 75% last August.The short interest ratio is at 2.2 currently and that is slightly below the average ratio of 3.0. Last August the ratio was 1.5 and then it was above 2.0 in November and in May. The short interest did drop a little in the most recent reporting period.The put/call ratio is at 0.639 currently with 15,228 puts open and 23,830 calls open at this time. The ratio was higher in all three previous instances when I wrote about Agilent. On two of those occasions, the ratio was above 1.0. What this indicates is that option traders have become more optimistic at this point.None of the sentiment indicators are at one extreme or the other. Analysts are more bearish toward Agilent than they should be in my opinion. Short sellers are slightly more bullish toward the stock than the average stock, but they are more bearish than they were last year. Option traders have become more bullish, but the open interest only represents a little over 2.5 days of daily trading volume.I still like Agilent’s fundamentals and I like the little bit of pessimism from analysts. The only problem I have with Agilent right now is the fact that it is overbought based on both the RSI and the weekly stochastic indicators. The stochastic indicators aren’t that big of an issue, but the RSI is an issue.The last three times the stock saw its 10-week RSI move above 70, the stock lost at least 18% after it peaked. The fall from this past January through the low in March was much more severe, but those were extenuating circumstances. It is worth noting that Agilent started falling long before the overall market did. The stock fell 10% in the last two weeks of January and then fell even further once the market started its free-fall.At this point, it is hard to say whether the stock has peaked or not, but I don’t think there is much more upside for it before we see a similar pullback to what we saw in the three previous instances mentioned. As of now, the stock peaked just below the $100 level and that would mean a drop to the $82 level would be a reasonable expectation based on the previous pullbacks. Because this isn’t an exact science, I wouldn’t get too greedy and try to time the low, but I think a drop below the $85 level would be a good entry price for investors looking to enter a new position on Agilent.Looking at the company’s previous eight earnings releases, it has beaten estimates six times, it matched one time, and it missed on one occasion. The time it matched and the time it missed both preceded downward moves in the stock. If we were to see a match or a miss on Tuesday, that might be the trigger for the next down leg on the chart."
4352647,94896,2020-06-08T17:12:18-04:00,"Agilent isn't exciting, but there's value in stability.Agilent appears fully valued in the current interest rate environment.On a pullback into the ~$74 range, I'd consider dipping in a toe.","Originally a 1999 spin-off of Hewlett-Packard, Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) is an established life sciences and diagnostics company operating out of Santa Clara, CA. Agilent underwent its own spin-off of Keysight Technologies (KEYS) in 2014, separating out technical and electronic instrumentation and leaving Agilent as a pure-play healthcare company. Mr. Mike McMullen was appointed Agilent CEO in March 2015, although he has been with the company since 1984. Given the significant changes in the 2014-15 time frame, this article will focus primarily on Agilent from 2015 going forward.Agilent operates three segments: Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group (LSAG), Diagnostics and Genomics Group (DGG), and Agilent CrossLab Group (ACG). The company produces products like cell imaging systems and microplate readers, and performs tasks like DNA methylation profiling and raman spectroscopy (finally, we'll figure out what makes those noodles so delicious). Breaking revenue down by segment:*Core growth is adjusted for acquisitions, divestitures, and FXOverall, Q1 of 2020 was fairly typical for Agilent as they've delivered about 6% revenue growth every year since 2015. Let's look closer at each segment.Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group - The noticeable difference in core vs. non-core revenue growth is primarily attributable to the acquisition of BioTek for roughly $1B (after tax benefits) growing at roughly 10% with 2018 revenue of $162. The core growth story is not as bleak is it first appears due to the COVID-19 outbreak in China, but given the spread of the virus since then, we're unlikely to see anything beyond low single-digit growth this year from LSAG. Management suggested that sales were simply delayed rather than lost. Reasonable given the instrument heavy business in China, but less likely to play out equally in the US and Europe given the higher mix of services and consumables.Agilent Cross Lab Group - Agilent's 2nd largest segment provided 6% revenue growth with double-digit growth from China, which is where we begin to see how dependent Agilent is on China for growth. Agilent established its presence in China well before many of its competitors, which works to its advantage given the high switching cost for reliable healthcare instrumentation and supplies. Given that Agilent's business is quite mature in the US and Europe, its strong reputation in China gives investors confidence for continued organic growth in the APAC region, currently 35% of its overall business.Diagnostics and Genomics Group - Agilent's smallest segment delivered the consistent mid-single-digit growth that investors have come to expect. While operating margin dropped half a percent, this was primarily due to the startup of a new manufacturing site for its growing Nucleic Acids Solutions Division. Additional near-term investments in this segment appear to secure future growth with possible margin expansion.A Discounted Cash Flow valuation should be well suited given the steady, reliable, and mature nature of the business; of course, it's only as reliable as its inputs:Unfortunately, the fair value of Agilent using DCF is highly dependent on their WACC, which, assuming a fixed Market Risk Premium of 6%, is primarily driven by changes in the risk-free interest rate, something beyond the company's control.We'll take a look at what I believe to be the top opportunities for the industry, the company, and a wildcard.The life sciences industry - An expanding senior population typically means higher healthcare costs, and therefore more revenue for healthcare companies. For example, the USA had 35M seniors aged 65+ in the year 2000. That number has expanded to 55M today and is projected to be over 70M in 2030.Agilent - Agilent established itself early in China and its current CEO played a big role in development there as well as the rest of the APAC region, including living for some time in Japan. My assumption from these facts is that Agilent would be at least as prepared as its competitors, if not more, to continue expansion in this high growth region. From the conference call, it's clear that management spends much more its time thinking about this region for growth than Europe and its past expansion suggests they have been successful.Wildcard - This opportunity is not as likely to come to fruition as the other two, but there is a near-term possibility of a Biden presidency coupled with Democratic control of Congress which could mean a dramatic expansion of healthcare in the USA, and that's likely to be a positive for healthcare stocks.I'll take the same approach as opportunities by looking at the top risks for the industry, the company, and a wildcard.The life sciences industry - The biggest risk to the industry is a reversal in interest rate policy specifically because the industry is pricing in a low risk-free interest rate. When you look at forward PEs of competitors like Danaher (NYSE:DHR) at 30x, Waters Corp. (NYSE:WAT) at 22x, Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) at 27x, or A at 24x, these multiples are hard to justify for an industry with mid-single-digit sales growth, unless the risk-free interest rate stays firmly below 3%. COVID-19 has ensured that we won't see inflation in the near-term, but if we see increased money supply (likely due to Fed printing), a rise in energy prices (possible due to slashed CapEx), and an increase in credit availability (unlikely due to high unemployment), interest rates would likely rise.Agilent - Agilent's CEO made a curious comment on the Q1 conference call when asked by an analyst: ""There were some negative pricing effects on the instrument business. Could you elaborate on that?"" CEO McMullen gave the response: ""I think that question needs to be posed to our competitors because we saw particularly as we finished the calendar year, we saw some very aggressive pricing by some of our competitors."" Alright, competitors compete with each other, unfortunate for investors, but we're used to it. What's worrisome is that management, including LSAG's head who had nothing to add, may not have a good grasp on the pricing environment they're a part of.Wildcard - China alone accounts for 19% or Agilent's revenue as well as a significant portion of its growth. If the past is indicative of the future, their instrument heavy presence in China should naturally expand as consumables and services become a greater part of the mix, which should be good news. However, COVID-19 may trigger a shift towards domestic producers across the globe as nations seek higher self-reliance, potentially limiting Agilent's expansion. If this shift occurs, it will likely take time given the difficulty in replicating the precision instrumentation Agilent produces, perhaps even decades, so I don't view it as a near-term risk.Over the long term, the CEO and management team have the power to either create or destroy shareholder value, so I think it's important to listen to at least one conference call and examine their history to get a feel for their character as well as possible strengths and weaknesses.Starting with insider holdings: As of early May, CEO McMullen owned roughly 500k shares equivalent to ~$40M, a significant sum and far more than any other insider. There was essentially no insider buying coupled with regular sales in line with stock-based compensation. As far as management is concerned, the stock is fairly priced at current levels.Mr. McMullen has been with the company since 1984, serving as CEO since 2015, so it's fair to say this is company he knows well, specifically the APAC business where he spent a good deal of his time prior to his appointment as CEO. Mr. McMullen was complementary of his team fielding many of the big pictures questions while the group heads dove into specifics in each of their areas.The management team spent quite a bit of time on the coronavirus in China because that's where it was relevant in February, but spent no time talking about the potential spread throughout the rest of the world. They specifically did not change their guidance for the full year, suggesting that management was caught flat-footed, but then again, who wasn't? (aside from Bill Ackman, who is coincidentally a big shareholder). This, coupled with the surprising competitive pricing mentioned earlier, suggests that while the management team isn't necessarily proactive in anticipating surprises, they don't overreact as suggested by Mr. McMullen in the comment: ""We don't play the price game here. I mean that's not how we want to win."" Their acquisition history points towards a level-headed, not overly reactive, decision-making process as they've typically favored smaller purchases that make strategic sense for the company, and that doesn't appear likely to change anytime soon as Mr. McMullen suggests, ""We're going to stay in our lane here and not do anything that's [a] magnitude larger than a BioTek.""Overall, it's good to see a level-headed management team that takes criticism in stride, is not promising the world, and ultimately seems content to have the business continue to grow in a steady reliable way through a natural expanding core business with reasonable acquisitions.I'd expect Agilent to perform largely in line with the broader stock market. It's an unexciting business with unexciting growth prospects, but if stability is your game, Agilent might be your name. Unless you expect interest rates to stay near zero for a long time, Agilent is fully priced for the current environment. If interest rates rise significantly, expect Agilent to sell off with the broader market as institutional and pension funds finally have a place to put their money other than equities. I'm not a buyer this close to all-time highs, but I could be tempted to start building a position near the solid base of support around $74."
4329436,31441,2020-03-04T08:56:04-05:00,"Agilent warned its life sciences operations faced headwinds from the coronavirus in its most recent quarter.It expects more headwinds in the first half of the year.Margins dipped slightly in its most-recent quarter, but could improve later on in the year.At 22x EBITDA the stock is overvalued.","Source: The New York TimesFinancial markets fell hard last week on fears of the coronavirus. Both the S&P 500 (SPY) and Dow Jones (DIA) fell by double digits. Several drug companies are trying to develop a treatment for the virus. The outbreak is hurting manufacturing activity in China. It could also be disruptive to companies with supply chains in China. Agilent Technologies (A) could be one of those companies. The stock is off in the mid-single-digit percentage range since reporting earnings in mid-February. The stock has likely been negatively impacted by the sell off in broader markets.In its most recent quarter Agilent reported revenue of about $1.4 billion, up 6% Y/Y. Each of the company's three main operating segments reported growth in the mid-single-digit percentage range.Revenue from the Life Sciences and Applied Markets Group (""LSAG"") grew 5% Y/Y on a reported basis. Results were driven by strong performance in biopharma and cell analysis. On a core basis, LSAG's revenue actually fell 2% as the segment was negatively impacted by the coronavirus:Agilent's quarter ended January 31, 2020. Per management, Agilent expects to recognize bulk of the $10 lost revenue in the following quarter. The lion's share of the $10 million hit to revenue was located within LSAG.Agilent Cross Lab Group (""ACG"") reported revenue of $249 million, up 6% Y/Y. Growth was broad-based, as the segment demonstrated traction across both services and consumables. It grew revenue in China in the low-teens, leveraging its large instrument installed base. The Diagnostics and Genomics Group (""DGG"") reported revenue of $470 million, up 6% Y/Y. The segment generated mid-single-digit growth in Pathology related businesses.Revenue growth was solid, yet margins fell. Gross margin was 53%, down over 100 basis points versus the year earlier period. Gross margin for LSAG and DGG fell by 190 basis points and 230 basis points, respectively. Gross margin for ACG was practically flat. On a dollar basis, gross profit was $723 million, up 2% Y/Y. Growth in gross profit was much less than growth in revenue. Startup costs for the company's new NASD facility and negative pricing for Agilent's instrumentation business weighed. Once startup costs ramp down then pressure on gross margin could dissipate.R&D and SG&A costs were a combined $508 million, up by double-digits Y/Y. As a percentage of revenue they were a combined 37%, up about 180 basis points versus the year earlier period. The fallout was that EBITDA of $294 million fell 3% Y/Y. This came despite the rise in revenue. EBITDA margin was 22%, off about 200 basis points versus the year earlier period. Management could potentially buttress EBITDA by cutting into its sizable pool of R&D and SG&A expenses.Agilent's top line growth was solid. Headwinds from the coronavirus will likely persist through the first half of 2020. Its financials could return to normal by the second half of the year. However, its valuation could be much lower by then. Financial markets have diverged to the downside over the past week. The coronavirus will likely cause a slowdown in the global economy and a hit to corporate profits. It could finally create some sort of price discovery in the markets. Stocks could finally be priced based on a semblance of earnings fundamentals instead of stimulus from the Fed.That said, Agilent's enterprise value is around $26 billion. It trades at 22x last 12 months EBITDA. I believe this is too robust for a company with mid-single-digit revenue growth and margins that may not improve anytime soon.Agilent's share price appears overvalued based on earnings fundamentals. Sell the stock."

The company provided non-GAAP earnings guidance of $0.80 to $0.81 per share for Q1 in their Q4 earnings report. However, the GAAP earnings for Q1 are likely to be significantly lower.The company will have a one-time charge of ~$0.74/share due to taxes from on-shoring certain intangible assets from subsidiaries to the U.S. The charge of $231MM is disclosed on page 45 of the company's 10-K filing. The large difference in reported earnings and guidance may come as a surprise to some shareholders, which could result in increased volatility in the stock after earnings are reported. With a potential catalyst in place to drive shares lower, now is a good time to determine what Agilent shares might be worth.Since being spun off from Hewlett Packard (HPQ) in 1999, Agilent Technologies, subsequently, split off the electronics measurement business as Keysight Technologies (KEYS) on November 1, 2014, becoming a pure play laboratory instrument business. The company continues to expand its product offering, recently focusing on life science applications.The company made two major acquisitions in the life science space in 2019, buying ACEA Biosciences Inc. for $250MM and Lionheart Technologies (""BioTek"") for $1.17B. The company spent $536MM to acquire seven businesses in 2018 (page 30 of 2019 10-K).Revenues are evenly split between the Americas and Asia at 36% apiece, with Europe contributing 28%. The company has been working towards increasing market share in diagnostics and clinical applications, but laboratory instruments still represent a bulk of the business (85%).From Agilent's Q1 Institutional Investor meetingThe business generates 58% of its revenue from software, consumables, and service. Agilent competes directly with companies like Thermo Fisher Scientific (TMO), PerkinElmer (PKI), and Waters Corporation (WAT).Agilent's instruments are used to characterize a variety of molecules, from small organic molecules used in the petroleum and pharmaceutical industry all the way up to large biomolecules and whole cells.Agilent GC/MS from the company's websiteThe instruments are generally robust and can run for decades with only routine maintenance. I have seen 30-year old instruments still being used in labs. A typical gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy unit might cost on the order of $100K, so you can certainly understand why labs run these instruments as long as possible.Of course, some labs do by instruments more frequently in order to have cutting edge technology with better detection capabilities, but spending on instruments can dry up during tough economic times. That is one reason the company has been looking to focus on more dependable sales in diagnostics and software.From Agilent's Q1 Institutional Investor meetingAgilent has grown free cash flow per share at an average rate of 11.8% over the last five years, helped in part by reducing the shares outstanding by 6% over that time.Data by YChartsLooking at the free cash flow as a whole over the 20-year history of the company, one can see the cyclical nature of the business. More concerning is the fact that the free cash flow trend has not been climbing across economic cycles.Compare that to Thermo Fisher Scientific, which has managed to continue to grow free cash flow even during economic slowdowns. Agilent's instruments have traditionally been more expensive than comparable machines from Thermo Fisher, which might partially explain why Agilent's business is more susceptible to economic cycles.Data by YChartsTo be fair, Agilent has spun off several businesses during this time, so the cash flow is slightly lower than it would be otherwise. Cash from operating activities dropped from $711MM in 2014 to $491MM in 2015, the first full-year following the KeySight spin off. Investment in property, plant, and equipment also fell from $205MM in 2014 to $98MM in 2015, making the net impact on free cash flow somewhere around $100MM in 2015, not taking into account costs associated with the spin off effort.Agilent's operating margins have been steadily improving since the KeySight spin, but they still are much lower than many peer companies. Thermo Fisher's operating margins are naturally lower due to their product mix, which includes many third-party products. Bill Ackman took a position in Agilent late last year on the thesis that margins could be further expanded and the balance sheet could be further leveraged.Data by YChartsAgilent provided adjusted EPS guidance of $3.38 to $3.43 per share, a 9% to 10% increase on 2019 adjusted EPS of $3.11. The 2019 adjusted earnings were actually below the GAAP EPS of $3.37, largely due to a tax benefit from an intra-entity asset transfer.From Agilent's Q1 Institutional Investor meetingAgilent expects their portfolio to realize 3-5% organic growth over the long term, which we can use for the terminal growth rate in our discounted free cash flow model.From Agilent's Q1 Institutional Investor meetingThe model uses 8.9% as the cost of capital (CAPM model), giving a working average cost of capital around 8.4% that is used to discount future cash flows to the present. Below are three different growth scenarios, with the high growth rate most closely matching company guidance and the most recent earnings history.Table: Net Present Value of Shares Based on Projected Free Cash FlowsAgilent is, currently, trading around $86 per share, somewhere in between the high growth and moderate growth scenarios. Growth is the only way to justify the current share price given shares are currently trading at over 31 times 2019 free cash flow.The moderate growth scenario seems reasonable, even conservative, if Agilent can maintain current growth rates. However, a coronavirus induced economic slowdown could precipitate the next cyclical decline for the company. Revenues from China represented 19.7% of sales in fiscal year 2019.From page 111 of Agilent's 2019 10-KIt remains to be seen if Agilent's move towards recession-resistant consumables and services will have the desired effect of stabilizing the business during downturns. It is also too early to know what kind of returns the company will get on the nearly $2B it has spent on acquisitions in the last two years. The company's 5-year average return on capital is around 9.2%, which isn't appreciably higher than their cost of capital.Agilent's forward annual dividend rate of $0.72/share equates to a yield of just 0.84%. The $225MM in total dividend payments for 2020 represents around 38% of their projected free cash flow for the year, so the dividend is safe and has room to grow. The company has been steadily increasing the dividend since it was cut in 2015 following the Keysight spin off.Data by YChartsAgilent has posted an impressive record of growth in recent years, and there is some reason to believe that the trend can continue. However, the company has yet to demonstrate that it can grow free cash flow over the long term. With a low dividend yield and a return on capital near the cost of capital, the current share price of $85.85 does not offer a value investor a big enough margin of safety to initiate a position in the stock, especially given the cyclical nature of the business. Even in the event of a price correction, I would prefer to invest in higher quality names in the lab equipment space, like Thermo Fisher Scientific or Illumina (ILMN)."
4308328,20715,2019-11-21T12:47:10-05:00,Agilent is expected to report fourth quarter earnings results on Monday.The stock has rallied by almost 20% since its last earnings report and has moved from oversold to overbought as a result.The sentiment has shifted away from a more optimistic stance to a more neutral stance since the last earnings report.,"I wrote an earnings preview on Agilent (A) back in August, and I had a bullish outlook on the company back then. Here is what I stated in my summary paragraph:While I was bullish, my statement that the stock wasn't likely to gap higher turned out to be wrong. The stock gapped almost 10% higher when it opened on August 15, the morning after the earnings report. The stock has continued to rally since the report and is up almost 20% since the close on August 14.Now, the company is getting ready to report fiscal fourth quarter results after the closing bell on Monday. Analysts expect the company to report earnings of $0.85 per share for the quarter and that is a slight increase from the $0.81 EPS in the fourth quarter of 2018.My bullish stance on Agilent back in August was based on a number of factors - the fundamentals and the technical picture were the main drivers with the sentiment toward the stock a minor concern. The fundamentals are still strong with the company growing earnings at a rate of 17% per year over the last three years and a jump of 13% in the third quarter. One thing that has changed in the last three months is that analysts expect earnings to grow by 11% for 2019. Back in August, the estimated annual growth was at 9%.Revenues have been growing by 8% per year over the last three years and they increased by 6% in the third quarter. Analysts expect revenue to come in at $1.33 billion for the fourth quarter and that would be an increase of 3% over last year.The management efficiency measurements did change a little since the last earnings report. The return on equity was at 22.93% and it is now 19.3%. It dropped a little, but it is still above average. The profit margin didn't change and is at 22.5%.The overall fundamental picture for Agilent is still strong and that is part of the reason why the stock has rallied over the last three months.The technical setup for Agilent was a big part of why I was bullish back in August. The stock was down near the lower rail of a trend channel and it was hovering near its 104-week moving average. The stock was also close to oversold territory based on the weekly stochastic readings. Now, the stochastic readings are in overbought territory and they have been elevated for almost two months now.The 10-week RSI hasn't reached overbought territory just yet, but it is certainly trending that way. The last time the indicator hit overbought territory was back in the first quarter and that was a bad sign for the stock. In fact, the last two times where the stochastic readings were in overbought territory and the RSI was in overbought territory, it was a bad sign for the stock.As impressive as the rally has been, it still faces the potential resistance in the $80 to $82.50 range. That was the all-time high that it hit back in February and March and it could potentially be a hurdle for the stock as it moves back up.The three main sentiment indicators that I look at are the analysts' ratings, the short interest ratio, and the put/call ratio. All three of these indicators have shifted to a more bearish reading in the last three months and as a contrarian, that is a good sign.There are 15 analysts covering the stock at this time with no ""buy"" ratings, five ""hold"" ratings, and one ""sell"" rating. This puts the buy percentage at 60% and that is slightly below average. Back in August, the buy percentage was at 75%. The changes have come from a drop in coverage and all of the ones that stopped covering the stock had buy ratings on it.The short interest ratio is at 2.4 and while that is still below average, it is up from the 1.5 reading we saw back in August. The number of shares sold short has increased from 4.0 million shares to 4.99 million shares since the last earnings report.Finally, the put/call ratio is at 1.12 with 19,132 puts and 17,066 calls open at this time. This reading is slightly above average, but, more importantly, it is up from the 0.846 reading we saw back in August. The put open interest has increased slightly while the call open interest is down by almost 5,000 contracts.While none of the three sentiment indicators are displaying extreme bearish readings, they have all three shifted to a more bearish stance. Now, what you need to remember is that increasing bearish sentiment is a good thing from a contrarian point of view.I am still bullish on Agilent for the long term, but I don't know if it is the right time to buy the stock. The stock has moved from oversold territory and hovering just above the lower rail of its trend channel and now it is in overbought territory and approaching potential resistance in the $80 to $82.50 range.The fundamentals are still good and the sentiment has shifted away from some pretty optimistic readings. In fact, I mentioned that the sentiment was a concern when I wrote the article back in August. However, I felt the technical picture was an overriding factor in that case.If I owned the stock already, I certainly wouldn't be looking to sell it at this time as I think it should continue to move higher in the coming quarters. If I was looking to add it to my portfolio, I would try to exercise patience and wait for the stock to pull back a little and move the oscillators down toward oversold territory. I would also look to buy it closer to the lower rail of the channel than the upper rail of the channel."
4345724,105560,2020-05-10T12:11:49-04:00,"Agilent is a good business protected by strong industry moats.
        The company has a long runway to grow intrinsic value at 10%+ annually for many years.
        Margin expansion opportunity and Pershing Square involvement provides attractive upside.
        The stock is a great buy at $65 or lower.","Agilent Technologies is a good business protected by a strong moat with ample room to grow. Bill Ackman and Pershing Square initiated a position in Agilent late last year around the current share price, so I decided to take a more in-depth look to assess the potential.While I may not be quite as bullish as Ackman, I think Agilent should produce respectable 10%+ returns from current levels with solid upside. The stock is a great investment anywhere below $65, levels it has touched multiple times over the past year, likely producing at least mid-teen’s annual returns for several years.After a quick industry overview I will do a deeper dive into the structural advantages of the business and discuss prospective returnsAgilent competes in the analytical measurement space and provides instrumentation, consumables, and services to testing labs across the world. The company operates in three reportable segments: Life Sciences and Applied Markets, Diagnostics and Genomics, and CrossLab. Each of these segments serve the attractive and growing end markets below.Source: Q3 2019 Institutional Investor MeetingAgilent essentially supplies instrumentation such as chromatography machines, mass spectrometers, and cellular analysis devices along with the associated software and consumables (like test vials and reagents). The equipment is used to perform tests such as cancer and DNA diagnostics, chemical properties of drugs and food, and environmental contamination.Source: Q3 20129 Institutional Investor MeetingThe nature of the industries served and services provided lead to an attractive business model and a number of structural advantages.Agilent checks several boxes that I look for when identifying businesses with enduring competitive advantages that lead to attractive economics. Specifically, the company essentially operates in an oligopoly and enjoys high switching costs across a vast client base.Oligopoly Agilent operates in an oligopolistic space and occupies the #1 or #2 spot in each of its end markets. Per the company’s estimates they control approximately 20% of their market, with the top 5 players accounting for 75% of the market share. One does not need to do a deep dive on all of their products to understand they are highly technical and require significant precision. Agilent spent $400M on research and development, or almost 8% of revenue, last year alone to maintain and advance its technologies and IP. Additionally, the end markets – pharma, food, academia, environmental services, energy, etc. – are all highly regulated. The combination of the required investment in R&D and regulatory hurdles create fairly strong barriers to entry. This results in the largest players controlling the market and insulating themselves from new entrants. This is especially desirable given the end-markets growth prospects where value should accrue to these top players for years to come.Switching CostsWhether a bank holding customer deposits or an analytical testing company performing DNA analysis, a sticky customer base is one of the most important aspects of any business. Agilent enjoys significant customer switching costs because of the ongoing relationship post-instrument sale with customers as well as the aforementioned quality and regulatory requirements of its devices.For example, once the company lands the sale of a chromatography instrument to a lab, the relationship with the customer is just beginning. Every time the device runs a test it requires reagents, analytical columns, and other consumable items. The test results need to be analyzed and stored with a high-degree of traceability through customized lab software. Also, the machines need periodic service and replacement parts. All of these regularly occurring activities are serviced and supplied by Agilent’s CrossLab segment. So long as these products and services are reasonably priced, customers are much more likely to go with the original manufacturer who they already have a working relationship with than outsource the recurring revenue to a third party and forcing them to deal with more vendors.Additionally, the cost of receiving an inaccurate result for any of Agilent’s customers is high. Imagine the impact to a lab by giving a doctor an incorrect cancer diagnostic result. Or if a pharmaceutical manufacturer received an inaccurate result related to an Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient. The customers in these markets can’t afford to receive inaccurate test results, so once they have a relationship with a business that: a) provides reliable test results and b) the scientists using the equipment are comfortable with, they are unlikely to make a change as the risks outweigh potential cost benefits. This dynamic further reinforces the oligopolistic nature of the industry, as labs are incentivized to go with the big “known entities” instead of a start-up equipment provider.Agilent has put intense focus on maximizing benefit from these high switching costs in recent years to drive a higher mix of recurring revenue and reduce the cyclicality of the company’s earnings. Roughly 60% of the company’s revenue is recurring in nature, comprised of services and consumables, up from around 40% in 2008, a trend management intends on continuing. Ackman has described investing in the business as almost like owning a fast growing annuity, which makes sense with this favorable mix of recurring revenue.I’d classify the regulatory and technological hurdles that result in an oligopolistic industry with high switching costs as a fairly solid moat protecting the economics of the business. The company may not swim in the deep end of a two-sided network effects moat like an Amazon or Facebook, but at the very least their core business appears to be well protected from significant disruption from new entrants. This should allow the company to benefit from the growth prospects of the markets it serves.As noted above, all of Agilent’s core markets are growing at a reasonable clip, and between 3-5% in aggregate. As the company outlines when discussing their transformation plan, they intend to outgrow the market modestly by pushing resources into faster growing areas such as China and the BioPharma space. They’ve achieved this goal thus far, compounding revenue at 6% annually since 2015.Consistent with recent years, Agilent was expecting a mid-single digit increase in revenue in FY20 (5-6% growth with 40 bps FX headwind) pre-COVID19. Revenue growth is split relatively evenly between core business and M&A as the company has been a consistent acquirer of businesses in adjacent spaces. While acquisitions pose a risk, which I’ll discuss more later, the results have been solid under the current management team with M&A revenue growing double-digits and comprising just under 10% of revenue, highlighted below.source: JP Morgan Healthcare ConferenceGoing into a little more detail, the company breaks out revenue segments growing faster than the core. I won’t pretend to be an expert in the technical aspects of each market, but the takeaway for me is that the leadership team is clearly focused on continuing to grow and has delivered on this target since taking the helm in 2015. All told it seems reasonable to expect mid-single-digit revenue growth to persist for the foreseeable future.source: JP Morgan Healthcare ConferenceTurning to earnings growth – ultimately the intrinsic value of the business will grow in line with the capital that can be invested into the business and the incremental returns that are earned on that capital. I think it’s important, and perhaps not enough attention has been paid, to look at what returns Agilent has produced in its current form after the spin-off of KeySight Technologies in late 2014. Looking back further obscures the value of the core business and doesn’t paint an accurate picture of the future. This also coincides with when the current leadership team has been at the helm. Below, using results from 2015 – 2019, I break out invested capital, incremental returns on invested capital (I-ROIC), impact of improved margins, and buyback yield to provide an estimate of per share earnings growth over the next several years.When Pershing Square built a position part of the thesis was that Agilent could continue closing the margin gap with its closest peer, Waters Corporation. Waters earns around 58-60% gross margins compared to Agilent’s 54-55%. Further, Waters appears more efficient on the SG&A front, resulting in 30% operating margins compared to Agilent’s 20% operating margins on twice the revenue base. The gap has closed in recent years, with operating margins expanding nearly 500 bps since 2015, but there is clearly room for that to continue. According to their February presentation, Ackman thinks Agilent could further expand margins 800 bps if they achieve a best in class operation. Product mix and moderately differing R&D spend muddy the water a bit, but when comparing to peers and with managements 50-70 annual bps margin expansion target, I can get on board with another 300 bps – 500 bps of operating margin expansion over the next ~5 years. This could add somewhere between 2-5% annual growth to intrinsic value and shouldn’t be ignored.Source: Pershing Square February Investor PresentationPulling all of this together, here is how I see per share intrinsic value growth shaking out over the next 5 or so years.Source: Author’s analysis from company filingsA quick note when deriving the I-ROIC I use a normalized operating cash flow margin so as to not conflate returns on capital with improvements in efficiency. Reported operating cash flow since 2015 has actually increased by about $500M because of the margin expansion, and my estimate of I-ROIC likely is a bit conservative. This is also why I highlight future benefit from margin expansion separately.If you can get comfortable with the future looking reasonably close to the past, I think you can expect 10%+ per share intrinsic value compounding over the next several years. Given the barriers to entry discussed earlier, the company’s end markets, and the management team’s commentary on growth opportunities, it seems quite likely the company can actually deliver higher annual returns.One final note on fundamentals – despite the M&A activity the company maintains a solid balance sheet with net debt to LTM EBITDA less than 1x, compared to 3x of competitors. Liquidity should not be a concern and Ackman points out there is further upside to equity holders by levering up the balance sheet in-line with peers. This is sensible given the predictable cash flow profile of the business.Ackman thinks the company can do mid-to-high teens annual eps growth. If they hit his targeted margin expansion and benefit from lower taxes as he projects, I think it’s certainly plausible, though I wouldn’t bank my investment on it.Below are current valuation multiples against historical median multiple since 2015 for Agilent and industry peers. I also compare eps annual growth rates over the same time period. Obviously this is a good industry with generally respectable returns on capital which results in premium valuations. It does appear that Agilent has higher growth prospects and can reinvest more of its earnings than its peers. This should result in faster growth than competitors as has also been the case over the past several years.Source: Author’s Analysis and ValueLine ReviewAt the end of the day the question investors need to answer is: what would they be willing to pay to acquire a business that:To me, if I can buy a business with those characteristics for anywhere near the market average or even a slight premium, I would be thrilled. As laid out below, anywhere in the mid-$60s is a great entry into this business. Assuming a purchase price of $65, about 13% lower than current prices, and a terminal multiple of 21.5x - lower than the 5-year average and matching the lowest average valuation for the stock since 2015 – I think investors can pencil in solid 14%+ annual returns. Add in upside from further margin expansion execution (and with it a likely higher valuation multiple) and/or balance sheet leverage and returns should easily approach 20% annually. Below I compare prospective returns from the current market price of ~$78 per share vs. where I would be more comfortable entering at $65.Source: Author’s analysis from company filingsNormally assuming a 21.5x exit multiple would be a stretch for me, but I think given the high quality nature of this business combined with the long-term secular industry tailwinds, not to mention a near zero interest rate environment, I actually think this will prove conservative. If the market values the business in-line with the last 5 years (~24x) that’ll add another couple percentage points to annual returns.The biggest risks I see to earning the returns outlined above are capital allocation mistakes, a prolonged slowdown in Agilent’s core industry spending, and, to a lesser extent, new entrants taking market share.Capital AllocationAgilent’s growth is partially reliant on finding acquisitions in target markets at acceptable valuations. Consistently finding these opportunities for the right price is certainly no guarantee. The outcome of the M&A activity is also reliant on management accurately assessing the prospects of the businesses and successfully integrating them. That said, so far the current management team appears to have done well by shareholders on this front. Recent acquisitions have contributed above-average growth for the business. Operating margins, including acquisitions costs, have marched steadily higher, implying acquisitions have not been a drag on margins. As an aside, the company adds back acquisition related expense to adjusted operating income, which I am not crazy about as these are real costs most years.If the company fails to identify attractive acquisition targets for a period of time, presumably they could dedicate more of their free cash flow to shareholder returns, which could approach 3-4% of the current market cap if no acquisitions are undertaken and the focus shifts to enhanced buybacks and dividends. Couple that with 3-4% core growth and some margin expansion and the investment is still far from a disaster, although not nearly as attractive as my base case.The more dangerous scenario would involve value-destructive acquisitions that actually impair the earnings power of the business. I’m not sure how to quantify this possibility, but it definitely exists. It’s somewhat comforting that Ackman is involved, albeit passively as far as I can tell, as he would certainly begin to attempt to enact change if capital allocation goes awry. I lean towards giving the current management team the benefit of the doubt given they’ve proved capable so far, though others may see it differently.Capital Spending SlowdownAgilent recently withdrew 2020 guidance amidst the COVID-19 lockdowns and will undoubtedly feel some impact this year. It’s tough to predict the exact impact from the closure of some university testing labs and general slowdown in global economic activity on this year’s results, but as long as investors have a multiple-year timeframe it seems unlikely that testing requirements and volumes in the company’s core industries feel any lasting negative impact.New CompetitionBreakthroughs in testing technology, new market entrants, and losing market share to existing competitors are other considerations for Agilent. As discussed above, because of the nature of the industries Agilent serves, I find it unlikely that the current order is disturbed meaningfully. It’s also not as if Agilent is reliant on one niche testing method or instrument for the bulk of revenue and profits. They serve tens of thousands of customers across dozens of testing methods, so the risk that a meaningful percentage of these are disrupted does not greatly concern me. Finally, Agilent spends hundreds of millions of dollars each year in R&D to stay on the cutting edge of analytical methods, further minimizing the risk of missing out on new technology.Agilent is a solid business with a defensible market position in desirable industries protected by technological and regulatory hurdles. They provide mission-critical testing services to a variety of customers that have little incentive to switch to competitors. Their defensive business model has evolved to provide an increasing mix of high-margin recurring revenue with room to reinvest capital at decent rates of return for the foreseeable future.Even at the current premium valuation, investors should do reasonably well over the long-term, though I would wait for higher prospective returns and would consider building a position around $65 per share."
4274967,25120,2019-07-15T09:45:50-04:00,"Agilent has reached a deal to acquire BioTek in a +$1 billion deal which looks fair and boosts the overall growth profile of the company.I like the deal and Agilent's long-term prospects at large, yet recognise that valuations are quite steep.Appeal has to come from improved performance, but mostly from a lower valuation, as I like the long-term prospects of the shares.","Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) has made a bolt-on deal as it is buying some real growth with the purchase of BioTek Instruments in a deal which looks fair. As the bolt-on deal looks reasonable, can easily be financed, given the strong finances, and does provide a boost to organic growth rates, I recognise that valuations at large for Agilent look largely fair. At this level, I see shares trading around fair value as the appealing valuation has to come from a lacklustre share price performance from here onward.Agilent has reached a deal to acquire privately-held BioTek Instruments in a $1.165 billion deal, although tax benefits have the potential to reduce the effective purchase price to $1.05 billion.BioTek is a designer and manufacturer of innovative life science instruments. Products in the portfolio include cell imaging systems, washers, dispensers, stackers, and automated incubators. The company generated $162 million in sales last year with growth seen around 10% per annum. These numbers suggest an effective purchase price of 6.5 times sales as the company reported a 22 times EBITDA multiple as well, suggesting a contribution of about $48 million in EBITDA per annum.The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, with accretion seen at $0.02-0.04 per share in 2020. Upon the deal announcement, shares were down 2% to just below $72 per share, although the day of the announcement coincided with a fall in shares of pharmaceutical and related companies, and thus, we should not read too much into that reaction.Agilent has steadily transformed the business into a higher growth player, which it has done by moving the focus away from instruments towards consumables, among others, as operating margins have comfortably risen to levels in the low-twenties. Excess capital being generated is largely invested into M&A in order to continue to position the mix perfectly towards the growth.Back in May, the company reported its second quarter results. Core revenue growth for the quarter was a bit lower at 4%. The company guided for full year sales of $5.105 billion, plus or minus $20 million, with non-GAAP earnings seen at $3.03-3.07 per share.The company has 321 million shares outstanding, which currently trade at $71 per share, for a market value of $22.8 billion. Ahead of the latest deal, the company actually operated with a net cash position of about $0.2 billion, for an enterprise value of $22.6 billion. This means the company is valued at 4.4 times sales, suggesting that the latest purchase does come at a premium, yet 10% organic growth has the potential to provide a boost to the overall organic growth profile of the company. The deal will boost pro forma sales by about 3%, as 10% growth has the potential to boost organic growth for all of Agilent by some 30 basis points.Based on a $48 million EBITDA contribution, while assuming 4% D&A charges in relation to sales, I peg EBIT at about $41 million. With an effective purchase price of $1.05 billion and net interest costs of 3%, I see incremental interest costs of $31 million. This makes for an earnings before tax contribution of $10 million. The $8 million after-tax earnings contribution does indeed come in at about two or three cents per share, in line with has been communicated by the company.With earnings seen just above the $3 per share mark, I peg forward earnings multiples at around 23-24 times earnings, by no means cheap. At the same time, a 4.0-4.5% earnings yield looks compelling in this low interest rate environment, while a steady player like Agilent typically shows long-term steady growth. This is, in part, ensured by the positioning as well as a 20% sales exposure to China, securing long-term growth as well.Reality is that Agilent is on track to report core growth of 5.0-5.5% this year, which is a very decent organic growth rate. Like many companies, including peers of Agilent, shares have seen a very steady rise higher in recent years.Trading at just $10 during the crisis, shares have steadily risen and traded in the mid-forties by the end of 2016, before nearly doubling again to levels in the eighties in spring of this year. Disappointing core sales growth for the first quarter of the year has resulted in shares having fallen to $71 at the moment, but even at these levels, valuations continue to be quite elevated.Last time I updated my thesis on Agilent was two years ago, the summer of 2017. Shares traded at around $60 per share at the time when the company announced the acquisition of Cobalt, as I expressed my wish that the company would make more of these deals. That bolt-on deal looked very cheap, as core sales growth for Agilent at large came in at the high-single digits, much more impressive than current growth rates.Trading at $60, with shares trading at 27 times earnings, I expressed my desire to build this world-class player at levels around $50, yet that dip has never come, although the $10 absolute return in the two years which followed was not particularly impressive as well. That being said, multiples have compressed a few times, yet growth has come down a bit as well. But I am still impressed with the long-term prospects of the business, and while I would be happy to pay a small premium over the market, I would be glad to buy the shares at 20 times earnings, working down to a targeted entry point at levels in the low-sixties."
4272668,105265,2019-06-28T11:54:00-04:00,Agilent is in attractive markets and has growth levers in place with new products.The Company's recent history is one of stellar execution across the board.Agilent trades at market multiples despite its excellent financials and promising future.The Q2 sell-off was overdone. We recommend taking advantage of the dip.We think that the market isn't pricing the potential for increased shareholder distribution and margin expansion.,"We have a Buy rating on Agilent (A). We like its growth prospects including its new products and growing markets. We love its financials, particularly its pristine balance sheet and cash generative ability as well as its impressive margin expansion. We think that the recent sell-off presents an opportunity that investors should take advantage of. We view the price as an average valuation for an above-average company. We see multiple catalysts going forward including increasing shareholder friendliness and continued margin expansion.Agilent estimates its markets to be $52 bn and growing at 3-5% per year. The Company addresses a wide array of industries including pharmaceuticals, chemicals & energy, clinical & diagnostics, academics & government, food, and environment spaces.The Company is one of the leading suppliers to the life sciences and chemical analysis industries. It offers bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions and semiconductor, and board testing. The aforementioned large market and demand for Agilent's products are reflected in the Company's top line which grew with ~7% CAGR in the past 3 years.Agilent has completely overhauled itself over recent years. In 2015, it changed its focus to growth, operational efficiency, and shareholder friendliness. The company management has had a stellar track record and has managed to execute on all fronts.The Company's revenues are experiencing accelerating like-for-like growth. This is mainly due to the launch of new products and entry into new markets and is expected to continue (detailed next section). Agilent grew smart as well as it did fast by increasing sales of after-market products and services thus decreasing its dependence on device sales. This transformation enabled a higher proportion of recurring revenues which is always favored by the market.Source: Agilent 37th JPM Healthcare Conference PresentationThis less cyclical, larger, and faster-growing Agilent also increasingly became more profitable.Source: Agilent 37th JPM Healthcare Conference Presentation The transformations positive effects made its way up to the investor as well with double-digit dividend growth and significant buybacks.Source: Agilent 37th JPM Healthcare Conference Presentation The company performed excellently all across the board.The track record of Agilent in building new products and expanding its addressable market has been stellar, and we don't expect this to change. The company is looking to grow organically with its industry-leading products and is bringing a new facility online; it is also exploring inorganic activities to expand its portfolio.Intuvo 9000 GC, launched in H2 2016, is the leading gas chromatography device on the market and is making a growing contribution to Agilent's sales. It was selected the innovation of the year by the Analytical Scientist. Analytical Scientist commended it for its user-friendliness and efficiency. Now, Agilent is building on the GC series with the launch of 8860 GC and 889 GC. We expect that these products will strengthen Agilent's market-leading position.Agilent set a new standard in mass spectrometry with its Ultivo product which launched in H2 2017. Ultivo delivers robust performance, superior uptime, and easier serviceability, in a footprint that is 70% smaller than previous instruments. Agilent estimates a $1 bn and growing opportunity in the space.The biopharma has seen ""incredible"" growth in recent decades and Agilent continues to see strength in the area. The Company has played into this strength with its ongoing development of its second Nucleic Acids Solutions Division facility which will more than double its commercial manufacturing capacity for nucleic acid active pharmaceutical ingredients. We expect this to become a solid organic revenue driver going forward.Agilent is also focusing on cell analysis where it sees the fastest opportunities for growth and has been growing the business in the double digits. The company has strategically doubled down in the space with its Luxcel Biosciences acquisition expanding its portfolio.China is an important market for Agilent and has been a differentiator for the Company. Agilent's 2,000 employees in China drive 21% of total revenue from the country. The management commentary highlights China as an ""important long-term growth market"". This view is reflected in company initiatives regarding the country with it expanding its footprint and e-commerce capabilities and is looking to leverage its large instrument installed base for growing aftermarket sales. Agilent is also building a clinical and diagnostics franchise and country-specific solutions and portfolio in China.Now though, tides seem to have turned with soft performance in China. The Q1 2019 revenue miss was largely blamed on slowing orders from the country. The management details that the lower-than-expected purchasing from government labs and that the lower drug price initiatives are having a larger than expected effect on small molecule pharma.We think that the former is due to frictions among China and the US as it is only the government labs that are slowing purchases. We would expect a return to normal post a potential trade deal or even a trade détente. We wrote about the US-China trade end-game here and here in detail. In summary, we expect a trade deal to be signed within the next 6 to 9 months as it is in the best interest of both leaders. We view the Chinese government lab purchase slowdown as a transitory issue.Small molecule pharma in China may be a longer-term issue as pressure on drug pricing may continue. But, we point out that China small molecule makes up only 2-3% of total top line and with adjusted guidance, will not be a major issue going forward thanks to Agilent's diversification.We think it makes sense to evaluate the valuation in the context of the operations of the company. With Agilent, we have a stellar operation, excellent track record of management execution, consistently high cash flow generation, growing margins, and top line. The company is the leader in most of its markets which are experiencing steady secular growth. In addition, there is a large organic growth (detailed above) and distribution (detailed below) potential.All of these favorable characteristics come at a reasonable price. Agilent is trading at a forward P/E of 24x which is the market multiple. On forward EV/EBITDA terms, the multiples are 17x vs. 15x and on P/CF, it's 22x vs. 21x. Agilent is essentially trading at healthcare sector multiples with much better operations and more promising growth prospects than the average healthcare company. We think that this is a mispricing and urge investors to take advantage of it.Agilent's share price dropped ~18% from top to bottom in Q2 from ~$82 to ~$67 before rising again to the current ~$72. The drop was a combination of a broader healthcare selloff and the Company's Q1 2019 results. We will not go into the healthcare selloff of Q2 as we have discussed the topic in detail and how it's fairly unrelated to niche medical device manufacturers in our article on Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) here.The Q1 miss wasn't that surprising given Waters Corporation's (WAT) earlier miss despite the beat and raise of two of other peers, Thermo Fisher (TMO) and Bruker (BRKR). Agilent blamed China, which we consider transitory (discussed above) and global big pharma delays. The Company lowered its top line 2019 forecast but kept its EPS target. Management commented that April was business as usual after a soft March. The miss clearly isn't a positive, but we don't think that it changes our bull thesis and view the price action following the announcement as excessive (+8% drop). We like that the company is managing to protect its margins despite a smaller-than-expected top line, and we are enthusiastic about the new organic growth initiatives we've detailed above which will bring faster revenue growth.Agilent has one of the cleanest balance sheets. It has over $2 bn of cash sitting on the balance sheet and a net cash position of $357 mn and has produced significant free cash flow every year going back to 2015.Despite its long-term double-digit dividend growth rate and the buyback program, we believe it can give back more to investors. The company has on average bought about 1.5% of shares per year (past 5 years) and has a payout ratio of ~23%. Given its cash generation and fortress of a balance sheet, these numbers should be higher. There is a $1 bn repurchase authorization, but we think that this will grow.Investors would fly to the name if Agilent signaled more capital deployment towards them. The market knows the amount Agilent can give back. One should expect a very positive market reaction if and when Agilent places strong buybacks into its rhetoric.We speculate that the new Agilent CFO, Robert McMahon, could be the one pulling the trigger. Mr. McMahon joined late 2018. He has spent 20 years with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) which we think would've taught him the benefits of shareholder friendliness. We think that taking the initiative on this matter would be a relatively easy way of making a significant impact on the share price by a new CFO.We also view continued margin expansion and recoveries in end markets of China and big pharma would cause increases in the share price. We have high conviction in margin expansion potential of the company based on its track record and static profit guidance in the face of lower estimated revenues.There are 2 company-specific risks that we see. First is execution risk. Agilent has been executing very well for very long. A deviation from this path would hurt the multiple. Other is value-destructive M&A. The company regularly engages in inorganic investments. So far, it has been successful in its endeavors which were relatively small bolt-on acquisitions. If it decides to make a large acquisition and ends up overpaying in the eyes of the market, there could be a significant knee-jerk reaction. A write-down of a previous purchase could also be detrimental to the share price.There are non-company-specific risks to the share price as well. Continuation of US-China tensions causing tariffs on Agilent products or influencing Chinese purchasing behavior would be detrimental to ~20% of Agilent's total revenues which come from China.Despite its impressive trend of rapid growth, slowing biopharma market would be detrimental to Agilent."
4296471,50452,2019-10-14T15:09:24-04:00,Agilent Technologies is a leading provider of instrumentation and analysis solutions to a number of end-markets.The company has seen operating metrics improve since splitting into two publicly traded companies.The company is positioned to drive market share growth in a growing and highly fragmented industry.,"Dividend growth investing is a popular and largely successful approach to generating wealth over long periods of time. Investors typically do well focusing on companies with long streaks of dividend increases in part because of the positive qualities a business needs in order to be able to continually afford what is ultimately a cash layout to shareholders. However, many of the companies known as ""dividend champions"" - those with 25 consecutive years (or more) of dividend growth, are mature companies. By identifying strong companies earlier in their life cycle, we can benefit from strong total returns while these companies build their dividend growth reputation. We will be spotlighting numerous dividend up and comers to identify the best ""dividend growth stocks of tomorrow"".Today's profile is on Agilent Technologies, Inc. (A). Founded in 1999 following a spin off from Hewlett Packard (HPE), the company designs and builds a variety of instrumentation and solutions used for analysis in a handful of core end markets, including petro-chem, environmental, food, pharma, academia, and clinical. In all, Agilent generates approximately $5 billion in annual revenues.Source: Agilent Technologies, Inc.The landscape at Agilent Technologies has been a bit uneven over the years. The company split into two separate companies a few years ago, the other currently trading as Keysight Technologies (KEYS). This split shows up in the company's chart in the form of a large drop off. Over the past three years, Agilent has grown its top line at a CAGR of 6.76%. EPS growth has been negative, but we can see that EBITDA has steadily grown with revenues, almost tripling.Source: YChartsFundamentals are the building block of any responsible investing decision. By tracking key operating metrics over a long period of time, we can learn a lot about a business.We review operating margins to make sure the company is consistently profitable. We also want to invest in companies with strong cash flow streams, so we look at the conversion rate of revenue to free cash flow. Lastly, we want to see that management is effectively deploying the company's financial resources, so we review the cash rate of return on invested capital (CROCI). We will do all of these using three benchmarks:Source: YChartsWe see a couple of themes present from over much of the past decade. First, we see how much of a disruption occurred when the company split into two entities. All three metrics crashed over a two-year period. The good thing, however, is that the metrics have recovered strongly after bottoming in 2015. Currently, all three metrics surpass our benchmarks. Investors interested in Agilent Technologies will want to see the company maintain this level of performance moving forward.The other aspect of our fundamental analysis is the balance sheet. The balance sheet is so important because it can turn an otherwise great business into a poor investment if a company has too much debt on its books. A company that is overleveraged could be subject to a dividend cut or cash flow crunch that takes away from the company's ability to perform at its highest potential.Source: YChartsThe company is in strong financial standing with almost no net-debt load once you factor in the company's $1.7 billion cash balance. The gross debt load puts leverage at 1.47X EBITDA, which is still below our 2.5X cautionary threshold. This gives the company financial flexibility to pursue growth via M&A, and insulates shareholders from risk should the business face an unexpected downturn.The reason we value companies with the ability to generate large cash streams is that these companies tend to return that cash to investors. Dividends and buybacks can boost total returns in a number of ways. Agilent Technologies has increased its dividend payout for each of the past 8 years. This means that management has kept this dividend growth philosophy through its split with Keysight.Source: YChartsThe dividend currently amounts to an annual sum of $0.66 per share, which yields 0.87% on the current share price. This means that despite a low interest rate environment that sees 10-year US treasuries yielding just 1.73%, Agilent Technologies isn't a great income generation stock at this point. Investors looking for growth will be more optimistic. The dividend has grown at a CAGR of 12.6% over the past five years. The company's cash payout ratio of 22% means that there is plenty of room for future dividend growth.Source: YChartsInvestors should note the company's recent uptick in share buybacks. While this could eat at the company's cash streams to fuel dividend growth, buybacks offer value to investors by shrinking the size of the float (makes your shares worth more). Shares have steadily dropped in recent years to just over 309 million outstanding.There are various growth tailwinds available to Agilent Technologies in the years ahead. The company holds a top two market position in virtually all of its core end markets. These markets total an estimated $52 billion addressable market. This gives the company approximately 10% market share based on projected FY revenues of about $5 billion. Additionally, these end markets are poised to grow at a mid-single-digit rate over the long term. This isn't a surprise given advancements in research and analysis to provide increased levels of safety to consumers.Source: Agilent Technologies, Inc.The fact that the company is able to hold a strong market position with little actual market share means that the industry as a whole is very fragmented. Strong players in fragmented industries tend to turn to M&A to drive continued growth of scale. Agilent Technologies is no exception to this thought. Management has spent more than $1 billion on various acquisitions, and we expect this to continue given the company's very clean balance sheet. As the company continues to diversify away from instruments, and into a more ""solutions"" based approach, this focus will help guide future M&A efforts.Source: Agilent Technologies, Inc.The company also has a very strong presence in China (21% of company revenues). This can be somewhat of a double edged blade for Agilent. On one hand, China is the most heavily populated country in the world. Agilent has noted that China has grown at a higher growth rate than the rest of the world for their business. This is an enormous market, and an advantage for companies that are able to penetrate the strict control held by the Chinese government. On the other hand, China has become a geopolitical risk for US companies as the US has continued to butt heads with China on trade policies. The company entered the Chinese market more than 20 years ago and offers tailor made solutions for Chinese clinical research and applications. We feel that the company's relationship is strong enough to withstand the most likely of outcomes of the US/China trade conflict.Shares of Agilent Technologies have been somewhat volatile over the past year, between $61 and $82. Shares currently sit in the middle at just over $75.Source: YChartsWith analyst estimates indicating full-year EPS of $3.08, the stock currently trades at an earnings multiple of 24.45X. This is a 15% premium to the stock's 10-year median PE ratio of 21.15X. In addition, the company's free cash flow yield is well off of 10-year highs and off of its post-spin off highs as well.Source: YChartsWhile we find that the company's strengthening operating metrics and clean balance sheet warrant a slightly higher premium, it is likely fair to consider the stock overvalued at its current level. We would like to see the stock come back down to the 22X multiple range, placing shares at approximately $67 as the high end of fair value.Agilent offers a lot for investors to consider. The company is a leading provider to a research driven sector. The company has seen operating metrics improve and is currently generating strong cash flow streams. This points to future dividend growth and buybacks that will help drive total returns as the company grows. Because of the major disruptions from the split with Keysight, we would like to see a longer track record of performance than a few years. However, Agilent Technologies is a stock that investors should consider in the future.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."

Also, a higher number of physicians are using autologous and allogenic stem cell therapies, avoiding the use of chemo and radiation therapies.Furthermore, the report forecasts rising demand for point-of-care testing in chronic disease management, increasing demand for real-time cytometry capabilities.The Asia-Pacific region is ‘presumed’ to see the fastest growth due to increasing government incentives for homegrown biotech firms and growing awareness about the capabilities of flow cytometers.According to a research report by MarketsandMarkets, the global cell analysis market is expected to reach $26.0 billion by 2020, increasing at a CAGR of 6.56%.Major competitors in the cell analysis space include:Agilent didn’t disclose the acquisition price or terms and didn’t file an 8-K or disclose a change in financial guidance. So the deal was likely for a non-material amount.A review of the firm’s most recent 10-Q filing indicates that as of July 31, 2018, Agilent had $2.1 billion in cash and equivalents and $3.8 billion in total liabilities.Free cash flow during the nine months ended July 31, 2018, was $574 million.Agilent is acquiring ACEA for its real-time cell analysis platform and cytometer capabilities for research use cases.As Todd Christian, VP and GM, Agilent Cell Analysis, stated in the deal announcement,In the past 12 months, Agilent’s stock price has risen approximately 9.1% vs. the S&P 500 Index’ 15%, as the chart below indicates:(Source: Seeking Alpha)Agilent is acquiring ACEA as part of a push to bolster its immuno-oncology research offerings.Immuno-oncology, which utilizes the body’s immune system to fight cancer, is an extremely active area of research for biopharma firms and academic research organizations worldwide.According to ACEA CEO Xiao Xu, Agilent also ‘has a number of complementary technologies, used in immuno-oncology and drug discovery, which should provide tremendous synergies.’Agilent has been on a multi-year effort to differentiate itself in the markets it operates in as well as accelerate its penetration in the biopharma research market.The ACEA acquisition fits into this approach. While we won’t see results in Agilent’s near-term financial reporting, 2019 and 2020 should begin to see the fruits of deals like that of ACEA.Assuming Agilent didn’t overpay for the acquisition, I view it as a positive and continuing focus by management to improve future results."

For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article ""The Good Business Portfolio: Update to Guidelines, August 2018."" These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return and growing companies that hopefully keeps me ahead of the Dow average.Agilent Technologies passes 10 of 11 Good Business Portfolio Guidelines, a good score (a good score is 10 or 11). These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. Some of the points brought out by the guidelines are shown below.The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the Good Business Portfolio. Agilent Technologies total return is higher compared to the Dow baseline in my 48-month test. I chose the 48 month test period (starting January 1, 2015, and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2017, and other years that had fair and bad performance. The good total return of 82.13% makes Agilent Technologies a good investment for the total return investor. Agilent Technologies has a below average dividend yield of 0.9% and has been increased for 7 years in a row.

Total revenue was higher at $1.29 Billion more than a year ago by 8.4% year over year and beat expected revenue by $30 Million. This was a good report with bottom line beating expected and the top line beating and having a good increase compared with last year. The next earnings report will be out February 2019 and is expected to be $0.73 compared to last year at $0.66, a good increase.The graphic below gives a summary of the earnings/revenues for the 4th quarter of 2018.Source: Agilent Technologies Earnings call slidesAgilent Technologies provides life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical products in the United States and foreign countries.As per excerpts from Reuters:Overall Agilent Technologies is a good solid business with 10% CAGR growth as the worldwide economy grows going forward with the increasing need for more life sciences and applied diagnostics products. The revenue growth provides Agilent Technologies the capability to continue its growth as the need for faster testing and diagnostics is needed.The Fed has kept interest rates low for some years, and on December 19, 2018, they raised the base rate 0.25%, which was expected. I believe that they will go slow in 2019, which should help keep the economy on a growth path. If infrastructure spending can be increased, this will even increase the United States growth going forward with better economics for the consumer. The Fed lowered GDP projection for next year which may mean they are getting to neutral on the economy, projecting two rate increases for 2019. The recent volatility may keep the Fed on hold. Recently the Fed chairman made a statement that was dovish, and the market went up strongly.On the November 19, 2018, earnings call, Mike McMullen (Chief Executive Officer and President) said:This shows the feelings of top management for the continued growth of the Agilent Technologies business and shareholder return via share buybacks with an increase in future growth.

Agilent Technologies will be considered for The Good Business Portfolio (My IRA account) when cash is available. The stability of the revenue growth and earnings from Agilent Technologies would be a good addition to my total return companies.The graphic below shows the company guidance for the next quarter.Source: Agilent Technologies Earnings call slidesI intend to watch the earnings reports for the companies in the portfolio and may finally decide to trim my high flyers that are over 8% of the portfolio so I can invest in good companies on my buy list.The Good Business Portfolio trims a position when it gets above 8% of the portfolio. The four top companies in the portfolio are Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) at 8.8% of the portfolio, Omega Health Investors at 8.7% of the portfolio, Home Depot (HD) at 8.9% of the portfolio and Boeing at 14.2% of the portfolio. Therefore BA, OHI, JNJ, and Home Depot are now in trim position, but I am letting them run a bit since they are great companies.Boeing is going to be pressed to 14% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on 787 deferred plane costs at $316 Million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase from the fourth quarter. The second quarter saw deferred costs on the 787 go down $530 Million a big jump from the first quarter. The second quarter of 2017 earnings was fantastic with Boeing beating the estimate by $0.25 at $2.55. The third quarter of 2017 earnings were $2.72 beating the expected by$0.06 with revenue increasing 1.7% over last year, another good report. The first quarter earnings for 2018 were unbelievable at $3.64 compared to expected at $2.64. Farnborough Air Show sales in dollar value just beat out Air-Bus by about $6 Billion, and both companies had a great number of orders. The second quarter earnings beat expectations by $0.06 at $3.33, but a good report was hurt by a write off expense on the KC-46 which should start delivery in 2019. Boeing received an order for 18 more KC-46A planes. As a result of the good third-quarter earnings, S&P CFRA raised the one-year price target to $ 450 for a possible 37% upside potential.JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because it's so defensive in this post-BREXIT world. Earnings in the last quarter beat on the top and bottom line and Mr. Market did like it. JNJ has announced a dividend increase to $0.90/Qtr, which is 56 years in a row of increases. JNJ is not a trading stock but a hold forever; it is now a strong buy as the healthcare sector remains under pressure.For the total Good Business Portfolio, please see my article on The Good Business Portfolio: 2018 3rd Quarter Earnings and Performance Review for the complete portfolio list and performance. I have written individual articles on JNJ, EOS, GE, IR, MO, BA, TXN, PM, MO, Omega Health Investors, Digital Investors Trust (DLR) and Automatic Data Processing (ADP), which are in The Good Business Portfolio, and other companies being evaluated by the portfolio. If you have an interest, please look for them on my list of previous articles.Of course, this is not a recommendation to buy or sell, and you should always do your own research and talk to your financial advisor before any purchase or sale.

The company has the cash it uses to buy bolt-on companies and expand the technology capabilities of its products.I use a set of guidelines that I codified over the last few years to review the companies in The Good Business Portfolio (my portfolio) and other companies that I am reviewing. For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article ""The Good Business Portfolio: Update to Guidelines, August 2018"". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return, and growing companies that hopefully keeps me ahead of the Dow average.When I scanned the five-year chart, Agilent Technologies has a fair chart that follows the volatility of the market with strong gains in 2016 and 2017 and flat for 2018.Data by YChartsAgilent Technologies is reviewed in the following topics below.The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the Good Business Portfolio. My total return guideline is that total return must be greater than the Dow's total return over my test period. Agilent Technologies beats against the Dow baseline in my 57-month test compared to the Dow average. I chose the 57 month test period (starting January 1, 2015, and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2017, and other years that had a fair and bad performance. The great Agilent Technologies total return of 92.42% compared to the Dow base of 49.32% makes Agilent Technologies a great investment for the total return investor that also wants some increasing income. Looking back five years, $10,000 invested five years ago would now be worth over $17,900 today. This gain makes Agilent Technologies a great investment for the total return investor looking back, that has future growth as the United States economy continues to grow.Dow's 57 Month total return baseline is 49.32%Agilent Technologies does not meet my dividend guideline of having dividends increase for 8 of the last ten years and having a minimum of 1% yield. Agilent Technologies has a below-average dividend yield of 0.9% and has had increases for seven years, making Agilent Technologies a poor choice for the dividend growth investor. The dividend was last increased in November 2018 to $0.164/Qtr. up from $0.149/Qtr. or a 10% increase with increases expected to continue for many years. The next dividend increase is estimated to be in November of $0.180/Qtr. or a 10% increase. The five-year average payout ratio is low, at 23%. After paying the dividend, this leaves cash remaining for increasing the business of the company by buying bolt-on companies.I also require the CAGR going forward to be able to cover my yearly expenses and my RMD with a CAGR of 7%. My dividends provide 3.3% of the portfolio as income, and I need 1.9% more for a yearly distribution of 5.2% plus an inflation cushion of 1.8%. The three-year forward S&P CFRA CAGR of 10% exceeds my guideline requirement. This good future growth for Agilent Technologies can continue its uptrend benefiting from the continued strong growth in the worldwide and United States economies.I have a capitalization guideline where the capitalization must be greater than $10 Billion. Agilent Technologies easily passes this guideline. Agilent Technologies is a large-cap company with a capitalization of $22 Billion. Agilent Technologies 2019 projected cash flow at $1.1 Billion is good, allowing the company to have the means for company growth and increasing dividends each year. Large-cap companies like Agilent Technologies have the cash and ability to buy other smaller companies and weather any storms that might come along.One of my guidelines is that the S&P rating must be three stars or better. Agilent Technologies S&P CFRA rating is three stars or hold with a target price to $74, passing the guideline. Agilent Technologies price is fair and at the target. Agilent Technologies is at the target price at present and has a moderate forward PE of 22, making Agilent Technologies a fair buy at this entry point considering the potential growth. If you are a long-term investor that wants fair increasing dividend income and future total return growth, you may want to look at this company.One of my guidelines is would I buy the whole company if I could. The answer is yes. The total return is strong, and the below-average growing dividend makes Agilent Technologies a good business to own for income and growth. The Good Business Portfolio likes to embrace all kinds of investment styles but concentrates on buying businesses that can be understood, makes a fair profit, invests profits back into the business and also generates a good income stream. Most of all, what makes Agilent Technologies interesting is the potential long-term demand for its life sciences and chemical analysis testing products are needed to reduce the cost of drug development. Agilent Technologies gives you an increasing dividend for the dividend investor and a great total return.I don't have a guideline for earnings but look for the earnings of my positions too consistently beat their quarterly estimates. Click to enlargeFor the last quarter on August 14, 2019, Agilent Technologies reported earnings that beat expected by $0.04 at $0.76, compared to last year at $.67.

The fair dividend income brings you cash as I continue to see further growth in revenue as the United States economy grows. The talking heads that preach recession should be ignored, and even with a slowdown in the world economy, Agilent Technologies great products are still needed.The quotes below from the 3rd quarter earnings call indicates growth for the company's products and services.This shows the feelings of top management for the continued growth of the Agilent Technologies business and shareholder return with an increase in future growth. Agilent Technologies has good constant growth and will continue as the world economy and population grows. The growth is being driven by added features to their existing services and products and the purchase of bolt-on companies.Agilent Technologies is a good investment choice for the total return growth investor that also wants a fair growing dividend income. Agilent Technologies will be considered for my portfolio when cash is available. I buy what I consider great businesses that are fairly priced, and the present Agilent Technologies entry point is fully priced. Good growing businesses do not come cheap, but over time, they grow and grow. If you want a solid growing good total return in the life sciences and chemical analysis testing business, Agilent Technologies may be the right investment for you.The five companies comprising the largest percentage of the portfolio are: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) at 7.6% of the portfolio, the Eaton Vance Enhanced Equity Income Fund II (EOS) at 7.9% of the portfolio, Home Depot (HD) at 10.2% of the portfolio, Omega Health Investors (OHI) at 9.0% of the portfolio, and Boeing (BA) at 12.7% of the portfolio. Therefore, BA, EOS, JNJ, OHI, and HD are now in trim or close to trim position, but I am letting them run a bit since they are great companies.On August 19, I wrote covered calls against my Danaher (DHR) position to collect another premium. I like DHR, but it's getting a bit pricey, and the covered calls give me some extra income and downside protection.On August 30, I trimmed HD to 10% of the portfolio. HD is a great business but needs more foreign expansion to grow.On August 30, I trimmed OHI to 9% of the portfolio. OHI is a great income business, but it has risks, so 9% is my limit on this company until the operator problems are totally under control.Boeing is going to be pressed to 15% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on 787 deferred plane costs at $938 Million in the first quarter of 2019, an increase from the fourth quarter. Boeing has dropped in the last five months because of the second 737 Max crash, and I look at this as an opportunity to buy BA at a reasonable price. On July 19th BA said that they expect to have the 737 Max flying by the early fourth quarter and BA went up $16. The second-quarter earnings report was real bad, and BA lost $25 over three days.JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because of its defensive nature in this post-BREXIT world. Earnings in the last quarter beat on the top and bottom line, and Mr. Market did nothing. JNJ in April 2019 increased the dividend to $0.95/Qtr., which is 57 years in a row of increases. JNJ is not a trading stock but a hold forever; it is now a strong buy as the healthcare sector remains under pressure.The total return for the Good Business Portfolio is ahead of the Dow average YTD by 6.62%, which is a nice gain above the market for the portfolio with BA a strong drag. Each quarter after the earnings season, I write an article giving a complete portfolio list and performance, the latest article is titled "" The Good Business Portfolio: 2019 2nd Quarter Earnings and Performance Review"".

4284107,20715,2019-08-09T17:38:07-04:00,"Agilent Technologies is scheduled to report fiscal third quarter earnings results on Wednesday.The company has performed well with above-average fundamental measurements.There is a trend channel on the chart, and the stock is just above the lower rail at this time.Sentiment toward the stock is slightly skewed to the optimistic side.","To me, Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) is a very interesting company. It is a healthcare company, but it is also part technology company. In fact, Yahoo Finance labels the company as a healthcare company while Investor's Business Daily labels the company as an electronics company within the scientific measuring group. The Santa Clara-based firm is set to report earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday, and analysts are expecting modest growth on a year-over-year basis.Analysts expect Agilent to report $0.72 per share for the fiscal third quarter, and that would mean a 7.5% increase compared to the third quarter of 2018. Over the last three years, the company has been able to grow earnings at a rate of 18% per year. Earnings were up 9% in the second quarter, and they are expected to increase by 9% for the year as a whole.Revenue is expected to come in at $1.24 billion, and that is a 3% increase over the third quarter of '18. Over the last three years, the company has seen revenue increase by 8% per year, and it was up 3% in the second quarter.Looking at the management efficiency measurements for Agilent, we see figures that are above average. The return on equity is at 22.93%, the profit margin is at 22.5%, and the operating margin is at 19.9%.Overall, the fundamentals for Agilent are well above average. The EPS Rating from Investor's Business Daily is an 81, and the SMR Rating is an A. That puts the company in the top 20% of all companies in their database for earnings growth, sales growth, profit margin, and return on equity.Looking at the weekly chart for Agilent, we see an upward trend with a channel that defines the various cycles within the overall trend. The lower rail connects the lows from last October and last December. The stock just hit that lower rail in the past week and bounced higher. The upper rail connects the highs from the first quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019.We see that the stock just dropped below its 104-week moving average when it dropped early last week. It also dropped below this 2-year trend line briefly last December and again in May. The 104-week seems to be providing a certain amount of support for the stock at this time.The weekly overbought/oversold indicators are down, but neither is in oversold territory. The 10-week RSI hasn't been in oversold territory at any point in the last three and a half years, but dips below the 50-level have generally been decent buying points for the stock.I think the pattern in the weekly stochastic readings is interesting in that it is very similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter of last year. The indicators did a double dip in October and December with two months in between the two lows. Here, we see a double dip in May and now July - again two months apart. When the stock bottomed in December, the stock rallied over 30% in the next two months. A similar move this time would put the stock up above the $86 level.Turning our attention to the sentiment picture for Agilent, we see three indicators that are either average or slightly skewed to the bullish side. There are 16 analysts following the company with 12 ""buy"" ratings and four ""hold"" ratings. This gives us an overall buy percentage of 75%, and that is right at the upper edge of the average range.The short ratio interest ratio is currently at 1.5. This particular indicator is below average and shows slightly bullish sentiment toward the stock. There are 4.0 million shares sold short, and it moved down slightly from the beginning of July through the mid-July reading. The company sees trading volume of 2.75 million shares on the average day.Like the analysts' ratings, the put/call ratio is currently showing an average reading. There are 18,577 puts open at this time and 21,971 calls open giving us a ratio of 0.846. The ratio was at 1.14 back on May 14 when the company reported second quarter results. This indicates that option traders are a little more optimistic heading in to this earnings report.Overall, I would call the sentiment toward Agilent slightly bullish, but not extremely bullish. The put/call ratio and the analysts' ratings are in the average range, but the two have moved in opposite directions in the last few months. Analysts have become less bullish and option traders have become more bullish. The short interest ratio is slightly skewed to the optimistic side.I like Agilent's fundamental standing, and I like the way the chart is setting up with the stock just above the 104-week moving average and the lower rail of the trend channel. The sentiment is a minor concern ahead of the earnings report.The company did disappoint with its last earnings report, and the stock fell 11% following the announcement. In the three prior earnings reports before May, the stock rallied after each report.There is an interesting pattern in how the stock behaves around earnings reports. In the last year and a half, six earnings reports, the stock has gapped lower twice, but hasn't gapped higher at all - at least not after an earnings report.I think the safest play on Agilent right now is to wait until after the earnings report. I am bullish on the stock, but if the company disappoints and gaps lower, it will likely drop below the lower rail of the trend channel, and that will negate one of the drivers behind the bullish posture. If the company meets expectations, based on history, it isn't likely to gap higher, but rather it is more apt to trend higher. Therefore, I recommend waiting until after the earnings report to enter a bullish trade on Agilent."
4277193,104618,2019-07-24T16:16:55-04:00,"Agilent has transformed its business since spinning-off from Hewlett Packard in 1999.Revenue is now tied to stable, secularly growing end markets rather than more cyclical markets.The business model is attractive, characterized by attractive margins and low maintenance capex requirements.","Since spinning off from Hewlett Packard 20 years ago in 1999, Agilent has transformed from a conglomerate of testing and measurement businesses serving a wide variety of end markets into a much more focused player. They spun-off Verigy in 2006 and Keysight in 2014 (click here to find the list of recent spin-offs) as well as divested numerous subsidiaries. All these transactions, along with a handful of acquisitions, created a testing and measurement leader in life science, food, and chemical markets.Historically, Agilent was a conglomerate of different testing businesses serving a wide variety of end markets. Over the last 10+ years, they have made significant moves which shifted the company out of more cyclical markets, such as semiconductors and electronics, where they had been a large player since they were part of Hewlett Packard. In addition to divesting or spinning off these more cyclical businesses, they made a number of acquisitions to grow their presence in the life science testing and measurement industry. Today, they are much more focused on this key end market and sell more services, consumables, and informatics (~60% of revenue) than equipment.1999: Spun-off from Hewlett Packard2001: Divested the healthcare solutions business to Philips Electronics for $1.7 billion2005: Divested the semiconductor products business for $2.6 billion2006: Spun-off the semiconductor test solutions business as Verigy. It was eventually bought out by Advantest Corporation in 2011.These portfolio moves drastically changed the Agilent's business profile:2010: Acquired Varian for $1.5 billion. Varian is a leading supplier of scientific instrumentation and associated consumables for life science and applied market applications.2012: Acquired Dako A/S for over $2.1 billion. Dako provides antibodies, reagents, scientific instruments and software for customers in pathology laboratories.2014: Spun-off the electronics measurement business as Keysight TechnologiesThe life science acquisitions combined with the Keysight spin-off transformed the company yet again:2019: Announced an agreement to acquire BioTek for over $1.1 billion. BioTek is a leading producer of instrumentation and assays used for analyzing live cells.Agilent provides instruments, software, services, and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow within life sciences, diagnostics, and applied chemicals markets. Their instruments and software allow customers to identify, quantify, and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular and cellular level. Their main competitors are Thermo Fischer Scientific, Danaher, and Waters Corporation.They operate the company through three segments: Life Sciences and Applied Markets, Diagnostics and Genomics, and Agilent CrossLabThe Life Sciences and Applied Markets (46% of revenue; 24% segment margin) business provides instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as allow customers to interrogate samples at the molecular and cellular level. Their key products include liquid chromatography systems and components, liquid chromatography mass spectrometry systems, gas chromatography, and a wide variety of other equipment.The Diagnostics and Genomics (19% of revenue; 19% segment margin) business is made up of six areas of activity providing active pharmaceutical ingredients (“APIs”) for therapeutics as well as solutions that include reagents, instruments, software, and consumables. These products enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the cellular and molecular level.The Agilent CrossLab (35% of revenue; 23% margin) business spans the entire lab with an extensive consumables and services portfolio that is driven by their installed base of hundreds of thousands of instruments. This ranges from chemistries and supplies (~1/3 of sales) to services and software (~2/3 of sales). Key product categories include various consumables for chromatography columns, sample preparation products, custom chemistries, and laboratory instrument supplies. Services include startup, operational, training and compliance support, software, as well as asset management and consultative services.The opportunity for Agilent investors is centered around three pillars: 1) testing and measurement businesses are fundamentally attractive, 2) long-term growth drivers, and 3) Clean balance sheetTesting and measurement companies, such as Agilent, are fundamentally good businesses. They benefit from selling highly technical instruments that serve mission-critical functions (verify food safety, ensure pharmaceutical efficacy, identify chemical pollutants, certify product quality, etc.) for companies as well as improve the productivity of highly skilled employees (lab technicians, scientists, engineers, etc.). Agilent’s business model has the added benefit of selling services and consumables that are needed in order to efficiently operate and utilize the equipment. This ‘razor/razor blade’ model generates a stable stream of revenue (~60% of total revenue) that depends on equipment utilization rather than capital spending plans. Overall, Agilent generates attractive returns on tangible invested capital which should prove durable over time.While not a rapidly growing, Agilent’s revenue is driven by end markets that are less cyclical than the general economy and grow in excess of GDP.Source: Agilent 2018 Investor DayAgilent should be able to grow profits faster than the mid-single-digit revenue growth due to expanding margins by 50 -70 bps per year (incremental margins are 30% - 40%) and using excess capital to repurchase shares.The last part of the investment opportunity centers around Agilent’s balance sheet. Even adjusted for the recently announced ~$1.1 billion acquisition of BioTek Instruments, they have a very clean balance sheet with net leverage of less than 1.0x.They can use 'dry powder' for additional bolt-on acquisitions and share buybacks at sensible prices (have ~$1.6 billion remaining on the buyback authorization). This should help grow value per-share over time as cash on the balance sheet currently earns a very low return.In terms of valuation multiple, Agilent is the least expensive company in the peer group, a group that has historically traded at a premium to the broader index given the attractive characteristics discussed in the article. Since Agilent has a clean balance sheet and the opportunity to expand margins, it wouldn't be surprising to see Agilent eventually trade at a premium to peers.Data by YChartsIn recent quarters the Life Sciences and Applied Markets business has slowed - mainly due to two events in China. First, the government implemented the 4+7 initiative where they are centralizing procurement of generic drugs with the purpose of lowering pricing. This has caused Agilent’s customers, the pharmaceutical companies, to delay capital spending on new equipment (which Agilent sells) until they see the impact from the 4+7 initiative (how much volume they will win or lose).The second factor impacting Agilent’s sales in China is the reorganization of the food ministries from thee to one. The Chinese government is decentralizing food testing and placing more commercial labs closer to actual production. This has caused a disruption in normal ordering patterns as the market transitions from the government to commercial customers. Furthermore, the consolidation has increased the utilization of the current installed base of instruments which caused a slowdown in ordering patterns.These factors are negatively impacting the business today but should prove to be transitory over the long run.The current Agilent is the result of numerous spin-offs, divestitures, and acquisitions. These transactions shifted the company out of more cyclical markets, such as semiconductors and electronics, and towards more predictable end markets. The current business should grow in excess of global GDP over the long run and generate attractive returns on invested capital. While the current valuation isn’t optically cheap, this is an above-average business and should be appropriately valued as such."

Agilent Technologies is one of the largest life sciences and chemical analysis testing products and services companies in the world. Agilent Technologies is a manufacturer of technical products on the edge of technologies and has the potential for future growth.The company has steady growth and has cash it uses to increase the dividends each year and grow their business.When I scanned the five-year chart, I noted that Agilent Technologies has a good chart going up and to the right in a strong slope. This is the kind of chart I like to see. In a good economy, Agilent Technologies really shines like in years 2014, 2016 and 2017 to date.A data by YChartsFundamentals of Agilent Technologies will be reviewed on the following topics below.I use a set of guidelines that I codified over the last few years to review the companies in The Good Business Portfolio (my portfolio) and other companies that I am taking a look at. For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article ""The Good Business Portfolio: Update To Guidelines and July 2016 Performance Review"". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return and growing companies that hopefully keeps me ahead of the Dow average.Agilent Technologies passes 9 of 11 Good Business Portfolio Guideline, a good score (a good score is 10 or 11). These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. Some of the points brought out by the guidelines are shown below.The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the Good Business Portfolio. Agilent Technologies passes this total return guideline against the Dow baseline in my 59.0-month test. I chose the 59.0 month test period (starting January 1, 2013, and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2013, and other years that had fair and bad performance. The good total return of 127.50% makes Agilent Technologies a good investment for the total return investor that also wants a steadily increasing income. Agilent Technologies has a below average dividend yield of 0.9% and has had increases for five years making Agilent Technologies a poor choice for the dividend income investor. The dividend was just increased in November 2017 to $0.149/Qtr. from $0.132/ Qtr., or a 13% increase.DOW's 59.0 Month total return baseline is 88.14%Click to enlargeFor the last quarter on November 20, 2017, Agilent Technologies reported earnings that beat expected by $0.05 at $0.67 and compared to last year at $0.38. Total revenue was higher at $1.19 billion up more than a year ago by 7.1% year over year and beat expected revenue by $20 million. This was a good report with the bottom line and the top line increasing. The next earnings report will be out late February 2018 and is expected to be $0.61 compared to last year at $0.52, a fair increase. The strong dollar is hurting A's foreign earnings.The graphic below shows the summary results for the fourth quarter.Source: Agilent Technologies earnings call slidesAgilent Technologies is one of the largest life sciences testing companies in the United States and foreign countries.As per Reuters:Overall Agilent Technologies is a good business with 9% CAGR projected growth as the United States and foreign economies grow going forward, with increasing demand for A's products. The good earnings brings you cash as we continue to see further growth as the world economy grows.Also as a tailwind, we have President Trump and Congress lowering corporate taxes on income. As the corporation foreign and domestic tax rate is lowered, earnings of Agilent Technologies business should increase.The economy is showing moderate economic growth right now (about 2.9%), and the FED has raised rates in December 2017, with future rate increases dependent on the United States economy and inflation. The FED projects for more increases in 2018 depending on inflation. I feel the Fed is going slowly; they don't want to trigger a slowdown in the economy.From November 20, 2017, earnings call Mike McMullen (Chief Executive Officer and President) said:The graphic below sums up the CEO's outlook.Source: Agilent Technologies earnings call slidesThis shows the feelings of top management regarding the continued growth of the Agilent Technologies business and shareholder return with an increase in future growth. Agilent Technologies has good growth and will continue as the foreign economies grow and demand for testing products and services increase.Agilent Technologies is a good investment choice for the total return investor with its high above average total return. Agilent Technologies will be considered when a slot opens up in The Good Business Portfolio. The Good Business Portfolio keeps the number of positions at 25 or less and the portfolio is full right now. If you want a growing dividend income and great total return in the life science testing business Agilent Technologies may be the right investment for you.The Good Business Portfolio trims a position when it gets above 8% of the portfolio. The four top positions in The Good Business Portfolio are, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is 8.4% of the portfolio, Altria (MO) is 7.2% of the portfolio, Home Depot (HD) is 9.2% of portfolio and Boeing is 11.4% of the portfolio, therefore BA, JNJ, and Home Depot are now in trim position with Altria getting close.Boeing is going to be pressed to 11% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on 787 deferred plane costs at $316 million in the first quarter, an increase from the fourth quarter. The second quarter saw deferred costs on the 787 go down $530 million a big jump from the first quarter. The second quarter earnings were fantastic with Boeing beating the estimate by $0.25 at $2.55. The third quarter earnings were $2.72, beating the expected by $0.06 with revenue increasing 1.7% year over year - another good report. S&P CFRA raised its one-year target to $272.JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because it's so defensive in this post-BREXIT world. Earnings in the last quarter beat on the top and bottom line and Mr. Market did like the growth going forward. JNJ is not a trading stock but a hold forever.For the total Good Business Portfolio, please see my article on The Good Business Portfolio: 2017 3rd Quarter Earnings and Performance Review for the complete portfolio list and performance.

4098554,24992,2017-08-14T05:12:50-04:00,"Shares are trading at a 15% premium to the overall market.Current White House public policy regarding research funding could act as a negative headwind for future earnings.If we assume a future dividend growth rate of 6% per year, our growth model shows only a 6.70% total annual return on shares to 2021.Our ChartMasterPro downward target price is $53.00.","Shares of Agilent Technologies Inc. (A) are up about 22% over the past month, and in my view investors who have benefited from that run-up should take the money and run. In the relativistic game of investing, there are far more profitable, less risky options available to us. I’ll go through the reasoning behind my bearish view by reflecting on the financial history here. I’ll also model what I consider to be a reasonable return from here based on the dividend. I’ll conclude by talking about the stock itself. In my view, the chief reason to avoid the name relates to the stock and its relative valuation.There are some things that I like about Agilent. Management is obviously relatively shareholder-friendly in their orientation, as evidenced by the fact that the dividend per share has grown at a CAGR of about 9% since 2010 on the back of a shrinking share count. In addition, the level of debt is not much of a concern in light of the fact that most of it (68%) is due after 2022. It’s also the case that the level of long-term debt is dwarfed by the size of the cash hoard (the size of the cash hoard is about 120% of the size of long-term debt). Finally, the most recent six months are much better than the same period last year.All that said, there’s little to get me excited about the stock, as the growth in both revenue and net income has been uninspiring. Not terrible, certainly, but certainly not inspiring. With the idea that a picture is worth a thousand words, I submit a graph of the revenue and the net income the company has produced over the years.Neither of these has been particularly inspiring in my view. The business is “fine,” but not exceptionally profitable.Although the financial history of the firm has been relatively uninspiring, investors buy a stream of future cash flows and for that reason I must spend some time trying to predict what the future holds based on dividends. Whenever I try to forecast, I engage in a ceteris paribus exercise, meaning that I only change the most relevant variable, in this case, the dividend. As I pointed out earlier, the dividend has grown at a CAGR of about 9%, but I typically reduce the growth rate when I perform these forecasts, in an effort to be as conservative as possible. In this case, it may be reasonable to do so, as the growth rate has certainly slowed over the past few years (the dividend per share was the same in 2016 as it was in 2013, for instance).I am going to infer a growth rate for the dividend of about 6% from now until 2021. This may be a bit aggressive, but I want to give the other side of my argument the benefit of the doubt. When I engage in this forecast, I infer a CAGR return for the shares of about 6.7% over the next four years. I don’t consider this to be a sufficiently strong return in light of the risks present.In my view, the risks here were best expressed by the company itself, so I’ll let the company’s 10-K speak for itself.Agilent 2016 10-K, pp 16The company is saying that revenue can be quite variable and that variability has been borne out at the firm. The fact that the current U.S. White House is “unpredictable” (to put it mildly) and has slashed some research budgets highlights the potential problems with this business.As per our ChartMasterPro Daily Trade Model, the trend for A would turn bearish with a daily close below $58.50. This would signal a bearish breakdown from a massive topping pattern on the daily charts which began in May. From here we see the shares falling to the $53.00 level over the next three months.On Monday, we may buy A put options, which will provide us with approximately 12x leverage on our short trade (for details on the option, please visit our website). Our initial stop-loss exit signal will be a daily close above $60.50.For investors in the shares, we recommend that you sell to avoid any further drop in the share value.As I’ve said repeatedly, for better or worse, investors typically access the future cash flows of a given business via the public markets. This can be a blessing or a curse. It’s a blessing when the market is in a particularly morose mood. In that circumstance, it may be possible to buy $1 for 50 cents. If, on the other hand, the market is particularly optimistic about a given company’s future, the long-term prospects for the investment may be poor.At the moment, shares of Agilent fall into the latter camp, namely, they are priced quite optimistically in my view. Although the company isn’t a particularly strong grower, the shares are priced as though they are (they currently trade at a 15% premium to the overall market). In addition, the company trades near the high end of its recent range. Given this, I suggest investors avoid the name for the time being. Agilent may be a business with some great prospects, but the stock is a different matter, so I rate it “avoid.”"
4053070,24361,2017-03-09T06:56:12-05:00,"Agilent has been making the most of new product cycles and delivering on its pledges to improve operating margins and be more disciplined regarding M&A.Potential reductions in academic research and environmental monitoring funding are not likely to disturb Agilent's growth trajectory all that much, but international dust-ups over trade are a bigger risk.Agilent appears priced for low double-digit FCF growth; a potentially attainable target but one with above-average risk given the competitive markets in which the company operates.","I was skeptical about Agilent's (NYSE:A) prospects for outperforming its peers back in the summer of 2015, but since then, Agilent shares have comfortably outperformed peers like Waters (NYSE:WAT), Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO), PerkinElmer (NYSE:PKI), Bruker (NASDAQ:BRKR), and Shimadzu with a 30% run that has also handily beaten the S&P 500. Management has done a better job than I'd expected of improving margins and streamlining/refocusing the business, and Agilent has also done better than I'd expected in the pharma space on the back of a strong liquid chromatography product cycle.At the risk of sounding like a broken clock, the valuation on the shares still concerns me. The new (and improved) Agilent has been generating FCF margins in the mid-teens and while I think management can deliver upside on operating margins and asset efficiency, I'm not sure that meaningfully exceeding 20% FCF margins is highly likely. So while I do think Agilent is a good company in the life sciences tools space (and performing well), it's hard for me to get comfortable with a valuation that already assumes double-digit long-term annualized free cash flow and/or a forward EV/EBITDA multiple more than twice the likely growth rate over the next three to five years.A Strong Player With A Somewhat Different MixAgilent remains a strong, diversified player across the life sciences tools market, with strong positions in mass spec, liquid and gas chromatography, and spectroscopy, as well as a diagnostics and genomics business that appears well-placed for where those markets are growing. What's more, Agilent is quite well-diversified in terms of its revenue base (with a 45% mix of instruments and a 55% mix of consumables and services), geography, and end markets.Agilent is a top-three player in mass spec. While its mid-teens market share is behind the 20%-plus share of Thermo and Danaher (NYSE:DHR), it is ahead of Waters and comfortably ahead of Bruker and Shimadzu. Agilent has a stronger position in higher-growth niches like Q-TOF, Triple Quad, and ICP-MS, while Thermo and Bruker have strong positions in other high-growth segments like Orbitrap and MALDI-TOF. Waters and Thermo are likewise comfortably placed in higher growth segments like Q-TOF and Triple Quad.Agilent also stands out in the chromatography field, where it is a leader overall and a leader in both liquid and gas chromatography. Waters is relatively close on the company's heels in LC (a roughly $3 billion to $4 billion market) and Thermo isn't too far behind, but Agilent dominates the $1.5 billion to $2.0 billion GC market with around 40% to 50% share (well ahead of Shimadzu). Agilent has also been successful at combining its product expertise, giving it strong positions in GC-mass spec (where it is number one) and LC-mass spec (where it is #1 in industrial markets).On the diagnostics/genomics side, Agilent has a growing presence in next-gen cancer diagnostics (part of its pathology segment), including a test that determines the level of a patient's PD-L1 expression (which can be a gating factor for getting new drugs like Keytruda or Opdivo). The genomics segment includes the company's competitive front-end sample prep business (used before sequencing) and its end-to-end microarray business. Agilent also has a small but growing nucleic acid solutions business - a business that manufactures oligonucleotides as active pharmaceutical ingredients.Agilent also generates meaningful revenue from its CrossLab (orACG) business. This business provides various lab/tool consumables (like chromatography columns and sample prep supplies), as well as equipment service and lab enterprise management tools. This business is increasingly ""platform agnostic"" (Agilent will service non-Agilent tools) and while it competes with Thermo and PerkinElmer, those companies haven't devoted as much attention to the ""lab management"" side of the equation.One of the areas where Agilent stands out is in its revenue mixes. Agilent has above-average exposure to ""industrial"" markets like chemical companies, refiners, oil/gas companies, and food, with these markets contributing approximately one-third of the company's revenue. Another 15% or so comes from environmental testing and forensics (which some, but not all, analysts also consider ""industrial""). Agilent is actually the leader in the chemicals/energy vertical, as well as the environmental/forensic markets it targets, and enjoys a #2 position in food safety.The pharma/bio market contributes close to a third of revenue (where the company has a #2 position on the back of its strength in LC and supplies/service), but the company is comparatively weak in academics (a number five market position). The company's position in diagnostics is a little harder to describe as like-for-like comparisons really aren't easy here, but the company is a leader/among the leaders in sample prep, anatomical pathology, immunohistochemistry, and microarrays.Multiple Avenues For GrowthI like the overall outlook for growth at Agilent. The company's pharma/bio business has been its strongest segment for a couple of years (surprisingly so to me), as the company has ridden a strong LC product cycle that likely still has a little room left to run. While increased consolidation in the pharma space would be a threat, the increasing complexity of drug development should support healthy tool demand.Agilent has also been doing okay in the chemical/energy space recently despite the well-known weakness in those end markets. Agilent isn't getting much out of the refining or oil/gas segments right now, but chemistry companies are upgrading their GC instruments and Agilent's new Intuvo 9000 system is getting a good reception (it's smaller, more energy-efficient, and simpler to use). As it will likely take at least four or five years for this cycle to run its course, Agilent should be looking forward to strong results here, and maybe some competitive share gains.China is a growth market for life sciences tools, and Agilent is well-placed here. With over 15% of its revenue coming from China, Agilent is up there with Mettler Toledo (NYSE:MTD) and Waters in terms of meaningful Chinese exposure, while Bruker and Thermo have more limited leverage.Management at Agilent is also looking to stimulate growth below the top line. The company's operating margins have been a touchy subject for a few years, but under the ""Agile Agilent"" program the new management team (in place since 2015) has done a pretty good job of restructuring its portfolio and operational footprint and streamlining its R&D process. There's still work to do on integrating Dako and improving the supply chain, and management is expecting most of the incremental improvement to come from better gross margin, as it targets mid-20%'s EBIT margins.The OpportunityWhile increasing production volumes of biopharmaceuticals is an important driver in the life science tools space, it's one that I expect will benefit companies like Danaher and Thermo more than Agilent due to the respective product mixes. Nevertheless, Agilent is still well-placed for the overarching theme of drug development becoming more complex and more focused on biologicals. Another mixed driver for Agilent is the outlook for government-funded spending in areas like environmental monitoring and academic research.The new administration doesn't seem particularly friendly to either of these categories, but Agilent's vulnerability to lower academic funding levels seems more modest. On the other hand, if trade disputes with countries like China become sharper, it could harm the business as almost two-thirds of the company's revenue comes from outside the U.S.M&A is a wildcard. Agilent has generally not been richly praised for its M&A history, and I think there are still some concerns that the company will do expensive and/or dilutive deals. I'm not so worried about this now; I think more deals are likely, but I think they'll be small tuck-in deals for more specialized products, services, or technologies (like specific diagnostic tests/testing technology).In terms of the flip-side, I don't really see Agilent as a prime target given its size; other life science tool companies would likely get pushback from regulators, though I suppose a low-probability bid from a company like Abbott (NYSE:ABT) could be theoretically possible.I believe Agilent can outgrow the global economy and generate mid single-digit revenue growth over the next decade. With improving margins and asset efficiency, I expect FCF margins to climb into the high teens and drive high single-digit growth. Unfortunately, that doesn't support today's price even with a high single-digit discount rate. Likewise, the shares trade at an EV/EBITDA multiple around double my estimate for near-term EBITDA growth. It's not uncommon for quality life sciences companies to trade at rich valuations, but it is nevertheless a concern for me.The Bottom LineI wish I could find a better balance between liking Agilent as a company and being concerned about the valuation on the stock. To their credit, management has answered a lot of the concerns I had about the strategic outlook for the company a couple of years ago, and the share price outperformance at least somewhat reflects that growing confidence. The company is doing pretty well now, with good core revenue growth and improving margins, and I'm reluctant to harp too much on valuation, but I do think investors that emphasize value over growth may struggle with this one."
4136454,36431,2018-01-10T02:44:10-05:00,"Agilent continues to outperform the market.A large part of this outperformance is due to multiple expansion.The company continues to improve itself, but whether it's improving enough to justify its lofty valuations is another question.","Agilent (A) continues to outpace the market, after more than doubling the return of the S&P 500 in 2017.A main driver of the outperformance largely comes from multiple expansion, as shares continue to trade at a lofty 33 times GAAP earnings.Management over at Agilent also provides ""non-GAAP"" earnings-per-share numbers (as well as guidance) that it thinks better reflects the firm's true underlying earnings power. Using the non-GAAP EPS numbers still leaves shares looking quite rich, however, at roughly 30.5 times earnings.The above chart (and all others, unless otherwise noted) was created by the author using data from Agilent's 10-K forms. This compares to the five-year average multiple of 26.7 times earnings, and the thirteen-year median multiple of only 16.83 times earnings. So not only are shares expensive today relative to history, but multiple expansion appears to be an ongoing trend over the last five years in general. I think this trend needs to be examined further.For one thing, Agilent has focused on transforming its business, especially over the past three years, and achieved the ""highest growth rate since the 2014 launch of the New Agilent"" according to CEO Mike McMullen, who continued explaining that, ""2017 revenues of $4.47 billion are up 6.7% on the core basis."" The company's non-GAAP operating margins also hit 22%, a 410 basis point jump from fiscal 2014’s adjusted operating margin - and it's guiding for further expansion in fiscal 2018 to 22.4%.Agilent has multiple levers it's pulling to optimize efficiency, focus on quality growth markets, and boost overall margins.Source: Agilent 2017 Q4 earnings call slidesAnalysts expect (non-GAAP) EPS growth of roughly 9.32% in fiscal 2018 and then another 10.85% from 2018 through 2019. With this in mind, we can stack up these growth rates against what's currently being implied in the share price.Assuming a discount rate of 10% to 12%, there's only about 6.5% to 8.5% of EPS growth baked into the company's share price at present. This also assumes the adjusted EPS figures are accurate reflections of true economic reality.Looking at Agilent's ROE by breaking it down into five analyzable pieces also provides further insight.We can see margin expansion taking form when analyzing the GAAP numbers as well, with operating margins increasing sequentially over the last three years. The company also continues to generate more revenues in relation to its assets, as illustrated by its improving asset turnover. These two improvements have led to significantly better GAAP ROE for shareholders, despite the deflating effects of declining leverage. All signs so far point to improvement, backing up management's claims.Taking the entire capital structure into account, we can also examine management's capital allocation skills through the lens of return on invested capital.Agilent likely either came close to earning its cost of capital or earned it (depending on the true cost of equity) in fiscal 2017, indicating adequate profits but nothing exceptional. Due to the extreme difficulty in estimating a true cost of equity, below I will include a range of different equity costs, as well as their impact on overall WACC.Agilent could theoretically be eking out slim economic profits if its true cost of equity is closer to 8% or 10%, but I like to err on the side of caution.If we use adjusted operating profit provided by management of $974 (in millions) and hold everything else constant, ROIC would be closer to 12.77%. While the company doesn't earn wide excess profits (where ROIC greatly exceeds WACC), it could in the future if margin expansion and increased efficiency in the firm's capital structure continues at a decent pace.There's little doubt that Agilent is improving the quality of its overall business, while also growing both its top and bottom-lines at an above-average rate. While it appears there could be a valid justification for the firm's current lofty valuations based on its growth (and assuming a best-case scenario), there doesn't appear to be any margin of safety.The worst-case scenario involves a drop in growth and/or failure to continue to expand margins. If that's the case, a ""reversion to the mean"" back to more historical valuation multiples could mean potentially ugly downside risks, in my opinion. Downside risk appears to significantly outweigh any upside potential, therefore, and despite my interest in the business improvement and growth potential, I'll remain on the sidelines.

4129388,95586,2017-12-04T09:21:03-05:00,Agilent is overpriced and ready for exit as its trading at an unjustifiably high price to earnings ratio and free cash flow ratio.Research into the company's 18-year history as a publicly traded company reveals the business is making a similar amount of free cash flow as it did back in 2004.Recent expansion of the board of directors with non-critical roles is evidence of the diffusion of responsibility and an expanding bureaucracy.,"The story of a successful investor is always primarily composed of stories of avoiding the catastrophe of buying into companies at too high a price.Today, Agilent (NYSE:A) is trading at too high a price for a wise investor to be able to intelligently continue holding this stock.Since February 2016, the company's stock has rallied from $36 to today's $68 per share as the perception of earnings growth has been promulgated by the company's book keeping practices, something evident based on relatively zero growth in annual cash flows on a 10-year comparison. Reported earnings per share has grown from 2016's $1.40 to a track exceeding $2.00 this year.The attendant excitement of the market has caused it to fall head-over-heels, bringing the company's market capitalization to over $22B on free cash flows unlikely to exceed $620M for the year. That's the kind of money this company was earning in 2004 and trading for $30 per share. While buybacks have shrunk the share count by 30% since 2004, that hardly justifies the much higher price for each dollar of cash incomes this company has coming in.Agilent's growth in earnings on a period-over-period basis consisting of today's trailing nine months as compared to last year's same nine-month period is truly substantial, according to the company's financial reports, with the recent issue measuring a 50% bump in EPS. However, the improvement in earnings does not gel with the reported cash incomes of the company for the same period.While the period-over-period earnings improved a whopping 50%, cash flows improved only 7%. This discrepancy between earnings' improvement and cash flows is a big warning flag that some accrued expenses rolled off of the accounting books, giving earnings a temporary boost. But it indicates that there might be no material improvement in the company's business.Nonetheless, the market is eating up the illusory good news and has boosted the company's stock to a massive growth company class multiple of 33x P/E and a whopping 40x my estimate of free cash flow for 2017 (as extrapolated from September 2017's quarterly report). Long-surviving market lore is that the benchmark for a wise investor to buy into a company growing at a moderate or zero pace is nearer to a 15x or 20x multiple when conviction is high.Agilent's board was expanded from 10 to 11 seats in July of this year, and there is no discernible reason it needs to expand its compensation committee and nominating/corporate governance oversight committees. By expanding these committees the only thing the board really accomplishes is the further diffusion of responsibility, in case this company's bureaucracy continues to grow, as is evident by this recent expansion of the board.For me, it comes down to whether or not it is wise to own a company that is substantially more expensive than most of the market on an earnings basis. To provide some perspective, if the company distributed 100% of its free cash flow as earnings, we'd be looking at an annual dividend of just 3%-3.5%. That doesn't motivate me to take the capital risk, market risk, competition risk, and so forth by hitching my wagon to Agilent.The company's main narrative for growth at this time is their move into laboratory scheduling software, which should earn some solid margins. But if it grows into a big segment for Agilent, you know other tech players, like Workday (WDAY), are going to come out to contend with them. In my opinion, avoid Agilent at today's $68 per share.Disclaimer: This article represents the opinion of the author as of the date of this article.

4079452,24823,2017-06-07T08:20:17-04:00,Our overall buy signal grade = 86 out of 100.It has our fundamental buy signal.Our implied return buy signal = 16.5%.Our demand buy signal = D 7 out of 9.Our technical buy signal is confirmed by the chart.,"Agilent (NYSE:A) is on our Daily Index Beater list because it has all of our buy signals but not our Timing buy signal yet, because the demand reading is so high. We have to wait for that to come down so we can buy on weakness. Let's drill down on the fundamentals and technicals to confirm our buy signals and see what price makes sense on any pullback.Analyst TargetsWe like to start with the experts on the company, the analysts, who know a great deal more about the company than any of us. Of course, the analysts are not going to tell us everything they know. Otherwise, they would never be paid for their expensive research. But writers on Seeking Alpha will tell us everything they know, so not too worry! (That is why the small investor needs Seeking Alpha to level the playing field with the pros.)A has a 12-month target of $64 and is trading at $60 as shown on finviz.com as I write. Nasdaq.com shows a target of $65 for consensus with a high analyst target of $70. Also, 9 of 11 analysts have buys. Flashratings.com also shows a target of $64 based on recent analyst postings. From my experience, the closer price moves to $64, the closer A comes to a pullback in price to test support. That would be the buy-on-weakness opportunity.FundamentalsHere is what we wrote to paying subscribers after earnings were announced: ""It looks ok but the P/E and PEG are too high indicating it is overvalued. The 12-month target is in the red and too low."" Well, now the target has moved up to $64, and A is trading below that price, so the target is no longer color coded red at finviz.com. But the PEG continues to be problematic, unless growth improves and targets rise. Of course, targets are rising.A P/E of 20 on the high analyst estimate of $2.80 for earnings = $56 target. The analysts' consensus of $64-70 is even more optimistic than what I consider an already optimistic $56 target. But who am I to argue with the expert analysts at $64 to $70? I will go with them. That upward trend in analyst targets is impressive. Based on the analyst target of $70, our implied return buy signal looks reasonable. With the exception of the PEG, our fundamental buy signal looks ok.TechnicalsAs you can see from the chart, our technical buy signal is confirmed. It is overbought, and price could easily come back, as it usually does, to test the lower channel line of the strong uptrending channel. If the overbought signals break down, we can expect that price weakness test of support to happen.ConclusionWe have verified all of our buy signals. The closer price comes to the consensus 12-month target, the closer it comes to a pullback in price to test support and trigger a buy-on-weakness Timing signal. A retest of support at S2 on the chart at $59 is probable. We have confirmed that A belongs on our Index Beater list and, I think, is an outperformer for the foreseeable future.Disclaimer: We are not investment advisers and we never recommend stocks or securities.

4093323,103507,2017-08-01T16:48:58-04:00,"Agilent has a rock-solid lineup of products.Agilent stands in great position to capitalize on an increase in spending on biopharma and chemistry research.In an age of high-throughput laboratory applications, Agilent delivers technology that is specifically suited to these needs.","Agilent Technologies (A) is a California-based provider of laboratory instruments and services. With a market cap of $19 billion, it is one of the largest providers of lab technology in the world, exceeded only by the more bio-focused Illumina (ILMN). Agilent focuses on 6 key markets: Food, Environmental and Forensics, Pharmaceutical, Diagnostics, Chemical and Energy, and Research. Agilent has global exposure, with 27% of Revenue coming from Europe, and 39% coming from the Asia Pacific region. They are a well-run company whose upper management has been together unchanged for 2 years and counting.Agilent's Life Sciences & Applied Markets Group has a strong lineup of products that will be attractive upgrades for lab managers. Their Intuvo 9000 Gas Chromatography (GC) line and Cary UV-Vis spectrophotometers (the latter of which I directly work on) are widely considered to be the best in their class, and are integral pieces of equipment in labs. Agilent is known for reaching out to lab managers and using feedback to optimize products to changing needs.The feedback to new instruments at conferences has been extremely positive. The Intuvo 9000 was selected as the Green Product of the Year at the ACCSI 2017 conference. The 1260 Infinity Liquid Chromatography (LC) system won the 2017 Scientists' Choice Award for Best New Separation Product (Q2 earnings call). Labs with aging equipment now have especially strong motivation to upgrade their systems, and the new Intuvo will build on the success of the popular 7890 line in the GC front.A new LC-MS (liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry) product, the Ultivo, has reduced the lab footprint (read: space required) of its predecessor by 65%. As explained by Senior VP Patrick Kaltenbach,The Diagnostics Group secured a major win by beating out competitors to become the vendor of equipment to the diagnostic services giant Quest, a testament to the quality of their equipment. The GentiSure Assay (type of CGH assay), a new offering by Agilent, will fulfill an important need for geneticists. Routine newborn screening is carried out in all 50 states (CDC, 2011), but is generally metabolism-focused and narrow in scale. CGH assays provide geneticists the ability to screen for chromosomal abnormalities in newborns who present with unexplained learning developments.There are several risk factors unique to Agilent. Agilent’s customers are primarily government agencies, research institutions, and biopharma companies. From Agilent’s 2016 Annual Report, “Fluctuations in the research and development budgets at these organizations could have a significant effect on the demand for our products.” The funding of these institutions is highly nuanced and political. Additionally, the current White House has shown a willingness to cut science funding with slashes to NIH and EPA funding.However, these implications for Agilent are relatively small. The only serious risk is a slowdown in biopharma spending, which represents 29% of Agilent’s revenue by sector (Q2 earnings call). A slowdown in that historically volatile sector would throttle the growth of Agilent’s Life Sciences division. However, current estimates on spending are optimistic amidst strong indications from the sector.Agilent is a strong candidate for a long position. They report Q3 earnings after close on August 15th. Management is notoriously conservative with guidance, and Agilent consistently beats estimates. Their strong lineup of new products should bring in orders from labs with aging GCs and other equipment. In the midst of a strong quarter for biopharma, buying in before earnings will be a favorable move.As explained in Deloitte's 2017 Global Life Sciences Outlook research, ""Life sciences sector growth is closely tied to global health care expenditures which, in 2017 and successive years, are expected to be fueled by increasing demand from an aging population and the prevalence of chronic and communicable diseases."" While funding in academia and government are currently slowing, the Diagnostic and Life Sciences groups have achieved strong organic growth. The underlying population-scale factors described above will continue to drive growth in Agilent's bell-cow divisions.Agilent's situation can be compared to Nvidia's (NVDA) rise in tech over the last 5 years - as the world turns toward AI, machine learning, and automation, Nvidia delivers the hardware that make these systems functional, and their valuation has increased accordingly. Similarly, as the world of science advances to gene therapy, informatics, and high-throughput applications of diagnostics, Agilent provides the equipment to make this progress possible."
4086801,25120,2017-07-10T20:23:18-04:00,"Agilent is an extremely well-run company, enjoying substantial tailwinds in its business.Growing sales and earnings are reinvested through a sound capital allocation strategy.I like the latest bolt-on deal which Agilent has made, and would like to see increased activity in terms of M&A.After a big run this year shares have gotten a bit too expensive for my taste, but I will be buying on any pullback to $50 per share.","Agilent (NYSE:A) is a very attractive business which runs diversified operations catering to laboratory companies across the world, being a stable-growth and high-margin business.Agilent's quality has unfortunately not gone unnoticed by the investment community, hence shares trade at very elevated multiples. That being said, a quality business and sound capital allocation decisions do have the tendency and potential to create a lot of value over time, hence my interest in Agilent.This is certainly the case, as the company made another nice bolt-on acquisition, albeit small. While the multiples are too steep for me given the 30% run higher this year, I am glad to start buying into the growth story at around $50 per share.A Large-Cap Growth PlayAgilent is, in essence, an umbrella of many businesses which focus on multiple growing market segments, which makes it a very diversified business with generally good growth prospects. The company generated $4.2 billion in revenues in 2016 by catering to laboratory companies, divided up across three segments.Applied markets and life science markets are the core segments for Agilent, as Diagnostics makes up the remaining 15% of sales. The company is very diversified in terms of geographic coverage, having an almost equal presence in the Americas, Europe and Asia. Diversification between consumables and instruments is very robust as well, being roughly 50-50.These activities are typically very profitable, with GAAP operating margins coming in around 20% of sales. Even better, both sales and margins have had a tendency to expand, thereby translating into substantial cash flows which Agilent aims to use wisely through a balanced capital allocation policy, including the focus on many nice bolt-on acquisitions.Quality Comes At A PriceAgilent itself has seen quite tumultuous developments since it went public in 1999 as a spin-off from Hewlett-Packard. After shares spiked far above the $100 mark during the dot-com bubble, they could be bought for 10% of that price in 2002-03, after which shares rose to $40 again, before dipping in the financial crisis. Shares rose to $60 again in 2014, levels at which they still trade today. This price underestimates the value created for shareholders as the company spun off Keysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) in 2014. The 0.5 share allocation in this company received by investors in Agilent is worth another $20 bucks at today's prices.Over time, the company has made many investments and divestitures with the long-term goals of growth and margins in mind. That kind of growth does not come automatically, however - the R&D budget of $325 million is quite substantial, being equal to 7.5% of sales.The focus on quality and growth comes at a price, and that is that of a high valuation. Agilent posted adjusted earnings of $1.98 per share in 2016. Following the anticipation of 5% core growth, sales are anticipated to approach $4.4 billion this year, which, combined with 21.5% margins, should translate into adjusted earnings of $2.15-2.21 per share. This makes shares quite expensive at 27-28 times earnings.Real GAAP earnings multiples are even higher, as the ratio of GAAP/Non-GAAP earnings came in at 70% last year. In all fairness, most of the discrepancy resulted from intangible amortization charges which do not involve any cash outflows. It should be said that the gap between earnings under both accounting metrics has narrowed substantially so far this year.In May, Agilent posted excellent results, as core revenue growth even came in as high as 9% for the quarter. The company ended the quarter with a comfortable cash buffer of $2.4 billion, as debt stands at $2.0 billion. If we take into account some modest pension-related liabilities, Agilent operates with a flat net cash position. This values the company at a $19.5 billion enterprise valuation at $60 per share. This implies that shares are valued at 4.5 times sales and 27-28 times non-GAAP earnings.The Latest AdditionIn July, Agilent announced a modest bolt-on acquisition, with the focus on modest. The company is acquiring Cobalt Light Systems for roughly $50 million. Cobalt was founded in 2008 and produces Raman spectroscopic instruments for a variety of industries. The innovative solutions of Cobalt Light Systems allow for identification of chemicals and materials through barriers, while traditional solutions have limited capabilities of doing so.Having the ability to analyze whole tablets or containers, the time-consuming sample processing in pharmaceutical, chemical ID and security applications can be reduced. This increases both safety and speed, while it reduces time and costs. Cobalt's clients include top pharmaceutical companies as well as more than 75 airports, as adoption of its technology is growing rather quickly.The company has grown very quickly since inception, now employing 52 workers. An FT story which featured the company back in 2014 indicated that sales grew by a factor of 5 times that year to 12 million pounds, equivalent to $15 million in USD. If we assume that revenues have been flat ever since, which seems like an unrealistic assumption, the multiple is absolutely non-demanding, as it seems that Agilent has made a great deal. For just $50 million, Agilent has bought a company with great growth rates and prospects at a sales multiple which is less than its own valuation.I like Agilent But Not Its PriceThis latest deal with Cobalt shows the power of Agilent's powerful platform as well as sound capital allocation policies, as I really like this deal. While this deal is not going to have a meaningful impact at all, given the small size of Cobalt, the impact of many of such deals over a cumulative time period can really make a difference in terms of accelerating organic growth.While the earnings multiples are not even out of line with those of many other great executors in this area - think of Ametek (NYSE:AME), Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER) and Teledyne (NYSE:TDY), for instance - the multiples are quite steep, especially if rates move higher. A 27 times multiple corresponds to a mere 3.7% earnings yield, which is just 1.3% above the Treasury yield. While the spread is very narrow in terms of the risk premium, note that Agilent's business can be regarded as low-risk, as the company is expected to deliver on growing earnings in the future, of course.The steep valuation has largely been the result of the 30% run higher so far this year, as shares were still trading in the mid-$40s by the end of 2016. Given the stability and the great underlying business, I see value in the shares if I pay a multiple in the low 20s, looking to accumulate some shares if they dip towards the $50 mark."

I wound up doing focus articles on companies that very quickly could not be seen as good long-term investments when compared using the Good Business Guidelines.So I got the idea of another series - companies that only had one letter in their symbol (no logical reason for this, just fun), but did not want to do full reviews of companies that did not show promise. This is the first part of the series.

For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article ""The Good Business Portfolio: Update To Guidelines and July 2016 Performance Review"". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, momentum, total return, and growing companies that keeps me ahead of the Dow average.This is a large-cap company with a capitalization of $15.8 billion. Agilent has a cash flow of $690 million for the year that pays a low dividend and leaves plenty of cash left over to continue to grow the business. It is the largest company in its sub sector and has the strength to weather economic downturns.I require the CAGR going forward to be able to cover my yearly expenses. My dividends provide 3.1% of the portfolio as income, and I need 1.9% more for a yearly distribution of 5%. Agilent Technologies has a three-year CAGR of 9%, meeting my requirement. This makes it a good investment for the total return investor, with good forward growth of the research sector expected and the company's below-average dividend.Agilent has a yearly dividend yield of 1.0%, and its dividend has been increased for 4 the last 5 years. The average payout ratio of the dividend is low, at 20% over 5 years. Agilent Technologies is therefore not a dividend income investment, but its total return is above the Dow base line by 19%, which is great.The company's last yearly cash flow is at $690 million, which leaves it enough of cash to pay its low dividend and have plenty left over for business development. The dividend payout ratio over the last 5 years is 20%, which is low, but allows Agilent to invest in the business each year by buying bolt-on smaller companies.Agilent Technologies' S&P Capital IQ rating is three-star or Hold with a target price of $47. It is then at a fair price compared to the target price. A prime objective of the portfolio is to beat the market and do better than the averages in good times and bad. Agilent Technologies is a total return investment, beating the Dow by 19% over my test period.Total Return And Yearly DividendThe Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of The Good Business Portfolio; the total return guideline was just added to my list of guidelines. Agilent Technologies beat the total return in my 43.8-month test compared to the Dow average. I chose the 43.8-month test period (starting January 1, 2013 and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2013, and other years that had fair and bad performance. Modeling the Dow average is not an objective of the portfolio, but just happened by using the 11 guidelines as a filter for company selection. The above-average total return and below-average dividend makes Agilent Technologies a great choice for the total return investor. The dividend has been increased for 4 of the last 5 years. The Dow's 43.8-month total return baseline is 41.59%. The total return during the test period for Agilent is above the Dow average at 60.67% (adjusted for the spin-off in 2014), beating the Dow baseline by 19.08%. YTD total return is 14.91%, well above the Dow average of 6% YTD. In a good year like 2013, Agilent Technologies really shone and had a total return of 57% compared to the market return of 27%.A data by YChartsLooking at these data points, it is clear that Agilent beat the Dow average in good years and has made a positive total return of 19% over the test period and provided a small income source.Dow baseline - 41.59Last Quarter's EarningsOn August 17, 2016, Agilent Technologies reported earnings for the last quarter at $0.49 compared to the last year's at $0.44 and expected at $0.47. Revenue was higher at $1.04 billion up from that of last year by 3.0% year over year that missed estimated revenue by $10.0 million. This was a good report showing the same earnings from the same quarter of 2015. Earnings for the next quarter will be out November 14, 2016, and is expected to be $0.52, compared to that of last year at $0.50. The expectation going forward is steady growth in both revenues and earnings year over year. This steady forward projection is what makes Agilent Technologies a solid total return investment. One problem with Agilent is the strong dollar hurting the company's foreign revenue.Business OverviewAgilent Technologies provides application-focused solutions that include instruments, software, services and consumables for the entire laboratory workflow. The company serves the life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets. It has 3 business segments: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics and genomics, and Agilent Cross Lab. The company's life sciences and applied markets business segment offers instruments and software that enable customers to identify, quantify and analyze the physical and biological properties of substances and products, as well as enable customers in the clinical and life sciences research areas to interrogate samples at the molecular level. Its diagnostics and genomics business segment includes the reagent partnership, pathology, companion diagnostics, genomics and the nucleic acid solutions businesses. One of my guidelines is that you understand the business - would you buy the whole company if you could? On this guideline, The Good Business Portfolio does not fully understand Agilent's products and will take a little more time to review them on the company's web site. Pharmacy, Food and Clinical products remain strong and should give continued growth to Agilent. Being in retirement, I like to play it safe, but for those who understand the business, it looks like a great total return investment.Takeaways and Recent Portfolio Changes- Agilent Technologies is a good total return investment with a below-average dividend yield and great total return over my test period and other periods compared to the Dow average, and has a good CAGR of 9% going forward. It will not be considered for The Good Business Portfolio because there are no open slots right now, but will be considered when a slot open up. I limit my portfolio to 25 companies, since I can't fully keep track of more than that. If you are in need of investment company with great total return, Agilent can be considered if you understand the products it makes and the markets it serves.- Sold some Cabela's (NYSE:CAB) covered calls, sold September $52.5's. If the premium gets to 20% of the sold premium price, I will buy them back with the hope that CAB goes up, so I can sell the calls again in the same month for a double.- Trimmed Harley Davidson (NYSE:HOG) from 5.5% of the portfolio to 5.1%.- Bought a starter position of Digital Reality Trust (NYSE:DLR) of 0.52% of the portfolio. I feel the computer industry facilities business has nowhere to go but up, and DLR pays an above-average dividend. I wrote an article on Digital Reality Trust in April of this year, if you are interested.- Sold some covered calls on Harley Davidson, sold August $50's. If the premium gets to 20% of the sold premium price, I will buy them back with the hope that HOG goes up, so I can sell the calls again in the same month for a double. The HOG price is presently above the strike price, and I have moved the calls up and out. On August 10, the portfolio moved the HOG calls up and out to November $52.5's.- The Good Business Portfolio generally trims a position when it gets above 8% of the portfolio. The four top positions in the portfolio: Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is 8.4% of the portfolio, Altria Group Inc. (NYSE:MO) is 7.8% of the portfolio, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is 8.0% of the portfolio and Boeing (NYSE:BA) is 7.8% of the portfolio. Therefore JNJ and HD are now in trim position, with Boeing and Altria getting close.- Boeing is going to be pressed to 10% of the portfolio because of it being cash-positive on individual 787 plane costs, as announced in the 2015 fourth-quarter earnings call. For BA, from the second 2016 earnings call, deferred costs increased $33 million - a small amount - and I project positive cash from the 787 program in the third quarter of possibly $100 million. The KC-46A refueling plane has been authorized by the Pentagon for its initial production, and this will be a big step to increase Boeing's already high cash flow even more. The contract has still to be awarded, which should be soon.- JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because it's so defensive in this post-Brexit world.For the total Good Business Portfolio, please see my recent article ""The Good Business Portfolio: 2016 1st-Quarter Earnings And Performance Review"" for the complete portfolio list and performance. Become a real-time follower and you will get each quarter's performance after the earnings season is over.I have written individual articles on CAB, JNJ, EOS, GE, IR, MO, BA, AA, Omega Health Investors, and HD that are in The Good Business Portfolio and other companies being evaluated by the portfolio. If you have an interest, please look for them in my list of previous articles.Of course, this is not a recommendation to buy or sell, and you should always do your own research and talk to your financial advisor before any purchase or sale. This is how I manage my IRA retirement account, and the opinions on the companies are my own."
3979887,96096,2016-06-05T02:09:35-04:00,The life science tools and services industry will continue to grow as developed countries experience demographic transition.The company has increased returns on assets and equity since Q2 2015.Agilent is trading at a discount compared to its peers while growing earnings at higher rates.,"The Industry & Agilent TechnologiesIn 1999, Agilent (NYSE:A) was established through a spin-off from HP (NYSE:HPQ). The company now provides the analytical tools, software, services, and consumables for entire laboratory workflows.Life sciences tools and services industry makes up various types of companies from biotechs and healthcare providers to technology companies. Investors may be familiar with this industry and more over how fragmented it tends to be. The eight segments are: proteomics, cell biology, small animal in vivo analysis, bioinformatics, general labware, genomics, and combinational chemistry. Mature economies have helped consolidate these segments because of the impending increased demand for drugs to combat cancer, heart disease, and other age induced illnesses. Although the FDA has often thrown a wrench in the progress of these companies through increased regulation, the industry has a positive outlook because of the great leaps technology has allowed these firms to make with their research.A Quick Look into Agilent TechnologiesThe company has its ups and downs. Unfortunately, Agilent Technologies has been faced with a relatively low growth rate compared to other equities due to regulation impeding process of new product development. Nevertheless, the company has had strong returns and I believe will continue to do so due to its high historic growth and return rates.Comparing Q2 FY15 and Q2 FY16, we can see their net sales have increased by 4.5% while their cash and equity remained relatively unchanged. Another great performance indicator is their profitability. Gross profit margins from 2015-2016 have also remained virtually unchanged while ROA is up 1.16%, ROE is up 5.07%. The company's volatility to the market is 1.39 which is relatively low risk for such upside potential.Agilent's Real ValueThe company's fundamentals are average with a Price/Earnings ratio at 32.28, and a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 21.70 comparing to industry peers at 33.06 and 21.67 sequentially. Where investors find some interesting trends is the valuation of their price to book ratio, earnings growth, and price to sales ratio. Taking a look at these fundamentals, the company's price to book ratio is 3.55 which means it is trading at a significant discount to its industry peers whose average is 5.34. The most sought after takeaway from looking at the company's filings is their earnings growth. At 83.11% they are over double the average for their sector which is indicative of higher capital appreciation and outperformance. Total market capitalization is roughly $14.9 Billion with an enterprise value of $14.64 Billion.From a numbers point of view, the company compared to the sector is trading at a discount while also growing its earnings at a rate that's above the rest of the sector. Agilent finds its value in consistent margins, earnings, solid debt management, and increasing returns on assets and equity.The ConsUnfortunately, as previously mentioned in the industry summary, companies like Agilent are facing and will continue to face challenges that are imposed on them through the FDA. This means, that it might be long ride for investors before they realize some strong capital gains. Slowed sales growth is also an issue for Agilent because it could be an early indication that the company is losing market share.ConsensusAgilent Technologies may be facing slowed growth currently but with sustainable margins, no long term debt, and potential to grow, they may present themselves to be a worthwhile equity for a growth portfolio. The industry may be facing its challenges now but as time continues, their research and products will have increased value because of the demographic transition the United States and other developed nations are experiencing. My positive outlook is driven by the company's multiple strengths which I think far outweigh weaknesses."
3277455,24361,2015-06-24T09:31:35-04:00,"Agilent is setting out organic revenue growth and margin improvement targets that are actually pretty aggressive relative to the history of the life science tools industry.
        Agilent appears weaker in areas like clinical tools, diagnostics, and pharma/biotech that are likely to generate more attractive growth and is stronger in markets offering less impressive growth outlooks.
        A low teens FCF growth rate isn't enough to support today's price and an attractive FV for Agilent is predicated on industry-leading growth and/or margin leverage.","The life science tools market doesn't offer quite as much organic growth as many investors seem to think, but the high barriers to entry, relatively short product cycles, and consumables/service streams do tend to support good margins for the established players. The question facing Agilent (NYSE:A) isn't so much about whether the company can remain a strong player in markets like separation, mass spec, and pathology, but rather whether the company can reverse a long history of failing to live up to expectations and truly make the most of its technology and market positions.At this point I'm a skeptic. Agilent shares may hold some appeal if you believe they can generate Waters-level (NYSE:WAT) FCF margins relatively soon, but I consider that to be a very ambitious expectation. Likewise, I'm a little concerned about the company's relatively weaker position in clinical markets next to Waters, Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO), Danaher (NYSE:DHR), and Bruker (NASDAQ:BRKR). Although I have little doubt that Agilent as a company will be fine, I'm concerned that there's too much optimism in the shares now that Agilent operates as a pure-play on life science and science tools.A Lot Of Improvement Is Already Part Of The StoryI normally leave discussions of probable growth rates and margin improvements until later in my pieces, but in the case of Agilent it is a front-and-center issue. Just for the sake of clarity, when I refer to ""Agilent"" I am referring to the businesses that currently compromise the company (so, excluding the businesses that were spun off as Keysight (NYSE:KEYS)).Relative to Waters, Thermo, and Danaher, Agilent has an okay margin history, but prior management had a history of setting targets it couldn't reach (particularly with respect to M&A synergies) and there is room for improvement today. Agilent has tended toward above-average R&D spending, but hasn't really generated the sort of above-average organic growth that would lead an investor to conclude that the R&D spending was translating into meaningful product development. Likewise, Agilent's overall revenue growth rate hasn't been that impressive; the company has struggled to generate much synergy from its past M&A deals and the company's organic growth isn't particularly distinguished relative to Danaher, Waters, and Thermo.Management is setting out to change that, and change it in a meaningful way. During the company's recent investor day, it's first as the new Agilent, management laid out a long-term organic revenue growth target of 5%. That's quite close to the 4%-5% target put forth by Thermo Fisher, but I think the company may find it harder to get there than the bulls believe. Agilent's largest and strongest markets (in terms of market share and company reputation) include food, environment, forensics, and academics - markets that I'm concerned will underwhelm in terms of their underlying growth (2% to 3% a year).On the other hand, I don't see the company enjoying quite the same strength in the faster-growing markets like pharma/biotech and clinical diagnostics. The recent ASMS meeting showcased a lot of progress from Bruker, Waters, Thermo, and Danaher in moving their mass spec (including MALDI) and LC-MS systems into clinical applications like pathology, high-throughput screening, proteomics, and non-invasive prenatal testing. Whereas Agilent is strong in areas like food and industrial applications, they are comparatively weaker in these clinical areas and I am concerned that Agilent will find it hard to break through.Along similar lines, I'm not sure what to make of Agilent's operating margin targets. I don't think that Agilent's 300bp improvement target is necessarily out of line or unreasonable, but the company is expecting to get about 60% of the improvement from volume-driven operating leverage. If the growth target proves overly ambitious, then, so too will the margin target. I do believe there are opportunities for Agilent to trim back its R&D and SG&A spending, though, and I like that the company exited its remaining NMR operations and sold its crystal XRD business to Rigaku rather than continuing to compete in suboptimal businesses.Filling The Gaps?In terms of life science tools, there aren't many gaps in Agilent's portfolio relative to Danaher, Waters, and Thermo. The company has a microarray business but not a sequencing business, and Thermo is the only real peer that still actively competes in sequencing. That said, management did say at a recent Goldman Sachs conference that it was looking into developing (or partnering to develop) a clinical next-gen sequencing system.If Agilent really believes that they need to be involved in sequencing, they are likely going to eventually have to turn to M&A. Likewise, I wonder if Agilent will need more M&A to support its diagnostics business. The company has made some progress in turning around Dako since its May 2012 acquisition, but I would argue that Danaher has done a better job with Beckman (though the businesses are different). My primary concern with Dako is that the world of advanced diagnostics is moving in a direction away from its traditional strengths and that the company will need to turn to M&A to fill in the emerging gaps.That has historically not been good news for Agilent shareholders as the company has not done a particularly good job of building on past M&A nor driving synergies between existing and acquired businesses. Generally speaking, though, I think Agilent is rather less likely to be an active player in the M&A space, as management's comments at the investor day and recent sell-side conferences seem to skew away from empire-building and toward internally-driven R&D innovation.On a more positive note, Agilent may also get a boost from government entities in filling its potential growth gaps. Between the EU's Horizon 2020 and the U.S. 21st Century Cures Act, governments are looking to increase government-funded R&D spending by billions and that should support a better underlying growth outlook for the academic/government market segment.The Bottom LineEven if I give management a lot of the benefits of the doubt regarding long-term financial goals, it looks like the Street has even higher expectations. A long-term revenue growth rate of close to 5% and a long-term FCF margin of 20% isn't enough to support today's price, let alone a higher target. That 20% FCF margin is a level that has been difficult to achieve (let alone surpass) in life science tools, and I think a low double-digit annualized FCF growth rate (which what the 5% revenue growth target and 20% FCF margin work out to) is pretty bullish.I think management is pursuing some solid, sensible goals for the new Agilent. I also think that the company's strong market presence in areas like chromatography, mass-spec, microarrays, pathology, and reagents do make for a strong whole, even if the company isn't as strong as I may like in certain markets. The issue at this point for me is valuation, and I think Agilent investors are already expecting quite a lot from a business that has some pretty significant competitors limiting just how far it can go with margins and market share."
3966978,91075,2016-04-21T11:53:09-04:00,Growing roster of new cancer related diagnostic products generating renewed interest in Agilent.Growing presence in the life sciences space makes Agilent more attractive to a potential acquirer.Emerging as a major player in the genomics and diagnostics field.Playing a key role fighting the war on cancer with advanced instrumentation and R&D.A potential acquisition candidate for Danaher and Thermo Fisher Scientific.,"By Charles KaplanFighting the war on cancer requires an advanced arsenal of treatments to destroy or inhibit tumors from metastasizing or spreading. The developmental and testing phase of drug development requires a diverse range of analytical instruments. Instruments that can identify complex drug compounds at the molecular level. Furthermore, oncologist are turning to genomics as a weapon in identifying malignant or benign tumors. Also, medical researchers trying to learning the secrets of how cancers trick our immune system are focusing on how gene mutations effect cell growth and death. Santa Clara- based Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) a leader in the life sciences space is providing much of the instrumentation, lab equipment, diagnostic and genomics testing equipment necessary in fighting the war on cancer. In a nutshell they are providing the bullets to fight this ignominious enemy.What makes this space so appealing?No doubt, this is an exciting time for the biotech space with cancer breakthroughs being announced on an almost daily basis. I consider this time as a ""golden age"" for research in this field. Recent developments in immunotherapy, genomics and improvements in conventional treatments like radiation, surgery and chemotherapy are all very encouraging. But fighting this disease will take many years of research and trials. However, companies like Agilent that supply the basic instruments used in the research process should be quite busy for years to come. Will cancer be cured in our life time? Most likely not, but it might become a more treatable disease that lets people live a normal life.When did the company go public?For those unfamiliar with Agilent Technologies, I would like to bring you up to speed. Company was formally a part of Hewlett Packard's (NYSE:HP) medical and test instruments business. In 1999 HP decided to restructure its operations by spinning off these businesses into an independent entity. Agilent went public in 1999 through an IPO raising $2.1 billion. The remaining shares were distributed to HP shareholders in 2000. During the remainder of the decade Agilent made a series of well timed acquisition in the medical instruments, genomics, laboratory equipment and life sciences field. Acquisitions included: Varian, OSI, Stratagene. On November 1, 2014 Agilent completed the spinoff of its electronic instruments business - Keysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) to its shareholders.Without Keysight Technologies, Agilent remains an attractive player in the fast growing biological and chemical testing space, making it more attractive as an acquisition target. Two major players in this space - Danaher (NYSE:DHR)and Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) are potential suitors as well as tough competitors.Presently, Agilent focuses on three key areas: life sciences and applied markets, diagnostics & genomics and CrossLab with each contributing 50%, 16% and 33% to net revenues in FY 2015, respectively. Serving such end markets as: pharma, chemical & energy, research, diagnostics, food and the environment. Revenue from each end market contribute 27%, 25%, 10%, 14%, 11%, and 13% to total fiscal revenues in FY 2015, respectively.Specifically what analytical instruments does the company produce and who are its customers?They produce: liquid and gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and atomic absorption instruments. Its instruments are used to purify, separate and analyze complex chemical compounds and are essential research tools used in drug development, food and water safety testing. The company had over 23,000 customers for its life sciences and applied products with no single customer amounting for a material part of net revenues. Customers include pharma, biotechnology companies, contract research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, as well as research institutions including academic institutions, privately funded organizations and large government institutes. The market size for its life science, diagnostic and applied market products is estimated at $45 billion with annual growth (OTC:CAGR) of roughly 5%.What types of diagnostic and genomics products does Agilent produce?According to the 10-K, the company produces routine clinical solutions for tissue based cancer diagnostics. This includes antibodies, reagents, instruments and software focusing on both primary and advanced cancer diagnostics. Its CoverStainer products target primary cancer diagnostics through a series of chemical biomarkers that identify carcinogenic tissue. Agilent is also developing diagnostic products that link protein and gene expression to cancer. Its products also include companion diagnostic tests that are used to help identify patients most likely to benefit from a specific targeted therapy. Furthermore as stated in its 10-K , ""Agilent is a leading provider of microarrays for Comparative Genomic Hybridization (""CGH""), mostly used by customers in cytogenetic laboratories. The arrays allow customers to detect genome-wide copy number alterations, with high levels of resolution (from entire chromosomal copy number changes to specific microdeletions or duplications)."" In addition to its microarrays, Agilent also markets a line of chemical reagents for sample processing, as well as specifically designed chemicals for uncovering DNA mutations stemming from gene expression.At latest count the company had approximately 14,000 customers for its diagnostics and genomics business. No single customer accounted for more than 5% of this business.What products does CrossLab produce?As described in its 10-K, ""Agilent offers a broad range of consumable products, which support its technology platforms, including sample preparation consumables such as solid phase extraction (""SPE"") and filtration products, self-manufactured GC and LC columns, chemical standards, and instrument replacement parts."" Its consumable products also include scientific instrument parts and supplies such as filters and fittings for GC systems; xenon lamps and cuvettes for UV-Vis-NIR, fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy.Currently, the had company had approximately 39,000 customers in fiscal 2015 with no single customer accounting for a material amount of the net revenue of this segment.How does Agilent stack up against its competitors?Company competes with such giants as Thermo Fisher Scientific and Danaher, much larger competitors. Its gross margin of 51% compares quite favorably to Thermo Fisher's 46% and on par with Danaher's 53%. Its profit and operating margins are on par with Thermo Fisher's but below the high-water mark set by Danaher at 16.33% and 17.79%, respectively. Its PEG ratio of 2.07 times is slightly higher than Thermo Fisher's 1.91 and Danaher's 1.73. Surprisingly enough all three life science companies have enterprise multiples of approximately16 times reflecting how efficient the market is in evaluating companies in this space. It appears all three are equally valued in terms of fundamental data. On a valuation basis using a DCF earnings model based on a 12% growth rate and Non-GAAP earnings of $2.20, its shares are selling at par. However, this calculation is only hypothetical and is subject to wide swings if economic conditions change.Yahoo FinanceHow healthy is Agilent's balance sheet?Company supports a sound balance sheet with $2 billion in cash and $1.6 billion in long term debt. Current assets are 3.7 times greater than current liabilities giving the company ample flexibility to fund its capital projects.How is FY 2016 shaping up?Fiscal 2016 is off to a strong start as reflected in Q1 results. Results for the Q1 of FY ended Jan. 31 showed solid growth as GAAP earnings for the quarter rose 32% to $0.37 per dilute share up from $0.28 per diluted share in the prior year's like quarter. Non-GAAP income from continuing operations equaled $0.46 per share for Q1. Management set Non-GAAP guidance for FY 2016 ending October 31 at $1.86 per share with estimated revenues for FY 2016 equaling $4.10-$4.12 billion. Next year's estimated earnings could climb 15% to $2.15 per share as pharma and biotech spending picks up, fueled by increased spending on drug research especially in such promising areas as immunotherapy and genomics.What are the risks?Agilent appears to be headed in the right direction with the possibility of it being a potential acquisition target sometime in the future. However, like all companies it is subject to both financial and business risk. Also it competes with some heavy weights in the life sciences space. Company is unsuitable for risk adverse investors and should be considered a long term investment. Diversification plays a critical role in all portfolios and is a highly recommended strategy for financial success. Concentrating a portfolio in one space or company is risky and negates the benefits from diversification.SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA(Unaudited)A data by YCharts"
3722976,89326,2015-12-01T04:38:49-05:00,"Agilent Technologies announced its 4QFY15 earnings on November 16 evening, following which the share price gained 3% the next trading day.The company performance remains on track in achieving its FY17 goal of 22% in adjusted operating margin.Based on its fundamentals, the stock is currently undervalued by 6% and is, therefore, poised for some handsome gains in the short-run.","Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) is a measurement company, providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the life sciences, diagnostics and genomics, chemical analysis, communications and electronics industries.Agilent's Q4 revenue of $1.04 billion contracted 1% over a year ago, up 6% on a core basis. The company's strong revenue growth was driven by a continued strength in the pharma, food, diagnostics, and clinical-end markets, and across all geographies. Company saw strong customer acceptance of its new instrument product introductions, and strength in its CrossLab services and consumables, diagnostics and genomics offerings. The company also experienced some US and state government big deal delays into Q1, and customers in industrial markets continued to take a cautious stance in light of weak commodity prices and uncertainties in the world economies. Adjusted operating margin, including the adjustment for Keysight billings, was 21.9%, expanding 150 basis points over a year ago, despite dis-synergies related to the Agilent/Keysight split and FX headwinds. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.50. This marks third consecutive quarter of significant year-over-year margin improvements, driven by the company's intense focus on growing its operating margin, as it seeks to achieve 22% margins by FY17.Moving on to the results by business group, the Life Science and Applied Markets group, or LSAG, as a reminder, brings together Agilent's analytical laboratory instruments and informatics. Core revenue growth of 2% was driven by strong performance in pharma and offset by weakness in industrial, academia, and government market. LSAG operating margin for the quarter was 20.0%, down 20 basis points from a year ago. The previously announced exit of the NMR hardware business continued to proceed as planned.Turning to capital deployment, as previously guided, Agilent aims to return $635 million in FY16 to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks, which is 59% higher than its capital returns of FY15. With respect to guidance, the company has reaffirmed its previous FY16 EPS guidance of $1.85 to $1.91, as the operating model of the new Agilent continues to drive profitable growth and margin expansion.Regarding guidance for the first-quarter, Agilent expects Q1 revenues of $1.00 billion to $1.02 billion, and EPS of $0.42 to $0.44. At midpoint, revenue will grow 3.5% on a core basis year-over-year. While the company did not repurchase any shares in Q4, the management intends to buyback this quarter subject to customary conditions.For the full fiscal year 2016, Agilent expects that revenue will grow 4.3% on a core basis, again excluding the impact of currency, NMR, and acquisitions and divestitures. Annual EPS guidance of $1.88 at midpoint is unchanged from previous guidance, due to additional savings, that compensated for slightly lower revenues. Adjusted operating margin for the year is expected to be 20.3%, or 70 basis points higher than last year.Financial Valuation:Here is an excerpt of the company's past performance. Every metric is presented in millions of dollars, except for percentages and ratios.Source: Company 10-KsHistorically, Agilent's sales growth trend has been volatile as years of major acquisitions e.g. 2010 and 2011 have been followed by weaker growth which reflects, to some extent, the high base effect of earlier years. Agilent's pricing power has remained stable over the past 6 years as indicated by its operating profit margins which have remained in the range of 10-16% during the period under consideration. Due to the volatile nature of company's sales growth, combined with one-off charges in some years, the company's net income growth has remained unstable as well. However, Agilent's return on equity (ROE) has suffered recently, falling from as high as 27% in 2011 to merely 10% in FY15. At the same time, effective controls on working capital has provided support to Agilent's cash flow over the years - note that cash flow from operations to net income ratio (CFO/net income) has improved from 1.05x in 2010 to 1.13x in FY15.The company's capital structure has also changed significantly, as its Total asset/total equity ratio has fallen from 3.00x in 2010 to 1.80x in 2015.The table below summarizes the projections until 2020.I have valued this stock based on free cash flow to equity (FCFE) basis, with valuation parameters presented below:By assuming terminal FCFE growth of 2.00% and applying discounted cash flow (NYSE:DCF) valuation method, the equity value comes out to be $14.71 billion, resulting in a target price of $44.40 per share, offering an upside of 6% from the last closing price of $41.97 per share. At the current market price, the stock is trading at 19.4x FY16 earnings, below our target P/E of 24.2x, which indicates an undervaluation.Conclusion:Agilent has underperformed the market, falling by 1.80% in last twelve months (as of 27th November close) compared to the S&P 500 Index which rose by 1.09% over the same period. This major underperformance has opened up valuations for this stock, and value driven investors should take up positions in this stock."
3453666,22775,2015-08-20T03:14:34-04:00,"Agilent’s top-line continues to disappoint due to FX and Chemical & Energy weakness.
        The risk remains on the downside going forward as oil remains extremely weak, China becomes a source of concern and order growth and book-to-bill were surprisingly poor in Q3.
        In the absence of significant EPS upside, M&A speculation could be a welcome catalyst. But Danaher, the most likely suitor, is unlikely to bid for Agilent in the near term.
        The stock is more a Hold than a Buy in the short term.","Ten months ago, we argued that the new Agilent (NYSE:A) offered a more defensive, less volatile profile following the Keysight (NYSE:KEYS) spinoff as its increased focus on life sciences, diagnostics and applied markets reduced exposure to macro-sensitive end markets (~30% vs. 70% previously) and came with a higher weight of recurring revenues in the mix (consumables and services now account for ~50% of group revenues).But while the company has been able in recent quarters to deliver in-line to slightly higher than expected earnings ($0.44 EPS vs a consensus of $0.41 in FQ3) and to maintain its FY15 EPS guidance despite significant FX headwinds, Agilent's top-line growth has been disappointing (mid single digit organic growth in the first nine months of FY15), leading to a FY sales guidance cut for the third consecutive quarter earlier this week (new range of $4.03-4.05bn from $4.05-4.11bn). The Pharma and Diagnostics divisions have been performing well but the Chemical & Energy business (26% of group revenues) has been under pressure (down 9% in Q3) as customers suffer from the oil price decline.With oil remaining extremely weak, China becoming a source of concern (while it has been a major growth driver in recent quarters, growing double digit in Q3), and Q3 order growth and book-to-bill being surprisingly poor (3% at constant FX and 0.93 respectively), we believe the top-line could continue to disappoint. The downside risk at the revenue level should be manageable at the bottom line level and Agilent's earnings outlook should not suffer much as the company's robust EPS momentum in recent quarters hints at the early success of its operational improvement measures and a higher-than-expected operating leverage.That said, we see no material EPS upside for the stock over coming years as the company's targets and consensus expectations are already quite aggressive (+300bps margin expansion by FY17, 5% revenue growth).Moreover, it looks like the margin improvement story is already priced in as Agilent is currently trading with a ~10% premium vs. peers in terms of 2015 and 2016 P/E and EV/EBITDA.In the absence of significant EPS upside, corporate action could be a welcome catalyst. In our recent articles, we commented that Agilent could be an attractive takeover candidate for larger life sciences tool companies such as Danaher (NYSE:DHR), with press reports last year suggesting that Danaher was considering a bid for Agilent.But such a scenario now appears highly unlikely in the short term as Danaher is busy splitting into two independent companies and integrating its recently-announced Pall (NASDAQ:PLL) acquisition (valued at $14bn).In conclusion, Agilent is likely to remain dead money for the rest of 2015 as we see no positive revenue/EPS surprise and as M&A speculation is unlikely to heat up before 2016. While Agilent is definitively an attractive company in light of its strong industry positioning and M&A appeal, the stock is probably more a Hold than a Buy in the short term."
3269355,44001,2015-06-19T01:14:44-04:00,"To me it means that Agilent is plowing back money into the company but may not have any other internal projects with a higher return on investment.
        The buyback is proposed to be up to $1.14 billion and will go through 2018.
        I believe the stock may be overvalued at this point and would rather see the money distributed as a dividend than dished out towards the buyback.","Not all share buybacks are created equal. Some are good and some are bad, I believe it all depends on how they've been funded. Some can be funded via free cash flow, retained earnings, and others can be funded by raising debt. By doing a share buyback a company can buy open shares from off the market whereby reducing the share count and making earnings per share move up and dividend payout ratios move down. When the earnings per share number increases typically stock prices follow. Usually shares are purchased when a company believes its shares are undervalued or the notion I like to believe is that when they have no better investment than investing in their own shares.When a company is making money they can either plowback the money into the company for projects which have the largest return on investments or return money back to the shareholders in the form of dividends. I consider share buybacks as a special type of project which tells me a company has exhausted all options for their already high return on investment projects and now it's time to focus on the ""company project"". Today I'd like to evaluate the share repurchase program which was recently announced by Agilent (NYSE:A) to the tune of $1.14 billion.The board announced that the repurchase program will be up to $1.14 billion for the common stock. The shares are expected to be reduced to 0.32 billion through 2018. Hypothetically if all the shares were to be purchased right now at the price of $39.90 approximately 0.28 billion shares could be bought back, leaving about 0.3 billion shares outstanding.Now I'm going to take the more difficult approach to determine what can happen with the capital appreciation of the stock by the end of the program. Assuming that the buyback amount is distributed evenly throughout the timeframe we get $0.28 billion of buybacks per year. If we use the initial estimate of $1.70 for 2015 earnings we can reverse calculate a net income number of $0.56 billion which we'll use later on to calculate the EPS at the end of 2015 if the shares were bought today. Approximately 7.1 million shares could be bought at today's price of $39.90 which would then reduce the total shares to 0.32 billion from the current 0.33 billion. Using the same net income number we calculated before we get an end of year 2015 EPS of $1.74. If Agilent were to operate in a vacuum from the rest of the market and if we used a P/E of 37.29 we'd get a stock price that's close to $64.78 by the end of the year.For 2016 I've assumed an earnings growth rate of 7.59% based on the initial 2015 EPS estimate of $1.70 to give me a 2016 EPS of $1.83. If I were to use the 0.32 billion shares at the end of 2015 and the EPS number I just calculated then I'd get a net income of $0.59 billion for the year. If in fact Agilent shares do end at $64.78 at the end of 2015 and the buyback was executed throughout the year then I would anticipate an end of year 2016 EPS of $1.85 for an ending stock price of $69.14 when using a P/E value of 37.29 to estimate the price.If we perform the same rigmarole for 2017 and 2018 I get end of year EPS values of $1.99 and $2.14, respectively. With this 2018 EPS estimate and using the same 37.29x earnings number I've been using we get an end of year price of $79.92 for the stock which constitutes capital appreciation to the tune of 100%. If I lower the P/E multiple to 20.26 to match the current forward looking P/E value we get an end of year stock price of $43.88 and capital appreciation of 10%. At the end of it all I get outstanding shares between 0.30 and 0.31 billion.What Does It All Mean?I believe 100% capital appreciation between now and the end of 2018 is a phenomenal return but will probably mimic the market. On the other hand if it only appreciates 10% then I wouldn't be too happy. However, as long as the company grows earnings by the 7.59% that I'm anticipating they can definitely increase the tiny dividend as well which means even more returns to shareholders. In my recent article on the company I stated, ""I'd like to see the company distribute some of that money right now to patient shareholders which have been dealing with a stagnating stock price."" I still believe that there is lots of cash on the balance sheet and that the dividend should be increased, but the stock may be overvalued and may actually only grow the 10% I calculated by 2018.Disclaimer: This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned. This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future.

3258745,44001,2015-06-15T10:01:03-04:00,I’d like to see the company distribute some of money on the balance sheet right now to patient shareholders which have been dealing with a stagnating stock price.The company recently declared a dividend which will be payable to shareholders towards the end of July.The dividend analysis shows stock value of $3.63 which makes the stock overvalued by about 91% from today's price of $39.84.,"A dividend is just one of many ways a company can reward its shareholders by paying them out in cash. The investor can then choose to take the cash and run, reinvest it in the company, or invest it in a different company. After a company has made their net income for the quarter they have the choice of what to do with it and the choices are usually to either plow the money back into the business for other investments or pay some of that money back to the shareholders in the form of a dividend.Most Recent DividendAgilent (NYSE:A) recently announced a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share with an ex-dividend of June 26th, making the must own date June 25th. The dividend is going to be payable to owners of the shares on July 22nd. The dividend is currently good for a 1% yield on today's share price of $39.84. Based on trailing earnings, the dividend is good for a payout ratio of 37% which is pretty low. From a free cash flow perspective the company has paid $0.15 billion in dividends over the past twelve months on free cash flow of $0.19 billion which isn't an ideal situation with a 79% payout ratio with respect to free cash flow.Potential For Future DividendsThe company doesn't have a good history of increasing its dividend over few years. Actually it started paying a dividend back in 2012 and was increasing it but recently reduced it because there was less income thanks to the Keysight spinoff (NYSE:KEYS). The company is projected to earn $1.70 per share in earnings for this year and if the payout ratio remains the same at 37% then I anticipate the company to distribute about $0.63 annually, or $0.1575 on a quarterly basis. I do believe the 37% payout ratio is sustainable for the long-term and anticipate an increase to around $0.63 annually. Earnings growth projections for the company are pretty mixed with a one year growth rate of 16.03% and five year growth rate of 4.4% so it wouldn't be surprising if increases to the dividend in the long-term are around the 4% range.Dividend ValuationNow let's get to the meat and potatoes, the dividend valuation model to determine a price that the stock should be at based on the dividend alone. The dividend growth model equation takes the form of:Where D is equivalent to the current dividend, R is the rate of return desired by the investor, and G is the anticipated growth rate of the dividend. For the D value I'm going to use the current dividend rate of $0.40. For the R value I'm going to look at the average return of the First Trust ISE Water Index Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:FIW) over the past five years because Agilent accounts for nearly 2.01% of the holding. The average annual return on the FIW has been 15.02% which is the number I'm going to use for the R value. For the G value of the equation I'm going to use the long-term dividend growth rate of 4% which I mentioned previously. When you plug and chug all the numbers you get a stock value of $3.63 which makes the stock overvalued by about 91% from today's price of $39.84.ConclusionThe dividend discount model is just one of many ways to value a company and should be taken into consideration while trying to evaluate a company. Assumptions are always made while using valuation models and I believe I've selected some of the most conservative criteria for the valuation in this article. Agilent is definitely a slow moving stock which I haven't bought in quite some time. The company has about 2.36 times the amount of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet right now compared to its current liabilities which means the company is hoarding quite a bit right now. I'd like to see the company distribute some of that money right now to patient shareholders which have been dealing with a stagnating stock price.Disclaimer: This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

3198466,22775,2015-05-20T07:39:40-04:00,"Despite weak revenue growth in the last two quarters, Agilent leaves unchanged its FY EPS guidance as the operating leverage appears better than expected.Agilent's earnings outlook appears rock solid, but is unlikely to offer significant upside.We view corporate action as the major catalyst.","For the second quarter in a row, Agilent (NYSE:A) delivered disappointing figures with Q2 revenue coming 3% below expectations and showing only 4.5% organic growth (vs. a consensus of 7.5%), leading to a slight EPS miss ($0.38 vs. $0.39).While Agilent blames logistics issues and shipping delays (that pushed $30m of revenue into the back half of FY15) and highlights order growth strength in the quarter (+8%), we would caution that the updated FY guidance ($4.05-4.11bn revenues from $4.06-4.12bn, unchanged $1.67-1.73 EPS) leaves little room for error as it implies a significant revenue growth acceleration in H2 (+8% after +5.8% in Q1 and +4.5% in Q2) while a couple of end markets are under pressure.Notably, Chemical & Energy revenues (26% of group revenues) were down 10% in the quarter as customers suffer from the oil price decline. That said, the Pharma and Diagnostics strength is likely to offset most of this Chemical & Energy weakness (as it did in Q2) and most geographies are expected to continue to perform well (Japan was the only weak spot in Q2). The significant traction seen in both Europe and Asia recently (+4% and +5% respectively in Q2, after +10% and +7% in Q1) is particularly encouraging.In addition, the company's ability to deliver roughly in-line EPS in the last two quarters despite weak revenues hints at a slightly higher-than-expected operating leverage. Excluding FX, we believe Agilent could have slightly raised its FY15 EPS guidance.In all, even if Agilent's earnings outlook appears rock solid, we continue to believe it does not offer significant upside over coming years as the company's targets are already quite aggressive (8% revenue growth in H2, +300bps margin expansion by FY17). Moreover, it looks like the margin improvement story is already priced in as Agilent is currently trading with a 10-15% premium vs. peers in terms of 2015 and 2016 P/E and EV/EBITDA.That being said, we stick to our view that corporate action could become again a major catalyst. We will probably have to wait until FY16 for a major acquisition as management recently commented that large M&A was not a priority in FY15. But if acquisitions are not a short-term catalyst, it's worth noting that Agilent could be an attractive takeover candidate for larger life sciences tool companies such as Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) and Danaher (NYSE:DHR). Recent press reports suggest Danaher has $12bn firepower and might consider a bid for Agilent. Should Agilent get an offer, the premium could be significant (20-30%) as the stock is currently trading at 3.4x 2015 sales, well below the ~4x multiple seen in recent deals.In conclusion, while we would not call the stock a Strong Buy, Agilent is definitively a Buy in light of its attractive industry positioning, defensive business model and M&A appeal."

The company's Q4 figures and FY15 guide perfectly illustrated this as most figures were in line with expectations (FY15 guidance is for EPS of $1.68-1.78 vs. a consensus of $1.74) despite a tough environment in Europe and Asia (66% of Agilent revenues). While Q4 was a solid but unsurprising quarter, we would highlight several positive developments that give confidence in Agilent's ability to reach and potentially exceed its FY15 guidance. First, order growth has been healthier than revenue growth recently (+5% vs. +3%) thanks to new product introductions in both life sciences and chemical analysis. Second, China has been improving with management commenting on the conference call ""what we saw happening in China was a return to levels of improved, albeit still subdued government spending"". These two factors suggest in our view that revenue growth could stand above 5% pretty soon. But admittedly, margins offer less upside as Agilent's target (+300bps margin expansion by FY17) is already quite aggressive.The only negative in this quarterly release was management's comment that large M&A was not a priority in FY15 (""So our focus right now for FY15 is not to pursue large M&A but really to focus on -- realize the potential of the acquisition we have made""). Indeed, we expected the company to go beyond the $500m cash returns to shareholders and make use of its whole financial resources to strengthen its position in life sciences tools at a time of rising industry consolidation. We will probably have to wait until FY16.That said, Agilent also could be an attractive take-out candidate for larger life sciences tool companies such as Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) and Danaher (NYSE:DHR). Recent press reports suggest Danaher has $12bn firepower and might consider a bid for Agilent. Should Agilent get an offer, the premium could be significant (20-30%) as the stock is currently trading at 3.1x 2015 sales, well below the ~4x multiple seen in recent deals.

2935426,22775,2015-02-20T11:08:36-05:00,"Agilent delivered in-line Q1 figures and fine-tuned its FY15 guidance in relation with FX headwinds.Excluding FX, Agilent could have raised its EPS guidance by 2-3%. Organic revenue growth and margins are healthy.The stock’s valuation does not offer significant upside, but we remain Buyers as corporate action could be a major catalyst.","FX has been a major headwind lately, leading Agilent (NYSE:A) to very slightly lower its FY targets earlier this week (revenue of $4.06B-$4.12B vs. $4.12B-$4.18B previously and EPS of $1.67-$1.73 vs. $1.68-$1.78). That said, we believe that Q1 trends at constant FX are encouraging and confirm our initial thoughts. Back in November, we argued that several positive developments (new product introductions in both life sciences and chemical analysis, improvement in China) suggested that revenue growth could stand above 5% pretty soon.And indeed, at constant FX, Agilent reported 5.8% organic revenue growth in the quarter, 1% above expectations, with significant traction in both Europe (+10%) and Asia (+7%), which account for 66% of group revenues. This performance in Asia gives credence to management comment that China has been improving (""what we saw happening in China was a return to levels of improved, albeit still subdued government spending""), while the robust growth across the company's end markets suggests Agilent has not been affected by any significant weakness in Chemical & Energy (26% of revenues) despite the oil price decline.We were also impressed by the company's ability to deliver in-line EPS in the quarter and to leave roughly unchanged its EPS guidance for the FY despite the above-mentioned FX headwind (400bps), hinting at a slightly higher-than-expected operating leverage. Excluding FX, we believe Agilent could have raised its EPS guidance by 2-3%.That said, we believe Agilent's margin outlook does not offer significant upside over coming years as the company's target (+300bps margin expansion by FY17, driven notably by the exit from low-margin businesses) is already quite aggressive. And importantly, it looks like this margin improvement is already priced in as Agilent is currently trading with a 10-15% premium vs. peers in terms of 2015 and 2016 P/E and EV/EBITDA.Hence, we reiterate that the stock price upside potential appears limited… unless corporate action becomes again a key part of the investment thesis. We will probably have to wait until FY16 for a major acquisition as management recently commented that large M&A was not a priority in FY15. But if acquisitions are not a short-term catalyst, it's worth noting that Agilent could be an attractive takeover candidate for larger life sciences tool companies such as Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO) and Danaher (NYSE:DHR). Recent press reports suggest Danaher has $12B firepower and might consider a bid for Agilent. Should Agilent get an offer, the premium could be significant (20-30%) as the stock is currently trading at 3.2x 2015 sales, well below the ~4x multiple seen in recent deals.In conclusion, while we would not call the stock a Strong Buy, Agilent is definitively a Buy in light of its attractive industry positioning, defensive business model and M&A appeal."
3190346,44001,2015-05-18T00:10:00-04:00,I'm anticipating earnings of $0.63 per share on revenue of $984 million.Analysts are expecting average earnings of $0.39 per share on revenue of $989.3 million.I'm optimistic that the company has found some streamlining initiatives since the spinoff to help reduce COGS quite a bit.,"As the first calendar quarter came to an end, we saw the technology sector of the market move up 3.68% as measured by the Nasdaq (NASDAQ:ONEQ) while the market overall was relatively flat (up 0.44%). Right now, I'd like to throw out an initial earnings analysis on Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) for their fiscal second quarter. The stock is a little behind the broader market for the year with Agilent sporting a 2.69% gain and the S&P 500 up 3.1%. I selected this stock for my Portfolio of Thirty back in June of 2014 because Covidien was bought out and I wanted to participate in the spinoff action that Agilent was providing at the time. I've been ambivalent with my purchase in the name as I'm up some 3% on my holding inclusive of reinvested dividends and dollar cost averaging, and the spinoff. I haven't been buying it lately because I don't want to increase my cost basis. With that said, I'd like to make my prediction for Agilent for the most recent quarter that the company will be announcing after the market closes on May 18th.I have revenue coming in at $984 million while the average analyst estimate for the quarter is $989.3 million with a low of $969.66 million. So I appear to be a bit pessimistic for the quarter on revenue than the average analyst. On a GAAP basis I'm predicting earnings to be $0.63 while the average estimate is calling for $0.39 with a high of $0.40. I may be way too optimistic on the company but I think they may report a surprise because of a decrease in COGS which I anticipate to take place because streamlining processes the company may continue to realize from the spinoff back in November.ConclusionFundamentally I believe the company to be fairly valued now on next year's earnings estimates and expensive on earnings growth expectations. Financially the company pays a tiny dividend with an small payout ratio on trailing earnings (33%) and average on free cash flow (54%) and the financial efficiency ratios are decent.We'll have to wait till the close of Monday to see what happens, but one thing is for sure, I won't be buying a batch in the name this week and probably won't continue to unless the fundamentals begin to change on earnings. I will only start to consider buying the stock if it drops to about $39.60 but that is a long ways away from happening I think. I like to be diversified with my Portfolio of Thirty and Agilent accounts for about 2.35% of the portfolio which makes it in the 8th smallest position.Disclaimer: This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

I selected this stock for my portfolio of thirty back in June of 2014 because I liked the prospect of the spin-off of Keysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) at the time and wanted a piece of the action. The stock has seen some tremendous volatility since that time and rightfully so as it carries a beta value of 1.55. But I believe the stock is going to continue to climb after taking a pounding recently. With that said I'd like to make my prediction for Agilent for the fiscal first quarter of 2015 that the company will be announcing on February 17, 2015 after the market closes.So you may notice that I have revenue to be far less than it was in the previous quarters, and that is because all the previous numbers include the electronic measurement revenue segment, which is now Keysight Technologies. The average analyst estimate for the quarter is $1.03 billion with a high of $1.06 billion. So I appear to be a bit optimistic for the quarter on revenue but on a GAAP basis I'm predicting earnings to be $0.10 which is a 43% increase from the previous quarter, which did include some earnings from the Keysight portion of the business.We'll have to wait and see what happens in a few days, but one thing is for sure, I'm not going to be buying any of the stock before the earnings report. I have already purchased quite a bit of it just the month before earnings and I'm hoping for the best. I actually anticipate it might dip and if it does I'll definitely evaluate picking up some more of it.Disclaimer: This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

However, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that looking at the price cannot be the sole factor in investment decisions, as the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits.

The Enterprising Investor, on the other hand, has no initial concerns as the company passes all of the investor type's requirements. As a result, all Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, Agilent Technologies has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $1.80 in 2011 to only an estimated $2.00 for 2015. This lack of demonstrated growth does not support the market's implied estimate for earnings growth of 6.28% over the next 7-10 years. Therefore, the model returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling below the current price, indicating the company is overvalued at the present time."

(NYSE:A) is one of four underperforming stocks in my portfolio since initiating a position in the name (down 0.96%). The last time I evaluated the name I stated that, ""The company is becoming more and more attractive to me as the spinoff approaches and management continues to create shareholder value, making me continue to buy the company."" Since the spinoff of Keysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) on November 3, 2014 the stock has increased in value by 0.98% and I've been buying shares every week while the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) is up 1.15%. Now I'd like to see what, if anything has happened after the analysis to see if now's the time to be buying more shares in the name is once again.The first bit of news since last writing about the company is that Keysight was spunoff. Keysight is the electronic test/measurement equipment unit which had $722 million worth of orders back in the fiscal third quarter. The next bit of what happened is that the company reported earnings after the market closed on November 17, 2014. The company reported fourth quarter earnings of $0.88 which missed analyst estimates by a penny. Revenues were reported at $1.81 billion which were in-line with expectations. Let's take a deeper look at how the company did.Segment revenues didn't have anything exciting going on but the company expects first quarter revenues to be between $1.02 billion and $1.04 billion which are pretty much flat from the recently announced quarter and in-line with estimates of $1.02 billion.The line items to notice were that total costs and expenses increased by 14% while income from operations decreased by 39%. Income before taxes decreased by 67% and net income decreased 92%. The company anticipates earnings of $0.39 to $0.43 for the fiscal first quarter versus expectations of $0.42.The company also announced to return $500 million during the 2015 fiscal year with $135 million going to dividends and $365 towards buybacks which will go as far as removing 2.7% from the float. Personally I would shift more of the returns towards the dividend because I feel the stock itself is fairly valued.

2690105,71215,2014-11-17T21:46:49-05:00,Agilent beat earnings expectations but narrowly missed sales expectations.The company stands to improve earnings and margins following the Keysight spin-off.Management posted next quarter and full-year guidance.I do not expect any major transactions in the next year.,"BackgroundOn November 17, 2014, Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: A) reported 4Q 2014 net income of $16 million ($0.05 per share GAAP, $0.88 adjusted) on sales of $1.81 billion compared to net income of $211 million ($0.64 per share GAAP) on sales of $1.72 billion in the same period in 2013. These numbers beat Estimize-reported consensus adjusted earnings estimates of $0.87 per share, but came just below sales estimates of $1.83 billion. These figures are based on a fully-diluted outstanding share count of 338 million in 2014 and 336 million in 2013.Key PointsGuidance1Q FY 2015Fiscal Year 2015What to look for next quarterPerformance of Keysight Technologies spin-offOn November 1, 2014, Agilent Technologies spun off Keysight Technologies, its electronics measurement business. The spin was done through a tax-free dividend to Agilent shareholders, who received one share of Keysight for every share of Agilent held. The separation reflects a change in Agilent's go-forward strategy, as it chooses to focus on its biological analytical solutions businesses. While this looks like a value-accretive play for Agilent, as it is divesting a lower-growth, lower-margin business, it will be very interesting to see how the spin-off manages to perform and is priced by the market.Additional spin offs in the future?Management did not discuss the possibility of spinning off businesses in the future in its most recent earnings call (or use the dreaded words, ""strategic alternatives""), but it's always something to look out for, especially as Agilent has so many assets at its disposal, and its history of such transactions.On October 14 the company announced that it is closing its Nuclear Magnetic Resonance business. While the press-release made it sound certain that the company was closing it for good, this may be seen by other companies as an invitation to purchase the division, or could possibly lead to a spin-off transaction.The company has divested assets through other means, such as the sale of its Medical Products business in 2001 (to Philips Medical Systems), and its Semiconductor Products Group. Agilent also spun off its semiconductor testing business to shareholders in 2006 as Verigy Ltd.Quick TakeI was impressed that management gave detailed guidance for the next quarter, and for the next full fiscal year. Management also detailed its expectations for cash repatriation, and even broke it down in terms of buybacks ($365 million in buybacks, $165 million in dividends). When management gives projections for sales and earnings, capital expenditures and the tax rate for the next quarter AND the full fiscal year, it's a good indication that management has a pretty well defined and detailed plan going forward, and that we shouldn't expect any surprises.While circumstances can change, I don't expect the company to do any major acquisitions or divestitures (i.e. spin-off or sales) of business units, but it is always a possibility, and circumstances can change. However, given the cash repatriation policy outlined by management, I expect the company to focus more on its operations.One caller asked about M&A opportunities in the near-term, and management stated that the company is not actively pursuing any major acquisition targets, which makes sense given that management was able to give us such detailed guidance.Since Agilent was spun off from Hewlett-Packard in 1999 (NYSE: HPQ), it has been a leader in life sciences products and diagnostic tools, but has also demonstrated some characteristics of a mature, steady-growth company. By divesting its lowest-growth businesses, the company stands to improve earnings going forward, but I don't expect any major transactions or risk taking by management in the near-term.Earnings webcast available from Seeking Alpha here. 8-K with financials and press release available here."
2678885,22775,2014-11-13T13:20:33-05:00,"The new Agilent offers a more defensive, less volatile profile.The margin outlook is healthy but already priced in.Additional corporate action (after the recent KeySight spin-off) will be key for the investment thesis.We expect Agilent to take part in the M&A game with an estimated $2-3bn takeover capacity or to turn into a target for the likes of Thermo Fisher and Danaher.","Now that the KeySight spin-off is effective, we believe it's time to have a fresh look at Agilent (NYSE:A). The company has become a pure player in life sciences, diagnostics and applied markets (chemical, energy, environment) and offers reduced exposure to macro-sensitive end markets (~30% vs. 70% previously) and increased exposure to recurring revenues (consumables and services account for ~50% of group revenues).Source: AgilentConsidering recent macro weakness in Europe and China/Asia (66% of Agilent revenues), Agilent's more defensive profile is likely to be a positive. That said, the company recently delivered below-consensus guidance for FY15 ($4.15bn revenue, roughly flat operating margin and $1.73 EPS) as Agilent factored in forex headwinds and ""dis-synergies"" from the Electronic Measurement spin-off.Beyond 2015, the outlook is more attractive as Agilent targets a 300bps margin expansion by FY17 driven by solid organic growth (5% is sustainable in our view) and various operational improvements (exit from low-margin businesses, reduction of dis-synergy costs).We believe this margin improvement is already priced in as Agilent is currently trading with a 10-15% premium vs. peers in terms of 2015 and 2016 P/E and EV/EBITDA. Considering that Agilent will be one of the most profitable companies in the industry by FY17, we see little scope for margin upside. Hence, the stock price upside potential appears limited, unless corporate action becomes again a key part of the investment thesis.As commented in our previous articles, the KeySight spin-off has increased Agilent's M&A power as the company can now use its whole financial resources to strengthen its position in life sciences tools at a time of rising industry consolidation. Large deals in the last 18 months include the pending acquisitions of Covidien (COV) and Nobel Biocare (OTCPK:NBHGY) by Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) and Danaher (NYSE:DHR), respectively, and the takeover of Life Technologies (NASDAQ:LIFE) by Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO). In view of its strong balance sheet (net debt close to 0), Agilent could clearly take part in the M&A game with a takeover capacity we estimate around $2-3bn.But Agilent also could be an attractive take-out candidate for larger life sciences tool companies such as Thermo Fisher and Danaher. Recent press reports suggest Danaher has $12bn firepower and might consider a bid for Agilent. Should Agilent get an offer, the premium could be significant (20-30%) as the stock is currently trading at 3.1x 2015 sales, well below the ~4x multiple seen in the above-mentioned deals.In conclusion, while we would not call the stock a Strong Buy, Agilent is definitively a buy in light of its attractive industry positioning, defensive business model and M&A appeal."
2633065,20411,2014-11-03T18:38:22-05:00,Agilent has not been growing for years.The Stock has been bid up due to stimulus.There are no fundamental reasons to own it at this time.,"Two years ago Agilent (NYSE:A) reported revenues that were in line with the recent revenue release in between there has not been any material internal growth, and as we would expect during that same time EPS growth has been dismal. In most cases revenues and EPS are directly correlated, and that seems to the case for Agilent. In one respect that is a concern because some investors like it when companies are able to grow earnings without growing revenues, but we consider that type of growth to be unsustainable.In fact, our EPS growth observations exclude one-time events so as to define growth from operations exclusively, and when we observe the growth from Agilent in recent years all we can possibly conclude is that growth has been virtually nonexistent.However, at almost the same time EPS growth stalled, which was the third quarter of 2012, the stock began to press higher. This clearly was not due to either revenue or EPS growth, but instead it was due to something else. It was due to multiple expansion. The PE multiple went from near 12 to near 20 during a time when EPS and Revenue hit a wall.The above observation is very important, and it tells us that the stock may have been a direct beneficiary of stimulus. That means the excess liquidity that was chasing stocks since the FOMC began its monthly bond buying program at the beginning of 2013 seems to have brought buyers to Agilent that were not so concerned with EPS or revenue growth. A clear rationale for this could be the money flow into S&P 500 index ETFs because that brings buyers for ALL stocks in the S&P 500 regardless of their growth rates.Summary:Our observations suggest that the no-growth environment that Agilent has experienced in recent years did not warrant the increase in stock price. The stock price was a direct beneficiary of excess liquidity in the financial system, and the multiple expansion that took place was not supported by anything other than more money chasing S&P 500 stocks. That poses serious risks for investors and we would absolutely avoid Agilent as a result."
2514675,44001,2014-09-23T09:10:57-04:00,"Agilent is going to pay a quarterly dividend with an ex-date of September 26, 2014.The company plans to spin off its electronic measurements subsidiary as a special dividend on November 1, 2014.The stock is fairly valued at the current time, but I love both companies going forward.","The last time I analyzed Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A) on June 19, 2014, I stated, ""This isn't the type company I would normally invest in, but because I believe the spin-off can provide lots of value, I decided to purchase it for the dividend portfolio."" Since the article was published the stock has decreased 2.9% versus the 1.9% gain the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) posted. Agilent is a measurement company providing bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries.On August 14, 2014, the company reported third quarter earnings of $0.78 per share, which beat the consensus of analysts' estimates by $0.04. In the past year the company's stock is up 10.35% excluding dividends (up 11.26% including dividends) and is losing to the S&P 500, which has gained 16.64% in the same time frame. Since initiating my position back on June 17, 2014, I'm down 1.72% inclusive of reinvested dividends and dollar cost averaging. With all this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to evaluate the stock to see if right now is a good time to purchase more for the healthcare sector of my dividend portfolio.FundamentalsThe company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 28.07, which is fairly priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 16.97 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. The 1-year PEG ratio (2.62), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is expensively priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 10.71%. Below is a comparison table of the fundamental metrics for the company for when I wrote all articles pertaining to the company.FinancialsOn a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. The company pays a dividend of 0.92% with a payout ratio of 26% of trailing 12-month earnings while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 6.5%, 12.6% and 10.2%, respectively, which are all respectable values. Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I don't believe the 0.92% yield of this company alone is good enough for me to take shelter in for the time being. Below is a comparison table of the financial metrics for when I wrote all articles pertaining to the company.TechnicalsLooking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock in middle-ground territory with a current value of 48.92. I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next. I see that the black line is below the red line with the divergence bars decreasing in height which tells me there is bearish momentum taking place. As for the stock price itself ($57.55), I'm looking at the 20-day simple moving average (currently $57.85) to act as resistance and the 50-day simple moving average (currently $57.02) to act as support for a risk/reward ratio which plays out to be -0.92% to 0.52%.Dividend and Separation AnnouncementAgilent recently announced a $0.132 per share quarterly dividend. This dividend accounts for a yield of 0.92% and has an ex-date of September 26, 2014 and pay date of October 22, 2014. I anticipate that the company will announce a dividend increase in the coming quarter which should have an ex-date of late December.In addition to the dividend the company has approved the spinoff of the electronic measurement subsidiary as a special dividend to current Agilent shareholders. According to the most recent quarterly earnings announcement, the electronic measurements business segment accounted for $757 million in revenues of the total $1.766 billion or 43%. I anticipate the price of the parent company to drop by about this much once the spinoff is executed.ConclusionAgilent isn't your typical dividend company, but I keep it in my dividend portfolio because I like break-up stories. Fundamentally, I believe the stock to be fairly valued on next year's earnings estimates and expensive on earnings growth potential, but 2015 earnings estimates have decreased by 0.6% since the last time I analyzed the stock. Financially, the dividend is tiny but has a lot of room to grow. On a technical basis the risk/reward ratio shows me more risk than reward but there appears to be some bearish momentum in the name. I like the company and will be purchasing a batch of the stock today.Because I swapped out Covidien (COV) for Agilent in my dividend portfolio, it is only fair that I provide an update from the swap-out date. From June 17, 2014, Agilent is down 1.32% while Covidien is up 4.25%, and the S&P 500 is up 2.92%. As of now it looks like I'm losing on this trade but I'm in it for the long haul.Disclaimer: This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

Agilent's more focused profile and improving momentum are likely to be rerating catalysts.","Agilent (NYSE:A) delivered a solid Q3, with both revenues ($1.77bn vs. consensus of $1.75bn) and EPS ($0.78 vs. consensus of $0.74) coming in ahead of expectations. Core Agilent (Life Sciences & Diagnostics) continued to perform well with revenues up 6% and orders up 9%, driven notably by increased government spending. And importantly, Keysight (the Electronic Measurement business), which had been a drag on Agilent's overall performances for a long time, delivered a healthy quarter with revenues up 8% and orders up 7% (first positive organic growth quarter since Q2 2012). Agilent tweaked its FY14 guidance and now expects revenue of $6.99-7.03bn and non-GAAP EPS of $3.04-3.08 (vs. $6.90-7.10bn and $2.96-3.16 previously).In our February article ""Agilent: High Level Of Confidence Heading Into Q1, FY14 Shaping Up Well"", we highlighted the potential of the Life Sciences & Diagnostics division. We expected academic research and government spending to recover in 2014 and to gradually improve the division's revenue momentum. Management's comments during the conference call and the acceleration in the division's order intake (+9% vs. +5% in Q2 and +2% in Q1) confirmed our view. In this article, we also called the recovery of the Electronic Measurement business. Our call came a bit early as Agilent reported a very disappointing performance in this business in Q1. But since then, the business has recovered with two consecutive quarters of solid order intake (+11% and +7% respectively in Q2 and Q3 thanks notably to strong base stations business in China and Europe), suggesting that Q1 was just a bump on the road to recovery.In all, we reiterate our positive view on the stock for three main reasons. First, the November spinoff of Keysight could be completed under favorable conditions for Agilent's shareholders, now that the division has been able to demonstrate an improving momentum. Second, Agilent's M&A power is about to increase as the company will soon have the opportunity to use its whole balance sheet to strengthen its position in Life Sciences (through M&A) at a time of rising industry consolidation. Third, Agilent's more focused profile is likely to be a re-rating catalyst for the stock which has been trading well below peers until now (EV/sales of 2.7x vs. a Tools average around 3.2x).Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2428345,41381,2014-08-15T18:05:02-04:00,"Agilent recently announced FQ3 EPS of $0.78/share which missed Street estimates by $0.04/share, and revenue of $1.77 billion beat estimates by a margin of $20 million.Recent trend behavior will improve during the second half of the year especially if both Agilent and Keysight can continue to deliver strong revenue growth over the next 6-12 months.If both Keysight and the new Agilent can demonstrate considerable growth in their respected areas of operation, meeting or exceeding full-year revenue estimates for FY14 should come as no surprise.","On Thursday, August 14, Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) reported the results of what I believe to be a very strong third quarter. The company's FQ3 EPS of $0.78/share beat Wall Street estimates by $0.04/share, while its revenue of $1.77 billion beat Wall Street estimates by an impressive $20 million.In the wake of the company's impressive third quarter, I wanted to examine several reasons behind my decision to consider a long-term position in this healthcare solutions play.Company OverviewHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, Agilent is a leader in life sciences, diagnostics and applied markets. The company provides laboratories worldwide with instruments, services, consumables, applications and expertise, enabling customers to gain the insights they seek.The scope of Agilent's business falls into six key market segments which include Food, Environmental and Forensics, Pharmaceutical, Diagnostics, Chemical and Energy, and lastly, Research.Recent Trend BehaviorOn Wednesday, shares of Agilent, which currently possess a market cap of $18.54 billion, a forward P/E ratio of 16.32, and a dividend yield of 0.95% ($0.53), settled at a price of $55.62/share. Based on a closing price of $55.62/share, shares of Agilent are trading 0.64% below their 20-day simple moving average, 2.66% below their 50-day simple moving average, and 0.51% above their 200-day simple moving average.Although these numbers indicate both a short-term and a long-term downtrend for the stock, which would normally translate into a selling mode for both near-term traders and many long-term investors, I strongly believe the company's recent earnings performance could be the first step in reversing the company's trend behavior.So what drove the company's results higher during the third quarter? According to Agilent's President and CEO Bill Sullivan, ""Agilent generated strong revenue and earnings this quarter, exceeding the high-end of our forecasted guidance and while delivering these solid results, both the Agilent and Keysight teams have done an outstanding job of executing the company separation to date which keeps things on pace for the formal separation to take place in early November.""It's pretty clear that the company's long-term growth will be heavily dependent on the continued developments that are related to its expected spin-off of Keysight Technologies that is scheduled for early November. With that said, I strongly believe the revenue growth of both the new Agilent (up 6% as compared to the year ago period) and Keysight (up 8% as compared to the year ago period) will be a key focal point for most long-term investors.If both companies can continue to demonstrate growth in such areas as Electronic Measurement (in the case of Keysight) and Applied Chemicals (in the case of the new Agilent) I see no reason why full-year revenues estimates for both 2014 and 2015 can't be met and/or exceeded.It should be noted that the company also demonstrated a 9% increase in its FQ3 reported orders (to $1.74 billion during the quarter) as well as a 7% increase in revenues (to $1.77 billion during the quarter). I strongly believe that if the growth in the company's reported orders carries over into FQ4, Agilent should have no problem in meeting Wall Street estimates, which are calling for the company to earn $0.94/share in terms of EPS and $1.83 billion in terms of revenue.ConclusionFor those of you who may be looking to establish a position in Agilent Technologies there are two key things to consider. For starters, shares of Agilent are trading at just over 26.3x earnings whereas the shares of both Bruker Corporation (NASDAQ:BRKR) (just under 40.3x) and PerkinElmer (NYSE:PKI) (just over 32.1x) were trading at much higher multiples, which therefore makes shares of Agilent comparably cheaper.The second of the two things we must consider is the company's upcoming spin-off of Keysight, which will focus on electronic measurement products, while the newer Agilent will focus on the life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets. On Sept. 19, 2013, Agilent announced plans to separate into two publicly traded companies through a U.S. tax-free spinoff of its electronic measurement business. Keysight is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of Agilent, with completion of the separation expected in early November 2014.If the long-term revenue growth of each of the post-spin-off entities mimics what we saw them demonstrate in the third quarter, there's a very good chance investors will be pleased with each individual entities' performance over the next several years.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2454555,57152,2014-08-27T12:04:09-04:00,"Agilent’s management expects revenue growth of 3.4% for full fiscal year 2014. The core revenue growth is projected to be 3.7% for the full year.The loss on early extinguishment of debt hurts Agilent Technologies’ net earnings and operating cash flows in the third quarter of FY 13.Overall, the debt reduction has improved the company’s financial stability by improving its debt-to-equity ratio and net cash position.The current economic situation in North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region suggests that Agilent Technologies will be able to generate even higher revenues in the next quarter.","Increased government spending on fixing environmental issues, life science research and forensics and the higher spending of the Chinese government on 4G research and development paved the way for Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) to generate higher revenues in the third quarter. The higher spending on food in the US and Europe, surging demand from mid-sized and specialty pharmaceutical companies along with some other factors resulted in positive sales growth for the company.The reported orders in this quarter went up 9% whereas the revenues went up 7% compared to the third quarter of the fiscal year. The sales growth was positive in all geographic segments. The highest growth of 11% was observed in Europe whereas the American and Asia Pacific regions reflected growth of 7% and 8% respectively.Source: Earnings PresentationThe economic conditions in these regions are improving so Agilent's revenues are anticipated to grow considerably in the next quarter as well. The Asia Pacific region, excluding Japan, is expected to show the highest growth. The countries in the East Asia Pacific region could help Agilent to expand its customer base. Unexpected growth in the U.S. labor market, consumers' willingness to spend more (according to the latest consumer index) and higher government spending on environmental issues makes the U.S. a strong revenue source for Agilent as well.Agilent's management expects revenue growth of 3.4% for full fiscal year 2014. The core revenue growth is projected to be 3.7% for the full year.Operational HighlightsLike the revenue growth, Agilent's operating profits, in all three product segments, also improved in this quarter due to higher revenue and better margins. The operating profits in the Life Sciences, Diagnostics and Applied Markets segments jumped 9.2%, the EMG segment's operating profits reflected an improvement of 15.5% whereas the LDG segment's profits went up by 2.2%.Agilent Technologies has increased its research and development costs and its selling, general and administrative expenses have also increased in this quarter compared to the figures reported in the third quarter of FY13. The company's year-over-year income from operations declined 3% in the quarter. Operating margin was down by approximately 150 basis points.Besides the lower operating profit, the factor that significantly hurt Agilent's net earnings was the loss on early extinguishment of debt. Net earnings were down by 13% year-over-year. However, per share earnings in this quarter were the same compared to Q3FY13's per share earnings after adjustments for the non-recurring loss on debt retirement.Despite lower net profits, Agilent raised its year-over-year cash dividends by 10% to 13.2 cents per share.Debt Profile and Liquidity PositionThe management at Agilent Technologies is putting great efforts into improving the company's debt profile by reducing its debt. In the first three quarters of FY14 the company has shed debt worth $483 million. Now the total debt stands at $2,216 million compared to $2,699 million at the end of FY13. Its debt-to-equity ratio in this period has improved significantly reaching 0.393 compared to 0.511 at the end of the last fiscal year. Even if we compare the company's figures to the industry average the ratio is quite impressive as the industry currently has an average ratio of 0.62.In the last quarter Agilent Technologies also announced it would redeem all of its outstanding 5.5% senior notes that were due in September 2015. The aggregate principal amount of the notes currently outstanding is $500 million. The redemption price is equal to the sum of the principal amount. The redemption would save $27.5 million worth of interest payments on these notes, consequently improving Agilent's profit margin, and would further improve its debt-to-equity ratio.The healthier debt profile, as a result of the company's debt reduction plans, would expand its future operating cash flows and decrease its vulnerability to any downturn in the business, competitive pressures and any adverse economic or industry conditions. The higher operating cash flows would increase the chances of higher returns to investors in the form of dividends and share buybacks.However, the extinguishment of debt squeezed Agilent's net income and cash from operations in the third quarter. Net loss on extinguishment of debt measured for the quarter was $21 million, or 6 cents per share. The operating cash flows in this quarter were only $28 million compared to $215 million in the third quarter of FY13 mainly as a result of lower net income and charges on early extinguishment of debt.However, Agilent's net cash (cash minus debt) is $211 million in this quarter compared to the negative net cash of $315 million in the third quarter of FY13 indicating the company's ability to easily pay off its other obligations even after paying its debt. Despite lower operating cash flows in this quarter its current ratio of 3.06 is considerably better than the industry average of 1.27 reflecting its strong liquidity position.Final ThoughtsAlthough Agilent's net earnings and operating cash flows were down in the quarter, the adverse effect was only due to the non-recurring loss of early debt retirement. If the company improves its operating margin then the next quarters could bring handsome profits for the company as the current economic situation appears and is expected to bring good revenue growth. The debt reduction also improved its financial stability as the debt-to-equity ratio and net cash position have both improved. The debt reduction would also help to generate better profits by reducing interest expenses.Therefore, based on this optimistic scenario I suggest investing in this stock because it also reflects upside potential based on its price-to-earnings multiple. Currently, it has a P/E of 27.55 compared to the industry average of 34.25."

Agilent will now be entirely focused on the life sciences, diagnostics and chemical analysis businesses. Its life science business focuses on the pharmaceutical, government, bio-agriculture, biotechnology, and contract research organizations. Key product categories include: liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry, laboratory software, nucleic acid solutions, magnetic resonance imaging and X-ray diffraction systems. Agilent's chemical analysis business focuses on instruments, consumables, and services that enable customers to identify, quantify, and analyze physical and biological properties of substances and products. The new pro forma stand alone revenue for the nine months ending July 2014 are shown below.Source: Author Graph Utilizing Agilent FinancialsNumerous Risks in FY15:Operating Margins Likely To Take Longer than expected: Agilent guided it is targeting operating margins to 22%-23% over time from the current 19% level. We believe these cost savings are likely to take longer than expected, with most of improvement not likely to occur until closer to 2017, hindering investor returns over the next twelve months. Source: Management PresentationWhat Would An Acquisition Multiple Be In Our View?: A lot of speculation has been made about Agilent being a life science tools acquisition target post its spin-off. We examined some of the recent transactions in the sector to better understand how much an acquisition would value the business from an EV/Revenue perspective. The enterprise value to revenue median of 3.9X is a good premium to where the company is likely to trade on a stand alone basis, thus an acquisition would produce a strong investor return. However, the company overlaps with likely Acquirers such as Danaher in many of its product offerings, thus an acquisition is not widely anticipated by the street.Source: Author AnalysisOur Valuation: For FY 14, the company has guided for revenue of roughly $4.08 billion. We are projecting growth of roughly 4% top line in 2015, yielding $4.25 billion in revenue. Using the median enterprise value to revenue multiple of the peer group we obtain a price target of $43.Source: Author AnalysisConclusion: We view Agilent's capital allocation strategy to return 45% of free cash flow over the next three years as a large positive for investors. However, 2015 appears to be a transition year with dis-synergies and Keysight service level agreements. Because of this, we are not compelled to purchase shares, but at the same time, cannot initiate any type of short position given the company's great capital allocation and the strong industry growth trends."
2589035,44001,2014-10-23T12:23:36-04:00,The company recently announced it was closing its NMR business which will boost operating profits by $10 million next year.The spinoff of the electric test/measurement business is still set for early November.The stock is fairly valued based on 2015 earnings estimates.,"The last time I analyzed Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A) on September 23, 2014, I stated, ""I like the company and will be purchasing a batch of the stock today."" Since the article was published, the stock has decreased 6.05% versus the 1.86% drop the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) posted. I've been buying shares along the way because it is in the speculation portion of my portfolio and want it for the spinoff action. Agilent is a measurement company providing bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries.On August 14, 2014, the company reported third quarter earnings of $0.78 per share, which beat the consensus of analysts' estimates by $0.04 and will report earnings on November 17, 2014. In the past year the company's stock is up 6.75% excluding dividends (up 7.43% including dividends) and is losing to the S&P 500, which has gained 12.07% in the same time frame. Since initiating my position back on June 17, 2014, I'm down 7.02% inclusive of reinvested dividends and dollar cost averaging. With all this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to evaluate the stock to see if right now is a good time to purchase more for the healthcare sector of my portfolio.FundamentalsThe company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 25.88, which is fairly priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 15.81 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. The 1-year PEG ratio (2.67), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is expensively priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 9.68%. Below is a comparison table of the fundamental metrics for the company for when I wrote all articles pertaining to the company.FinancialsOn a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. The company pays a dividend of 1% with a payout ratio of 26% of trailing 12-month earnings while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 6.5%, 12.6% and 10.2%, respectively, which are all respectable values. Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I don't believe the 1% yield of this company alone is good enough for me to take shelter in for the time being. Below is a comparison table of the financial metrics for when I wrote all articles pertaining to the company.TechnicalsLooking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock in middle-ground territory with a current value of 43.65. I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next. I see that the black line is below the red line with the divergence bars flattening in height which tells me the bearish momentum is turning bullish. As for the stock price itself ($53.99), I'm looking at the 50-day simple moving average (currently $56.14) to act as resistance and $51.14 to act as support for a risk/reward ratio which plays out to be -5.28% to 3.98%.Shedding The WeightIn addition to the company spinning off the electronic test/measurement portion of the business, it will be cutting 300 jobs and shuttering its nuclear magnetic resonance equipment business. The extinction of the business will result in a $72 million charge for the company and the shutdown is expected to lower fiscal 2015 revenues by $20 million to $30 million. However, operating profits are expected to increase by $10 million for fiscal 2015.ConclusionIt's never good to hear about job cuts from a humane perspective, but that's the nature of business. Fundamentally I believe the company to be fairly valued on next year's earnings estimates while expensively valued on earnings growth potential. Financially, the dividend is tiny but can grow quite a bit. On a technical basis the risk/reward ratio shows me there is more risk than reward right now. The company is becoming more and more attractive to me as the spinoff approaches and management continues to create shareholder value, making me continue to buy the company.Disclaimer: This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned. This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future.

2547095,45691,2014-10-07T16:44:05-04:00,"Agilent's spin-off of Keysight will lead to a significant decline in top line, which will reduce it to a lightweight company relative to its initial revenue potential.Shares of Agilent Technologies have fallen since advancing following the announcement of FQ3 results and have since failed to recover significantly.Agilent plans to resize its burgeoning debt of $2.22B by redeeming $500M of the outstanding $600M 6.5% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017, thereby easing its leverage and loan interest.The resizing of the company's debt will improve net margins and help channel more income to shareholders.","Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A), the Santa Clara, California-based Medical Laboratories and Research company is expected to complete the spin-off of its semiconductor measurements unit - Keysight Technologies (KEYS) - by November 3, 2014.Since making the announcement, the bio-analytical & electronic measurement solutions and services provider has received reasonable coverage by market enthusiasts with some expressing their bullish outlook following the announcement of 13.2 cents per share dividend payable on October 22, to shareholders of record date September 20.This announcement came following a solid Fiscal Q3 results, which saw the company report an EPS of $0.78 per share, which overwhelmingly beat analyst estimates. The most notable negative was that the company issued a weak guidance, which could also have limited its chances of advancing further.Nonetheless, investors responded positively to the news of impressive earnings rallying the stock to a high of $58.93 per share on August 15 compared to the previous day's close of $55.49. However, the share price has since dropped to about $56.90.Chart Via QuantShare.ComNow based on the current price levels, it appears as though investors are treading with caution as we approach the time for the completion of the spin-off.Notice that only Agilent shareholders of record date October 22, will be eligible for allocation of one share of Keysight for every two Agilent shares held. The distribution is set to be done on November 1, 2014 according to the company's press release.Investors seem to be coy over the post spin-off performance of Agilent. This could be primarily because the company is slimming up into a lightweight player by letting go one of its biggest business units. After the Spin-off, Keysight will boast a work force of not less than 9,500 employees and will be operational in 30 countries.Currently, the 15-year old Agilent Technologies boasts 21,200 employees (Keysight included). Therefore, the company is almost splitting in half (based on workforce).Additionally, Keysight reported a revenue of $2.9 billion for the last Fiscal year ended October 31, 2013. This represented a significant drop from the previous two years (2012 and 2011) which registered $3.3 billion in revenue each.Now overall, Agilent (including sales from Keysight) generated $6.782 billion worth of revenue last year, a slight drop from 2012's $6.858 billion, and a significant improvement from $6.615 billion reported in 2011.This means that the company will be losing a significant chunk of revenue, close to 43% - based on last year's results following the spin-off of Keysight Technologies.However, on a positive note, it is quite clear that over the last two years, Keysight has failed to keep pace with Agilent in terms of revenue growth. Between 2011 and 2012, Keysight added zero revenues, while Agilent added more than $200 million, and last year, Keysight revenue fell by $400 million while Agilent's revenue grew by more than $300 million.Therefore, Agilent is spinning off a business unit that has been slowing its overall growth over the last two years in a bid to concentrate on its well performing business. This is why the idea of becoming lightweight makes sense.Additionally, Agilent has revealed that it plans to resize its burgeoning debt of $2.22 billion by redeeming $500M of the $600M 6.5% outstanding Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2017. The redemption is set to take place on October 20, this year.This will ease its leverage position and loan interest burden ahead of what appears to be a period of heavy investment in core business.With revenue declining due to the spin-off of Keysight Technologies, Agilent would be under pressure to maintain attractive margins that will help channel more income to shareholders.ConclusionAgilent Technologies appears to be slimming up to a lightweight player. However, based on Keysight's recent performances, as well as, the possibility of resizing the current debt, this makes Agilent more attractive.The company can now concentrate on its well performing business, strengthen it, and channel more income to shareholders. This is what makes me fancy the stock going forward."

(NYSE:A), a measurement company that provides core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to various industries, has recently announced its Q2 FY 2014 results. The company disclosed a mixed performance in Q2 FY 2014 while the organization is in the process of restructuring itself. In this article, we will discuss an overview of the company's performance in Q2 FY 2014. Additionally, I will also discuss updates on the company's on-going restructuring program and recent developments in the company's products.Mixed Results in Q2 FY 2014Source: Q2 Fiscal Year 2014 Results PresentationAgilent Technologies reported revenues of around $1,731 million in Q2 FY 2014, slightly above the consensus estimate of $1,730 million. On the other hand, the company's revenue of $1731 million in Q2 FY 2014 was down around 0.1% in comparison to Q2 FY 2013 (see graphs above). The company reported 7% higher orders ($1.81 billion) in Q2 FY 2014, in comparison to orders of $1.69 billion in Q2 FY 2013 (see charts above). The company reported revenue growth in all of its segments, with the exception of its electronic measurement group ""EMG"" segment. The EMG segment, that is planned to be spun off from Agilent Technologies, recorded a 2.2% fall in its revenues in Q2 FY 2014 compared to Q2 FY 2013 (see table below).Source: Yahoo FinanceThe company's chemical analysis group's ""CAG"" revenues were up 2.5% in Q2 FY 2014 in comparison to Q2 FY 2013, led by growth in the food and energy markets. The company's life sciences and diagnostics group's revenues were up 1.1% in the recently reported quarter compared to Q2 FY 2013, led by the pharmaceutical and diagnostics/clinical markets.Source: Q2 Fiscal Year 2014 Results PresentationAs far as Agilent Technologies' bottom line is concerned, the company posted an EPS of $0.72 in Q2 FY 2014 that was just $0.01 down from analysts' estimates of $0.73. During the same quarter in the previous year, Agilent Technologies posted an EPS of $0.77 (see graph above). The company's net income dropped 10% in Q2 FY 2014 in comparison to its net income in Q2 FY 2013. This was because the company's results were hit by costs related to the planned spin-off of its electronic measurement business. The company recorded pre-separation costs of $41 million, and integration and transformation costs of $10 million in Q2 FY 2014.Electronic Measurement Business Spin-offOn September 19th, 2013, Agilent Technologies declared its plans to split into two publicly traded companies. One of these companies would consist of the life sciences, diagnostics, and chemical analysis businesses (LDA), and would retain the Agilent Technologies' name. The other company would consist of the company's current portfolio of electronic measurement products (see pie charts below). The separation into two entities is expected to occur through a tax-free pro rata spin-off of the electronic measurement company to Agilent Technologies' shareholders. The spin-off is anticipated to be concluded in early November 2014. The company has projected it would incur pre-separation expenses of $100 million in FY 2014. The separated business will be named Keysight Technologies, and is expected to trade as a common stock on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol KEYS.Source: A Separation PresentationAgilent Technologies hopes to create two strong companies through this spin-off, as Agilent Technologies will then be able to improve its performance by focusing more on its growing segments. This action of the company will escalate the strategic flexibility of both standalone businesses. Electronic measurement is a more cyclical business, while LDA holds high growth potential. Hence, by separating its electronic measurement business, the company is reducing its exposure to the cyclical electronic measurement industry. Agilent Technologies expects its core revenue growth to reach 6% (see table below) in FY 2015, as the spin-off will be concluded by the end of FY 2014.Source: An Analyst Meeting 2014 PresentationRecent Events Overview: New SureDirect Blood PCR KitAgilent Technologies recently launched a new Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) Kit known as SureDirect Blood PCR Kit. This kit will allow amplification of DNA directly from blood and blood derivatives, without the requisite for nucleic acid extraction and isolation. The new kit will simplify the DNA amplification workflow and will reduce the turnaround time, as it will allow PCR from fresh, dried, and frozen blood. It will also enable PCR from serum and plasma from human and animal samples.The SureDirect Blood PCR kit contains Agilent Technologies' latest innovation DMSO, which is the inhibitor-resistant polymerase. It also has positive control template and primers. The polymerase provides the ability to overcome anti-coagulant and blood PCR inhibition, as a result of which DNA target amplification becomes easier and quicker. The kit will provide researchers with greater flexibility in experimental design, and is made to serve the international research community.The global human identification market, the market related to DNA testing, was valued at $419.4 million in 2013. Looking forward, the global human identification market is projected to reach a value of $804.0 million by 2018, growing at a CAGR of 13.9% between 2013 and 2018. Government support in the form of grants and funds and the need for new technology in order to reduce time and costs related to DNA analysis will drive the growth of the global human identification market in the coming years. These factors indicate the fact that Agilent Technologies' launch to SureDirect is in line with the growth trends for the human identification market. SureDirect will add to Agilent Technologies' genomics and diagnostics portfolio. Agilent Technologies expects its genomics and diagnostics segment will generate 17% of the company's total revenue in the coming periods.Expectations, Price Targets, and Final TakeThe company has recently updated its earnings guidance for FY 2014. Agilent Technologies is projected to record revenues of $6.9-$7.1 billion in FY 2014, compared to the consensus estimate of $6.98 billion. The company has a guidance that targets an EPS of $2.96-$3.16 in FY 2014, compared to the consensus estimate of $3.08.Analysts at Zacks recently restated a neutral rating on shares of Agilent Technologies. They now have a $60 price target on the stock, while the stock is currently trading at around $54.97. The analysts at Jefferies Group have reaffirmed a buy rating on shares of Agilent Technologies, with a $66 price target on the stock. Overall, the company currently has a consensus rating of buy and a consensus target price of $60.38.The company disclosed mixed financial results in Q2 FY 2014, as both the company's revenue and earnings were just close to the consensus estimates, but down compared to Q2 FY 2013. The costs related to the planned spin-off of the company's electronic measurement business by the end of FY 2014 negatively impacted the company's bottom line in Q2 FY 2014. The company's electronic measurement segment was the only one among the company's segments that reported negative growth in its revenue in Q2 FY 2014 in comparison to Q2 FY 2013. By spinning off this segment, the company expects to focus on high-growth areas and improve its financial position and performance. The company has also recently launched a PCR kit that incorporates advanced methodology to serve the growing human identification market. The price targets set by various analysts on the company's stock indicate handsome upside potential from its current share price, also making the stock a worthwhile investment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a Gemstone Equity Research research analyst.

(NYSE:A) and try to explain to investors the reasons this is an apparently appealing investment opportunity.The Largest DealIn 2012, Agilent completed the acquisition of Denmark-based Dako. This company provides antibodies, reagents, scientific instruments and software primarily to pathology laboratories for cancer diagnostics. In a rapidly growing diagnostics market, Dako manages to provide new offerings. It recently announced the addition of two new antibodies, Anti-CK 8/18 and Anti-TdT.Other Notable AdvancesDays ago, and with the aim of leading the technology exploration of next-generation wireless communication systems, Agilent made an agreement to collaborate with China Mobile Communications Co. Ltd. Research Institute (CMRI) on the next-generation 5G wireless communication systems.Over the current month, it introduced a family of basic AC power sources that deliver stable, reliable power for testing electronic devices during design and manufacturing. The new Agilent AC6800 Series includes four models from 500 to 4,000 VA output power, all with the quality and capability required for basic testing. Additionally, it announced the M9099 Waveform Creator 2.0, providing new capabilities for engineers working on the development of radars, satellite communications, military radios and the next generation of DOCSIS 3.1 cable modems.Spin-OffLast year, Agilent said it will spin off its electronic measurement (EM) business as a separate publicly traded company to be named Keysight Technologies. The separation is expected to occur through a tax-free pro rata spin-off of the EM company to shareholders. The spin-off, subject to necessary approvals, is expected to be completed by November 2014. But why is it important? Several benefits can be highlighted, such as greater focus on the business and the reduction of exposure to the cyclical EM industry. ""Agilent has evolved into two distinct investment and business opportunities, and we are creating two separate and strategically focused enterprises to allow each to maximize its growth and success,"" said William (Bill) Sullivan, Agilent president and CEO.Relative Valuation, Earnings and ROEAgilent's stock had its ""Hold"" rating, but continues to be one of the best investments from a valuation standpoint, trading at a 25 P/E. That's a discount compared to the industry mean (36x), which indicates that other companies operating in the same sub-industry are much more richly valued. Some of its major competitors include Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. (NYSE:TMO), Waters Corporation (NYSE:WAT), PerkinElmer Inc. (NYSE:PKI), Bruker Corporation (NASDAQ:BRKR), Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:BIO), Illumina Inc. (NASDAQ:ILMN), National Instruments (NASDAQ:NATI), Pall Corp (NASDAQ:PLL), Haemonetics (NYSE:HAE) and Trimble Navigation (NASDAQ:TRMB).The following table compares the current valuations:The company looks attractively valued, looking back at the trailing ratio. With respect to earnings per share (EPS), Agilent has decreased them by 14.5% in the second quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. Agilent President and CEO Bill Sullivan said, ""We delivered on our commitments this past quarter with solid order growth, and revenues and earnings in the mid-range of our forecast guidance. Looking ahead, we are well positioned as we move into the second half."" With respect to future revenues, third-quarter 2014 revenues are expected to be in the range of $1.74 billion to $1.76 billion, a billion more than the past quarter. The consensus for EPS is $73.59 for the third quarter and $93.85 for the fourth quarter.In the next table, we can appreciate Agilent's earnings estimates based on Wall Street analysts' analysis. These estimates are used as a benchmark to measure a firm's performance relative to how experts expected it would do. A good candidate for investment might be a company with five years of solid earnings growth and strong earnings growth estimates for the coming years (at least two years).Comparing actual earnings to analyst estimates is also helpful. An earnings surprise can move a company's stock price.In the next chart, we can appreciate a very interesting upward trend in the last five years. Year-to-date, Agilent's stock has a very nice gain in the past year of 35%.Furthermore, we can see that Agilent has the best price performance among peers during a five-year period.Finally, I always like to see one of the most important financial ratios applying to stockholders, the best measure of performance for a firm's management: the return on equity. The ratio has decreased from the same quarter one year prior. This is a clear sign of weaknesses within the company.Let's compare the current ratio with the peer group in the next table:Agilent has a ratio of 13%, which is higher than the industry mean. The ROE has averaged about 14% during the past 13 years. We believe that a ROE greater than 30% is quite enough to provide dividends to owners and have enough funds for future growth of the company. So, for investors looking for this level of ROE, Mettler Toledo International (NYSE:MTD) and Rockwell (NYSE:ROK) could be options.Final CommentThe separation into two industry-leading public companies and the acquisition of attractive Dako's products, which complement Agilent's existing diagnostics offerings, are all reasons that make me feel bullish on this stock in an industry with a positive outlook due to technology advances and sophisticated research. According to the P/E ratio and the mean comparison, it is better for investors, as there are chances of higher appreciation. Because the stock market is forward-looking, stock prices are established based on the expectations that investors have for the future earnings power of the firm. A proxy for the market's expectations is analysts' consensus earnings estimates, which we see are starting to increase their predictions in the upcoming future.Its stock price performance growth over the past five years was the highest among peers, and actual price levels may be indicating a good buy at this moment. According to The Financial Times, the share price forecast is based on 10 analysts offering 12-month price targets. They have a median target of $64.50, with a high estimate of $67.00 and a low estimate of $58.00. The median estimate represents a 13.36% increase from the last price of $56.90. Additionally, the majority of analysts rate Agilent as a buy, which makes me feel more comfortable.I would recommend investors to consider adding the stock for their long-term portfolios. Hedge fund gurus have also been active in the company in the first quarter of 2014. Gurus like Paul Tudor Jones, David Dreman, Steven Cohen and Signature Select Canadian Fund have taken long positions on it.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Core Agilent (Life Sciences & Diagnostics) continues to perform well with revenues up 6% despite still weak government spending. And financial discipline remains a major earnings driver as illustrated by the 17.6% operating margin reported in Q1, 50-60bps above consensus.But these positives were overshadowed once again by poor performances in the Electronic Measurement division (revenues down 5% in the quarter), leading Agilent to cut its FY revenue target to $6.90-7.10bn from $6.95-7.15bn and EPS guidance to $2.96-3.16 from $3.03-3.33.Contrary to our expectation, it looks like it's too early to call the recovery of the Electronic Measurement business as defense and communications verticals remain tough. Obviously, this suggests that the November spin-off of Electronic Measurement could be completed under less favorable conditions for Agilent's shareholders, even if the division still has a couple of months to demonstrate an improving momentum.The early March analyst day could be a positive catalystAgilent's analyst day in early March should provide the group with the opportunity to show off the potential of the Life Sciences & Diagnostics division. As we explained last week, the division's revenue momentum should gradually accelerate. Academic research spending is indeed expected to recover in 2014: the US congress recently released the 2014 budget in which the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the nation's medical research agency which provides research grants, would receive a +3.5% budget increase from FY13 levels.Management is also likely to highlight Agilent's increased flexibility following the Electronic Measurement spin-off: we believe that Agilent's M&A power is about to increase as the company will soon have the opportunity to use its whole balance sheet to strengthen its position in Life Sciences (through M&A) at a time of rising industry consolidation.Unchanged confidence in core Agilent's reratingAgilent's more focused profile is likely to be a rerating catalyst for the stock which has been trading well below peers until now. Agilent is currently trading at an EV/sales of 2.7x vs. a Tools average around 3.2x.Due to the scarcity of players in the Life Sciences Tools space, Agilent could also command a speculative premium in our view. The upside here would be significant given that Life Technologies (NASDAQ:LIFE) was acquired last year at an EV/sales of 4x and that Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN), widely perceived as a takeover target, is currently trading at a 11.7x ratio …Disclosure: I am long A.

2123683,23471,2014-04-03T14:11:22-04:00,,"Benjamin Graham taught that Intelligent Investors must do a thorough fundamental analysis of investment opportunities to determine their intrinsic value and inherent risk. This is best done by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries. What follows is a specific look at how Agilent Technologies fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.A data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 3/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 5/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - 1/31/2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryA Dividend data by YChartsConclusion:Agilent Technologies is a very intriguing company for Enterprising Investors, having passed all five of the investor type's requirements. The company does not quite qualify for the Defensive Investor due to the lack of earnings stability over the ten year period, short dividend history and the high PEmg and PB ratios. As a result, Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding with further research into the company but should also compare it to other opportunities through a review of 5 Low PEmg Companies for the Defensive Investor and 5 Low PEmg Companies for the Enterprising Investor. From a valuation perspective, the company looks significantly undervalued after having grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $1.42 in 2010 to an estimated $2.74 for 2014. This demonstrated level of growth outpaces the market's implied estimate of 6.02% earnings growth, and leads the ModernGraham valuation model to return an estimate of intrinsic value that is well above the market price.The next part of the analysis is up to individual investors, and requires discussion of the company's prospects. What do you think? What value would you put on Agilent Technologies? Where do you see the company going in the future? Is there a company you like better?

2276953,44001,2014-06-19T10:34:02-04:00,"Agilent is due to break itself up into two companies in November.I've been a part of a few breakup stocks, and they've done well against the broader market.The split will have one company carrying the life sciences business, while the other company keeps the electronics business.","Parting ways with things is usually a difficult thing to do, whether it's a girlfriend, your first car, or even your favorite foods when starting a diet. Almost always, subtracting that something from your life might end up being a good thing, because you end up learning that thing wasn't too good for you, allowing you to learn and grow from the experience, and that's what I'm going to focus on; the growth potential of Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A) in parting ways with one of its business units.Within the past couple of years, I have subscribed to this theory a few times, with the ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), Abbott (NYSE:ABT), Covidien (COV), National Oilwell Varco (NYSE:NOV) and News Corp. (NASDAQ:NWSA) breakups. In the Conoco breakup, you got shares of Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX), Conoco retaining the upstream portions of the oil business and Phillips 66 keeping the downstream portions. From this breakup, COP itself is up 58.44% (excluding dividends), but PSX is up 147.72% (also excluding dividends)! In the ABT scenario, you received shares in AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), AbbVie maintaining the legacy pharma business and Abbott holding onto the nutritional/medical device segments. The list just keeps going; take a look at the table below, which shows the massive gains in the portion of the company that spun off from the parent company, when compared to the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY).I found a pretty cool site that I've been utilizing, which shows all the upcoming spin-offs, to try and pick up some other potential winners like the examples above. One company I like is Agilent. Agilent is a measurement company providing bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the communications, electronics, life sciences and chemical analysis industries. The company plans to create two publicly traded companies; one in the life sciences, diagnostics and applied markets, which will keep the Agilent name, while the second company will keep all the electronic measurement products and take on the name Keysight Technologies. The split is supposed to take place sometime in November. I'd like to take a moment to evaluate the stock on a fundamental, financial and technical basis to show why I bought shares of the company right now for the healthcare sector of my dividend portfolio. In order to make space for this stock in my portfolio, I sold Covidien, because I felt the upside was capped due to the takeover announcement by Medtronic (NYSE:MDT).FundamentalsThe company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 28.09, which is fairly priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future, as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 17.4 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. The 1-year PEG ratio (2.56), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is expensively priced, based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 10.98%.FinancialsOn a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. The company pays a dividend of 0.89% with a payout ratio of 25% of trailing 12-month earnings, while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 6.7%, 13.5% and 10.2%, respectively, which are all respectable values. Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I don't believe the 0.89% yield of this company alone is good enough for me to take shelter in for the time being.TechnicalsLooking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock approaching overbought territory, with a current value of 67.61. I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next. I see that the black line is above the red line, with the divergence bars increasing in height, indicating bullish momentum should be starting. As for the stock price itself ($59.27), I'm looking at $59.71 to act as resistance and $58.33 to act as support, for a risk/reward ratio which plays out to be -1.59% to 0.74%.ConclusionThis isn't the type company I would normally invest in, but because I believe the spin-off can provide lots of value, I decided to purchase it for the dividend portfolio. Fundamentally, I believe the company is fairly valued on 2015 earnings estimates, but expensive on growth expectations. Financially, I'm giving up quite a bit of dividend, but the capital appreciation in Covidien is capped. On a technical basis, the stock doesn't have a favorable immediate-term risk/reward. The deal with Medtronic for Covidien was part-cash, part-stock offer, and I don't necessarily like Medtronic. Otherwise, I would have been in that stock already; hence, why I sold Covidien. I will provide reports on how each is doing against each other as the future progresses.Disclaimer: This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future.

1915981,57561,2013-12-25T08:13:01-05:00,,"Global mobile data traffic is expected to grow from 127 mb/month in 2012 to 1078 mb/month in 2017, at a compounded annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 53%. Also, the global number of mobile users is forecasted to grow from around 4.3 billion in 2012 to 5.2 billion by 2017. These forecasts look promising for the communications testing business of Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A). The communications business comes under the company's electronic measurement group, or EMG, and accounted for 34% of EMG's revenue, or 14% of Agilent's total revenue in fiscal 2013. The company has listed the following growth drivers for its communications market.Agilent anticipates the overall communications testing market to grow by 4% to 6%. Considering the company's No. 1 market position, I expect its communications testing business to grow in line with the overall market.Even though the communications division reported a 20% year-over-year decline in revenue this fiscal year, primarily due to the loss of a large wireless manufacturing customer, Agilent's wide range of products and services will help it generate better revenues in the future.Apart from its wireless network, the company manufactures testing equipment for microwave, voice, broadband, data, and fiber optic networks covering the entire communications market. The global unified communications market, which includes all forms of real-time communication services such as telephony, instant messaging, and data sharing is expected to grow at a CAGR of 15.8% from 2012 to 2016. Long-term, Agilent is in a good position to take advantage of overall growth in the communications market.Will spin-off lead to better efficiency?Agilent's split into two separate publicly traded companies is expected to be completed by November 2014. The LDA group, which will concentrate on life sciences, diagnostics, and applied markets, will retain the Agilent name. The second company, which has yet to be named, will focus on electronic measurement. In fiscal 2013, Agilent posted a 1% decline in revenue, largely due to a 12.6% decline in EMG's revenue.Even though Agilent did not report impressive top-line growth in 2013, the company's income statement reveals a different story. In the last three quarters the company has improved its cost structure, thereby reflecting better operating efficiency.In terms of efficient use of funds, Agilent has been posting a decent return on capital employed, or ROCE. In the last three years the company posted a double-digit ROCE, as seen below:Further, Agilent's split will allow management to strategically focus on running the LDA business and EMG business separately. The two businesses are unrelated, and the spin-off will allow more efficient allocation of the company's capital. I expect separate management teams to maximize the profitability of both businesses, thus improving its ROCE.A glance at competitor's capital efficiencyAgilent's peer, Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO), was cleared by the European Commission to acquire Life Technologies (NASDAQ:LIFE) in November 2013. Thermo Fisher now awaits the clearance from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and expects the acquisition to be completed early in 2014. Earlier this year, Thermo Fisher announced the acquisition of Life Tech for $15.8 billion, which includes Life Tech's assumed debt of $2.2 billion. The transaction will increase Thermo Fisher's total debt by $10.8 billion in addition to $7.1 billion of debt reported at the end of third quarter. To fund the acquisition, the company has already raised $3.2 billion in debt. With the increase in debt, it becomes important for the company to generate sufficient returns to pay off future debt obligations.The ROCE for the past three years is disappointing for Thermo Fisher compared to the ROCE for Agilent. Moreover, the company's increase in debt will require a higher ROCE as interest expense is bound to increase. For Life Tech also, the ROCE in the past three years has been a single digit number. However, the ROCE improved consistently during the period, mainly due to the company's long-term debt reduction from $2.7 billion in 2010 to $2 billion in 2012.Dividend, earnings, and free-cash-flow yieldIn November, Agilent increased its quarterly dividend by 10% from $0.12 to $0.132, boosting investor sentiment. Last year, Agilent distributed its first quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 and has been paying regular quarterly dividends since then. Below, I have analyzed Agilent's dividend, earnings, and free-cash-flow yields with that of Thermo Fisher.Agilent generated a better dividend yield than that of Thermo Fisher in the last two years. Agilent's higher earnings yield showcases its ability to earn more than Thermo Fisher for every dollar invested in the stock. Also, the company has generated an impressive free-cash-flow yield in the past three years. On the basis of all three yields, Agilent appears to be relatively undervalued.ConclusionI expect the growing subscriber base and mobile data traffic to drive Agilent's communications testing market growth. Moreover, the company has displayed improved profitability and efficient use of capital compared to its peers, and its plan to split up will improve its ROCE, as I expect better capital allocation. Finally, Agilent's yields analysis suggests an upside in its stock price. I recommend a buy on Agilent.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Note that net earnings halved to $211 million, entirely due large tax benefits of $169 million for income taxes last year.GAAP earnings came in at $0.63 per share, down from the $1.20 reported last year.Non-GAAP earnings came in at $271 million, or $0.81 per share, down from $0.86 per share reported last year. Analysts were looking for earnings of $0.76 per share.Looking Into The ResultsWhile revenues were relatively weak, the order intake rose by 4.4% to $1.83 billion. As such Agilent reported a solid book-to-bill ratio of 1.06.Despite the drop in revenues, Agilent's cost structure has been well-aligned in recent times. The cost of production, research & development costs, as well as selling, general & administrative costs all fell, resulting in a modest jump in operating income.The large tax benefits last year are the only reason why GAAP earnings were falling. The gap between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings was mainly caused by $48 million in intangible amortization charges as well as multiple other small charges.The life sciences and diagnostics business reported an 8% jump in revenues to $601 million as operating earnings rose by 26% to $115 million.Chemical analysis revenues rose by 6% to $445 million, as income from operations rose by 23% to $102 million.The electronic measurement business reported a modest 1% jump in revenues to $705 million. Income from operations was up nearly 4%to $134 million.Looking ForwardFor the current first quarter, Agilent sees first quarter revenues of $1.68 to $1.70 billion, with non-GAAP earnings seen between $0.65 and $0.67 per share. This implies that revenues are seen between flat and plus one percent compared to a year ago.The first quarter guidance came in below consensus estimates of earnings of $0.73 per share on revenues of $1.72 billion.Full year revenues are seen between $6.95 and $7.15 billion, with revenues seen up 3% at the midpoint of the range. Full year non-GAAP earnings are seen between $3.03 and $3.33 per share.Analysts were looking for full year earnings of $3.17 per share on revenues of $7.04 billion.ValuationAgilent ended its fourth quarter with $2.67 billion in cash and equivalents. Total debt stood at $2.70 billion, for a flat net cash position.Revenues for the fiscal year of 2013 came in at $6.78 billion, down a percent compared to last year. Net earnings fell some 37% to $724 million on the back of tax benefits last year, and increasing costs amidst stagnating revenues.Factoring in gains of 5% in after-hours trading, with shares exchanging hands at $53 per share, the market values Agilent at $17.5 billion. This values the company at 2.6 times annual revenues and 24 times annual earnings.Agilent pays a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 0.9%.Some Historical PerspectiveLong term holders in Agilent have seen fair returns. For most of the past decade shares have traded in a $20-$40 trading range, with exception of the crisis in 2009 when shares were approaching the $10 mark.Ever since, shares have risen to levels in the low-fifties at the moment, still being far removed from all time highs around $150 at the turn of the century. Between 2009 and 2013, Agilent has increased its annual revenues by little over 50% to $6.8 billion. The company posted earnings just north of a billion dollars in 2011 and 2012, falling back to levels below in 2013.Investment ThesisDespite the poor results based on the headline numbers, investors are relieved with Agilent's report. The strong order intake and expense reduction in the final quarter sparked enthusiasm among investors.Yet the focus of investors and the wider Wall Street community is on the announced split of the company, expected to be completed by November of 2014.Back in September, when Agilent announced its intentions to split up the company I last took a look at the prospects of the firm. I concluded that investors had to mark their calendars, looking for the effective split date, which is now expected to happen before November of next year.Agilent will remain focused on life sciences, diagnostics and applied markets, while retaining the current name. This business will have revenues of approximate $4 billion per annum, and will be led by CEO Sullivan.The electronic measurement business will operate as a separate entity of which the name is still not known to date. Revenues for this business are seen close to $3 billion as the newly created business will be led by COO Neresian. It is notably the electronic measurement business which is not performing as hoped for at the moment, creating a ""conglomerate discount"" for the entire Agilent firm.While I don't think the valuation after this year's return is very appealing, I applaud the spin-off and the guidance for the full year of 2014. I would not expect shares to outperform the wider market, but will keep an eye out for the effective spin-off date. As such I could jump on the short term bandwagon, anticipating some short term outperformance going forwards.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1772602,38201,2013-10-25T00:31:14-04:00,,"Agilent Technologies (A), a worldwide provider of bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions and services, recently announced its plan to separate the company into two publicly traded companies. On September 19, 2013, the board of directors approved the spin-off of the company's Electronic Measurement Group, or EMG, and the life sciences, diagnostics and applied markets, or LDA, businesses.Management feels the two segments need a focused approach for greater growth and shareholder returns. Also, the conglomerate's diverse businesses make it difficult for investors to understand the value proposition of the company. Therefore, we start with understanding the company's business model, and later we will discuss the implication of separation for investors.Business overviewCurrent performanceDue to the soft communication sector demand and sequestration, EMG is facing a challenging economic environment, which has negatively impacted the group's revenue. In the third quarter ended in July 2013, the segment reported a revenue decline of 17% year-over-year. In the third quarter, the segment accumulated orders worth $674 million and generated revenue of $701 million.The LDA performed better than the EMG for the quarter ended July 31, 2013. The life sciences orders increased by 1%, chemical analysis orders increased by 5%, and diagnostics & genomics increased by 52% compared to the same quarter last year. The LDA group generated revenue of $951 million, an overall 4% growth year-over-year. Also in the third quarter, the segment accumulated orders worth $926 million, an increase of 9% year-over-year.Agilent is making efforts to deal with the uncertain economic environment; it has generated a cost saving of $56 million in 2012 and is expecting to generate an incremental cost saving of $50 million in 2013.So what differs after the separationIt's all about focus; the electronic measurement group will separate from Agilent with a strong management team and solid capital structure to thrive as a stand-alone company. The management plans to expand its operations across the world aggressively in fast growing segments like wireless communication, while continuing the effort to grow its share in the oscilloscopes market.The LDA group has performed well in the past, and the management will maintain the focus to grow the organic revenue in its core instruments businesses, which are witnessing good demand in the market. It will also capitalize on its Dako and Varian acquisitions, while expanding into new geographies to tap the growth in emerging markets.What's there for investors?The separation is expected to be complete by the end of calendar year 2014. After the spin-off, both companies will have a greater focus on the distinct businesses of LDA and EM group. The company will be able to properly allocate resources for the higher growth LDA group. We expect the split to unlock the proper valuation for the LDA group, which is affected by the cyclical poor performance of EM group. Also, the new company formed out of EM group will be able to focus on the growth areas organically or inorganically that will help it to improve its performance.A data by YChartsAfter the separation, current shareholders of Agilent will own shares in two separate companies which are focused solely on their own operations. The news of split has positively impacted Agilent's stock price, and in the last three months, the stock grew by 9%. Historically, we have seen that Agilent has transformed its businesses into successes; it is originally a spin-off unit from Hewlett-Packard in 1999.The third quarter data clearly demonstrates the increasing demand for LDA group's specialty instruments, and looking at the past trends, we expect the demand to rise further. At the same time, with proper resource allocation and a focused growth strategy, the performance of the EM group will also improve. Investors who weren't able to value Agilent confidently due to its exposure to two different businesses now have new and focused companies with proper valuations to consider. We expect the split will increase the demand for the stock of both the companies from new investors, which will put upward pressure on the stock price.Other Spin-off that workedIn past few years, we have seen some big pharma companies spinning off a division and turning it into a separate entity to achieve better growth for the shareholders. The recent example is Abbott's (ABT) spin-off. On January 1, 2013, Abbott Laboratories split into two companies with two different publicly traded stocks, Abbott and Abbvie (ABBV). Abbott is a medical device, diagnostics, and nutritionals company, while Abbvie is the drug manufacturing company. Since the spin-off, Abbott's stock has given a yield to date, or YTD, of 16.35%, and Abbvie has given a YTD of 37.61%. This clearly reflects investors' confidence in the spun-off drug manufacturing division, Abbvie, which has better growth potential. The split has unlocked the true valuation of Abbott's spun-off division, Abbvie.ConclusionAfter the separation, the EMG business will become a separate publicly-traded company, while the LDA business will remain under the Agilent name. The spin-off makes sense, as it reduces the company's exposure to the cyclical market of EMG and its poor performing defense segment, which was hit by sequestration. After the separation, the new Agilent will be a pure-play life science entity and will be able to dedicate its resources effectively to areas with solid growth prospects that are less affected by adverse macro environments. Also, we expect with the strategy of expanding into new geography will minimize the impact of the economic cycle, and it will improve the performance of the newly formed EM group. In the past, we have seen the spin-off of Abbott, which has helped the company to unlock its true valuation, and the stock of both companies experienced upward movement. We expect Agilent's stock will also experience a similar upward movement after the spin-off.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1705722,25120,2013-09-20T13:41:21-04:00,,"Shares of Agilent (NYSE:A) took a jump on Thursday after the company announced its intentions to split the company in two separate publicly traded companies.While it might easily take a year before the split materializes, investors are cheering already.Given the historical strong performance of the to be spun-off companies, today's action might provide an interesting opportunity for shareholders to participate in.While it is obviously too late to benefit from Thursday's jump, opportunistic investors should mark their calendars. When the split becomes effective, which is estimated to happen in 2014, the spun-off electronic measurement product company, as well as the combined value of the company, might easily jump again, as we have seen in previous spin-offs.The SplitAgilent announced that it will split its operations in two separate companies.Agilent will create a company focused on life sciences, diagnostics and applied markets (LDA) which will retain the current Agilent name. The other company, which still has to be named, will focus on electronic measurement (EM) products.The separation will be done in a tax-free spin-off of the electronics measurement company to current Agilent shareholders.This is not the first split for shareholders in the company, which has seen four major spin-offs since 2005. I think it is a wise decision to split the company up. The current valuation looks rather appealing to some of Agilent's competitors as recent underperformance in the measurement division has impacted the overall valuation, thereby the valuation of the healthcare business as well.Splitting the company in two separate entities should allow investors to value both stand-alone companies, thereby ""unlocking"" current value being destroyed by the ""conglomerate discount.""Agilent aims to complete the transaction before the end of 2014.Benefits For ShareholdersWith the split, current shareholders will own shares in two separate businesses which are focused solely on their own operations. Each company will have a unique investment profile, allowing it to attract its own investment clientele depending on the risk tolerance of investors.Both firms hold leading positions within their industry, and should be well-capitalized having debt-to-EBITDA ratios of 2.0x or less.Historically other splits have boded well for shareholders, notably in the company which has been spun-off from the ""mother"" company.AgilentThe newly formed Agilent company will focus on life sciences, diagnostic and applied markets. Balanced geographical operations, a recurring revenue base, opportunities in emerging markets, molecular diagnostics and clinical market opportunities should provide an attractive growth profile.Full year revenues for the business are seen around $3.9 billion for this year. Agilent will continue to pay a dividend yield which is equivalent or more to the current dividend yield.Current CEO Bill Sullivan will remain to lead the company.Electronic MeasurementThe newly formed Electronic Measurement Company will hold leading positions in communications, aerospace, defense, computers and semiconductors markets. Revenues for the year are seen around $2.9 billion as the new company does not anticipate paying a dividend.Current Chief Operating Officer Ron Neresian will become CEO of the new business.ValuationAgilent ended the third quarter with $2.33 billion in cash and equivalents. The company operates with $2.70 billion in total debt, for a modest net debt position.The company is on track to generate annual revenues of around $6.8 billion, as earnings could approach $950 million, or around $2.85 per share.The current $17 billion market capitalization values the firm at 2.5 times annual revenues and around 18 times annual earnings.Implications For InvestorsWhile the split is still a long time away, shareholders are already benefiting from it. Following the announcement, shares saw gains of up to 6%, boosting the market capitalization of a firm by almost a billion.Investors are comforted by the strong performance of other recent spin-offs. Murphy Oil (NYSE:MUR) has just finished its spin-off of Murphy USA (NYSE:MUSA) in recent weeks. A year earlier, refiner and marketer Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) was spun-off from ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) as shares in the spin-off promptly doubled amidst a favorable refining environment.As mentioned before, Agilent has transformed itself many times in its history. The business was originally a spin-off itself from Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) back in 1999, and has four major spin-offs since 2005 as mentioned above.The company's trouble, which is holding the valuation of the entire business down, is the struggling electronic measurement business. This results in the well known ""conglomerate discount"" and affects the value of the healthcare unit.Thursday's jump clearly demonstrates this effect as apparently investors are willing to pay up to a billion more if the company is focused, just showing how real the ""conglomerate discount"" really is, even in today's world. The electronic measurement business has seen some recent weakness on the back of cuts in defense spending and a soft communications market.Back in November of last year, I last took a look at Agilent's prospects. I concluded that the company which traded around $38 per share was a good addition for long-term investors. Ever since, shares have risen by roughly a third to their low-fifties. Unfortunately I did not act upon my own advice to buy into this compelling opportunity. For now investors can be happy with Thursday's returns, but keep an eye on this one for the future.While the actual split might be due next year, investors might have an opportunity to buy the spun-off company, which shares have historically seen decent returns in splits.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2009951,22775,2014-02-11T02:12:31-05:00,,"Agilent (NYSE:A) reported a few months ago a strong Q4, with revenues accelerating to 8% in the core Life Sciences & Diagnostics business (vs. low to mid-single digit growth in previous quarters) and slightly improving on a sequential basis in the Electronic Measurement business (-12% vs -16% in Q3). This suggests in our view that the company is at an early stage of a beat-and-raise cycle: consensus expectations have been reset in 2012 and early 2013, financial discipline has been rising and the revenue outlook is now improving. In our view, Agilent is a core holding in the Life Sciences Tools sector along with Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) on which we published an article in January.2014 is all about the academic spending recovery and the Electronic Measurement bottoming-outOur level of confidence is pretty high heading into the Q1 release (Thursday after the close) as two large Life Sciences Tools peers, Illumina and Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO), recently reported impressive top-line performances: respectively +25% (4% above consensus) and +6% (3% above the Street, and TMO's highest performance in 13 quarters), suggesting some year-end budget flush by pharma and biotech customers. Even assuming continued tough trading conditions for the Electronic Measurement business in the quarter due to a rather weak telecom equipment market (see the recent uninspiring figures from Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) and Nokia (NYSE:NOK)), Agilent should be able to surprise on the upside in Q1 in our view.But more importantly, the group's revenue momentum should gradually accelerate in coming quarters. While spending from private customers is likely to remain healthy, academic research spending is expected to recover in 2014 and to give a boost to Agilent. Indeed, Sequestration looks like an old story for Life Sciences Tools companies: the US congress recently released the 2014 budget in which the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the nation's medical research agency which provides research grants, would receive a +3.5% budget increase from FY 2013 levels.As for the Electronic Measurement business, we expect a gradual improvement and a return to (slightly) positive revenue growth during the year driven by macro, positive industry capex and easy comps after a tough FY13.Electronic Measurement spin-off a catalyst for increased corporate actionThe announced spin-off of the Electronic Measurement business (deal to be completed by November) has been well received by investors as it will enable to unlock value (see below). But we see two additional positive consequences:1/ Agilent's M&A power is likely to increase as the new Agilent will soon have the opportunity to use its whole balance sheet to strengthen its position in Life Sciences & Diagnostics (M&A in sight) at a time when competition increases. Giant groups have indeed emerged in the industry (such as Thermo Fisher + Life) with a clear scale advantage.2/ But the hunter could become the hunted: Agilent's more focused profile and strong cash generation and rising consolidation in the industry could attract rivals or private equity investors.Higher valuation levels in sight for both Electronic Measurement and Life SciencesIn our view, the upcoming spin-off of Electronic Measurement could be completed under favorable conditions for Agilent's shareholders, as the division's improving momentum suggests a higher valuation than initially expected.The core Life Sciences & Diagnostics business is likely to benefit from higher valuation multiples as well, thanks to accelerating performances and to Agilent's more focused profile. The stock has been trading well below peers until now (Agilent is currently trading at an EV/sales of 2.9x vs. a Tools average around 3.2x) as Agilent was not a pure player in Life Sciences Tools. But the stock should rerate once the spin-off of Electronic Measurement is completed.Agilent could also command a speculative premium given the scarcity of players in the Life Sciences Tools space. The upside here would be significant: Life Technologies (NASDAQ:LIFE) was acquired last year at an EV/sales of 4x and Illumina, widely perceived as a takeover target, is currently trading at a 11.7x ratio…Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in A over the next 72 hours.

1944241,24695,2014-01-15T10:00:00-05:00,,"Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A)Business Overview:Agilent Technologies is a measurement company providing core bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions to the life sciences, chemical analysis, diagnostics and genomics, communications and electronics industries. Agilent primarily sells its products through direct sales, but also utilizes distributors, resellers, manufacturers' representatives, telesales and electronic commerce. Agilent was incorporated in Delaware in 1999, after being spun off from Hewlett-Packard.Segments:The firm is defined by three main segments:Agilent can be defined in four major segments:Thesis:Agilent presents a good opportunity for those investors looking for safer yet rewarding investments in the potential volatile markets of FY14. With a spin-off to be potentially completed in November, 2014, Agilent with its strong balance sheet, leading market position and strong cash flows is one such company that is poised to generate healthy returns for its shareholders. Adding to the hard spin-off catalyst are significant market opportunities in the mobile space, energy & food sector and environment space in US, EU and especially emerging markets. Agilent's history of share buybacks and increasing dividends also should comfort investors. With leading positions in its respective market segments and consolidation in the defense and life science industry, the spin-off event should also help the firm expand its multiples and assist the management in more efficient and effective deployment of its cash flows. An interest in takeover of the pure play EMG business should also benefit those investors willing to wait.Major Catalyst:FY14 Spin-off to create opportunities: Some might argue that with a 30% rise in FY13, Agilent might have run out of steam. But contrary to some opinions, there are reasons to believe that the best may be yet to come. One is Agilent's announced spin-off of its Electronic segment that it expects to complete in November, 2014 might lead to another 30% rise in the shares over the course of the next 15 months. The spin-off will free the two completely different businesses that have existed within the Agilent umbrella, helping investors value the segments better. Post spin-off, Agilent expects to keep the dividend for the new Agilent intact while keeping investment grade credit rating for the individual businesses. Another reason might be the joint ventures and cost initiatives that have yet to kick in and are expected to impact Agilent's bottom-line. Additionally, the joint ventures for both the segments are not completely discounted for, especially the 2H14 announcement for China Mobile venture that will be a positive for the EGM segment. The good fundamentals, margins and ROIC numbers add to the flair; however, the kicker comes in the form of EGM becoming a potential takeover target.Individually, both the businesses, the EMG and LDA (new Agilent), are leaders in their respective fields, with LDA and EMG, both reporting median operating margins of 18% since FY06. Post spin, LDA is expected to generate 11% ROIC while EMG 31%. The LDA business has bright prospects with growth in environmental regulations, rising energy demand and the needs to test water due to water scarcity and pollution, especially in emerging economies. Another bright spot within the LDA is the higher growth of its Diagnostic and genomic unit, which is currently driven by companion diagnostics, and aging population.Revenue and Operating Margin Trend:Despite reporting declining margins and revenue, EMG over the long term should see incremental demand and margins. In spite of the cyclicality and margin swings in the short term, EMG has maintained 18% margins since FY06 and has increased its revenues by almost a USD 1bn since FY08. Furthermore, EMG is a leader in all its markets, namely Communications, Aerospace & Defense and Industrials, with mobile and wireless communication contributing to the growth.The spin-off should unlock value within the individual segments making allocation of capital to the segments more effective and efficient. The separation of businesses should lead to multiple expansion over the medium term, thereby benefiting shareholders.Sequestration & Upcoming JVs to Benefit Shareholders:In addition to the obvious, there are certain ongoing joint ventures that will create profit opportunities for the firm in the future. On the LDA side, the firm announced in 2Q13 and 3Q13 that the company has entered into a customer contract with Pfizer where they have signed a long-term developmental agreement related to companion diagnostics, which also includes advisory services from a regulatory and marketing perspective. The company also stated that it's in a privileged position with Genentech and expects an uptick in the business. Agilent intends to continue to announce more partnerships with Tier 1 Pharma companies. From FY14 and onwards, Agilent expects to see a steady stream of new companion diagnostic tests that will be marketed through the Dako sales organization. Additionally, the focus by governments of countries such as China, US and Japan on environment, water resources, food quality, and energy only creates opportunities for Agilent's Chemical Analysis group. Agilent generates approximately 40% of its revenues from the Asia Pacific region, 35% from the US and the rest from the EU.On the EMG side, this segment over the medium term also looks exciting; with a major announcement coming in the near future that will impact it's profitability. China Mobile, probably the biggest mobile company by subscribers, is in the middle of selecting their suppliers which, according to Agilent management, currently has nine companies in the bidding process. China Mobile has planned to spend approximately USD 6.7 bn on this deal and is supposed to make a decision by August or early September. Agilent, according to its management, is well positioned with all those suppliers. So no matter who wins, Agilent shareholders will still benefit from this opportunity. Additionally, with the expanding mobile market worldwide and with it, the complexity of the chip sets getting produced create additional opportunities for Agilent. The satellite sector mostly outside of the US is also an area of growth for the firm. Agilent, with its market leading position, is poised to benefit as EMG turns around.Additionally, the sequestration debate, which has seen some internal sparring from both sides of the Isle regarding the actual spending cuts in the key defense areas also seems to be coming to some compromise with the new budget deal - another positive for the firm over the medium term.Cash Flow Deployment May Lead to Additional Buybacks and Higher DividendsAgilent is generating approximately USD 1bn in cash flow every year and had been pretty consistent with generating free cash flow year over year. In the most recent past, the company has increased its dividend by 20% and has bought back USD 9.5bn in stock, with USD 1bn in FY13 alone. Since FY06, the company has reduced approximately 100m shares outstanding. Additional cash flow is expected, as the firm consolidates its manufacturing facility and restructures its operations in FY14. USD 50m of cost reductions were put in place in 2Q13 and more are expected. In its spin-off presentation, the company has spoken about doing accretive bolt-on acquisitions to grow the firm inorganically - another use of capital that might be ultimately beneficial to the investors. Agilent has a history to making successful acquisitions, with the most recent in FY12 of Dako and in FY10 of Varian. After the spin-off, as the deployment of capital becomes more independent and effective, the firms with their strong individual cash flows might increase dividends or buy back more stock.Potential M&A:While Agilent has spoken about making bolt on accretive acquisitions, the spin-off event which entails separating LDA from its EMG business might make the hunter getting hunted. With high margins, consistent return on capital and a healthy balance sheet, the growth prospects of either the LDA or the EMG business might garner interest from potential suitors over the medium term. There has been a flurry of activity in the last 12 to 24 months, where firms within the life sciences, scientific instruments or in the field of diagnostics have been acquired. EMG sector has also undergone consolidation since FY09. As mentioned earlier, the individual segments within Agilent have healthy margins, consistent cash flow and 15%+ returns on invested capital through the FY08 crisis. This speaks to the resilience of Agilent business and bodes well for its shareholders. It must be noted that the individual entities cannot be acquired right after the spin-off happens due to regulations; however, it's not out of the realm of possibility that there might be takeover interest. Even if LDA or EMG does not actually get sold, they might still trade as potential takeover targets - a positive for investors.Analysis of the acquisitions that have happened in Europe and US since FY06 result in the following takeout multiples by individual segments. In the event, Agilent ever divests or gets an offer to be taken out, it should be able to fetch the following multiples.Current Valuation Discount Majority of Negative News:Agilent currently has $ 2,675m in cash and $2,699m in debt as of 31 October 2013. I have done extensive scenario analysis to run various revenue estimates using low case, base case and best case scenarios for both FY14 and FY15.Then by running a competitive analysis on different segments of the company, I have performed sum of the parts analysis on Agilent. Following are some of the competitors I have used for the LDA and the EMG segments.The following are the forward multiples for the respective LDA and EMG segments that have been drawn after performing a competitive analysis on respective Agilent segments and its competitors. These multiples are used to value Agilent on P/E, EV/Sales and EV/EBITDA basis, where the respective earnings, sales and EBITDA numbers are calculated using scenario analysis. Then the value for the company is calculated under a most conservative, base case and best case scenario.To calculate individual EBITDA, I have used conservative estimates to calculate what the EBITDA for FY14 might be.The final values for the company are calculated using both sum of the parts analysis and transaction multiple analysis on the individual segments. Agilent already has had quite a run this year, and the stock might see some pull back in the short run. If the markets significantly correct, Agilent's share price can fall to as low as USD 45. However, over the longer term, for those investors who are willing to hold Agilent for more than two years, this stock should be valued at at least USD 75 to USD 80 per share. Add a dividend yield and a potential for share buybacks, holding Agilent in the possible volatile markets of FY14 might be worth the risk.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in A, over the next 72 hours.

While September's track record is weak, investors willing to buy in September and own through fall are historically treated kindly.I've already outlined some of my favorites in large cap consumer here, but for those interested in technology, Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) and ASML Holdings (NASDAQ:ASML) have an uncanny ability of trading up over the coming months.September weakness is likely to be short livedEveryone knows the past doesn't guarantee the future. But, those who've followed the tape for a while recognize markets, sectors and industries tend to trade higher or lower at certain times of the year.And, while the September and October sell-offs get the most media attention, investors shouldn't discount the S&P's ability to shrug off those sell-offs and move up into Q4.Over the past decade, the S&P 500 has finished November higher than it starts September 9 times, generating an average and median return of 1.95% and 4.07% respectively. Those kind of returns suggest you shouldn't worry too much if you have cash to spend into weakness this month.Source: Seasonal Investor DatabaseIf you're looking for a bit more risk and reward than the broad market, technology stocks are worth a look.

Agilent Technologies and ASML Holdings have both posted strong returns through November, suggesting September may be a good time to buy.1. Cost cuts make this company leaner for the next business cycleOkay. Agilent isn't a pure play technology company. They get a big chunk of their sales from healthcare. But, technology drives Agilent's product line. The company has a rich history of innovating to help pharmaceutical and biotech companies bring new products to market. And, its electronic measurement segment counts some of the biggest communications firms in the world as customers. Unfortunately, that business hasn't been a good one lately. In the most recent quarter, sales slumped 17% year-over-year. That's quite a headwind given it represents $3.3 billion in sales in FY12 -- nearly half the company's total revenue.Offsetting that business, sales for chemical analysis and higher margin life sciences grew 1% and 3% from last year, respectively. The Chemicals group should provide low to mid single digit growth as company continues to see demand from emerging markets tied to meeting the world's food demand. The Life Sciences business offers steady mid single digit industry growth, suggesting sales should improve as Asia and Europe, which account for 37% and 27% of segment sales, get back on track. The strongest part of Agilent was Diagnostics & Genomics -- it's smallest business at just $400 million in FY12 sales. Revenue in that group grew 54% from last year in the quarter, or 6% if you remove the impact of its acquisition of Dako. The diagnostics and genomics group sells into a $7 billion market growing 8%-10% annually thanks to the trend for personalized and targeted medicine. Against a backdrop of lackluster growth, Agilent has been cutting costs. A leaner Agilent aims to reduce expenses in manufacturing and logistics by $200 million. Those moves will help support Agilent's earnings -- and corresponding dividends and buybacks -- while providing more margin friendly business to leverage once global growth returns. For the full year, Agilent is guiding to $2.83-2.85 per share in fiscal 2013.Over the past decade, investors have bid up shares into fall ahead of hopes for expanding research budgets. Shares have gained 9 of 10 times, producing an average 4.95% and 8% return in the period, respectively.Source: Seasonal Investor Database2. Smaller chip sizes are driving demand for increasingly complex machinesIntel committed $2 billion to 14 nanometer chips earlier this year, an amount likely to be matched or boosted next year when Intel expects to have 2 new 14 nm fabs fully ramped by year end. Intel's activity is emblematic of the broader industry shift to smaller die size, which presents a host of challenges as smaller designs become increasingly complex, requiring more debugging and testing. The need for greater collaboration as sizes fall drove Intel, Samsung and Taiwan Semi to invest in ASML Holdings; giving them greater access to next generation extreme ultraviolet lithography (""EUV""). ASML bolstered its EUV product line with its acquisition of competitor Cymer in 2012. That technology is used by semiconductor makers to print circuits on increasingly smaller silicon, a market ASML has a stranglehold on with 80% share.The company is sitting on a backlog of 42 systems -- 90% of which will ship in the next 6 months. It sold 38 systems in Q2. The majority to Taiwan. Units were split equally between memory and foundry.As we move into the friendlier period for historical book-to-bill, ASML has been a nice performer.

1029151,33161,2012-11-26T17:36:44-05:00,,"This year, Agilent's (NYSE:A) shares have experienced much volatility with very little gain. From January through March, shareholders enjoyed a 30% gain, but since then, shares have declined by nearly 20%. This volatility in share price signals uncertainty among market participants and warrants investigation from profit-seeking investors. Through this article, we will delve into the fundamental developments of Agilent throughout the past 5 years and arrive at the conclusion that this is a strong company, worthy of investment.A History of ReturnsIn order to thoroughly investigate Agilent, I have relied heavily on return on assets and return on equity. Return on assets is the net income of the firm divided by average total assets. Return on assets tells the investor how efficiently the organization uses its assets to generate profits. Return on equity is the net income of the firm divided by directly-invested shareholder equity and this ratio tells investors how effectively management uses investments to generate profits. In the chart below, 5 years of return on assets and return on equity for Agilent can be seen.The chart of returns shows a very clear picture of Agilent's historic fundamental performance. Between 2008 and 2009, Agilent experienced a plateau and decline in firm performance, much like the rest of the economy. During these years, organizational returns declined to the point where the firm actually began experiencing net losses in the fourth quarter of 2009. The market responded to this degradation in firm performance by shedding over 15% from the stock price. In 2010, Agilent recovered from its fundamental malaise and once again delivered performance which lasted until the middle of 2011. Over these quarters, the stock price rose nearly 70%. Between the third quarter of 2011 and the third quarter of 2012, performance once again deteriorated and share price experienced likewise declines of over 24%. During the third quarter of 2011, fundamental performance once again strongly rebounded and the stock price surprisingly fell by 8%. This represents an investment opportunity for the prudent capitalist. Prior to exploring this opportunity, please examine the following table which summarizes the time periods studied.The table above effectively summarizes the past 5 years of organizational and stock performance for Agilent. Investors tend to complicate things by relying on a variety of factors, but I believe a simple and logical approach to investment is what is rewarded in the long run. The logical relationship that we have relied on throughout this analysis is this: as a firm improves fundamentally, its stock price should improve as well. The table above proves that this relationship has held true for the past 5 years - until this most recent quarter. In my opinion, this represents an investment opportunity. Agilent has shown an ability to improve itself from a fundamental standpoint and shares have not quite caught on the fact that returns, rather than temporary news, is what drive share price in the long term. If the simple and logical relationship of returns and share price performance continues to hold true, Agilent's share price is due to increase in the near future. In my opinion, investors seeking to profit should consider purchasing Agilent's shares.Technically SpeakingEven though I believe that Agilent has a strong fundamental catalyst which will drive share price increases in the near future, I do not believe that investors should immediately purchase the security. Share prices have declined nearly 20% over the past 7 months and it is entirely possible that declines will continue. For this reason, I advocate patience for investors in Agilent. Since our fundamental thesis is that Agilent is a strong and growing company, I believe that we should wait until price confirms this analysis prior to investing. It can be seen in the chart below, that I believe that Agilent is in a pullback within a multi-year uptrend. In my professional opinion, Agilent will more than likely bounce in the near future, but I believe that investors should wait until price closes above the descending trend line prior to initiating a position. Specifically, investors should purchase if price is able to end the week above $40 per share. I believe that an immediate stop-loss should be placed at $33 per share in order to protect capital if price were to reverse its uptrend. Investors should seek to sell one-third of these shares at the significant price barrier of $46.50 per share. Price has battled with this level for the past year and a half and I believe that a battle could once again be fought for control of this threshold. If price continues past this threshold, I believe that investors should sell another one-third of the initial investment at $53 per share. This is a price threshold that Agilent attempted to overcome twice, and failed, in 2011. I feel that the final position should be allowed to ride until the fundamental condition of Agilent worsens, as witnessed by a decrease in return on assets and return on equity. For investors who follow through with this systematic method of investing, I believe that these final shares should have a stop of $46.50, which will protect profits should the market reverse its gains.The table below shows the breakdown of the systematic approach to investing I just mentioned. The reward to risk ratio of this trade looks relatively low in that you only stand to gain $1.24 for every $1.00 you are willing to risk, but it is important to understand that this is the moderate-case scenario in which the market hits two of our targets and reverses. Realistically, the fundamental performance of Agilent dictates strong share price gains in the future. Historically, changes in firm performance have driven changes in share price 100% of the time, over the past 5 years. If you believe that the current increase in fundamental performance has an 80% chance of increasing share price, then you should consider taking this trade.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Based on the preliminary financial results for the quarter ended 2013-07-31 we analyzed Agilent relative to its peers (peer set at the end of this post).The table below shows the preliminary results along with the recent trend for revenues, net income and returns.Agilent is in Harvesting modeAgilent Technologies, Inc.'s current Price/Book of 3.2 is about median in its peer group. We classify Agilent as Harvesting because of the market's low expectations of growth (PE of 17.4 compared to peer median of 28.4) despite its relatively high returns (ROE of 19.4% compared to the peer median ROE of 8.6%).The company attempts to achieve high profit margins (currently 13.7% vs. peer median of 10.6%) through differentiated products. It currently operates with peer median asset turns of 0.7x. Agilent's net margin has declined 3.1 percentage points from last year's high but remains above its five-year average net margin of 11.2.Agilent Earnings seem to be PeakingWhile the company's revenue growth has been above the peer median (15.2% vs. 12.1% respectively for the past three years), the stock's PE ratio of 17.4 is less than the peer median. This implies that the company's earnings are peaking and the market expects a decline in its growth expectations.Under-Investing in GrowthAgilent's annualized rate of change in capital of 11.7% over the past three years is around the same as its peer median of 10.7%. This investment has generated a better-than-peer median return on capital of 14.2% averaged over the same three years. The greater than peer median rate of return suggest that the company may be under investing in growth.Trend ChartsPeers used for analysis of AgilentAgilent Technologies, Inc.'s analysis versus peers uses the following peer-set: Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR), Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

816351,25120,2012-08-20T02:55:29-04:00,,"Shares of Agilent (A) took a beating ending the week 8% lower. The measurement company, which focuses on bio-analytical and other measurement solutions, reported its third quarter results on Wednesday.Third Quarter ResultsAgilent reported disappointing third quarter revenues of $1.72 billion, up 2% compared to last year. On average, analysts expected the company to report revenues of $1.79 billion. GAAP net income fell from $330 million last year to $243 million, or $0.69 per share. Adjusted earnings came in at $278 million, or $0.79 per share, below analysts consensus of $0.82 per share. Agilent had a lot of one-offs during the quarter, including intangible amortization costs, acquisition and integration costs and other write-downs.New order intake was quite weak. Orders fell 1% on the year to $1.66 billion. Some key areas of weakness were the aerospace and defense sector, which recorded an 11% decline in revenues on fears of automatic spending cuts. Other weakness was seen in industrial markets and environmental markets, with the latter also related to budget cuts. The forensic market was strong, reporting 17% revenue growth.Integration of the $2.2 billion acqusition of Danish Dako is on track. The acquisition will add $85 million in fourth quarter revenues.CEO Bill Sullivan commented on the results, ""Agilent's performance in the fiscal third quarter did not meet our revenue and EPS guidance. We have clearly entered an environment of much slower growth, resulting in deals taking longer to close and customers delaying their order deliveries.""OutlookFor the fourth quarter, Agilent is now anticipating revenues of $1.76-$1.78 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to come in between $0.80-$0.82. This compares to third quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.79 per share. The fourth quarter outlook is very soft. Analysts expected non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.93, on revenues of $1.87 billion.For the full year of 2012, the company anticipates revenues of $6.85-$6.87 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected at $3.06-$3.08 per share. Both metrics came in lower than previously guided.ValuationAgilent ended its third quarter with $1.9 billion in cash and equivalents. It operates with roughly $2.2 billion in short and long term debt, for a net debt position of $300 million. For the first nine months of 2012, the company reported net revenues of $5.1 billion. The company reported net profits of $728 million, or $2.06 per diluted share.After last week's plunge, the market values the firm at $13 billion. Based on Agilent's full year outlook, the firm is valued at 1.9 times annual revenues and 12 times non-GAAP earnings.The valuation compares to a revenue multiple of 1.8 times for Thermo Fisher (TMO) and 2.3 times for Danaher (DHR). These competitors trade at 19 and 17 times trailing annual earnings, respectively.Currently, the company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 1.1%.Investment ThesisYear to date, shares of Agilent trade with modest gains of 6%. Shares quickly advanced to levels around $45 in the first three months of the year, but fell back to trade around the $40 mark. Last week's plunge send shares back to $37 per share.Over the past five years, shares have gained a mere 10%, trading in a wide trading range of $15-$50 per share. While Agilent's business model was not immune for the recession, it did recover quickly from the downturn. 2012's expected revenues of $6.86 billion, come in ahead of 2008's annual revenues of $5.77 billion. Earnings per share advanced from $1.87 in 2008 to a rough estimate of $2.70 for 2012, on a GAAP basis.While Agilent missed the third quarter consensus, and it guides for a soft final quarter, the market reaction might be overdone. The weakness can be traced back to uncertainty regarding the ""fiscal cliff"" discussions, resulting in government organizations delaying order placements. The temporarily delay, might result in catch-up demand in the start of Agilent's fiscal 2013.After the recent decline, I think that shares of Agilent do offer compelling value in the medium-to long term.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

With the acquisition of Dako, the overall measurement market was expanded to $54 billion. Lastly, the dividend was increased by 20% to $0.12 a share, and a stock repurchase plan (up to $500 million for the remainder of FY 2013) was authorized.BreakdownsExciting developmentsCombination of Dako allows Agilent to bring advanced care for cancer victims by providing the antibodies, reagents and instruments, enabling physicians to choose the right form of treatment, the first time. Dako sees 1/3 of all of the cancer tissues in the world.Agilent also works with the large pharmaceutical companies of what's called companion diagnostics and has recently announced 2 collaborations, one with Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and the other one with Lilly (NYSE:LLY).Management StrategyThe management has chosen not to outsource the manufacturing. As a result, Agilent can drive technology across the company and control the whole supply chain. The management will continue to focus on the manufacturing with a plan to reduce the manufacturing costs by $180 million over the next 3 to 4 years. It is now about 1/3 completed. The management is also planning for a slow economic time this year, which should pick up in the second half. Strategically, the company will continue to invest aggressively in organic growth, developing markets, as well as in R&D.Analysts' Estimates and CallsAnalysts are estimating an EPS of $0.68 with revenue of $1.76B for the current quarter ending in April, 2013. For 2013, analysts are projecting an EPS of $2.92 with revenue of $7.03B, which is 2.50% higher than 2012. Analysts currently have a mean target price of $48.60 for Agilent.On April 4, 2013, ISI Group analyst, Ross Muken, commented that Agilent should consider divesting some of its underperforming assets.

Agilent also achieved higher revenue growth in the past 3 years. Yet, Agilent only has a low P/E of 13.0. Agilent should deserve a better valuation.Technically, Agilent was on the long-term upside trend since July 2012 and started to pull back in mid-March, 2013. More technical analysis can be reviewed here.Source: Finviz.comBottom LineAgilent's economic moat comes from its higher barriers-to-entry for competitors with a fortress of intangible assets. With the acquisition of Dako, stronger long-term growth is expected.

1273821,31361,2013-03-14T11:38:36-04:00,,"As the world's premier measurement company, Agilent (NYSE:A) offers the broadest range of innovative measurement solutions for industry with four major divisions: Chemical Analysis, Life Sciences, Diagnostics and Genomics, and Electronic Measurement.Agilent's roots date back to 1939, when Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard started the company that helped shape Silicon Valley and the technology industry. The two founders were renowned for their visionary approach to management and for their commitment to making products that contribute to advances in science and technology.Agilent was spun off from the Hewlett-Packard Company in 1999.Agilent acquired Dako, a Danish company specializing in diagnostic tests, for $2.2 billion in the first half of 2012.Companion diagnosticsPersonalized medicine calls for personalized diagnostic tests.Personalized medicine was brought on by the ever increasing sophistication in genomic research. More and more new drugs are helpful only to a select group of patients who have a certain genetic irregularity.Diagnostic tests help the physician to select the right drugs for the right patients.More new drugs therefore are approved by the FDA with a companion diagnostic test that is usually selected by the manufacturer of the drug.Companion diagnostics serve a vital role in big pharma's plans to sell expensive new drugs for specialty markets. The payers could not agree more as the tests confirm that the expensive new med has a good shot at working for a patient.The Swiss giant Roche is most anxious to integrate its diagnostics and pharma arms, pursuing more than 200 biomarker and companion diagnostics projects internally. CEO Severin Schwan, himself a veteran of the diagnostics unit, has said that in the future more than 60 percent of Roche's pipeline drugs will be paired with companion diagnostics.Bayer has signed an agreement with Qiagen (NYSE:QGEN) for companion diagnostics to use with Bayer's solid tumor treatments, and Bristol-Myers (NYSE:BMY) has set up a partnership with California's Life Technologies (NASDAQ:LIFE), initially in cancer and then branching out into other therapeutic areas. GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) has an agreement with Response Genetics (RGDX) and has expanded its interest by purchasing shares in the company.The FDA's draft guidance on companion diagnostics in July 2011 further encouraged the trend.The patients are winners in the process. Companion diagnostics ensure that they get the most effective treatment for their specific type of disease, and reduce the number of ineffective or potentially harmful treatments they may receive. For doctors the tests make it easier to match patient and treatment, especially as the drug choice in certain diseases such as cancer become dizzyingly complex.DakoKadcyla, previously known as T-DM1 from Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY), is a recently approved breast cancer treatment that analysts predict will pull in between $2 billion and $5 billion a year.Now, Dako's two assays, HercepTest and HER2 IQFISH pharmDx, are FDA approved to be sold alongside the targeted drug.Dako, a division of Agilent, teamed up with Roche's Genentech subsidiary last year to develop the tests and submit them for FDA approval.It is noteworthy that Roche, with its multibillion-dollar diagnostics division, opted against developing the assays in-house and chose instead to farm it out to Dako.The Kadcyla pairing is Dako's fourth big pharma partnership in a year, as the company has signed on with Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) to develop diagnostics for oncology drugs.When Agilent acquired Dako in the largest deal ever in the company's history, Dako was already a star in the companion diagnostics world, boasting partnerships with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN), Bristol-Myers Squibb and Quintiles.TestsDako's HercepTest and HER2 IQFISH pharmDx will serve as diagnostic tools to identify cancer patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer to select patients who may be eligible for Kadcyla treatment.HercepTest uses immunohistochemistry (NYSE:IHC) analysis for the detection of HER2 protein over-expression in breast cancer.HER2 IQFISH pharmDX is a direct fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay. FISH is used to examine gene copy number variation in the tumor.Because the results of the IHC test can sometimes be ambiguous, many doctors suggest the FISH test for a second opinion. Tumors that are 3+ positive by IHC and those that test positive by FISH are most likely to benefit from HER2-inhibitors like Kadcyla.Dako has recently introduced its new IQISH technology in the U.S. The technology will reduce the turnaround time for cancer evaluation from two days to three and a half hours. This will ease the waiting time and associated anxiety for the patient and allow physicians to more quickly initiate targeted cancer treatments.""Every second counts when waiting for test results that will indicate how to treat your cancer most effectively,"" said Lars Holmkvist, CEO of Dako and senior vice president, Agilent.The HER2 gene encodes a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), which promotes the growth of cells. In about one of every five breast cancers, the cancer cells make an excess of HER2 due to a HER2 gene mutation.HER2-positive breast cancers tend to be more aggressive than other types of breast cancer. As they are also less responsive to hormone treatment, medical treatments that specifically target HER2, like Roche's Herceptin and Kadcyla, are often considered.""The new protocol yields very distinct signals,"" said Professor Giuseppe Viale, medical director at Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, Milano, Italy.

It is now available in the U.S.Investor's summaryBiotherapeutics have enormous potential to improve human health. The number of approved protein and antibody therapeutics are increasing every year around the world as they address unmet medical needs.But discovery and development of biopharmaceuticals is not easy, besides science, tools, equipment, chemicals and tremendous engineering skills are needed to get an idea trough trials and into the clinic.At every stage in the process, from disease research to testing and manufacturing, Agilent sells the tools and everything else a pharmaceutical firm may need to succeed. Agilent is the invisible miracle worker in the background.Dako, a new member of the group, is one of the leading global providers of cancer diagnostics tools and it should significantly increase Agilent's recurring revenues.Dako's products are sold in more than 100 countries, and it generated $340 million in revenue in 2012. The company employs more than 1,000 people, in Denmark, in Carpinteria, Calif., and elsewhere.Diagnostics and Genomics is a growing market with growth rate projected somewhere between 8% and 10% a year over a longer period of time.Agilent Technologies reported revenues of $1.68 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31, 2013, 3 percent above one year ago. First-quarter net income was $179 million, or $0.51 per share, which compares to last year's first-quarter net income of $230 million, or $0.65 per share.The Life Sciences division's revenues were up 2 percent over a year ago, with operating margins 15 percent. The Diagnostics and Genomics division grew 145 percent with operating margins 13 percent.Agilent generated $245 million of cash from operations in the first quarter.For the fiscal year of 2013, Agilent expects revenue of $6.9 billion to $7.1 billion and earnings of $2.70 to $3.00 per share.At the end of January the company held cash and cash equivalents of $2.45 billion. The share price's 52-week range was $35.32 - $46.28.Agilent is a strong company that deserves investor's attention. The addition of Dako, especially with its growing, worldwide diagnostics business, will make it even stronger.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1187761,24361,2013-02-19T10:36:41-05:00,,"As a high-quality company with strong share in most of its addressed markets, Agilent (NYSE:A) doesn't frequently get all that cheap. The initial reaction to a weaker-than-expected fiscal first quarter has been pretty restrained as of this writing, but investors may want to sharpen their pencils and get ready to move on this name. Agilent has cyclical volatility and exposure to weaker government spending, but represents a good quality growth name at the right price.For Fiscal Q1, Most Of The Surprises Were UnwelcomeContrary to the expectations built up by the reports from Danaher (NYSE:DHR), Thermo Fisher (NYSE:TMO), Waters (NYSE:WAT), and National Instruments (NASDAQ:NATI), Agilent's fiscal first quarter was pretty mediocre, with surprising weakness in the electronic measurement business (EMG).Revenue was up 3% as reported, but down 2% on an organic basis and just a bit shy of analyst expectations. The largest business, EMG, was down 7% on an organic basis, with surprising weakness in wireless. Chemical Analysis (CAG) was also sluggish (down 1%) as weak environmental results and flat food and petrochemical demand weighed down good results in forensics. Life Sciences (LSG) was surprisingly strong, up about 3%, on good pharma demand, while Diagnostics (DGG) was up 4% on better-than-expected results at Dako.Margins came in a little soft this quarter as well. Agilent's gross margin was flat from last year, and slightly better than expected. Adjusted operating income was down 8%, though, and the operating margin was about a half-point weaker than expected. Given that Agilent saw late quarter order/shipment delay requests from customers in the EMG business, I suspect that Agilent management was put in a situation where they had to make certain expenditures on the assumption of on-plan revenue performance and then couldn't trim them back when the revenue shifted out of the quarter.History Suggests That EMG Will Get Better SoonHistorically, Agilent's performance in the test and measurement business has tracked the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) with about a one-quarter lag. What's more, both Danaher and National Instruments were relatively positive on these businesses, though in the context of challenging overall markets.Agilent's problems (its 7% revenue decline was worse than the 2% contraction at Danaher) likely stemmed from the company's higher exposure to communications, particularly the wireless handset market. Anritsu, another test and measurement company with significant communications exposure, had a more Agilent-like relative performance. Certainly investors have gotten a little more nervous of late, as even twin titans Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) have looked mortal when it comes to handset growth.At this point, I'm not willing to throw in the towel on this business. This quarter was disappointing, but the book-to-bill was decent (orders were down 1%) and business activity should pick up as 2013 rolls on. Even so, the company's exposure to the defense, semiconductor, and general industrial markets are risk factors and if the wireless market gets any worse, Agilent's numbers will have to go down.Life Sciences Holding Up Pretty WellAlthough academic and government spending was pretty flat, Agilent turned out a relatively good performance in the life sciences business. Although Danaher's Sciex saw 12% growth, that division got a boost from new product introductions. Compared to Waters (up less than 1%) and Thermo Fisher (up 3% in Analytical Tech), Agilent definitely held its own. While sluggishness in the liquid chromatography and mass spec bears watching (and could be vulnerable to bigger federal budget cuts), the company's strong position in sequencing sample prep is a good recurrent business tied to the ongoing sequencing growth at Illumina (NASDAQ:ILMN) and Life Tech (NASDAQ:LIFE).Can Dako Be Another Beckman Coulter?When Agilent spent over $2 billion for Dako in 2012, it was definitely a deal with the long term in mind. Not unlike Beckman Coulter (which was bought by Danaher), Dako's private equity owners let its portfolio and technology stagnate and didn't reinvest enough capital (or reinvest it effectively) back into the business.Even still, the company retained the #2 position in advanced staining (with more than double the share of Danaher's Leica and more than three times the share of Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT)). Likewise, the company has a good business in immunohistochemistry and at least some presence in in situ hybridization. Maybe just as important, the company has manufacturing facilities, research labs, and an infrastructure to work with the FDA and European regulators.I don't think Agilent will have quite as much low-hanging fruit to pick in terms of operational inefficiencies as Danaher did with Beckman. Expectations for Dako on the Street are pretty modest, though, and the company looks like a good fit with Agilent's corporate culture. It's also worth noting that the development and approval timelines in diagnostics are much more conducive to a relatively quick turnaround in comparison to the drug or device sectors.Addressing The Right Markets, But The Growth Won't Be SteadyOver the long term, it's not hard to see growth potential across Agilent's many businesses. Semiconductors and mobile phones are not going away, and industrial markets are increasingly incorporating more advanced electronic components. While the company's overall business is a little more skewed to instrumentation (versus consumables) than I might like, I think the company's long-term revenue growth rate will approach 5%. Keep in mind that it likely won't be a steady climb, though - it is almost impossible to serve markets like aerospace, defense, and semiconductors and not absorb the cyclicality.I also believe that Agilent has room to deliver further operating margin and cash conversion improvements. All told, I see the free cash flow margin moving into the mid and then high teens, helping fuel close to 7% free cash flow growth. As an aside, I see more revenue growth potential at Danaher, but less margin/cash conversion potential, so Agilent actually ends up as the stronger growth story over the long term.The Bottom LineAgilent doesn't share Danaher's reputation as a value-adding conglomerate, and the combination of the test and measurement businesses with the life science and diagnostics businesses doesn't always make for the best match in terms of what investors want in growth, margin, and predictability. What that means to me, then, is that Agilent is a strong value-building company that will occasionally trade at an appealing discount to long-term fair value.On the basis of that 7% growth assumption, Agilent's fair value would seem to be around $50. That doesn't make it the greatest bargain today, but it looks pretty solid relative to the peers it has trailed over the past year like Danaher, NATI, Thermo, and Waters. While I might personally try to hold out for a 20% discount to fair value before buying, it's easy to ""out-clever"" yourself that way and these shares have pretty good potential even at today's price.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The measurement company which provides bio-analytical and electronic measurement solutions reported its fourth quarter results on Monday.Fourth Quarter ResultsAgilent Technologies reported fourth quarter revenues of $1.77 billion, up 2% on the year before. Orders during the quarter came in unchanged at $1.75 billion, for a book-to-bill ratio of 0.99. Analysts expected Agilent to report revenues of $1.76 billion.The company reported fourth quarter GAAP earnings of $425 million, up from $289 million last year. Earnings per share rose from $0.82 last year to $1.20 per share this quarter. Net earnings were boosted by a $227 million tax benefit.Non-GAAP income came in at $303 million, or $0.86 per diluted share, thereby comfortably beating analysts expectations of $0.80 per share for the quarter.CEO Bill Sullivan commented on the results:Detailed InformationLife SciencesRevenues for the life science business came in unchanged at $401 million. Orders came in at $417 million, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.04. Gross margins rose 4 percent to 53%, resulted in an operating income growth of 25% to $71 million.Chemical AnalysisRevenues for the chemical analysis business fell 2.7% to $394 million. Orders were unchanged at $421 million, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.07. Gross margins rose a percent to 53% for an unchanged operating income of $97 million.Electronic MeasurementRevenues for the electronic measurement division fell 4.6% to $816 million, with orders falling to $755 million, for a book-to-bill ratio of 0.92. Operating margins fell by a percent to 57%, with operating income falling to $189 million.Diagnostics and GenomicsThe diagnostics division reported an incredible 126% revenue growth to $156 million. Orders rose to $158 million, for a book-to-bill ratio of 1.01. Operating income rose to $26 million, with gross margins coming in unchanged at 63%. Growth in the segment was driven by the $2.2 billion acquistion of Danish Dako.OutlookFor the first quarter of its fiscal 2013, the company expects revenues to come in between $1.68 and $1.70 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to come in between $0.65 and $0.67 per share.Analysts expected Agilent to guide for first quarter revenues of $1.73 billion on which the company was expected to earn $0.76 per share.For the full year of its fiscal 2013, Agilent expects to generate revenues to come in between $7.0 and $7.2 billion. The company guides for non-GAAP earnings of $2.80-$3.10 per share.Analysts thought that Agilent could earn $3.34 per share for the full year of its fiscal 2013 on revenues of $7.17 billion.ValuationAgilent ended its fourth quarter with $2.4 billion in cash and equivalents. The company operates with roughly $2.4 billion in short and long term debt, for a flat net cash position.Full year revenues for its fiscal 2012 came in at $6.9 billion. Agilent reported a net profit of $1.15 billion, or $3.27 per diluted share.The market currently values Agilent at $12.8 billion. This values the company at 1.9 times 2012s annual revenues and 11-12 times annual earnings. The company trades at 1.8 times 2013s annual revenues and 12-13 times annual non-GAAP earnings. Historically, the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings have not been extremely large.Agilent initiated a $0.10 quarterly dividend earlier this year, for an annual dividend yield of 1.1%.Some Historical PerspectiveYear to date, shares of Agilent are trading with very modest gains of 5%. Shares started the year around $35 in January and quickly rose to $46 during spring. Shares fell back to $35 during the summer, and are currently exchanging hands at $37 per share.Shares of Agilent traded around the $35 mark during 2007 and 2008, and fell to lows of $14 in 2009 during the financial crisis. Shares quickly advanced to $53 in 2011, after which shares lost roughly a third of their value. Between its fiscal 2009 and 2012, Agilent reported a 53% growth in revenues coming in at $6.9 billion in 2012. The company reported a $31 million loss in 2009, followed by a $1.15 billion profit this year.Investment ThesisInvestors are slightly disappointed with a rather modest weak outlook for the coming year. The valuation of 1.8 times annual revenues and 12-13 times annual non-GAAP earnings is fairly attractive. Shares of competitors Thermo Fisher (TMO) and Danaher (DHR) trade at 1.9 and 2.3 times annual revenues, respectively. These competitors trade at 20 and 17 times annual earnings.Agilent has plenty of liquidity, some 18% of its market capitalization consist out of cash and equivalents, and it operates with a flat net debt position. The business gradually grows, driven by bolt-on acquisition including that of Dako. The strong financial position allowed the company to initiate a modest quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share.I think current levels offer a compelling opportunity. Shares are fairly valued despite the weakness at the large electronic measurement division. Furthermore, there is financial room for share repurchases and future dividend hikes.Agilent offers long term value at these levels.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

701521,32321,2012-07-04T08:10:38-04:00,,"Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A) produces measurement and diagnostic devices for three main divisions: life sciences, chemicals, and electronic. The company was spun off from Hewlett-Packard Co. (NYSE:HPQ) a little more than 10 years ago to focus on its own core business.Beginning around 2009, the company began a major restructuring program to reduce costs and streamline its operations. This included a decent number of brand divestitures. These operations have been fruitful leading to approximately 20 CAGR revenue since beginning 2009, and even greater proportional increases in net income. The company has recently pursued some acquisitions notably in the form of Varian, which increased its brand presence in the life sciences division.Agilent attracted my attention by satisfying many of the value propositions I screen for: E/P twice the rate of the risk free rate, P/E ratio less than 40% of the max P/E over the past 5 years, current ratio above two and tangible book value greater than total debt. I got these from Benjamin Graham. Agilent satisfied all of these metrics and further piqued my interest with an 8+% FCF yield.The company's balance sheet is in excellent shape. Its cash and short-term investments have been growing steadily over the past four years and the company would have an extra $1.5B if it paid off all of its long-term debt with cash now. The company has decreased its debt significantly over the past two years after finishing its restructuring. Consequently, the company is not in serious danger if there is a major market downturn. In fact, the company feels strongly enough about its financials that it has initiated a 40 cent dividend for the first time.The reason the company has so much cash is that the money is made abroad, and repatriating earnings would subject these funds to significant income taxes. However, this is already being taken into account by the markets as evidenced the 2Q earnings conference call. Nonetheless, they already make good use of the cash by being able to pay for expenses locally and investing in the brand.The company's presence abroad also lets it take advantage of many tax holidays. This has resulted in it paying an astronomical low level of taxes (less than 10% of taxable income). This is coupled with net operating losses of $272MM, allowing the company to continue to pay low taxes for the foreseeable future even if tax rates rise. This situation makes Agilent extremely well placed to take advantage of any revenue growth.The company is also well positioned to take advantage of future revenue growth because of its efficiency. With net profit margin=15%, gross margin=53%, operating margin=16% and ROE=29%, Agilent has greater margins than its competitors Thermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) and Danaher (NYSE:DHR). Margins could easily improve in the future because Agilent has large fixed costs allowing marginal increases in revenue to have a significant impact. Margin growth could be a catalyst time goes by.Looking forward the company is well positioned to take advantage of a variety of trends. In its electronic measurement division, the company will receive a significant amount of revenue from the movement of mobile platforms from 3G to 4G. The company also has exposure to the growing area of DNA/RNA analysis.The company sells equipment to companies in the communication, defense, pharma, research/academia, food, chemical energy, and semi conductor industries. In this way, Agilent becomes a great way to get exposure to a variety of industries.More significantly, Agilent becomes a way to bet on technology in general. For example, it is difficult to predict if the Droid or I-Phone platform will win. However, we know that mobile connectivity will increase and Agilent allows one to take advantage of this. This is evidenced by the improving book to sale ratio of 1.1 currently for the company, and the $100MM increase in backlogs for the company. This indicates strong demand for the goods and a good opportunity to improve earnings.There are definitely risks to the thesis. Even though the company's balance sheet it strong, it may not result in any increase in the stock's price as the markets take their time in waking up to issues such as these. Additionally, the company is quite cyclical in nature as evidenced by the company's poor operating results in 2009. However, the company is better positioned and more efficient than it was. The business is R&D intensive, which does not always pan out; however, Agilent has had strong history of production. Additionally, the company's products require a significant amount of lead time, making it not most nimble in responding to changes in the economy. The company's inventory has gradually increased, but not rapidly, and as mentioned the company does have a significant backlog. The company is not at risk in terms of currency because its revenue streams are quite diversified and it does hedge.Nonetheless, Agilent, a company with long-term growth can currently be bought at an EV/EBITDA of around 8x, and a P/E ex cash below 12x, while the predicted growth rate is around 12%. This appears to be a strong value proposition for a well run and diversified company.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
562871,25026,2012-05-05T16:06:05-04:00,,"With long term interest rates hovering near all-time lows, we continue to sit atop a massive rally in U.S. Treasuries that saw bond ETFs (like the iShares Barclays 20+ Year Treasury ETF (NASDAQ:TLT)) return up to 30% in 2011. From a historical standpoint, it seems unlikely that long-term rates will remain this low indefinitely. So is it just a matter of time before they rise back up?In short, I'd say yes. At only one point in the past 130 years - around the time of World War II - have long term Treasury yields been as low as they are now. Nominal yields on the 10, 20 and 30 Year Treasury bonds are 1.98%, 2.76%, and 3.16% respectively. In real terms, the yield on the 10 Year remains negative. As such, it's easy to say with certainty that ""rates will rise in the future;"" the real question is when, and by how much. The Financial Forecast Center publishes these forecasts:It's important, however, to note that long term interest rates could easily remain at current levels, or fall lower, before they go back up as I expect they will. The Fed has openly expressed a commitment to keeping at least short-term rates near zero through 2014. But other forces, such as investors' expectations and general market sentiment, are at work as well. Comparing the performance of TLT, the iShares Barclays 20+ Year Treasury ETF, with that of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY), the inverse relationship between them during bear markets is quite pronounced, as investors flock to treasuries in fear and push up prices:So what's the most efficient investment strategy for capitalizing upon this expected rise in long-term interest rates, granted the possibility of a potential decrease or lack of movement in rates in the meantime? For most investors, purchasing individual bonds is more cumbersome than buying bond-focused exchange traded funds (ETF) or exchange traded notes (ETN) , so we will focus on strategies using the latter. Given the inverse correlation between yields and bond prices, the following strategies would allow us to profit from a rise in long-term yields:ETF- Short an ETF like the iShares Barclays 20+ Year Treasury ETF, TLT.- Buy the ProShares Short 20+ Year Treasury ETF (NYSEARCA:TBF), which is the 1x inverse of TLT.- Buy the ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury ETF (NYSEARCA:TBT), which is the 2x inverse of TLT. This would allow us to achieve the nearly the same returns as buying TBF, but using half as much capital.- Use Options to buy puts on TLT or buy calls on TBT and/or TBF.ETN- Buy an ETN like the iPath US Treasury Long Bond Bear ETN (BATS:DLBS).- Short the iPath US Treasury Long Bond Bull ETN (NASDAQ:DLBL-OLD).To give an idea of how these vehicles perform relative to each other, look at this graph:All these strategies would yield a profit in the event of rates rising - but as far as efficiency, using options on the most leveraged vehicle (in this case TBT) would yield the highest potential returns on capital. A long-only call option strategy does, however, involve the risk of losing all your capital; for those who would rather hold the actual ETF or ETN, that would allow you to retain at least a portion of the investment's value in the event rates remaining the same or falling lower. But the way I see it, I want the most bang for my buck, especially when I am confident in the trade. Why spend $1,800 buying 100 shares of TBT when you could buy an $18 January 2014 call option for $330?So, let's move forward with the TBT call option strategy for capitalizing upon a rise in interest rates. For a trade like this with a long time horizon, we want a distant option expiration - for TBT this is January 18, 2014. Now we need to select a strike price. We are looking for a balance between safety (purchasing deep in-the-money calls means we have a lower break-even price for TBT) and cost (higher strike call options are cheaper). We must also incorporate our expectation for where TBT will reach or end up come January 2014.The following data points show how TBT's price has moved in relation to the yield of the 20 Year US Treasury bond:With all these things considered, I'm going with the January 2014 $18 Call option, costing $3.20 per share (or $320 for one contract). Assuming rates on the 20 Year Treasury rise to 3.6% between now and January 2014 - which seems entirely feasible - TBT would likely be around $30. If TBT reaches $30, a holder of the aforementioned call option would see a profit of $880 per contract - more than double the initial investment.If long term rates rise even further, with yields on the 20 Year rising above 4%, TBT could easily reach $40, which it did in February 2011. In this scenario, each $18 Jan 2014 TBT call option would yield a profit of $1,880 per contract - more than 5x the initial investment.Assuming we purchase $100,000 worth of these call options, our returns would be as follows:Start - May 2012Buy 312 TBT $18 Jan '14 Call Options @ $320/contractCost = 312 x $320 = $99,840End - Jan 2014TBT @ $20 = $37,440 loss = (-37.5%) total returnTBT @ $30 = $274,560 profit = 167% total returnTBT @ $40 = $586,560 profit = 467% total returnIn conclusion, we have a great opportunity to capitalize upon a rise in long-term interest rates over the next few years. The use of options on leveraged ETFs creates the potential for massive returns on investment. Although this is an inherently risky strategy, I would say the reward is commensurate with the risk!Disclosure: I am long TBT."

Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.B) annual shareholder meeting, commonly referred to as the Capitalist Woodstock (though they go light on the mud and nudity in Omaha, Nebraska) will be held this weekend and then on Monday morning, Buffett, who in recent years has never shirked from a camera, will be headlining CNBC (NYSE:GE) for (count 'em) three hours.With the financial world consumed with all things Warren, investors will be picking through his statements for hints of what is to come. They should save their picking. In recent years, Buffett, an undeniable genius, has turned into a platitude machine. At his shareholder meeting, questions from the public tend to be marshmallows. He is fielding questions from real live analysts this year, but I'll believe a true change when I see it. Moreover, there are issues of health and succession to belabor, as well as calls for buybacks to address until everyone is blue in the gills.As for the direction of the economy, Buffett isn't quite a disinterested party. His holdings are so big and vast that Buffett has transformed over time into a cheerleader for the American economy. Even when he is negative, he tends not to be concerned with items that will give traders a notion of where the economy might be headed.In the past year, his most noted public statement was a call for the ""Buffett Rule"" that, in either national fiscal policy brilliance or a transparent bit of pandering, presses for higher taxes for the wealthy. But for a trader, looking for guidance, that and a quarter will get you on the subway. And there are no subways in Nebraska.In trying to interpret how recent earnings and economic statistics will impact the coming week, any traders living by his wits risks death. After all, where in the wide, world of conflicting signs is the pattern?Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) did well in China, where another stalwart -- McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) -- fell. General Motors (NYSE:GM) was a mixed bag all by itself, while jobs number, recently welcomed as signs of recovery, looked more like impending doom. With another week of earnings on deck, the increasingly uncertain eyes of traders will fall on Buffett.So investors are waiting on Warren.

Both firms have fairly strong free cash flow yields and are structurally well positioned to gain from a recovery. Momentum from recent execution only further reinforces the bullish outlook.From a multiples perspective, Agilent is the cheaper of the two. It trades at a respective 15.4x and 12.6x past and forward earnings, with a dividend yield of 0.9%. Danaher, on the other hand, trades at a respective 18.7x and 14.1x past and forward earnings, with a dividend yield of 0.2%. Agilent also has a free cash flow yield that is 70 bps higher at 7%.At the fourth quarter earnings call, Danaher's management noted excellent progress for the year:EPS of $0.71 was strong even after accounting for $120M worth of restructuring. It was particularly impressive how management grew margins by a staggering 200 bps y-o-y during the quarter. And while organic growth was modest in 2011, the Beckman Coulter integration is proving to be more of catalyst than what many expected. The purchase is well on its way to realizing the $250M cost synergy target for 2012 and being accretive shortly. I anticipate 100 bps margin improvement just from the acquisition. Furthermore, Danaher also is one of the most defensive plays among technical instrument producers. It has 40% less volatility than Agilent, for example. On the other hand, the exposure to Europe limits earnings potential.Consensus estimates for Danaher's EPS forecast that it will grow by 16.6% to $3.30 in 2012 and then by 11.8% and 12.5% in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 15x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $3.63, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $54.45, implying 5.3% upside. Agilent similarly had a successful recent quarter. Orders grew 4% to an impressive $1.8B and earnings per share of $0.84 beat guidance. The firm has one of the most diversified portfolio of products and is particularly well-positioned in life-sciences. Agilent is expected to outperform in organic growth, R&D and margin expansion. The flexible cost base grants it some insulation against cyclical economic weaknesses.Consensus estimates for Agilent's EPS forecast that it will accelerate, growing by 7.8% to $3.18 in 2012 and then by 9.1% and 10.4% in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 15x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $3.37, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $50.55, implying 15.5% upside.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

In Agilent Technologies's (NYSE:A) case, we think the firm is undervalued, with our fair value coming in at $49 per share (our report on Agilent Technologies and other companies can be found here).For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for more information on our methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Agilent Technologies scores a 3 on our scale (reflecting its undervaluation, but very bearish technicals).Our Report on Agilent TechnologiesClick to enlarge images  Investment Considerations  Investment HighlightsAgilent Technologies earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. We expect the firm's return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) to expand to 67.9% from 43.2% during the next two years.Although we think the firm's DCF valuation indicates a potential attractive investment opportunity, we'd be more comfortable investing in the firm if it was more attractively priced on a relative basis versus peers as well.Agilent Technologies has a good combination of strong free cash flow generation and manageable financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 15.9% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 1.7 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 33.7%.The firm posts a VBI score of 3. We don't find the firm that attractive based on this measure, and we'd grow more constructive if it registered an 8 or higher on our scale.Click to enlargeEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Agilent Technologies' 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 25.9%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.7%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Click to enlargeCash Flow AnalysisClick to enlarge  Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Agilent Technologies' free cash flow margin has averaged about 11.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website. At Agilent Technologies, cash flow from operations increased significantly from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 47% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Agilent Technologies' shares are worth between $35.00 - $63.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $49 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 17.2 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 12.1 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 4.4% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 4.6%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 25.7%, which is above Agilent Technologies 's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.2% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Agilent Technologies, we use a 9.7% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Click to enlargeMargin of Safety Analysis Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $49 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Agilent Technologies . We think the firm is attractive below $35 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $63 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Agilent Technologies' fair value to be about $49 per share at this point in time. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Agilent Technologies's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $67 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $49 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity, less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Click to enlargePro Forma Financial StatementsClick to enlarge      Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: EMR is included in the portfolio of our Dividend Growth Newsletter."

237014,20568,2010-11-16T04:01:00-05:00,,"Agilent Technologies’ (NYSE:A) fourth quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus by 5 cents, or 8.3%. Revenue growth and margin expansion helped drive results in the last quarter. While the gross margin declined sequentially after 5 quarters of increase, Agilent saw both operating and net margins continuing to expand.RevenueAgilent’s revenue grew 14.5% sequentially and 35.7% year over year. Excluding the impact of Varian, Agilent’s revenues were up 27.3% sequentially and 35.0% from last year, much better than management’s expectations of a 16-19% year-over-year increase excluding Varian. While sequential growth was evenly balanced across geographies, increase from the year-ago quarter was varied.Asia witnessed the strongest growth at 39.5%, followed by Europe, which grew 35.7% and then the Americas, which grew 32.2%. Agilent’s strong growth in Asia was fueled by China and India, which grew 37% and 31%, respectively.All end-markets were up from the year-ago quarter, although the strongest by far was Petro/Chemical testing (up 103.6%), followed by Forensics/Environmental and Academic/Government, both of which grew 81.0%. Food Safety was the only area to see triple-digit sequential growth (up 104.7%), with industrial and semi following closely behind at 92.5% growth. The Communications, Academic/Government and Petro/Chemical testing markets declined sequentially.Revenue by Segment and Product LineAt the beginning of the fiscal year, management changed the reporting structure. Therefore, Agilent is now reporting results in three segments—Chemical Analysis, Life Sciences and Electronic Measurement.The Chemical Analysis segment generated 25% of fourth quarter revenue. The Food and Environment markets fueled the increase in the last quarter, helped by resurgence in Energy and Petro/Chemical markets. Segment revenue was up a whopping 72.9% from a year ago and up 18.2% sequentially. The platform (GC/MS and ICP/MS instrumentation) grew strongly.The Life Sciences segment generated 27% of revenue, up 35.1% from the year-ago quarter and 15.2% sequentially. Excluding Varian and Hycor, revenues were up 17% from the fourth quarter of 2009. Both Academic and Pharma markets helped growth in the last quarter. Academic was greatly helped by stimulus programs, both in the U.S. and internationally.Agilent stated that Pharma companies continue to restructure and transfer operations to low-cost regions. Liquid chromatography platforms grew 21%, driven by the 1290 and 1260 tools. The LCMS and genomics lines also grew. Additionally, Agilent saw continued demand for the recently launched SureSelect sample preparation category.Agilent’s Electronic Measurement segment continued on the growth path. This is the company’s largest segment, with a revenue contribution of 55% in the last quarter. The 22.6% increase from the year-ago quarter came from the general purpose business, largely offset by continued weakness in the communications business. Part of the softness is on account of the network solutions disposal.The business continues to be driven by 3G deployments, both on the infrastructure side and on the handset side. Segment revenue was up 10.4% sequentially, fueled by the general purpose business. While most of the strength was attributable to industrial, computing and semiconductor markets, aerospace and defense markets also witnessed very strong growth.Agilent remains one of the largest providers of spectrum analyzers and oscilloscopes, which continued to grow in the last quarter. The company’s high performance oscilloscopes witnessed particularly strong demand. Agilent believes that share gains continued in the last quarter.OrdersAgilent's orders grew strong by double-digits in the last quarter, compared to both sequential and year-over-year bases. The strength was driven by the Chemical Analysis segment, which saw sequential and year-over-year increases of 14.6% and 68.5%, respectively.Life Sciences increased 19.7% and 33.0%, respectively from the previous and year-ago quarters. Electronic Measurement was the slowest segment, although here too revenues were up 9.1% and 19.6%, respectively from the previous and year-ago quarters.Agilent’s book-to-bill ratio was positive in all segments, resulting in backlog accumulation.MarginsThe pro forma gross margin for the quarter was 55.2%, down 76 basis points (bps) sequentially and 37 bps from the year-ago quarter. The operating expenses of $572 million were up 9.1% sequentially and 14.6% year over year.However, the operating margin, at 19.1% continued to expand, increasing 99 bps sequentially and 628 bps from the year-ago quarter. The sequential increase was driven by lower SG&A expenses (as a percentage of sales), partially offset by the slightly higher COGS and R&D expenses (as a percentage of sales). However, the year-over-year comparison was helped by a significant reduction in both SG&A and R&D, partially offset by slightly higher COGS.The year-over-year increase in operating margin was entirely on account of the Electronic Measurement segment, which saw a margin expansion of 1,361 bps. The Chemical Analysis margin dropped 545 bps, while the Life Sciences margin dropped 35 bps. Both Electronic Measurement and Chemical Analysis margins expanded sequentially.Net IncomeAgilent generated pro forma net income of $228 million, or a 14.4% net income margin compared to $191 million or 13.8% in the previous quarter and $111 million, or 9.5% in the fourth quarter of last year. Our pro forma estimate excludes restructuring charges, acquisition-related costs, amortization of intangibles, impairment of long-lived assets, gain on sale of the network solutions business and other one-time items on a tax adjusted basis.On a fully diluted GAAP basis, the company recorded a net income of $232 million ($0.66 per share) compared to income of $205 million ($0.58 per share) in the previous quarter and $25 million ($0.07 per share) in the year-ago quarter.Balance SheetThe balance sheet shows a net debt position of $1.04 billion. The debt-to-total-capitalization ratio was 54.2%, which is not bad. The interest coverage ratio is 11.2X, which means the company should not have trouble servicing the debt. The interest coverage ratio has continued to increase over the past 3 quarters.Inventories at quarter-end were up 4.1%, with annualized inventory turns increasing from around 3.5X to 4.0X. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) went down from around 52 to around 50. Agilent generated around $367 million of cash from operations, spent $32 million on capex and $51 million on share repurchases.GuidanceAgilent expects fiscal first quarter revenue of $1.53 billion to $1.55 billion (a 2-3% sequential decline). The non-GAAP EPS for the quarter is expected to come in at around 55 to 57 cents.For fiscal 2011, Agilent expects revenues of $6.1 billion to $6.3 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $2.30 to $2.50 a share.Our TakeWe believe Agilent shares will benefit from a strengthening domestic market as well as a growing opportunity pipeline abroad, especially in Asian countries, such as China and India. The company has a very well-diversified business and has prudently supplemented organic growth with acquisitions.Agilent sports a Zacks #2 Rank, implying a short-term Hold recommendation, similar to competitors such as Ametek Inc. (NYSE:AME). We are slightly more positive about short-term prospects for competitors Cognex Corp (NASDAQ:CGNX) and Itron Inc (NASDAQ:ITRI), which are Zacks #1 Ranked (short-term Strong Buy recommendation).Our longer-term view (3-6 months) remains Neutral at this point, given the softening in the equipment sector, which could have some impact on Agilent’s testing business."
205636,23048,2010-05-18T04:23:11-04:00,,"By Carolyn AustinInstrumentation and measurement company Agilent (NYSE: A) reported second-quarter earnings per share of $0.43 after the bell Monday, beating analysts' estimates by $0.2 per share (see transcript). The company reported earnings per share of $0.13 for the year-ago quarter.Revenue came in at $1.27 billion, up over 16 percent from one year ago, on orders of $1.35 billion, a YOY increase of 31 percent. This is another profitable quarter for the company. In the prior quarter, revenues increased 4 percent and net income increased 23 percent. The company had a $100 million net loss in 2009 for a negative $0.29 per share.The company raised its earnings guidance to $1.70 to $1.75 per share for the 2010 fiscal year. Earlier this month, Agilent completed an acquisition of Varian, which is expected to add $.08 cents to earnings for the year.Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and CEO, commented, “Overall, Agilent had a very solid second quarter. From a market perspective, we saw year-over-year revenue growth in every region and most of the key markets that we serve. All of our businesses performed well.”The stock traded higher in after-hours trading.Comments: Agilent is a company doing the right things and doing things right. The company reduced inventory, completed a financial restructuring that puts them on track to save $525 million for the year, and absorbed over 40 million in various write-offs for the quarter.Agilent businesses include chemical analysis, life sciences, electronics and semiconductors, all of which showed strength. This is a solid company with good growth prospects, but on the charts the company closed below its 50-day moving average and stochastic is bearish. Still the company is stronger than many of its peers, although much of the upside potential looks priced into the stock already. The stock is dollars short of its 52-week high at the end of April, but volume is fairly consistent so expect trading in a narrow range for the near-term. But a good stock to watch for a good entry point.Disclosure: No positions"
192579,20568,2010-03-08T17:19:24-05:00,,"Following stellar results in the fiscal first quarter ended January 2010, Agilent Technologies’ (NYSE:A) CFO, Adrian Dillon, left the company. However, despite Dillon’s long stint at Agilent, share prices did not reflect concern due to his departure. This is mainly because the company’s end markets are seeing strong recovery that Agilent is well positioned to take advantage of.Stronger MarketsRevenue was ahead of the Zacks Consensus in the last quarter, with North America stabilizing, Europe benefiting from currency gains and Asia continuing to grow strongly.The company also changed its reporting structure to better reflect the growing prospects in the previously reported Bio-Analytical segment. This segment has now been split into Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis. The rest of the revenue was reported under the Electronic Measurement segment.Food, petrochemicals, forensics and environment verticals are driving the company’s strength in the Chemical Analysis business. All of these markets show secular growth trends, both in developed and developing countries.Agilent is seeing very strong orders from all over Asia and particularly China. The company’s strong position in China could help it gain market share. Additionally, new products in the Life Sciences segment are driving strength at pharmaceutical, academic and government customers. These segments have held up relatively well even during the recession.The Electronic Measurement segment suffered on account of the recession, although we now expect growth to return on the back of double-digit order increases from the semiconductor, computing and industrial markets. The company is the leading provider of network analyzers and spectrum analyzers into these markets and also has a comprehensive portfolio of oscilloscopes.We believe the momentum in these markets will continue through the rest of fiscal 2010. Although communications testing revenue (specifically handset testing) declined double-digits in the last quarter and is expected to decline again in the current quarter, we believe this is near-term softness. Gartner expects handsets to grow 11-13% this year, which means testing demand will accelerate as we move through the year.Healthier ProfitsMargins in the last quarter benefited from higher volumes, increased efficiencies and cost reductions from restructuring actions.Over the last few years, the company has reorganized the business a couple of times with the primary objective of streamlining operations and focusing management attention on core competencies. Management expects the latest $325 million restructuring of the Electronic Measurement segment to be more or less completed in the first half of fiscal 2010. This is expected to raise segment operating margins from the current 9% level to the 12% level at an annual revenue runrate of $2.4 billion.Since the Electronic Measurement segment generates over 50% of revenue and the rest of the business generates significantly higher margins, the leaner cost structure will help the company report strong profits profits significantly.Guidance is StrongAlthough management adopted a conservative tone, a tentative guidance of 10% revenue growth for fiscal year 2010 was provided. Management also stated that full-year earnings could be expected to come in at around $1.65-$1.70.Estimate Trends & RevisionsAs a result of the performance in the last quarter, Agilent’s first quarter earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6 cents, or 18.75%. The positive surprise was less than in the two preceding quarters, when results exceeded guidance by more than 30%. On average, results have beaten the Zacks Consensus by 20.69% in the last four quarters.We believe the accuracy of estimates for 2010 will continue to improve, as there is now greater certainty of a rebound. This is the reason for the relatively smaller surprise in the last quarter. Moreover, analysts have been quick to revise estimates after the company reported earnings, so that upside potential at this point looks limited.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter is 41 cents, up 7 cents since the company reported earnings. Fiscal third quarter and full-year estimates have also been raised. Accordingly, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2010 is currently $1.68 (the middle of the guided range). This is an increase of 22 cents since the company reported earnings and a clear indication that estimates have been revised to give effect to the stronger outlook.In a NutshellWe believe the much stronger outlook and the improvement in Agilent’s all around performance is already reflected in analyst expectations and consequently, share prices. Further upside will therefore be limited, in our opinion. This is the rationale behind the Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Hold) and long-term Neutral recommendation on Agilent shares."
156574,21445,2009-08-17T13:18:38-04:00,,"Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) is expected to report Q3 earnings after the market close on Monday, August 17, with a conference call scheduled for 4:45 pm ET. The consensus estimate is 11c for EPS and $1.02B for revenue, according to First Call. Management has not provided EPS guidance for the quarter. FBR Capital is modeling for 13c EPS on a 25% organic revenue decline, driven by declines in the company’s late-cycle technology, telecom, and electronics markets which make up 58% of total revenues. Similar to its test and measurement peers, FBR expects Agilent to report some indications of stabilizing in its life sciences and academic/R&D-related markets, but continued deterioration in the industrials and communications markets, which comprise 35% of Agilent’s total portfolio. Pricing pressure started to build last quarter, particularly in Agilent’s weaker Electronic Measurement markets but also on the Bio-Analytical Measurement side. FBR will continue to carefully watch for signs that pricing power is becoming a larger issue for Agilent. With its predominately mid/late-cycle mix, Agilent’s results tend to lag a macroeconomic recovery by six to nine months, and FBR still prefer stocks with more defensive early-cycle exposure, such as 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Tyco (TYC). Looking forward: FBR expects Q4 EPS guidance of 15c - 20c versus FBR's estimates of 17c and 20c for consensus. The firms estimate includes a 24% Q4 organic revenue decline, in line with the Q3 decline. The seasonal sales increase into Agilent’s Q4 should be a plus. FBR Capital is positive on the pending acquisition of Varian (VARI), which the firm believes should complement Agilent’s life sciences product offering. The pending acquisition has been an impressive catalyst for the stock since it was announced on July 27. FBR believes its initial FY10 accretion estimate of 15c-20c could prove conservative. The firm also understands that Agilent management will not be able to discuss anything regarding the pending acquisition on the conference call due to regulatory restrictions. Key issues for the conference call: forward guidance, commentary on market share and pricing, an update on the company's restructuring initiatives and most noteworthy would be any commentary regarding the pending Varian acquisition and its impact on Agilent. Management did provide FY09 revenue guidance on its last earnings call of down roughly 25% from the reported FY08 $5.77B."

The following day, the shares expanded those gains, closing the regular session up 14.8%.  On May 16, 2005, Agilent slipped 1.8% in night trade after the company topped Q2 revenue expectations and matching on EPS. It also offered Q3 forecasts that were in line with expectations. The shares regained some strength the next day, ending regular-hours trade up 4.2%.  Agilent lost 2.1% the night of Feb. 14, 2005 after the company beat by a penny on EPS but guided its outlook below the Street. The stock turned higher in next-day trade, ending the Feb. 15 bell-to-bell session up 1.5%.  On Nov. 11, 2004 Agilent slid 3.2% in night trade after the company reported results shy of expectations. Sellers beat it deeper into the cellar on Nov. 12, thrashing it for a 12% decline.  On Aug. 12, 2004 Agilent jumped 7.5% in evening action after the company beat expectations and said it was comfortable with its prior guidance. Those heftier after-hours gains slimmed down on Aug. 13 as Agilent closed the regular session up a more modest 4.2%.  On May 17, 2004 Agilent added 3% in night trade after the company beat on revenue, reported in-line EPS, and guided for revenue ahead of Street estimates.

156803,20568,2009-08-18T11:49:27-04:00,,"Agilent Technologies’ ([[A]] - Snapshot Report) third quarter earnings beat the consensus by 9 cents. Revenue of $1.06 billion also beat by 3.9%. Revenue declined 3.1% sequentially and 26.8% year over year. Electronic Measurement (EM) generated $524 million, down 6.1% sequentially and 35.6% year over year. The weakness in this market was driven by communications test, which declined 10.8% sequentially and 34.1% year over year. The general purpose test business fared slightly better, declining 3.0% sequentially and 8.1% year over year. The Bio-Analytical Measurement (BAM) segment generated $496 million, down 0.4% sequentially and 8.1% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was principally on account of weakness in the chemical analysis business, which declined 17.9% and further worsened by the life sciences business (down 5.3%). Food Safety continued to outperform, growing 14% from the year ago quarter. However, other parts of the chemical analysis business, such as petrochemicals, forensics and environment declined sharply driven by various factors in the respective markets. The weakness in the life sciences business was partially recession-driven and partially due to consolidation in the large pharma market. Semiconductor & Board Test (SBT) generated around $37 million, up 5.7% sequentially and down 58.9% from the year-ago quarter. The three segments generated 47%, 50% and 3% of third quarter revenue, respectively. Although the sequential increase seems to indicate a bottom in this market, the significant year-over-year decline is the result of recession-driven weakness in the electronics manufacturing space.   Although top line results remain unexciting, we are encouraged by the strengthening order patterns. BAM segment orders increased 2.5% sequentially, following two quarters of decline, EM segment orders increased 3.6% sequentially also following two quarters of decline, while SBT orders increased 63.6%, following declines in the preceding five quarters. Agilent continued to see very strong order growth in the BAM segment, although the EM segment lagged expectations. The EM book-to-bill was the highest at 1.03, followed by BAM at 0.99 and SBT at 0.97. The overall book-to-bill was 1.01, reflecting the 4.4% sequential increase in orders. Higher backlog in the EM segment more than offset small declines in BAM and SBT.    The proforma gross margin for the quarter was 53.5%, up 121 basis points (bps) from the previous quarter’s 52.3%. The operating expenses of $468 million were lower than the previous quarter’s $486 million. The operating margin was 9.3%, up 148 bps from 7.8% in the second quarter. The increase was primarily on account of lower COGS and helped by flattish R&D and SG&A expenses (as a percentage of sales). The BAM segment generated an operating margin of 2.2% (up 48 bps), the EM segment generated -0.2% (up 88 bps), while SBT generated -27.0%, up 1,869 bps). On a pro forma basis, Agilent had a net income of $70 million, or a 6.6% net income margin compared to $62 million or 5.7% in the previous quarter and $216 million, or 15.0% in the third quarter of last year. Fully diluted pro forma earnings per share (EPS) were 20 cents in the third quarter compared to 18 cents in the second and 58 cents in the year-ago quarter. The pro forma estimate in the last quarter excluded deferred stock compensation, restructuring charges, amortization of intangibles, impairment of long-lived assets and other one-time items. On a fully diluted GAAP basis, the company recorded a net loss of $19 million (6 cents per share) compared to $101 million (29 cents per share) in the previous quarter and a net profit of $169 million (45 cents per share) in the year-ago quarter.    The balance sheet shows limited liquidity, with a net debt position of $654 million. The net debt total capitalization ratio was 20.8%, which is not that bad. Inventories at quarter-end were $571 million, yielding annualized inventory turns of 3.4x. Days sales outstanding (DSOs) were 47 days. Management did not provide detailed guidance for the fourth quarter or the year. Revenue is expected to grow in-line with or slightly less than seasonal patterns indicate. However, the effects of restructuring are expected to become increasingly apparent. Accordingly, the non-GAAP EPS is expected to come in at around 20-25 cents."

The consensus estimate is 54c for EPS and $1.47B for revenue, according to First Call. On its last earnings call the company provided Q3 guidance of 52 to 56c in EPS and FY08 guidance of $2.07 to $2.15. Commentary at the time from the CEO was, ""We continue to anticipate tough conditions in U.S. markets and mixed conditions in Europe and Japan, while Asian markets are expected to remain quite robust."" Goldman expects Agilent to report solid Q3 operating earnings of 55c, at the higher-end of guidance. The firm believes there could be confusion in the market on the initial release, as Agilent is making the transition to reporting EPS including employee stock options, and will accordingly report Q3 and provide guidance on both bases. Previously, Agilent had reported operating EPS excluding ESO, which has historically been at 4c to 5c per quarter. Goldman expects underlying operating results to show the value of Agilent's diverse portfolio, both end-markets and geographic, also the resiliency of Agilent's operating model. Goldman says end-market trends are unlikely to surprise, with areas of strength including wireless R&D, food safety, Olympics, and petrochemical. In terms of potential areas of concern, Goldman believes investors will look for gross margin pressure in Electronic Measurement, ongoing computer/semi weakness, and signs of slowing in emerging markets, which is unlikely in our view. Although Goldman expects generally upbeat operating results, they still remain on the sidelines in Agilent shares ahead of the quarter, due to potential headline risk around the options expense transition."

In response to deteriorating economic conditions, particularly in electronic measurement market, Agilent lowered its Q1 EPS guidance on December 9 to a range of 28c-32c per share vs. previous guidance of 34c-38c per share. The company also lowered its Q109 revenue guidance to a range of $1.25B-$1.3B, down 7%-10% from a year earlier. Prior guidance was for a revenue range of $1.34B-$1.39B. On December 17, Agilent announced a restructuring plan of its business units that have been most severely impacted by the economic downturn and the reduction of 500 regular jobs and 300 temporary jobs. The company expects to complete a majority of the activities related to the restructuring by May 31, with the remainder expected to be completed by October 31. The reductions in workforce are expected to result in lowering annual operating expenses of approximately $165M in total. Key issues analysts expect for the conference call include forward guidance and details on demand slowdown and consolidation in the company's customer base.

(NYSE: A), together with a team from the Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences and Tongi University, discovered new insight into how adult cells can be coaxed into a pluripotent state where they act like embryonic stem cells (ESC). Pluripotent stem cells have the ability to grow into all types of tissue.The researchers observed a developmental signaling network of 16 signaling pathways, including nine that had not previously been assigned roles in maintaining or inducing pluripotency. The findings of the collaboration’s research were published as ""Yamanaka factors critically regulate the developmental signaling network in mouse embryonic stem cells"" in the journal Cell Research.Discovered in 2006, the ability of adult stem cells to attain pluripotency creates an alternative to embryonic stem cells, which have the ability naturally.The study used Agilent chromatin immunoprecipitation-on-chip (ChIP-on-chip) and gene expression microarrays to study molecules known as ""Yamanaka factors"" and their roles in inducing pluripotency in mouse cells. Agilent provided the microarray kits under a 2008 Agilent grant.ChIP-on-chip microarrays are used to observe activity at ""promoter regions"" on the genome, where chemical events activate and deactivate various genes to control cellular functioning.Disclosure: none."

Keep in mind that, in the past, analysts have typically overestimated Agilent's quarterly profits in each of the past eight periods. Citigroup expects Agilent's Q4 results toward the low-end of the mid-August guidance as proactive operating expense control, a decent starting backlog, and some end-of-year budget flush offset weakening October order trends. Managements guidance for Q1 is EPS of 40c to 44c, and sales of $1.45B to $1.5B. Citigroup sees Q1 sales guidance of -2% to -4% YoY, or 900bps below the prior 4% to 8% YoY guidance. Citigroup recently reduced its Q1 EPS estimate to 33c, below the Street's 41c estimate. The firm believes that monthly order commentary should observe abrupt mid-September order deceleration, tracking the PMI's steep Sept./Oct. pull-back, and also aligning with competitor National Instruments' (NASDAQ:NATI) Oct. 24 commentary on weak October monthly order flow. Citigroup believes Agilent will likely refrain from issuing full-year guidance until its Dec. 9 analyst day. Instead, the company should provide initial Q2 guidance which Citigroup expects will be slightly ahead of Q1's -2% to -4% YoY change.

Well basically, on the semiconductor and electronics side, when high-tech companies are designing products or providing services, they want to make sure that the products / services are working correctly. Agilent provides equipment, tools and software for them to do these tests. As semiconductor and electronic products continue to get more complex and expensive to produce, solutions that allow the companies that make them to be more effective in bringing new products to market and minimizing flaws in existing products are increasingly valuable.
On the bio-analytics side, Agilent provides products that allow companies and institutions in areas such research, pharmaceuticals, environmental, petrochemical and forensics to analyze biological and chemical components. Examples of how customers use their products include drug companies testing the composition of drugs they are developing; oil and gas companies analyzing finished oil products for quality and environmental compliance; and the Department of Homeland Security analyzing chemical compounds at the scene of a crime.
The company is headquartered in Palo Alto, CA and was originally a unit Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE: HPQ) before they were spun off and IPO’d in 1999.
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON 

There is a lot going on at the company as they continue to bear down on refining the company’s focus to be solely on the measurement market. Last year, Agilent sold off its semiconductor business (which manufactured analog and mixed signal semis, as opposed to their other division which does testing of semis) to buyout shops KKR and Silver Lake Partners for $2.66 billion. Currently, the company is also working on the spin-out of its semiconductor test unit. They filed the S-1 form (this is what you have to file with the SEC when you want to do a public stock offering) for this unit early in March under the name Verigy Pte. Based on the financials in the filing, this unit was not exactly setting the world on fire either.
Meanwhile, while all of this refocusing and divesting has been going on, the company continues to make acquisitions for the measurement side of the business. In fact, management’s stated goal is to have 2-3% of annual growth come from acquisitions. Personally, I am a bit suspicious of most acquisition activity, since a lot of times the expected “synergies"

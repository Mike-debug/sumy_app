Its legendary CEO Miles White, who has so masterfully guided it for several decades, turned over the CEO position to Abbott veteran Robert Ford effective 4/1/20.Keep the 4/1/20 date in mind. This was scheduled as an orderly transition; it was turned into a hot potato by the pandemic. Consider the timing:Hardly an auspicious beginning for Ford's inaugural term as CEO. Nonetheless, during Abbott's 7/16/20 Q2 2020 earnings call, CEO Ford showed that the company had not missed a beat. In this article, I review Q2 2020 earnings and my expectations for Abbott's future outperformance over the long term.Like investors everywhere, I have watched with dismay as COVID-19 disruptions upset established businesses. As a long-time enthusiastic investor in and supporter of Abbott, I watched with particular dismay as elective surgery bans started taking effect across the nation.I have always considered Abbott to be one highly resilient business. It had been sorely tested in recent years; the current period was supposed to be a time for the company to reap the benefits of its 2017 closings of St. Jude Medical and Alere.Now, here we are only a few years on with medical devices generating ~33% of Abbott's revenues and along comes a shuttering of elective procedures in the US, Abbott's largest market. When the company's Q1 2020 earnings report came out, I was most anxious to see how it fared. I was discouraged, but not surprised, with its suspension of guidance.As stated during the conference call, ""... given the uncertainties regarding the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic..."", this was its only responsible choice. Abbott is the epitome of a global business with operations in >160 countries.The pandemic is proving to be an outsized black swan event with devastating worldwide impact on supply chains, business operations and communications. Abbott's Q1 2020 10-Q, signed 4/29/20, described its potential pandemic impacts under its ""risk factors"" section (p. 22) as follows:Such disruptions have been writ large across the routines and prospects of most individuals, companies and nations worldwide over these last several months.Abbott's overall performance during this pandemic year has been sterling, as shown by the chart below comparing it to wider market ETFs and to the iShares U.S. Medical Devices ETF (IHI).Data by YChartsAbbott has underperformed the widely held technology Invesco QQQ ETF (QQQ) [not shown above], which some have seen as quite bubbly. In this respect, the company provides a nice point of diversification for portfolios overstuffed with high-flying tech stocks.During Abbott's Q2 2020 earnings call, it dared to set out a revised guidance for 2020 earnings per share of $3.25. This compares to its original 2020 guidance for adjusted earnings per share of $3.55-3.65 which it set out during its Q4 2019 earnings call.To put Abbott's revised 2020 guidance in perspective, I note that it is a virtual mirror of the company's Q4 2019 earnings per share guidance established at $3.24 during its Q4 2019 earnings call. Even though this revised 2020 guidance was a substantial reduction from its original 2020 guidance, the market received it with considerable relief given the severity of the challenges posed by the pandemic.During Abbott's Q2 2020 earnings call, several analysts probed the thinking behind its newly printed forward guidance. Given that the pandemic, which so recently cold-cocked the company's original 2020 guidance, is still raging in broad areas of the country and the world, this skepticism makes perfect sense.I note that Abbott has reported earnings per share aggregating $1.22 ($0.65 for Q1 and $0.57 for Q2) so far for 2020. The company will need to aggregate $2.03 during Q3 and Q4 2020 in order to meet its $3.25 target. As points of reference, consider that it reported earnings per share of $0.84 for Q3 2019 and $0.95 for Q4 2019, aggregating $1.79.Such ciphering implies that Abbott anticipates H2 2020 earnings will exceed those for H2 2019. Given the ongoing pandemic, one can understand analysts' concerns. CEO Ford stuck to his guns. He described the developments which he sees as driving Abbott's upcoming success.These include:With Abbott, I am very much expecting that past will be prologue. The company has been successfully managing its proven portfolio of businesses around the world for a very long time. It is justifiably proud of its nearly matchless record of dividend payments. After describing Abbott's solid debt posture, EVP and CFO Funck noted at the close of Abbott's Q2 2020 earnings call:Abbott's earnings have definitely been choppy during this pandemic period, as revealed by the earnings chart below:During black swan events such as we are currently enduring, dividends are always at risk. The things that can reduce the risk are dividend commitment and financial capacity. Abbott clearly has the commitment to its dividend, as reflected by its past record as stated above. The company's capacity to make dividend payments remains intact despite its challenging H1 2020, as shown by the following graphic listing of its annual dividend payout ratios:Abbott is one of those stocks which rarely goes on sale except when investing conditions are so dire that everything is on sale, as shown by the stock chart listed earlier in this article. I have been lucky to have exposure to it since before the AbbVie (ABBV) split.If I were trying to build a position in Abbott at the current price quoted on Seeking Alpha at $99.80 as I write, I would buy a small amount (say 5-10% of my goal holding). I would add to it incrementally on dips. Of course, if I were paying brokerage commissions, I would factor that into my decision.Abbott's current price is hovering right at resistance, as shown by Fidelity brokerage's technical charting feature. This same feature lists $84.22 as support. When I check back to my previous Abbott articles for recent years, I note that this entry point question is a recurring problem. Take, for example, the following quote from a February 2, 2018 article published when the stock was trading at $72.00:During the intervening period, those who bought incrementally as recommended were generally buying at higher prices. The only time Abbott really went on sale was during the COVID-19 swoon this past March. On March 23, 2020, it hit an intraday low of $61.61. The stock only stayed in the $60's for four days. By mid-April 2020, it was back trading in the $90's, with no significant dips since.With the Fed holding to near-zero interest rates and quality bonds offering only meager yields, investors have few attractive options. Abbott is one of the best on offer in this market for those who are looking for attractive markets and proven execution. It definitely deserves to be part of diversified investment portfolios."
4377593,105617,2020-10-05T09:30:18-04:00,"ABT is securing more orders for millions of its rapid covid-19 testing kits.While the medical devices segment was hit hard with double-digit declines in organic growth, trends in procedure volume show a path to recovery.Relative to other players in the rapid testing space, ABT has a much larger scale of operations and a better value picture.","Abbott (NYSE:ABT) is currently one of the leaders in COVID-19 testing, with six different tests available for use; these tests are only providing more value to Abbott as the remainder of its business remains strong. As the third quarter has just finished, Abbott looks to have more upside potential ahead of another possible strong earnings report, as well as with COVID-19 testing options and new next-gen product CEs.A little over six weeks ago, Abbott released an update on COVID-19 testing, with over 26 million tests shipped across the U.S. and territories and an unspecified amount shipped internationally. That update came nine days after a prior one, with just over 25 million tests shipped, equating to ~100k per day average. Q2 results point to about 40 million tests shipped worldwide, so U.S. sales are near two-thirds of that share based on the last update.Abbott has made significant progress since then, especially with the ID NOW point-of-care and BinaxNOW tests. The Canadian government recently stated its plan to purchase just under 8 million ID NOW tests for the upcoming months, although Health Canada has not yet authorized the test. The Trump administration also recently laid out plans to ship 150 million of the BinaxNOW test, with over 6.5 million estimated to ship this week, as Abbott ramps production up to 50 million tests per month. The company had already expected to ship tens of millions during September.Source: AbbottWith the BinaxNOW, Abbott offers two molecular (m2000 and Alinity m) and two antibody (Architect and Alinity i) lab-based tests, and the two rapid molecular tests (ID NOW and BinaxNOW).Both the lab-based and rapid tests are helping meet large demand for testing. The Alinity m system can ""run up to 1,080 tests in 24 hours,"" while the two rapid tests can show results in as little as five to fifteen minutes. The BinaxNOW test also costs just $5.However, one downside of BinaxNOW that does downplay its cost and speed is that it's targeted for use only in patients who exhibit symptoms. Even so, the test is demonstrating ""sensitivity of 97.1% (positive percent agreement) and specificity of 98.5% (negative percent agreement) in patients suspected of COVID-19 by their healthcare provider within the first seven days of symptom onset."" It might not be identical in effectiveness as PCR tests, but the time needed to generate results in PCR is far, far longer than BinaxNOW.So while it does not necessarily work in asymptomatic cases and aid in slowdown efforts of asymptomatic transmission, it's still incredibly affordable, scalable, portable (credit-card size and no instruments needed), and rapid, which does allow millions to be tested frequently even in the case of false positives or false negatives. While that might undermine the overall trust of the product, in some cases, it does point to better efficiencies in testing.Abbott isn't exclusive to the rapid testing realm, as there are numerous other tests involved. These include tests produced by Cellex, NeuMoDx and QIAGEN (QGEN), Luminex (LMNX), Mesa Biotech, BioFire, and Quidel (QDEL) to name a few. However, while some do focus on real-time PCR, like Quidel's Lyra, Abbott looks to have the upper hand in scalability and affordability.Yet Abbott still isn't reliant on COVID-19 testing for sales, as it has an established line of pharmaceuticals, devices and nutrition products. Combining these with tailwinds from COVID-19 testing points to a possible strong end to the year.Nutrition showed organic growth in both adult and pediatric nutrition in the previous quarter, driven by Ensure and Pedialyte in the U.S. and some regions internationally as a China recovery still struggled. As China recovers, further strength in U.S. and internationally should continue to drive organic growth. Nutrition was the only segment to show organic growth during Q2 across U.S. and international geographies, although diagnostics showed total organic growth from strong demand for COVID-19 tests (as international growth was down).The medical devices segment is likely to be a key tailwind for Abbott as procedure volumes start to normalize. For Q2, diabetes care was the only sub-segment to show growth, while heart failure devices showed marginal growth internationally for 1H. Yet for the quarter, the remaining seven segments all had double-digit declines in growth. These declines were attributed to ""reduced cardiovascular and neuromodulation procedure volumes.""However, Abbott did see that ""[p]rocedure volume trends improved significantly over the course of the second quarter as both demand for procedures and availability of healthcare resources began to return to more normalized levels."" As healthcare resources are still diverted towards COVID-19 in heavily impacted regions, it's likely that even now in Q3 that volume trends are still below normal, even as procedures start to tick back up.Nearly half of 1H sales in medical devices came from diabetes care and vascular devices. Abbott is still innovating in these two fields - it recently received a CE Mark certification for its FreeStyle Libre 3, a next-gen glucose monitoring device. It's the smallest and thinnest sensor, with 14-day accuracy available at the same price as previous FreeStyle models. This could be a strong driver of organic growth, as FreeStyle Libre had 39.9% organic growth from Q2.Earlier this year, Abbott received FDA approval for Gallant implantable defibrillator devices, which should bring growth to heart rhythm sales (third largest sub-segment), and a CE Mark for TriClip, the ""world's first minimally invasive clip-based tricuspid heart valve repair device."" Tricuspid regurgitation is typically a high risk procedure, but TriClip eliminates the need for open-heart surgery and minimizes risk by using the femoral vein. The fourth-gen MitraClip also received its CE Mark, as Abbott builds upon its 16 years of experience in the mitral valve space.Medical devices is Abbott's largest segment, contributing about one-third of revenues for Q2 and 1H. Much of the declines to growth happened during Q2 - 19.9% organic decline (~$600 million), while 1H only showed an 8.8% organic decline (~$600 million). As procedure volumes start to recover, so should revenue streams and organic growth.Looking a year ahead, Abbott could see revenues around $33.5 billion, maybe up to $34.5 billion. Recovery in procedure volumes, recouping lost growth and capitalizing on new innovative products could see medical devices revenues near $12 billion to $12.5 billion, while nutrition's solid growth should see revenues float close to $8 billion. Established pharmaceuticals should see revenues near $4.5 billion, although foreign currency impacts might mitigate a bit of that growth, as that segment is internationally focused. Diagnostics, especially with COVID-19 testing, could see revenues at $8.5 billion up to $9.5 billion.Some of the growth to those revenue streams could happen in the late stage of this fiscal year, such as within medical devices and diagnostics. Abbott's forecast of at least $3.25 might be a conservative figure, given strength and demand in COVID testing, and earnings could be as high as $3.4 in a best-case scenario.However, that strength in COVID testing also poses a risk, as Abbott has ""invested hundreds of millions of dollars since April in two new U.S. facilities to manufacture BinaxNOW at massive scale."" If production needs to be scaled higher from current levels, around 50 million per month, that will come at a high cost, which ultimately could cut into results.Abbott still offers an attractive valuation relative to peers, as well as value with its growing dividend.Data by YChartsLooking at forward P/S, Quidel is poised for growth (based on its current P/S of 14), but it's banking on extremely huge quarterly growth stemming from COVID testing - it might get residual value for the next 8 to (potentially) 16 months, but after that, there seems to be little fuel in the tank to support such a high ratio. Abbott and QIAGEN sit in the middle, as both have seen steady revenue growth over the past three years and similar steadiness in trading. Luminex might look undervalued here, but it's likely not to attain a significant market share within COVID testing to justify a higher multiple (above 5x) and therefore might have trouble retesting its old 52-week high.Abbott's diverse, lab and rapid six test lineup sets it up to be a significant provider of millions of tests as it has scored more orders recently. Scaling production up to 50 million during October for the BinaxNOW tests will allow it to continue selling millions each week of this test, while still distributing the other five. This is likely to be a large driver of revenue for the diagnostics segment, but medical devices is also key - a recovery back from double-digit declines in organic growth might be underway as favorable trends within procedure volumes look to be arising. New innovations and recent approvals/CE Marks pave the way for more growth upon the recovery. Nutrition should hold steady and find continual growth, as it builds on being the only positive organically growing segment from Q2 in both U.S. and international markets. Abbott is still a provider of value and looks set for more upside, as its strengths in medical devices will return, aided by strength in diagnostics from multiple COVID test options and steady growth in nutrition."
4372124,41431,2020-09-02T11:55:58-04:00,"P/E ratios and other share investment metrics are presently distorted by the impacts of COVID-19.Abbott currently has a high trailing twelve month P/E ratio of 36.37 - putting a question mark over the share price.I revise my interactive models to take account of present circumstances, in order to better evaluate the opportunities and risks of an investment in Abbott at current share price.","Despite the high P/E ratios, Abbott (ABT) at present share price offers an opportunity for total return ~6% per year through end of 2022, subject to meeting analysts' consensus EPS estimates, and P/E multiple remaining above end of 2019 level. There is downside risk from P/E multiple contraction, but this only becomes significant if P/E ratio retreats to end of 2017 levels or lower. Additional risk arises if Abbott does not produce earnings to match analysts' consensus estimates. A detailed analysis including optimistic and pessimistic scenarios is included below.An Irish friend once told me a joke about a tourist on a back road in Ireland asking a farmer how to get to Dublin, to which the farmer replied, ""If I was going to Dublin, I wouldn't start from here.""I feel a bit like that with P/E ratios at present, due to the disruption to earnings caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The usual metrics do not work when the 'E' in P/E is distorted by the impact of COVID-19. And, if the P/E ratio is suspect, so too then is the PEG ratio similarly affected. Abbott Laboratories currently has a Non-GAAP TTM P/E of 36.37 and a PEG Non-GAAP (FWD) of 3.07, per the peer comparisons below from SA Premium.Figure 1.1 - Peer comparisons P/E and PEG ratiosDespite the PEG ratio of 3.07, Abbott receives similar ratings, per Fig. 1.2 below, to BDX and CVS which have much lower PEG ratios of 2.3 and 1.48, respectively as shown in Fig. 1.1 above .Figure 1.2 -Peer comparison RatingsFig. 1.1 and 1.2 source: Seeking Alpha PremiumPer Table 1 below, Abbott's P/E ratio at end of 2019 was 26.81 compared to the present P/E ratio of 36 to 37. This is why I say it is a tough investment climate at present. If the Abbott P/E ratio were to quickly fall from current levels to the end of 2019 level, there would be immediate large capital losses for shareholders. Real Vision discusses the possibility of market turmoil in their article, ""This Bull Market Is Built On A Very Shaky Foundation: Harrison"", from which the following excerpts are taken,This possibility should be particularly concerning for retirees, who do not have time on their side to recover from large capital losses. On the other hand, I have read countless articles over the last 5 years warning the rise and rise of share prices must come to an end, and those who have stayed out of the market have suffered large opportunity cost losses. To further complicate matters, the present P/E ratios are distorted due to the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic. The markets use metrics such as P/E and PEG ratios to guide share pricing decisions. If these present metrics are temporarily broken, then they are like a broken compass, and their use will not avoid investors potentially running aground with their investments. So how do we bridge this gap and find guidance to get to 2022 and beyond, without mishap? Like the Irish farmer, my response to that question is, I would not start from here. Instead, I start at the end of 2019 to map out a route to 2022, avoiding the current distortions to investment metrics. As part of this process, I have built a model to enable quantification of potential outcomes, on both an optimistic and a pessimistic basis. Inputs and outputs are shown below in Table 1 (optimistic scenarios) and further below in Table 2 (pessimistic scenarios).Table 1 below details Abbott's actual performance from 2016 and projected performance out to 2022. Table 1 will be relevant for those investors who like to get deep into the detail. For those who don't like that approach, I provide further below the most relevant detail in excerpts from Table 1, together with my comments.Table 1 - Abbott P/E Ratio Projections - Optimistic Scenarios, Cases A, B And CTable 1 has three Cases, A, B, and C, based on projected P/E ratios at end of 2022. These are my more optimistic scenarios, which assume Abbotts' P/E ratios will be maintained or continue to expand, as they have in the past, along with the wider market, as interest rates have come down. Table 1.1 below is a selection of a section of Table 1 to facilitate viewing and comment.Table 1.1Comments on Table 1.1 -1. P/E Ratios Actual and Estimates (line 26 Tables 1 & 1.1)-Historical actual P/E ratio at end of 2019 is 26.81.P/E Ratio Assumptions at end of 20222. Non-GAAP EPS growth rates actual and estimates (line 23 Table 1.1)EPS percentage growth estimates in line 23 are based on analyst consensus, low and high EPS estimates per SA Premium, and are the same for all cases.Historical EPS -Analysts' EPS estimates -3. Share price growth (line 24 Table 1.1)Actual 31.26% average yearly share price growth rate for Abbott over the 3 years 2016 to 2019.Estimated share prices based on analysts' consensus EPS estimates and P/E ratio assumptions -In all three cases A, B, and C, the share price is based on the common consensus EPS multiplied by the consensus P/E ratio for each individual case. While the share price is different for each case, the share price within each case is the same for consensus, low and high EPS estimates.4. Share price vs. EPS growth - Better (Worse) %age points (line 25 in Table 1.1)At a constant P/E ratio, share price will grow at the same rate as EPS growth. Where there is multiple expansion, the share price grows at a higher rate than the EPS growth rate. Where there is multiple contraction, the share price grows at a lower rate than the EPS growth rate. Note in Table 1.1 a share price growth rate that is higher than the EPS growth rate is classified as ""worse"", as continuing higher than EPS growth rates are unsustainable in the long term.Abbott P/E multiple expansion 2016 to 2019 -For Abbott, the average share price growth rate of 31.26% per year, for the three years 2016 to 2019 was 17.49 percentage points higher than the EPS growth rate of 13.77% over the same period. This caused the P/E ratio to increase by 53.6% from 17.46 at end of 2016 to 26.81 at end of 2019.Abbott P/E multiple expansion estimates 2019 to 2022 -Table 1.1 and related comments map out the journey, starting from end of 2019 through to end of 2022. Based on Table 1.1, and assuming consensus EPS estimates are met, average yearly share price growth rates over this period are 10.40% for Case A, 13.97% for Case B, and 17.32% for Case C. Add the dividend yield on cost of 1.62%, per line 15 of Table 1, and you have the approximate indicative rate of return for buying Abbott shares for $86.86 per share at end of 2019 and holding to end of 2022. But, the present share price at September 1, 2020 is far higher at $106.55 and we are joining the caravan at a later date than end of 2019. Fortunately, by design, the Table 1 interactive model allows us to input the current date and share price, to automatically generate indicative rates of return for buying now. Table 1.2 below is a selection of sections of Table 1 to facilitate viewing and comment.Table 1.2Comments on Table 1.2 -Share Price Growth Rates (lines 24 and 41 in Table 1.2)Based on the assumptions discussed above, buying Abbott shares at end of 2019 and holding three years to end of 2022 would result in average yearly share price growth rates of 10.40% for Case A, 13.97% for Case B, and 17.32% for Case C (see line 24 in Table 1.2). These projected growth rates compare to a 31.26% average yearly share price growth rate for the previous three years 2016 to end of 2019. Line 41 in Table 1.2 shows the comparable share price growth rates for buying at present and holding through to end of 2022. In all cases, the indicative share price growth rates for buying now are lower than for buying at end of 2019. Case A share price growth rate reduces from 10.40% per year to 4.05%, Case B from 13.97% to 8.36% and Case C from 17.92% to 12.44%. The reason for the lower growth rates from now to end of 2022 is the share price growth rates from end of 2019 to now have been well above the projected averages for the whole three year period.If Abbott can achieve EPS levels in line with analysts' consensus estimates for 2022, and P/E multiples remain at end of 2019 level of 26.81, or increase by 10% or 20%, indicative rates of return are Case A 5.7%, Case B 10.2% and Case C 14.5% (see line 12 of Table 1.2). The actual increases in the share price from now through end of 2022 would be, Case A $10.34 (9.70%), Case B $22.03 (20.7%), and Case C $33.71 (31.6%) (see lines 13 & 14 of Table 1.2). To achieve these results, the ending projected P/E ratio for Case A is 26.81, for Case B 29.49, and for Case C 32.17. These compare to P/E ratios at year end of 25.11 for 2018, 22.83 for 2017, and 17.46 for 2016 (see lines 53, 54 and 55 in Table 1). For the 'Pessimistic"" case I input these historical P/E ratios into the interactive model to project the potential outcomes for investors in the event of multiple contraction.There can be little argument interest rate easing, along with quantitative easing, has been a factor in P/E multiple expansion. However, the US Ten Year Treasury yield graph below shows the increases in Abbott's P/E ratio from 2016 to the present cannot be explained by interest rates alone.Figure 2: Us Ten Year Treasury YieldSource: CNBCTen year treasury yields were higher at the end of 2017, 2018, and 2019 than at the end of 2016, but P/E ratios for Abbott were successively higher at end of 2017, 2018, and 2019 than at the end of 2016. This is the inverse of what would be expected, if interest rates alone were causing multiple expansion. For Abbott, at least, it is only in 2020 that a fall in treasury yields coincided with a further increase in P/E multiples. If we don't fully understand why P/E multiples have expanded as far as they have, then we don't really know what danger signals to look for, that could cause multiple contraction. But we can quantify the effect of potential multiple contraction. That allows each of us, individually, to make a judgement whether the potential rewards per the optimistic scenarios above, outweigh the potential loss of capital in the event of the pessimistic scenarios below coming to pass.Table 2 - Abbott P/E Ratio Projections - Pessimistic Scenarios, Cases A, B And CIf Abbott can achieve EPS levels in line with analysts' consensus estimates for 2022, and P/E multiples progressively revert to the lower actual levels at end of 2018, 2017 and 2016, indicative rates of return are Case A 2.7%, Case B negative 1.4% and Case C negative 12.3% (see line 12 of Table 2). The actual increases/decreases in the share price from now through end of 2022 would be, Case A increase $2.93 (2.80%), Case B decrease $7.01 (6.6%), and Case C decrease $30.42 (28.6%) (see lines 13 & 14 of Table 2). These results are based on past historical P/E ratios - Case A 25.11 (end 2018), Case B 22.83 (end 2017), and Case C 17.46 (end 2016). These compare to actual P/E ratios at 2019 year end of 26.81 and current TTM P/E of 36.37 per Fig. 1 above.I expect many Abbott current and prospective investors could be encouraged by the foregoing review. If Abbott meets analysts' consensus estimates for 2022, and the shares attract a P/E multiple at end of 2022 equivalent to the P/E ratio at end of 2019, indicative rate of return is 5.7% per year through end of 2022. If the P/E ratio were to revert back to the 25.11 at end of 2018, indicative return would still be positive through end of 2022. It is only if the P/E ratio were to revert to end of 2016 level that losses become really significant. The risk of EPS not reaching analysts' consensus EPS estimates should also be considered."
4383446,101378,2020-10-30T19:53:50-04:00,Abbott is one of the stock market's steadiest performers.COVID-19 opens the door for realizing the vision underlying the Alere acquisition.Abbott's capital strategy supports business and dividend growth rather than buybacks.Abbott's future growth is nurtured by its highly productive pipeline.,"Count me as a retired investor who is uncertain as to how to proceed in today's highly fraught market environment. The thesis of this article is that Abbott (NYSE:ABT) should be in top contention for a role in everyone's retirement portfolio and in the portfolios of those who hope to retire in the future.Let me explain.Abbott's past accomplishments are notable. As I started this article in late October 2020, I ran a google search for ""Abbott dividend aristocrat"". It returned the following result prominently placed:Having paid dividends for nearly a century and having increased them for nearly a half century, Abbott's past dividend record is pristine. What about its future? I submit that we shareholders are in a solid position here also.As for its suite of businesses, take a look at the following excerpt from Abbott's Q3, 2020 presentation graphic:Abbott has carefully assembled its four units: medical devices, diagnostics, established pharmaceuticals and nutrition. These were bolstered by key acquisitions in 2017. As I noted previously in ""Abbott: Triumph Upon Triumph"":Former Abbott CEO White assembled Abbott's businesses carefully over time. His goal for the Alere acquisition was to position Abbott as number one in rapid diagnostics.As is often the case in such transactions, there were concerns in the early going that Abbott overpaid for Alere. These concerns were exacerbated during the acquisition phase when Alere had reporting difficulties that almost scuttled the deal. Once the deal finally closed, Abbott turned to its long practiced techniques of integrating the newcomer, which it accomplished in ""warp speed"". During Abbott's Q4, 2017 earnings call, CEO White described the process as:Moving forward to Abbott's Q3, 2020 earnings call, Abbott's current CEO Ford describes how Alere is taking a leading role in an important new paradigm. Its suite of reasonably priced COVID-19 tests are:Critically, this is not a strategy doomed just to ramp during the pandemic, only to wither on the vine once the scourge has passed. To the contrary, COVID-19 is the door-opener providing access to medical venues that would otherwise take years to develop. Again, as noted by CEO Ford:During Abbott's Q3, 2020 earnings call, Evercore analyst Kumar teased out the impressive fundamentals underlying Abbott's current financial condition. Noting Abbott's healthy balance sheet, Kumar asked CEO Ford what Abbott considered as an optimal capital structure for the company.In this regard, Abbott is generating solid profits, with a quant profitability rating of A+, or as CEO Ford put it, ""nice cash"". The great news for shareholders is that Abbott, in addition to its extraordinarily long-lived commitment to its dividend, has productive uses for its cash. Abbott downplays share repurchases, generally limiting them to offset dilution. I have long considered share repurchase as a suboptimal use of corporate capital.Abbott's growing businesses offer it ample opportunity to deploy excess capital in organic projects which generate future cash flows. Recent examples include expenditures to expand production of products that are in particular growth mode. CEO Ford described it as:The diversity of Abbott's ever-refreshing pipeline beggars my capacity for accurate and complete summarization. During Abbott's Q3, 2020, earnings call, CEO Ford hit the high points. He emphasized that Abbott's pipeline consisted of over a 100 new products across its four business units.He stated the case for how this positions Abbott favorably for future growth as follows:I started this article celebrating Abbott's storied past as a dividend aristocrat that has paid quarterly dividends since 1924. When I look to its future, Abbott shows every sign of continuing this proud tradition.I have discussed how Abbott is growing a new ecosystem around its point of care testing devices, most productively over the near term for COVID-19. Its other hot button franchise that has been churning out product improvements since 2017 is its glucose monitoring system, FreeStyle Libre.Abbott's latest available 10-Q (p. 21) for Q2, 2020, sets out the scope of this program as follows:During Abbott's Q3, 2020, earnings call, CEO Ford gave the latest on this fast developing franchise as follows:Other areas that merit attention from a pipeline development point of view are its various cardiovascular devices and its Alinity laboratory-based diagnostic products. Cardiovascular devices present an interesting piece of the Abbott story. The COVID-19 lockdowns earlier in the year took a nasty chunk out of Abbott's revenues as described in detail in Abbott's Q2, 2020 10-Q (pp. 18-21).Going forward, Abbott has recovered nicely and is adding to its cardiovascular device franchise with a ""very rich"" pipeline. In this regard, Ford waxes enthusiastic about upcoming products and enhancements for mitral valve repair, a left atrial appendage device and a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).As I write on 10/29/20, the economic horizon is showing high uncertainty. Clouds of COVID-19 resurgence are gathering in the United States and around the world. The United States political situation is at maximal uncertainty with a hotly contested presidential election unfolding with the Supreme Court possibly having an outsized role in the final decision.What is an investor to do in this environment? Treasuries and CDs are yielding little more than cash. What to do? Everyone has a different situation. I submit that, for most investors, gradually adding Abbott to their portfolio will improve their long-term results."
4359710,24361,2020-07-21T15:43:21-04:00,"Abbott posted a good second quarter, with the expected outperformance in diagnostics, but also better results in devices, diabetes, and nutrition.The pace of normalization in hospital-based procedures is shaky at best, but whether it takes a few more quarters or not, Abbott has some attractive growth drivers.Abbott is well-placed for the current environment, with a mix of hospital-based and consumer-driven businesses, but the valuation looks full and fair.","While I thought Abbott Labs (ABT) was relatively well-placed relative to its peers through the Covid-19 pandemic with my last update, I also thought that the valuation was pretty full overall. Since then, the shares have done a little better than peers like Becton Dickinson (BDX), Boston Scientific (BSX), and Medtronic (MDT), but not all that well compared to the S&P 500 (lagging by about 13%), and that’s with a better-than-expected second quarter and enough management confidence to give some guidance on full-year earnings.There are certainly positive drivers here, including ongoing long-term growth in MitraClip procedures, long-term growth in the diabetes franchise, and further opportunities in diagnostics from the Covid-19 pandemic. I also like Abbott’s organizational flexibility, including its willingness to do both big acquisitions and big divestitures/spin-offs. My issue is just the valuation – the stock looks priced for a mid-single-digit annualized return that I just don’t find that interesting (though there aren’t a lot of bargains in big-cap med-tech).It’s not surprising that Abbott continued to benefit from Covid-19 testing demand, I’d expect companies like Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) and Danaher (DHR) to likewise show momentum here, but I was surprised that Abbott’s upside wasn’t just limited to Covid-19 testing. Frankly, with the exception of the branded generics business, most of Abbott was stronger than expected, although still weak relative to pre-Covid-19 expectations.Revenue fell a little more than 5% in organic terms, but that was still good for a better than 7% beat relative to sell-side expectations. Diagnostics was the biggest dollar contributor to the beat, with 7% growth and a better than 10% beat relative to expectations. Diabetes was no slouch either, though, with 28% growth and a 12% beat relative to expectations. Cardiology and Neurology were also strong, though, beating by more than 5%, while Nutrition beat by 3% and Pharma missed by 6%.Medical Device revenue declined 20%, with the large Vascular (down 33%) and CRM (down 26%) businesses both down sharply as non-essential procedures were delayed. Electrophysiology was likewise down 30%, while Structural Heart was down 36%, Heart Failure was down 20%, and Neuromodulation was down 49%. Diabetes revenue rose 28%, with 27% growth in the U.S. and 40% overall growth in the Libre business.Diagnostics revenue rose 7%, with Molecular Diagnostics up 241% on strong demand for CV19 testing, a strong indicator for Roche, Danaher, GenMark (GNMK) (which has pre-announced almost 120% yoy growth) and other peers in the space. Core lab testing was down 13%, though, and point of care was down 18% as the business feels the pinch from lower overall hospital admissions. Rapid testing was up 11%, helped by Covid-19 testing. All told, Covid-19 testing accounted for just under 31% of total diagnostics revenue, with non-Covid-19 diagnostics exiting June at about 90% of pre-Covid-19 levels.As I expected, Nutrition revenue was relatively less fazed by the pandemic, with pediatric down slightly (despite 2% U.S. growth) and adult up more than 7% with 4% growth in the U.S. business. Established Pharma revenue fell almost 1%, with slightly better performance in “key markets”.Gross margin fell more than three points from the year-ago level and missed expectations by about 20bp. Operating income declined 26%, beating by about 9%, with a 140bp beat on margin driven by a better-than-expected decline in SG&A expenses as costs like travel were cut significantly.A summer surge in Covid-19 infections is complicating the recovery story, as hospitals in many states are seeing ICU beds filling up with Covid-19 patients. While there have been relatively few re-closures to elective/non-emergent procedures, it seems that many patients are voluntarily holding off on procedures, whether that is due to fear from increasing case counts or consultation with their physicians that certain procedures still aren’t worth the relative risk.That said, exit rates in the month of June weren’t bad. Between the earnings reports of Abbott and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), CRM and electrophysiology are down about 10% versus normal rates, while vascular and structural heart are down about 15% and neuromodulation is down close to 20%. I’d expect these rates to continue improving, but I’d caution readers that true “normalization” will be hard so long as there are still high case counts and hospitalizations from Covid-19.On a more positive note, there are still meaningful longer-term drivers here. While Abbott is somewhat better-shielded than some companies from the downturn in procedures (due to its Nutrition, Pharma, and Diabetes businesses), I see above-average growth opportunities in Libre 2, structural heart (MitraClip, TriClip, and Tendyne) and the next-gen Gallant ICDs and CRT-Ds.A recent settlement with Edwards (EW) in structural heart will bring in several hundreds of millions of dollars over the next few years, and the strong results from the COAPT study should support a significantly expanded market opportunity (functional mitral valve regurgitation) of roughly 5x for MitraClip. While the recent Libre 2 CGM approval was long in coming (a roughly one-year delay) and didn’t include labeling for use with automated insulin dosing systems (unlike Dexcom’s (DXCM) G6), it got iCGM clearance, and I believe Abbott will work quickly with partners like Tandem (TNDM) and Insulet (PODD) to fill that gap.With some recent positive developments at Abbott, I’ve modestly bumped my estimates up such that my long-term revenue growth estimate moves from around 6% to closer to 7%. While the current diagnostics boost from Covid-19 will likely abate in a year or two, it will be more than compensated for by growth in other businesses (like structural heart). I also expect Abbott to become more profitable and asset-efficient over time, such that FCF margins move into the low 20%’s and drive low double-digit FCF growth (a little higher than my prior expectation).Unfortunately, neither discounted free cash flow nor a revenue growth and margin-driven EV/revenue approach (which works well with med-tech) suggest meaningfully undervaluation today. Instead, Abbott looks priced for a roughly mid-single-digit annualized total return, which is not bad relative to the underlying quality, but also isn’t particularly exciting.I continue to believe that Abbott is a very well-run company that is also solidly balanced between essential and discretionary procedures, as well as hospital-based and consumer-centric businesses. That balance has served the stock well relative to other large-caps, but what works best in times of trouble doesn’t always work best in recoveries, and I would prefer a better (lower) entry price and a higher prospective return before buying Abbott, though it still looks like a solid hold for those who already own it."
4358157,20715,2020-07-13T12:08:02-04:00,Abbott Laboratories is expected to report second quarter earnings results on Thursday.Earnings and revenue are expected to decline compared to the results from Q2 2019.The chart for Abbott has been incredibly consistent over the last few years with the exception of February and March.,"The current global health crisis is having a great impact on the healthcare industry with a number of companies working on vaccines while other companies are working on better and faster testing. One of the companies that is on the testing side is Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and the company is set to report second quarter earnings results on Thursday.Analysts expect Abbott to report earnings of $0.41 per share for the second quarter and that estimate is exactly half of the $0.82 EPS the company reported in the second quarter of 2019. The estimate has been moved down from $0.59 over the last 90 days. Revenue is expected to come in at $6.75 billion and that is down 15.4% from the $7.98 billion in the second quarter of ’19.The overall outlook from analysts has Abbott seeing a drop in earnings of 11% and that is a reversal from the last few years. Over the last three years, the company has seen earnings grow by 13% per year and earnings were up by 3% in the first quarter.Revenue results have been just as consistent in the last few years, increasing by 12% per year over the last three years. Revenue also increased by 3% in the first quarter.Looking ahead to 2021, earnings are expected to increase by 29.6% and revenue is expected to grow by 12.1%.As for Abbott’s management efficiency measurements, they are slightly above average. The return on equity is 18.9% and the profit margin is 21.2%. The valuations for the stock are a little elevated right now with the trailing P/E at 47.3 and the forward P/E is at 32.5%. Abbott does pay a small dividend with the current yield at 1.5%.Overall, the fundamentals for Abbott are pretty solid. Yes, the earnings and revenue numbers are expected to decline this year, but with the pandemic creating greater demand for Abbott’s testing products, the numbers might not be as bad as predicted.One of the most intriguing things to me about Abbott was the weekly chart. Even before I drew the lines on the chart, I could see the pattern very clearly. In this case, the middle line is the regression line for the last three years. I drew the outer bands of the channel by freehand, but I was attempting to show one standard deviation from the regression line. Over the last three years, 156 weeks, the stock has only been below the lower rail for six weeks. All six of those weeks were back in February and March.The stock has been above the upper rail for a few weeks as well, but it has never moved above the upper rail nearly as much as it moved below the lower rail in March. Beyond the anomalies when the stock was outside the channel, look at how consistent the stock has been in its ascent higher.Yes, there are stocks that have tripled, quadrupled, or even more over the last three years. But you would be hard-pressed to find a stock that has doubled in the last three years and has been as consistent as Abbott. Prior to the big decline in the first quarter, the biggest drawdowns in the last three or four years were in the 10% to 15% range.The current setup shows that the overbought/oversold indicators are above their midway points, but neither the RSI nor the stochastic indicators are in overbought territory. The stock is right at the regression line from the last three years and just above the 13-week moving average.Given the solid fundamentals and the upward trend on the chart, it should come as no surprise to see that the sentiment indicators are showing optimism across the board. There are 21 analysts covering the stock at this time with 16 “buy” ratings, three “hold” ratings, and two “sell” ratings. This puts the buy percentage at 76.2% and that is slightly above the average range.The short interest ratio is at 1.4 and that is below average, meaning that short sellers are more optimistic about Abbott than they are toward the average stock. Short interest dropped from 12.8 million shares to 10.9 million shares in the most recent reporting period. The drop in short interest indicates investors are becoming more optimistic.As for option traders, the put/call ratio is at 0.685. There are 74,905 puts open and 109,330 calls open at this time. The ratio appears to be in the middle of its typical range, at least the typical range for Abbott. Over the last three months, the ratio has been as low as 0.52 and the highest it has been was 0.76. When the company reported earnings back on April 16, the ratio was at 0.60.Personally, I am bullish on Abbott. The company has been pretty consistent with earnings and revenue growth, and the management efficiency measurements are above average. Expectations for the second quarter earnings results are pretty low and I wouldn’t be surprised to see the company beat estimates by a bigger margin than usual. The company has beaten estimates in seven of the last eight quarters, but the biggest surprise was only by 11%.Previous earnings reports haven’t really created many gaps higher or lower. I did notice a pattern about Abbott and how the stock behaved around the earnings reports. On several occasions over the last few years, the stock bottomed just after earnings and on a couple of other occasions the stock topped. The earnings reports seemed to be pivot points within the overall upward trend. The earnings reports in April and January came just ahead of tops in the stock while the stock bottomed just ahead of the October earnings report.The direction of the swing appears to be highly correlated to the daily oscillators - when the stock is overbought on the daily chart, the earnings report is a catalyst for a pivot lower. When the stock is oversold ahead of the earnings report, the earnings report is a catalyst for a move higher.The daily stochastic indicators are in overbought territory currently and that leads me to believe we may see a little move lower after the earnings report. But I think a move lower will provide a slightly better entry point for a long-term investment in Abbott. If the daily stochastic indicators reach oversold territory again in the next week or so, that would be the entry point I am looking for."
4338975,24361,2020-04-22T08:15:00-04:00,"Abbott posted better than expected revenue and margins in the first quarter, despite a sharp drop-off in most device businesses in the month of March.
        Abbott is focusing on ramping up production capacity for its three approved Covid-19 tests, and testing is a major gating factor to reopening the U.S. economy.
        The appeal of Abbott as a Covid-19 play is understandable, with both consumer-driven recurrent revenue and leverage in diagnostics, but the valuation looks fair now.","As everyone scrambles to figure out what Covid-19 will mean for health care providers, patients, and companies, Abbott Labs (ABT) is carrying on pretty well, with the shares up on a year-to-date basis, helped by a strong first quarter report. While Abbott is definitely going to see a hit from deferred procedures in areas like cardiac rhythm management, vascular, electrophysiology, and neuromodulation, close to half of the business is more consumer-focused (and likely to hold up better) and the diagnostics business is likely to prove key to getting the U.S. economy back open and on its feet.As a huge and well-followed company, it doesn’t surprise me that this is now reflected in the share price. Relative to a stock like Stryker (SYK), which is likely to see a much bigger near-term hit to procedure deferrals, Abbott doesn’t look so interesting on a long-term basis, though I won’t understate the possibility that diagnostics could drive some upside from here.Abbott saw a major shift in the business in March, as health care facilities largely shut their doors to non-essential/non-emergent customers. Even so, the March quarter was strong relative to expectations, with a roughly 5% revenue beat and meaningful upside at the gross and operating margin lines.Revenue rose less than 3% as reported, but more than 4% in organic terms. The largest business, devices, saw nearly 3% growth, with double-digit growth in Heart Failure and almost 36% growth in Diabetes offsetting weaker results in Structural Heart, Electrophysiology, CRM, Neuromod, and Vascular (the only segment to post a double-digit decline). Nutrition grew better than 7%, with solid growth in pediatric and adult, and particularly in the U.S.. Diagnostics was up modestly (a little less than 1%), with strong growth in molecular diagnostics offset by weakness in core lab. Established Pharma grew nearly 9%.Gross margin declined 60bp, but still beat expectations by about 80bp. Operating income was up slightly from the year-ago period, with operating margin down 40bp but two points better than expected.It’s not surprising that Abbott saw a marked shift in business in March, as non-essential procedures stopped abruptly. In the cardiac rhythm management business, revenue declined more than 6% for the quarter, but declined 24% in March. Electrophysiology was down 3%, but down 31% in March. Vascular declined 11% and saw March down 29%, while Structural Heart was down slightly for the quarter, but down 35% in March. Neuromodulation was down 8% for the quarte but down 30% in March. Heart Failure was relatively unfazed, with a steady performance in March.I believe these results will be fairly predictive for Boston Scientific (BSX), Medtronic (MDT), Nevro (NVRO) and others in the CRM, EP, neuromod, vascular, and similar markets. While Abbott is not really a comp to Stryker or other ortho and hospital equipment companies, I expect a sharp decline in ortho procedures, as most ortho departments are closed to non-trauma procedures.Expanded testing has been established as a key milestone and enabler to reopening the U.S. economy, and Abbott is well-positioned here. The company currently has three Covid-19 tests available, including a test for the m2000 high-throughput system, a rapid point-of-care test for the ID NOW platform, and an antibody test for the Architect platform.There are more than 2000 m2000 systems in place in the U.S., and Abbott can manufacture about 4M tests per month. Abbott has 18,000 ID NOW instruments in place around the U.S. and is working to ramp production to 50K tests per day with a target closer to 67,000 per day (2M per month) in June.Abbott will be sharing this opportunity with other large diagnostics companies like Danaher (DHR) and Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY), but I would expect diagnostics revenue to jump in the second half of 2020 (Q2 could still see the impact of “regular” testing declines), pushing full-year growth toward the mid-to-high single-digits and into the high single-digits to low double-digits next year.The impact of Covid-19 on health care companies is going to be asymmetrical and company-specific. Abbott, for instance, generates almost half of its revenue from businesses like generics, nutrition, and diabetes that I don’t believe will be impacted much from the outbreak. Companies like Boston Scientific and Stryker, though, with less consumer-driven business and more exposure to deferred procedures are likely to see a bigger negative impact.This impact is likely to extend into the recovery period as well, and will again be more eccentric and company-specific. While Abbott has a lot of consumer-facing business, its device business is more focused on cardiology and only about one-quarter of these procedures are typically done on an out-patient basis. I believe that is relevant because I expect ambulatory surgical centers to be among the first to open, and I likewise believe that out-patient procedures will start up sooner in hospitals.I’m not surprised that Abbott shares have benefited from a flight toward those stocks likely to see less impact from elective procedure deferrals and more likely to benefit from Covid-19 drivers like testing. Still, I think we’re talking about a company with a core long-term revenue growth in the mid-single-digits, with FCF margin upside into the low 20%’s. Abbott does have some non-Covid-19 drivers, including the FreeStyle Libre, the MitraClip, and some other earlier-stage programs, but for the time being it is Covid-19 testing that will dominate the story.Abbott shares aren’t all that appealing to me on a valuation basis. While 2021 is likely to benefit significantly from catch-up procedure growth, I believe the share price already discounts an optimistic long-term growth outlook. I can’t rule out the possibility of near-term upside on diagnostics, but I think there are better opportunities in health care stocks that have been hit harder on the near-term declines in elective procedures.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4337133,102293,2020-04-12T15:20:36-04:00,"Abbott Laboratories offers perfect combination of dividends and growth to shareholders.There are multiple high-growth assets in the company’s diversified business.Investors should consider risks such as headline risk, missing earnings estimate, and litigation risks.","The COVID-19 pandemic has been a boon in disguise for Abbott Laboratories (ABT). Although the company’s shares tumbled from the high of $91.86 on January 22 all the way down to $62.82 on March 23, they had recovered much of the lost ground and closed at $86.04 on April 09. The company had even gained 2.44% in March 2020, a feat considering the extremely bearish sentiment in the market. Abbott Laboratories is down by 0.94% YTD (year-to-date), higher than 13.65% lost by S&P 500 in the same time frame.Abbott Laboratories has emerged as one of the more resilient companies during these uncertain times. The company’s molecular point-of-care test for COVID-19 can play a major role in controlling this global pandemic. But Abbott Laboratories is not only dependent on the success of its coronavirus efforts. The company offers other leading products which make a huge impact in other areas of healthcare. Prominent amongst them include Freestyle Libre CGM (continuous glucose monitoring), Alinity family of lab diagnostics system, and the company’s extensive range of devices targeting heart conditions. Going beyond a sturdy and diversified business model, the company is also a consistent dividend payer. Hence, this blue-chip stock can be a good pick for both value as well as income investors.Today, the world is in dire need of diagnostic tests capable of testing patients infected with the novel coronavirus. The lack of test kits and the high turnaround time of available tests have been affecting efforts to tackle this pandemic.Abbott Laboratories seems to have found the solution to this problem by coming up with the fastest COVID-19 test to date. This test runs on the company’s ID NOW molecular diagnostics platform, known for its high accuracy and portability. FDA has granted emergency-use authorization for this molecular point-of-care test, capable of delivering positive results in 5 minutes and negative results in 13 minutes. This implies that although the test is not FDA approved, it can be marketed during these emergency times. The ID NOW is also the most adopted point-of-care testing platform across hospitals as well as physician doctor’s offices in the U.S. Besides, healthcare providers in urgent care settings who do not own ID platform may even opt for purchasing ID Now for running these tests.The test can play an important role in the fight against the pandemic. Considering its very low turnaround time, it is obvious that the test is in high demand across the world. Abbott laboratories plan to start shipping 50k tests per day starting April.In March 2020, Abbott Laboratories also secured emergency use authorization from FDA for COVID-19 in-lab molecular test, Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 EUA, which runs on Abbott's molecular instrument, the m2000 RealTime system. The company had immediately deployed 150,000 of these tests. The company plans to produce 5 million kits daily for both tests combined.In 2019, Abbott reported revenues of $31.9 billion and profit close to $3.7 billion. There are many more growth drivers in Abbott’s arsenal.At the forefront is the company’s CGC (continuous glucose monitoring) system, Freestyle Libre. This product has already earned close to $2.0 billion in revenues in 2019, a YoY increase of 70%. FreeStyle Libre is the global market-leading wearable CGM with around 2 million users across the world. The product’s user base has roughly doubled each year and is now the highest user base across all CGMs in the U.S. FreeStyle Libre also enjoys a broad payer coverage and is the only CGM widely available through the pharmacy channel. In February 2020, Abbott released new real-world data which demonstrated positive health outcomes for type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients after using CGM FreeStyle Libre.In February 2020, Insulet (PODD) and Abbott have collaborated to integrate the FreeStyle Libre CGM with the former’s tubeless insulin pump, Omnipod Horizon system, to form automated insulin delivery system.The company is now awaiting approval for FreeStyle Libre 2, which is currently under FDA review. Already approved in Europe in October 2018, this product offers optional customizable glucose alarms for patients who need them. The company aims to secure approval for this next-generation Libre system as iCGM (interoperable continuous glucose monitoring) which implies that it will have met the special controls established by FDA required for interoperability with other devices including insulin pumps. Potential FDA approval will further expand the company’s addressable market opportunity in diabetes space.FreeStyle Libre is categorized under the company’s medical devices segment, which raked in around $12.2 billion revenues in 2019. This segment also includes multiple other devices such as heart ablation catheters, heart valve clips, cardiac monitors, stents, neuromodulation devices, and diabetes-care devices. In January 2020, the company secured FDA approval for an expanded indication of Infinity DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) to include the targeting of an area of the brain called the internal globus pallidus to treat Parkinson’s Disease symptoms.Alinity family of lab diagnostics systems is another key driver for the company. This system is penetrating the European market at a fast pace due to the high renewal rate and a rapid increase in new clients. In 2019, the company secured FDA approval for Alinity for blood and plasma screening system. The company now aims to secure regulatory approvals for a critical mass of immunoassay and clinical chemistry test menu which will run on Alinity. Post-FDA approval of additional assays, Abbott Laboratories expects U.S. ramp-up of Alinity to be similar to that seen in Europe. In 2019, the company’s overall diagnostics products segment reported $7.7 billion in sales.MitraClip is a leader in the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation or a leaky heart valve. The product reported around $700 million in sales in 2019, a YoY rise of more than 30%. Focus on expanding MitraClip’s label has been rapidly increasing its addressable market size. Despite this success, market penetration is only 5%, implying much more upside ahead. Abbott expects MitraClip to emerge as a multi-year, multi-billion dollar opportunity.Abbott’s HeartMate 3 LVAD (left ventricular assist device) is approved by the FDA as a destination therapy for advanced heart failure patients ineligible for a transplant. The destination therapy designation implies that patients can trust the device to mitigate challenges such as stroke and blood clotting traditionally associated with LVAD devices. Patients can also expect outcomes similar to that seen with heart transplants. In 2019, the device saw a 20% YoY growth in revenues. This growth rate is expected to lower down with expanding base in 2020. In February 2020, Abbott managed to secure Breakthrough Device designation from FDA for its in-development FILVAS (Fully Implantable Left Ventricular Assist System).In February 2020, Abbott announced FDA approval to commence Catalyst trial for the evaluation of its Amplatzer Amulet LAA (left atrial appendage) occluder to treat people with AF (atrial fibrillation). The trial will compare Amplatzer Amulet LAA with a newer class of blood thinners called NOAC (non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant) drugs.Abbott is also making big advances in the remote monitoring space. In February 2020, the company secured European approval for Gallant ICD (implantable cardioverter-defibrillator) and CRT-D (cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator) devices for patients with abnormal heart rhythms and heart failure. In addition to having all the benefits of previous ICDs and CRT-Ds, the Gallant line of devices can connect with the company’s myMerlinPulse mobile app via Bluetooth. Hence, patients and physicians have access to data from these devices, thereby ensuring remote monitoring.Abbott’s nutritional products segment is also a major driver for the company and reported sales worth $7.4 billion in 2019. The company’s established pharmaceuticals business which is focused on emerging markets managed to rake in $4.5 billion in 2019.In December 2019, Abbott Laboratories announced 36 cents per share or 12.5% per share increase in its quarterly common dividend. This marked the 48th consecutive year of increased dividend payout. Subsequent to this announcement, the company’s dividend yield became 1.7%.Abbott Laboratories is just 2 years away from joining the elite Dividend Kings group, stocks which have increased dividends for 50 consecutive years. I am pretty confident that the company will increase its dividends in 2020 and 2021.Although ABT’s point-of-care COVID-19 test is touted to be a game-changer, it will definitely face competition from more than two dozen tests in the market today. The molecular diagnostic company, Cepheid's point-of-care COVID-19 diagnostic, Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2, has also secured FDA emergency use authorization from the FDA. This test produces results in 45 minutes. Many other major Medtech players such as DiaCarta Inc, Becton, Dickinson & Company (NYSE:BDX), inBios International, and Luminex Corporation (NASDAQ:LMNX) have also secured emergency authorizations from FDA for their tests. Although the turnaround time of these tests is not as low as Abbott’s, physicians can still opt for these tests in case of price and availability constraints.Going beyond tests that are focused on finding active infections by sequencing the genetic material of the virus, Cellex has come up with a rapid antibody blood test for COVID-19. This test detects two different types of antibodies produced by the body to fight off the COVID-19 infection. Cellex’s antibody-based test takes 15-20 minutes to get a result. This test, although not the most accurate, does not require any dedicated platform like ID Now. This makes it more accessible especially in markets where molecular testing is not well adopted.Then again, COVID-19 test will account for only a small portion of the company’s revenues in 2020. In the fourth quarter, the company’s Medical Devices segment reported $3.2 billion revenues, a YoY rise of 11.3%. The diagnostics segment reported a much lower $2.0 billion in revenues, a YoY rise of only 6.4%. COVID-19 tests which fall in the category of diagnostics are expected to have only limited impact on the company’s topline and bottomline.And this impact is also not expected in the first quarter of 2020, since both of the company’s COVID-19 tests secured emergency authorization in the second half of March 2020. Hence, there has been no driver to offset the impact of COVID-19 disruptions in the first quarter of 2020. The company also earns over 60% of its revenues from international markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted manufacturing and supply chain in many of these markets. Patients are being advised to defer many procedures. This poses a significant risk to the company attaining its 2020 guidance. Analysts have been reducing consensus revenue and EPS estimates ahead of the first-quarter earnings. The company has guided for 2020 organic revenue growth in the range of 7% to 8% and diluted EPS between $2.35 and $2.45. The company may downgrade this guidance in the first-quarter earnings.Investors have been increasingly worried about the FDA approval of Libre 2, which has been under review for quite some time now. Although the application was submitted in October 2019, the review is taking more time since Abbott has to resolve certain issues. Besides, the current pandemic may also affect the company’s plans to expand manufacturing capacity for Libre 1 and its penetration in international markets.Device recalls are presenting another major challenge for a Medtech company. They not only impact topline but also expose the company to potential litigations. In January 2020, Abbott announced a recall of 14,000 NC Trek RX coronary dilatation catheters and NC Traveler RX coronary dilatation catheters with 4.0 mm, 4.5 mm and 5.0 mm balloon diameters, distributed from August 2019 to January 2020. Till then, the company had received 13 complaints as well as one report of death. FDA has categorized these recalls as Class I, which is the most serious type. Even in 2017, the company had identified 449,661 catheters as faulty and had asked healthcare providers to stop using them.Abbott Laboratories currently trades at a PE (price-to-earnings) multiple of 42.57x and forward PE of 22.19x. The valuations are high, making the stock susceptible to significant share price volatility. The COVID-19 pandemic is also exposing the company to significant headline risk.According to finviz, the 12-month consensus target price for ABT is $95.13. I believe that this is a fair representation of the company’s growth potential. The company’s diversified business offers a strong combination of consistent dividends and share price appreciation.Majority of analysts seem now expect lower revenues and earnings from ABT in the first quarter. Therefore, despite believing in the company’s fundamentals, they are lowering target prices. Raymond James analyst Jayson Bedford has lowered target price to $92 from $99 but keeps Outperform rating on the shares. The analyst believes that 5% of Abbott's revenue is deferrable for more than 4-5 months, but remaining is semi-elective or unlikely to be materially impacted by the current environment. Barron’s believes ABT to be one of those Dividend Aristocrats which can be considered safe for consistent and growing dividends. JPMorgan analyst Robbie Marcus lowered the target price on Abbott to $88 from $101 but keeps an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst believes ABT to be one of the best positioned in COVID-19 pandemic and potential economic downturn. Credit Suisse analyst Matt Miksic lowered the firm's price target on Abbott to $94 from $104 and keeps an Outperform rating on the shares. Goldman Sachs analyst Amit Hazan has initiated coverage for the company with a Neutral rating and $96 price target. Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen reiterated Overweight rating and raised the target price for Abbott to $103 from $97.I recommend investors to wait till the company’s first-quarter earnings results. Since the chances of lower revenues and earnings remain significant, there exists the possibility of investors picking up the stock at a much better entry point after some emotional selling. Even if the stock falls to its last low of $61.61, the sellers will be done within a few days. Thereafter, we can expect bargain hunters to start buying the stock pushing up prices. This is expected considering that ABT is a fundamentally strong pick.However, I do not expect the stock to dip to this level, even after first-quarter earnings miss or revision of 2020 guidance. Considering the inherent uncertainty, I will recommend only retail investors with above-average risk appetite and investment tenure of at least one year to invest even in stable stocks such as ABT in such uncertain times."
4359268,56142,2020-07-19T21:17:13-04:00,"Abbott's stock quote is beginning to discount a bright earnings future, as Wall Street estimates skip higher.With 63% of Q2 sales sourced from foreign customers, a lower U.S. dollar will benefit Abbott more than other companies.Technical momentum buying appears to be accelerating the past few weeks.","Abbott Labs (ABT) is a top-rated defensive choice in uncertain times. Its diversified revenue stream, in terms of geography and product lines, are usually quite recession-proof. Overall, the performance of its operating business in the first half of 2020 has held up stronger than that of the majority of S&P 500 companies. The medical product and health care giant has seen a sharp uptick in new COVID-19 testing and equipment sales offset declines in other areas, created by coronavirus pandemic shutdowns. Abbott is a mainstay in the manufacture and marketing of baby and adult nutrition products, heart pacemakers, pumps and valves, stents, pharmaceuticals, full lines of diabetes care, and laboratory diagnostics, to name a few of its largest segments.Image Source: 2019 Annual ReportI wrote an article about the company three years ago on Seeking Alpha, explaining the stock as one of the top defensive picks to own. Since July 2017, the stock price has doubled for an annualized +28% total return, including dividends. Abbott has handily surpassed the equivalent period S&P 500 total return of +12.5% annualized. Below, you can review a 3-year price chart versus peers and competitors in the blue-chip medical and health care product spaces. Abbott truly has been a performance gem for safety-minded investors for many years.Without understanding the earnings and revenue growth forecast for Abbott, the stock does look expensive. The company is digesting several large takeovers the last couple of years, including St. Jude Medical’s heart devices. On trailing sales, cash flow, free cash flow and book value, the stock is nearer its 10-year high for underlying fundamental worth.Yet, compared to the nosebleed, record or nearly so, valuation of the S&P 500 index using similar metrics, Abbott’s situation is not out of line with the alternatives. On the plus side of the equation, the operating business is expected to expand at stronger-than-normal rates into 2023.Abbott quickly developed and received approval to sell coronavirus tests to detect active and prior infections from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. During Q2 ended in June, the company posted 240% sales growth for its molecular diagnostics business. Sales of coronavirus tests added $615 million in revenues for the quarter. However, an expected drop-off in elective surgery procedures, postponed and cancelled from the pandemic, produced a net sales decline of -8% for Q2.Looking forward, earnings and sales are expected to grow much faster than the U.S. economy and equity market generally. Wall Street’s 15% EPS advance in 2020 (flat on an adjusted basis) is projected to approach a 20% gain in 2021. Today’s 30x EPS multiple should slide under 20x by 2023 (5% earnings yield), compared to the S&P 500 EPS forecast rising only slowly after 2020’s wipe-out. In addition, risk-free Treasury securities yielding less than 1%, under ten years in duration highlight the company’s still-desirable valuation relative to bond alternatives for your investment capital. All told, Abbott appears to hold a better long-term buy proposition than the average S&P 500 business and U.S. bond market, if Wall Street analyst growth assumptions prove correct.Image Source: Seeking Alpha Estimates PageBelow is a graph of sharply higher expected income results from Abbott into 2023. And if my modeling plays out regarding a big drop in the U.S. dollar’s value into 2021, these numbers could be quite understated.Only AbbVie (ABBV), mostly a pharmaceutical company, maintains a markedly better long-term growth rate projection into 2023 from my peer diversified health care and medical product company sort. You can read my bullish take on AbbVie from May here. The reason Abbott’s valuation on trailing results is high revolves around investor anticipation of super-strong growth rates.From my research, what is Wall Street missing in its projections? 63% of Abbott’s Q2 revenue originated from overseas customers. The foreign percentage of sales is far above the S&P 500 corporation average of 42%. Second-half 2020 results should begin to benefit from the weakening U.S. dollar trend this summer versus foreign currencies. When reporting its overseas results in converted dollar amounts, a lower local accounting currency should fuel much-improved operating performance in 2021-22. It is likely a dramatically lower dollar could spike annual growth rates of 15-20%, another 5-10% by 2022. Modeling EPS beyond $6 by 2023 is not out of the question given a 20-30% drop in the foreign exchange value of our paper money over 12-18 months.Below is a chart of the tumble in the U.S. dollar beginning to play out from record Federal Reserve money printing and the bungled mess of a pandemic response in America. You can read my effort in June calling for a lower dollar trend here.In summary, if the company executes operating growth as projected, and the U.S. dollar’s value drops precipitously, Abbott may still be selling at a market multiple (17x-18x or lower) P/E on 2-3 year forward results. And given the usual premium valuation the stock receives for its higher-margin, more consistent operating performance, I can make a logical argument today’s $100 a share quote has room to rise 10-15% annually in the next 36 months.To be completely truthful, it’s getting hard to find any serious bargain in July’s inflated valuation environment for U.S. equities. Putting all of the pieces of the puzzle together, Abbott’s investment story may still provide an opportunity for “outperformance” of the stock market in either an up or down direction from today. This dual capacity of being able to rise faster or fall more gracefully in price is Abbott’s main attraction for smart capital allocators.Defensive investors have been accumulating shares the last year. Plenty of evidence of buying momentum and enthusiasm is found in the technical indicators I follow. For starters, Abbott reached an all-time high price on Friday. On the graph below, I have drawn the Accumulation/Distribution Line (ADL), Negative Volume Index (NVI) and On Balance Volume (OBV) indicator for review.The ADL measures the daily close against the price range of trades each session. A rising line means the stock is closing consistently nearer the high versus the low print of the day. The NVI only records days with lower trading volume versus the previous session. If the line is in an uptrend, buyers are overwhelming sellers on slow news days. If enough supply isn’t present to meet demand, prices tend to rise, sometimes strongly. Finishing the chart, OBV tracks buying/selling price changes at the close multiplied by volume each day. It is the simplest way to track volume purchases or liquidation. All three in combination are in a very healthy position, rising stronger than the vast majority of S&P 500 companies I track. I rank the technical picture for Abbott in the top 15% of all U.S. equities over the past year. Over the last three months, it is a top-5% momentum performer (using 9 proprietary indicators of health).If investing was a simple game of buying the cheapest pick on trailing valuations, we would all be rich! To be successful, you have to factor in changes occurring in the world daily and projections of where we are headed. Ignoring future expansion and contraction trends in operating business fortunes is the primary reason investors of all stripes lag the indexes when picking individual equities.Abbott stock valuation appears rich at first glance. However, above-average growth is already being discounted in the stock quote during 2019-20. On top of an improving long-term outlook, a tumble in the U.S. dollar could propel sales/income into a tremendous growth position because of the company’s greater-than-normal level of overseas business exposure.An added bonus is Abbott’s stellar dividend story. While the trailing yield of 1.5% is about the same as the S&P 500’s 1.8% rate, robust earnings growth should support a big jump in the dividend payout in future years. One of the best dividend records on the planet, paying 96 years of uninterrupted dividends and 48 years of rising cash yield, Abbott is commonly referred to as a Dividend Aristocrat.Drafting some defense for your portfolio, especially a fast-growing selection, may be just the ingredient you need to build a winning team for 2021-23.A companion investment suggestion, alongside owning Abbott Labs, is my favorite diversified health care setup today, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). You can read my June article pick for the best long-term defensive blue-chip available to investors here. A much lower valuation and higher dividend yield are the main reasons I prefer JNJ over ABT for long-term investment holdings at this point in time in a head-to-head competition. For intelligent investors, putting both in your portfolio doubles down on your defensive position!Thanks for reading. Please consider this article a first step in your due diligence process.

4337505,75575,2020-04-14T11:17:28-04:00,Earnings will focus on Covid-19 vs guidance.The outlook for the new testing kits.Stock goes ex-dividend this week.,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has been in the news lately because of their efforts to create a fast and efficient testing unit for Covid-19. The company releases earnings this week, and this article is a guide to the upcoming numbers with a recommendation to buy any dips on the stock.Abbott Laboratories focuses on four business segments: medical devices, pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, and nutrition. The biggest driver of revenues is medical devices with almost 40% of the company's annual sales, which were $31.9 billion in 2019. The remaining business segments provide between 14% and 25% of revenue, and this provides a good balance in the business if one particular area was subject to a slowdown.(Source: Abbott Laboratories)In the company's fourth quarter earnings, the medical devices unit was the fastest growing with almost 10% growth from the year previous.Full year guidance from management in 2020 was for organic sales growth of 7-8 percent. This guidance was obviously delivered before the onset of the Covid-19 virus, and the company should see at least a short-term bounce from their efforts in this area. One risk to the company is the postponement of non-urgent surgical procedures.(Source: Abbott Laboratories)As shown above, in the annual sales for medical devices, the company focuses on heart procedures, so these are urgent and will not be postponed, meaning less of an impact on sales. Investors are awaiting these earnings hoping for guidance that the Covid-19 testing can outweigh a drop in demand for other products. They will also be looking for any new business and research opportunities related to the coronavirus.Analysts are expecting Abbott to report revenues of $7.6 billion in the first quarter, a rise of 0.4% from the first quarter of 2019.Abbott stock was boosted after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorization (EUA) to the company's Covid-19 testing kit. The Abbott ID NOW test is a lightweight unit that can be used outside of a traditional hospital and can give a test result in as little as 5 minutes.(Source: Abbott Laboratories)The company commented on the device production saying,Alongside this, the company has a RealTime SARS-CoV-2 test, which they say, ""combined with ID NOW… expects to produce about 5 million tests in April.""The Abbott test takes less time than rival units from Cepheid and Mesa, whilst they are also able to scale production larger and faster.It was reported, however, that more than 90% of the 1 million Abbott coronavirus tests delivered to laboratories have not yet been used because labs don't have the required resources to operate Abbott's systems. White House response coordinator Deborah Birx said,This doesn't affect the bottom line for Abbott Laboratories, but it may slow delivery or production, and if Covid-19 is a one-season virus, then the sales bump could be temporary in nature.Abbott Laboratories releases their earnings on Friday this week, but the stock goes ex-dividend this week on Tuesday. Abbott Laboratories is an investment contender due to its stable dividend, with the company raising its payout for a 48th consecutive year.ABT stock has rallied strongly from the general market sell-off, with a move from the lows near $61 to its close on Friday of $86.04. This was a great buying opportunity on the stock, but the current price is still at the lower end of analyst expectations, with an average target of $96.70.(Source: Abbott)The company has seen revenue growth of 56% over the last four years, and the price/earnings on Abbott is now around 42x, whilst price/sales is 4.76, so it is not too extreme if the stock was to see an earnings bounce from the testing kits and then settle back to their previous growth trajectory when the virus passes.Abbott is another business that will be shielded from the worst of the economic fallout from the virus and would be a good defensive buy for a target of $100. A potential strategy would be to take an initial position in the company and then to buy any further market dips, but if investors are expecting another leg down in stocks, then this is an option for your watchlists."
4331728,50452,2020-03-13T01:59:50-04:00,"Shares of Abbott Labs have been valued at a premium for some time now. The recent chaos in the markets has since distressed the share price.The company is fundamentally strong, and threats of a single-payer healthcare system in the US have diminished.The stock is now attractively priced for long-term investors and will become very attractive if it slides below $65 per share.","In the continued selling of the broader market, it gets continually more enticing to look at discounts afforded on high-quality stocks with strong long-term fundamentals. Healthcare conglomerate Abbott Labs (ABT) certainly fits this bill. The stock had been valued at quite a premium for the past several years, as strong positions in high-growth categories have propelled Abbott to high-single digit sales growth. With shares approaching 52-week lows, the stock is beginning to become attractive again for long-term investors.Note: Our previous coverage on Abbott Labs can be found here.The momentum in the stock market is a reflection of the sentiment felt by the general public. This is especially true in a situation such as we face now, when there is more uncertainty and misinformation than concrete facts. The market has now closed in bear market territory and is continuing to bleed heavily as I write this article. Long-term investors are always at an advantage in these challenging times. A long-term horizon allows for stocks to fall in line with their fundamentals over time - something that isn't as easy with a short holding period.In identifying companies poised to come back strong out of this bear market, we look at two key areas. The first is that a business model remains stable through the adversity. Abbott being a healthcare conglomerate would certainly fit this. The company produces/sells a variety of medical devices, diagnostic systems, consumer products, and pharmaceuticals.Note: Our overall profile on Abbott Labs and its business model can be found here.Being more specific, Abbott's offerings are needed by the population regardless of the economic climate. A strained healthcare system may stunt momentum by clogging up doctors and hospitals with patients, but we see long-term demand as being strong. Diabetes and Cardiovascular Health are the two main categories that Abbott caters to. While we will need to see exactly how Abbott has been impacted by the Coronavirus, the company did come in with stellar sales growth of 8.5% for the fourth quarter. Again, we don't suspect that there will be a huge disruption to Abbott's business, but will know more when the company reports its next quarter.A bit of a bonus for Abbott Labs however, is that the Democratic Party has recently rallied around Joe Biden to try to thwart off self-proclaimed Democratic Socialist Bernie Sanders from taking the party's nomination. After the most recent primaries, it appears that Bernie's path to the nomination has become very narrow. Because of how the party awards delegates, Bernie Sanders would have to win the remaining primaries in a dominant fashion to have any chance - momentum is simply pointing in the opposite direction of this, however. The reason this matters is because it likely kills any near-term potential of a single-payer healthcare system being implemented. The suspected pricing pressure applied by such a system would be damaging to providers of medical drugs/devices, while being an existential threat to insurance companies.The other aspect of identifying strong companies in this bear market is the balance sheet. While we already expect Abbott Labs to maintain solid operational metrics through this, the balance sheet is strong enough to fill any unexpected gaps.(Source: YCharts)The company has been steadily deleveraging its balance sheet after blockbuster acquisitions of Alere and St. Jude Medical (closed in 2017). It is currently sitting on a solid cash position of $3.86 billion. The company's gross leverage ratio of 2.52X EBITDA is comfortable enough given the expectation for steady performance moving forward.While Abbott technically lost its dividend growth crown in the AbbVie (ABBV) spin-off, the company is a virtual Dividend Champion with decades of consecutive payout increases. That dividend consumes just 50% of cash flow, so it is about as safe as they come. The company spends little on buybacks - just $718 million over the past year - so there is little financial downside here. If cash flows slip a bit, the worst outcome is that Abbott has to slow down its deleveraging process some.The biggest problem for Abbott stock over the past few years has been the stock's valuation. Shares had virtually doubled over the past three years, running from $45 per share to more than $90.(Source: YCharts)Shares have obviously retreated in a big way, now trading at approximately $74 per share. Based on the midpoint of 2020 guidance ($3.60 EPS), the stock is trading at an earnings multiple of 20.55X. This is still above the stock's 10-year median P/E ratio of 17.67X, but Abbott has also entered a period of accelerated growth following its restructuring over the past few years. Analysts are currently projecting the company will grow earnings at a low-double digit growth rate over the next five years.Given the blue-chip nature of Abbott Labs and the accelerated growth rate of earnings, we like the current share price as an entry point to begin accumulating shares. Shares will become increasingly attractive as they move lower from here. Were Abbott to fall below approximately $65 per share (a multiple of 18X), it would represent a very attractive opportunity for long-term investors. The company's strong position in key health categories among an aging population gives us conviction that it will meet projected growth estimates. This gives investors strong total returns, including double-digit earnings growth, a dividend of 1.75%+, and potential PE expansion if the market is able to avoid a recession and rebound.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4319431,101378,2020-01-28T07:26:13-05:00,"Abbott's CEO White has orchestrated two of the grandest coups in pharma history: the Humira juggernaut and the AbbVie creation.The company's acquisition and successful integration of St. Jude has created an amalgam of top-ranked devices to treat cardiovascular disease, the world's top cause of death.Abbott is in tiptop shape as CEO White hands over the reins to his handpicked successor.Despite its long track record of successes, there is more on the way.There are several areas where additional sculpting is indicated as Ford settles in.","Abbott's (ABT) great CEO, Miles White, is stepping down March 31, 2020 after >20 years spent in creating a tour de force in the medical device field. While succession to a rockstar CEO creates inevitable risk, there are reasons for optimism in this case.As a long-term holder of Abbott, I am watching this succession carefully. I am currently quite optimistic, as this article explains.Miles White has travelled a long and storied road. Starting in 1984 as a diagnostics division sales manager, in 1998 he became Abbott's CEO, taking on the chairman's role in 1999.The company he captained was the oldest of the old guard and the bluest of the blue chip, but it was looking tarnished around the edges. Early on, he entered into a flurry of deals - acquisitions, in-licensing, and collaborations - with mixed results.Then, in late 2000, he hit upon his masterstroke. He braved a skeptical market and signed up to pay a princely ~$6.9 billion for BASF's Knoll Pharmaceuticals. Knoll's main attraction was its phase 3 candidate, D2E7 (paywall).This acquisition turned into one of the grandest successes of all time. In short order, the FDA approved D2E7 (adalimumab), now known as Humira, to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Over time, indications to treat multiple additional indications were added.As early as 2007, Humira was proving to be a mega-blockbuster with >$3 billion in worldwide sales. Additional FDA approvals were stacking up promising additional revenues. In 2011, global Humira revenues had climbed to almost $8 billion.As bright as Humira's bounty was proving to be, CEO White realized that it was an obstacle to the orderly management of Abbott's other significant businesses. Accordingly, towards the end of 2011, he decided to set it adrift with the balance of Abbott's so-called research pharmaceuticals.In doing so, he solved several problems. He avoided the difficult task of ushering Humira through its difficult years as its patents started to expire. He also burnished Abbott's financial standing, maximizing shareholder value and paving the way for sculpting Abbott into the business it is today.The new setup created an exciting challenge for Richard Gonzalez, Abbott's no. 2, whom White tapped to head the new spin-off named AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). The deal closed around a year later. The logistics of disentangling the companies was handled with customary distinction.Now, six years after the closing, AbbVie has alternately soared and suffered as Humira's developing prospects have dictated, per the stock price chart below:Data by YChartsAs Humira sales finally hit their peak, likely in the next very few years, Abbott will be entirely free of this boom-bust cycle.Abbott's path immediately following the AbbVie split was challenging for the first few years. The company had several notable headwinds that held back its share appreciation, as shown by the stock chart below:Data by YChartsThese issues included an unfortunate closing of operations in Venezuela, uncertainties surrounding developing nutrition product rules in China, and constant exchange rate issues.CEO White knew exactly what Abbott needed to work its way through these doldrums. He wanted it to be a top revenue generator in key cardiological device markets. Abbott was quite familiar with the nuances of this market insofar as it was already a leader in several categories.When White saw an opening to potentially acquire St. Jude Medical (STJ), he jumped in with an offer at a ~37% premium. He made the offer despite the inconvenience of a pending less-fortunate deal to acquire Alere (ALR). At the time, these beefy acquisition bets had me asking if Abbott could continue on its winning ways.I posed the question, ""Abbott Laboratories: Should I Stay Or Should I Go?"" Seeking Alpha readers were most helpful in convincing me that I needed to stand pat. CEO White had no such doubts about the merit of acquiring St. Jude. The graphic below shows White's strategic rationale for the deal:CEO White played the game to perfection. He enhanced shareholder value by growing the company, and recognizing the value he was creating, he bought over a million shares in the open market on his own account during 2016.The chart below shows how spectacularly this is playing out:Data by YChartsAs the CEO proudly announced during Abbott's recent Q4 2019 earnings call:After >20 years in the top spot at Abbott, CEO White is turning the company over to his longtime mentee, Robert Ford. The transition started to take shape in the public eye during the company's Q3 2018 earnings call. In response to a question following Ford's 10/18 appointment as president and COO, CEO White acknowledged that it was an obvious succession step.He vouched for Ford's 22-year tenure at Abbott as an:White's careful attention to his own successor is vintage White. His tenure as CEO has seen success after success. Now that he has molded Abbott into the gem that it is, it can't be easy to walk away from the top spot. Nonetheless he is doing so and has set a proven Abbott veteran to take over in his stead.New CEO Ford is going to have big shoes to fill. As I write on 1/26/20, Abbott share price is trading at all-time highs, always a caution for an incoming CEO. Parsing Abbott's Q4 2019 results should provide clues on how he will go about filling them.Abbott's most recent quarterly slide slice, its single slide presentation that encapsulates its performance, has so elongated itself that I will only include the Q4 2019 performance excerpt below; it shows non-GAAP organic growth at a healthy clip:The company's four divisions - medical devices, diagnostics, nutrition and established pharmaceuticals - grew from 2019 to 2020 at a combined organic growth of 7.7% Y/Y. The following excerpt from its Q4 2019 earnings PR 8-K (p. 2) gives the relative size of these divisions:The fastest-growing, medical devices, is far and away the largest; with sales of $12,239 million out of $31,904 million, it makes up >38% of the year's total. The other double0digit grower, established pharmaceuticals, with sales of $4,486 million out of $31,904 million, makes up a mere ~14% of the total.The double-digit growers account for nearly half of Abbott's overall sales. The growth laggards, diagnostics and nutrition, each weigh in for a little less than a quarter of the company's total annual sales.Abbott's guidance for 2020 is for more of the same. It calls for organic growth from 7% to 8%, for a midpoint of 7.5%, compared to 2019's 7.7%. Out of the gate, the first Q4 2019 earnings CC question asked the big one: Bank of America analyst Hopkins queried both the current and the incoming CEOs on how they dared postulate any durability to such a large company's ""incredible 7% revenue growth outlook... expressed for 2020 and beyond"".CEO White took the question first. Acknowledging the temptation to stick a successor with unbelievable goals, he explained how such dynamic was inapplicable to his assessment of Abbott's prospects. He decried any notion that the company's size was an impediment to its forward growth prospects.Acknowledging inevitable speed bumps, particularly from foreign exchange - his ever-present bete noir - he noted:White's replacement COO Ford, who will be in the hot seat for Abbott's next earnings call, aligns his vision closely with that of his predecessor. Ford noted that he participated during the company's most recent developments and enthusiastically embraces them.He pointed to Abbott's opportunities for sustained growth that are in early stages of development, including:I fully expect Abbott's new CEO to respect his predecessor's legacy and to work within the bounds of the company's existing strategies as his tenure as CEO starts to take hold. This predecessor has left a situation where there are few glaring deficiencies requiring prompt attention.Nonetheless, there are areas where I would be looking to enhance Abbott's performance. Examples that seem obvious include:The current market environment pushes overvaluation hurdles in front of investors whenever they try to establish positions in first rate companies. This is strictly true for Abbott now as I have noted it to be from time to time in past articles. Wealth Insights makes a more recent well-articulated case of overvaluation in ""Abbott Laboratories: Near-Term Potential Has Dried Up"".In the interim, Abbott has reported solid earnings and given guidance supporting its ongoing growth trajectory. Its new CEO has confirmed his appreciation of and support for the company's existing path. Abbott share price has responded positively.The bull case for Abbott, which I support, focuses on its carefully orchestrated positioning in growth markets where it plays a leading role. It occupies an enviable spot as a defensive stock projected for forward earnings at the top level among Dividend Aristocrats.There are two ways one might evaluate the company's near-term performance. The bear case would be an attitude of concern bred of caution as its new CEO finds his sea legs. The bull case sees this as an opportunity for a fresh pair of eyes to burnish a masterpiece.With the market seemingly in an uncertain state, the next short while should provide opportunities for investors to build positions in Abbott at a reduced price."
4302473,86786,2019-11-05T06:06:58-05:00,"Many investors are aware that news drives stock prices, but few are aware that management sentiment drives stock prices in much the same way.Management is particularly optimistic on a number of their growth catalysts, from products to emerging markets.The optimism present in management's forward-looking statements in ABT’s earnings report should help investors be less hesitant to buy at a relative high.","Abbott Laboratories (ABT) reported its quarterly earnings last month. My primary investment process is a quarterly one, both in predicting earnings movements and in predicting post-earnings movements. As we are in the post-earnings movement phase, it is best we investigate the primary catalyst for quarterly momentum: sentiment.Many investors are aware that public information releases (news) generate responses (sentiment) that drives stock prices to a severe degree, regularly more so than the often uninvolved financial data related to the company in question.(Source: Semantics Scholar)But few are aware that management sentiment accounts for 50% more predictability of stock price than does actual EPS or revenue beats. Investigations into management sentiment during earnings calls produce reliable predictions as to the stock’s general trend into its next earnings report. Specifically, my method is to calculate sentiment scores across quarters for a company, looking for significant changes with respect to itself and the general market.As per my analysis, ABT’s management sentiment has been hovering around the industry average and is quite volatile. Yet this quarter’s sentiment is 64% more optimistic than last quarter’s, which was below the industry average. Year-over-year, ABT’s sentiment is also more optimistic: a 24% increase.To see how sentiment drives stock, you only need read the above paragraph while looking at ABT’s chart. Last quarter’s post-earnings reaction drove the stock higher initially, but the stock price is now lower than one quarter ago. Likewise, the earnings report one year ago was of industry-average sentiment, and the stock trended roughly sideways.The “negative” earnings report this quarter drove the stock downward, yet sentiment is significantly higher year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, implying excess returns over the next quarter. The general reason sentiment stirs stock prices more so than balance sheet changes lies in the fact that management is classified as insiders and thus possess non-public information, yet we can puncture our way into this insider bubble via psychology: unconsciously, managements are expressing their expectations – based on insider information – in a semi-transparent language by the words they select in their conversations with investors; this is well-documented in the financial literature. In my lexical analysis of ABT’s earnings calls, we will extract some of the more interesting statements of positive sentiment, hinting at excess gains over the coming months – gains that we are beginning to see via the transition in ABT’s price action, which is now bullish in spite of negative reaction to earnings. On that note, the smart money and dumb money are acting similarly to ABT’s movements, both taking profits on bumps and buying dips – however, the dip-buying is much stronger with the smart money, while the profit-taking is much stronger with the dumb money.Back to ABT’s recent earnings report, let’s look at some of the statements flagged as positive sentiment:- This is in regard to emerging markets. The statement implies neither a flight from US competition nor wild speculation but a pertinent method of selecting businesses to maximize the conversion of investor capital to profit.- Though ABT continues to leverage emerging markets, the company is not sacrificing its position in the United States.- Management is particularly optimistic on a number of their growth drivers, Libre being one. A non-invasive glucose monitor garnering profits from the Canadian health care system (and possibly many others in the near future), Libre’s expected run rate is $2B but a higher potential run rate is credible, as its growth rate has surpassed 70%.(Source: Physicians Weekly)Overall, the optimism present in the forward-looking statements – especially those regarding multifaceted growth (across markets, countries, and product types) in ABT’s earnings report should help investors be less hesitant to devote (more) capital to a stock that is often viewed as overpriced. I think we will see some analyst upgrades soon, actions that could easily raise the average analyst target price (currently $94) into the three-digit range. If you are fortunate enough, you could buy on a dip, as the smart money does.Abbott is a buy in my opinion, but its price makes it risky to hold through earnings reports. My research on predicting earning reactions can help you decide whether to exit, hold, buy more, or – best of all – create an options strategy to overturn the risk/reward ratio of holding through earnings.You can drastically improve your confidence heading into an earnings report with my strategies on predicting earnings movements."

And the company recently increased its dividend by 10%.,"By Bob CiuraStocks with higher yields are among our favorite stocks because they allow investors to compound their dividend income at a much higher rate. But there has to be more than just a generous dividend to warrant an investment. If business fundamentals are deteriorating or the dividend is at risk, investors should avoid those stocks.Pharmaceutical giant AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) has struggled in recent years, mostly due to concerns over declining revenue for Humira. The stock price has declined 4.5% year-to-date while the S&P 500 has returned more than 23%. However, AbbVie has strong long-term growth potential thanks to its pipeline and the Allergan (AGN) acquisition. In the meantime, the stock has a 5.5% yield and recently increased its dividend by 10%, making it one of our favorite high-dividend stocks.We believe AbbVie's current yield is sustainable, with room for future dividend increases. It is a rare stock in that it offers a 5.5% yield plus a high dividend growth rate. For all these reasons, AbbVie remains a buy even with the recent run-up from its 52-week lows.AbbVie was originally a part of Abbott Laboratories (ABT), but was spun off in 2013. Thanks in large part to Humira, the world’s best-selling drug, AbbVie has quickly become one of the largest companies in the biotechnology industry. AbbVie has a current market capitalization of $126 billion and generated nearly $33 billion in revenue last year. The company has approximately 30,000 employees around the world. AbbVie’s products treat more than 30 million patients in almost every country on earth from infancy through the senior stages of life.AbbVie reported third quarter earnings results on Friday, November 1st. The company’s top line grew 3% to $8.5 billion. AbbVie’s bottom line improved 9% to $2.33 per share. Both results beat consensus estimates.Sales for Humira were down 3.7% globally, the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year declines. U.S. sales for Humira grew 9.6% to $3.9 billion, but international sales declined 33.5% to $1.05 billion. International sales contributed ~21% of total Humira sales in the quarter. Humira is patent protected in the U.S. until 2023, but has lost patent protection elsewhere. The success of the product has invited numerous biosimilars. Competition has eroded results outside of the U.S.While revenues for Humira will not be replaced by one single product, AbbVie has several recently released products that offer the potential to become significant sources of revenue.First, AbbVie has other promising products in its immunology lineup. Currently, Skyrizi added $91 million to sales in the most recent quarter. Skyrizi just launched last May, but has the potential to produce blockbuster results. A recent survey of dermatologists stated that 8% of patients with psoriasis could be prescribed the drug by year’s end. This is a high uptake rate for a new product and on pace with competitor’s drugs that are already on the market. Given this, initial peak sales of $5 billion may turn out to be quite conservative.Another promising drug, Rinvoq, just received approval from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration for treatment of moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis in adult patients. This product has only been on the market since September and has already captured 6% of new rheumatoid arthritis patients. The company forecasts that Rinvoq could produce annual revenues of $6.5 billion by 2025.AbbVie’s hematology oncology division, which provides products that treat and prevent blood disease and cancers, grew 38.5% in the quarter. Imbruvica, which treats certain cancers like lymphoma, had sales growth of 29.3% to $1.2 billion. This product is approved for use for multiple indications. Imbruvica has the largest market share for treatment in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which make up approximately 37% of all leukemia cases. This gives this product a potentially large patient base. Imbruvica could reach peak sales of $7 billion. It should be noted that AbbVie splits profits for Imbruvica via a collaboration with Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).Venclexta only added $221 million to sales in the quarter, but had a growth rate of more than 100%. Venclexta, which treats certain relapsed leukemia patients, could reach peak sales of $3 billion.AbbVie also updated its guidance for the remainder of the year. The company raised the low end of its guidance and now expects earnings-per-share of $8.90 to $8.92 for 2019, up from its previous guidance of $8.82 to $8.92 per share. The midpoint of updated guidance represents a 12.6% increase from 2018’s result. AbbVie has compounded earnings-per-share at a rate of 16.6% since 2013.While Humira has been extremely important to the company’s success, we feel that there are multiple avenues for future growth.Because Humira has been so successful at treating ailments such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and chronic plaque psoriasis, among others, biosimilar competition has begun to chip away at AbbVie’s international sales. AbbVie has patent protection for Humira in the U.S. until 2023 and has made licensing agreements with competitors in an effort to shield revenues until this time.Eventually, AbbVie forecasts that Humira revenues will approach zero, likely by 2025. Given the drug’s importance to the company (Humira contributed 58% of sales in the third quarter), AbbVie will likely need contributions from a variety of sources in order to replace these lost revenues.Research and development are a key component for any company in the biotech industry and AbbVie is no different. The company spent 26.9% of net revenues on R&D in the third quarter. And this expense is starting to prove fruitful for the company. For example, the previously discussed Rinvoq, which was discovered and developed by AbbVie and projects to produce peak sales in the billions.Another avenue for adding revenues is through acquisitions. AbbVie has been very active on this front, though not all transactions have been successful.For example, AbbVie purchased Stemcentrx in 2016 for more than $10 billion. AbbVie believed that the company’s Rova-T compound would be highly effective at treating small-cell lung cancer. Clinical data, however, revealed that the drug wasn’t more effective than chemotherapy. AbbVie eventually took a $4 billion impairment charge.Other deals are likely to be more successful. On 6/25/2019, AbbVie agreed to acquire Allergan for $63 billion in cash and stock.Source: Investor PresentationThe combined entity of AbbVie and Allergan, which will add products like Botox to the company’s portfolio, would have produced $50 billion in revenue last year. This would have made it one of the largest healthcare companies in the world based on sales. Almost two-thirds of this deal will be funded with cash and the rest with stock.AbbVie expects this acquisition to be 10% accretive to adjusted earnings-per-share a year after the close of the deal. Peak accretion could reach 20% and the return on invested capital of the transactions should exceed AbbVie’s cost of capital within the first full year.Another added benefit of the Allergan purchase is that it offers the AbbVie an opportunity to diversify its revenue streams.Source: Investor PresentationAbbVie’s reliance on Humira for revenue has decreased in recent quarters and that should only continue once Allergan is in the fold. Whereas Humira contributed the majority of revenues prior to this deal, the new look AbbVie will only receive 40% of revenues from Humira. This will be especially important as the drug losses patent protection in 2023.This deal does comes with risks, as AbbVie will add to its debt position in order to fund the transaction. The company ended the third quarter with $36 billion of debt already on its balance sheet and that is before any debt related to the Allergan purchase is issued. AbbVie expects to raise as much as $28 billion to help fund this purchase.Still, the company seeks to maintain an investment grade target rating and expects to reduce debt by at least $15 billion by 2021. This gives us confidence that AbbVie should continue to increase its dividend going forward.AbbVie has paid a dividend every year that it has been an independent company. Counting the years that the company was attached to Abbott Laboratories, the company has increased its dividend for 47 consecutive years.Dividend growth has been plentiful since the separation.AbbVie has seen its dividend growth by extraordinary rates since becoming an independent company. Dividends-per-year have compounded at a rate of 27% annually since 2013.The company increased its dividend 10.3% the day of the third quarter earnings release. Based on the annualized dividend of $4.72 and the most recent closing price $85, shares offer a yield of 5.5%. This is nearly three times the average yield of the S&P 500.AbbVie’s dividend is also very safe. Using dividends received in 2019 and the midpoint for expected earnings-per-share, the company has a payout ratio of 53%. This is just slightly above the average payout ratio of 44% since AbbVie became an independent company. Therefore, the company could continue raising its dividend at a high rate, which is rare among 5%+ yielding stocks.AbbVie is a young independent company, but is one of the largest healthcare companies in the world. Much of this is due to the success of Humira. Though sales for this product have begun to decline in international markets, Humira is patented protected in the U.S. until 2023.AbbVie also has several other promising products that have the potential to produce substantial peak revenues. In addition, the stock offers a very high 5.5% dividend that is well-covered by earnings.Unlike many high-yield stocks, which do not offer much dividend growth, AbbVie is a rare combination of a 5.5% yield and substantial dividend increases. For these reasons, we feel that AbbVie is one of the best high-yield dividend stocks on the market today."
4314363,50452,2019-12-28T08:41:59-05:00,"Abbott Laboratories continues to have a great long-term story for investors. Revenue growth is strong, and the dividend is going up 12.5%.However, the stock has been on a tear since mid-2017, and now trades at 27X earnings.Despite the strength of Abbott Labs, investors entering the name at such a high valuation will likely be disappointed over the next several years.","Healthcare conglomerate Abbott Laboratories (ABT) continues to stand out to investors for its strong top line growth and continued dividend growth since spinning off AbbVie Inc. (ABBV). The company has outperformed the S&P 500 with ease over the past five years. We last covered Abbott Labs over the summer, and explained that the company's newfound growth led by contributions from product innovation as well as integrated acquisitions has justified an increased valuation on shares. However, the current share price in the upper $80s is overly ambitious, and investors buying into Abbott's positive story may wind up disappointed with the results.Let's start by recapping our long-term investment thesis on Abbott Labs, which still remains very bullish. The company's most recent quarter (Q3 of current fiscal year) was again solid, reporting revenues and EPS ""in line"" with analyst expectations. The company continues to post strong sales growth with organic revenues up across the company's segments, and up 7.6% on an organic basis overall for the quarter.source: Abbott LaboratoriesLong-term growth drivers continue to be emerging technologies that are helping treat health conditions with large demographic exposure. Prime examples include the company's Freestyle Libre - a means for diabetics to monitor glucose levels. Sales were up 68% in the third quarter. The company's newest iteration of its MitraClip is used for mitral valve repairs. Sales of this product were up 32%. The company's blockbuster acquisition of Alere has helped boost the diagnostics division. The acquisition of St. Jude has boosted Abbott's medical device segment.And while these acquisitions were very expensive (totaling about $30 billion in value), the company has steadily paid down debt and its balance sheet is quickly recovering.Source: YChartsThe company has worked itself down to a leverage ratio of 2.75X EBITDA on a gross basis, and that doesn't even factor in the $4 billion in cash on hand (enough to pay down another 20% of all outstanding debt). The company underlined its confidence in the financial outlook with a recently announced 12.5% hike to the company's dividend payout for 2020.While we go into greater detail regarding our bullish outlook on Abbott Labs in previous articles, this summation outlines what we expect to be double-digit potential returns (high single digit earnings growth in addition to the dividend) over the coming years.The pitfall currently facing investors is simply a matter of valuation. Let's look at just how much Abbott Labs has appreciated in recent years. It turns out that a lot of good news has been priced in at this point.Source: YChartsWe can see in the chart above that Abbott Labs has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years. Much of that outperformance has come in the past 18 months, but the stock has been a steady riser since mid-2017.Source: YChartsManagement is forecasting full-year EPS at approximately $3.25. This puts the stock at an earnings multiple of 26.92X. If this figure sounds high at first glance, that's because it is. Consider that Abbott's median 10-year median PE ratio is 17.24X. The current multiple represents a sizable 56% premium. It's important to note that part of the decade included AbbVie, which would skew this figure some (AbbVie trades at a lower multiple). In previous coverage, we assigned a justified PE of 22X to Abbot Labs to properly reflect its current growth trajectory. That would still imply that shares are overvalued by approximately 22%.While we like Abbott's story as a long-term holding, we can see below that the share price has managed to outrun the actual earnings growth of the company over time.Source: YChartsIt's fair to say that time can heal most/all investment wounds, so buying at current levels will not ruin you over a very long holding period. But what if you were looking at something a bit shorter - say the remainder of the current fiscal year, and an additional two years for example?Let's assume that shares of Abbott Labs correct to a lower PE ratio, we will use our already estimated PE of 22X. Analysts are projecting the company to grow earnings at an 11% clip over the next five years. If we project out a few years, we can see roughly how long it would take for the current premium to burn off.When we project out, we see that it could take through FY2021 just to burn off the current premium on shares. To realistically maintain such a high multiple, the company would essentially need to vastly outperform an already elevated expectation for earnings growth. The more likely outcome, in our view, is that the stock regresses at some point. Abbott Labs is an outstanding selection for any long-term portfolio, but investors will want to pump the brakes before initiating a position, or adding shares. We continue to strive for 22X earnings as an ideal entry point, or $71.50 per share.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4273686,23998,2019-07-06T16:05:27-04:00,"On Friday, shares of Abbott Labs and several competitors dipped after President Trump told reporters his administration was working on a plan to reduce drug prices.That ""most favored nation"" plan would allow the U.S. to purchase drugs for the lowest price they are offered in other countries.In the event this plan is enacted and cuts into Abbott Labs' revenues significantly, I present ways bullish shareholders can stay long while limiting their risk.","Abbott Laboratories celebrates millennial blood donors (photo via Abbott's Twitter account). One of the frustrations of Americans for years has been the high cost of prescription drugs relative to the prices those drugs sell for in other first world countries, leading some Americans to travel to Canada to purchase drugs there (that's also led to accusations that countries such as Canada are free-riding on drug research subsidized by American consumers). On Friday, though, SA News Editor Liz Kiesche noted that shares of Abbott Laboratories (ABT), along with those of Pfizer (PFE), Eli Lilly (LLY), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and Merck (MRK), were down after Bloomberg reported that the Trump administration was working on a plan to allow the U.S. to buy drugs at the lowest price they are offered in other countries.In the event this plan pans out and cuts into Abbott Labs' revenues in the U.S., below are several ways bullish shareholders can stay long while strictly limiting their risk.Correction: Darcy Ross of Abbott Labs contacted me making the same point a few readers have:I asked Ms. Ross whether Abbott's diabetes testing equipment would be affected by President Trump's ""most favored nation"" proposal, but haven't heard back yet. In any event, the hedges below will protect your ABT shares if something else were to cause the shares to decline. Up until recently when I've posted hedges for securities, I've used expiration dates approximately six months out. That's been Portfolio Armor's default for years, partly out of convenience for investors and partly for the reason Riskalyze CEO Aaron Klein explained here: Investors seem to be better able to conceptualize risk over six-month periods than longer ones. That's still Portfolio Armor's default, but we've just added a new feature that lets users select their own expiration dates.This raises an interesting question: What's the cheaper way to hedge if you adjust for the different times to expiration? To enable an apples to apples comparison, I've highlighted the annualized cost of each ABT hedge below, two of which expire in September and two of which expire next June. Each of these hedges is designed for an investor unwilling to risk a decline of more than 19% in his ABT shares.Uncapped Upside, Expiring In SeptemberThese were the optimal, or least expensive, puts, as of Friday's close, to hedge 1,000 shares of ABT against a >19% decline by late September of this year.The cost here was $290, or 0.34% of position value (the cost of the puts in all of these examples was calculated conservatively, using the ask price - in practice, you can often buy puts at some price between the bid and ask). That works out to 1.63% of position value annualized.Uncapped Upside, Expiring In JuneThis hedge uses the same parameters except it expires next June.The annualized cost here was higher, 3.23% of position value.Capped Upside, Expiring In SeptemberThis was the optimal, or least expensive, collar, as of Friday's close, to hedge against a >19% decline by late September if you were willing to cap your possible upside at 10% by then. The income generated from the short calls for this collar and the next one was calculated conservatively, assuming you sold them at the bid.As you can see here, you would have had a net cost of $120 when opening this hedge, assuming you placed both trades (buying the puts and selling the calls) at the worst ends of their respective spreads. That works out to a cost of 0.14% of position value, or 0.67% of position value annualized.Capped Upside, Expiring In JuneThis optimal collar uses the same parameters as the one above, except it expires in June of 2020.Here, you would have collected a net credit of $440 when opening the hedge, which worked out to a cost of -0.52% of position value or -0.54% of position value annualized.For readers wondering why I used an upside cap of 10% in the collars above, the answer is that was the highest cap at which the cost was negative when hedging against a >19% decline by next June. If you are willing to risk a larger decline, you may be able to find a collar with a negative cost with a higher cap.Also, for readers wondering why I have given Abbott Labs a bullish rating here: I have done so because Portfolio Armor estimates a potential return for it greater than that of the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) over the next six months."
4281503,105306,2019-08-04T18:52:14-04:00,"Uptrend in stock price is justified by the company outlook.Abbott is well-positioned has advanced its presence in long-term growth areas such as diabetes care, cardiovascular medical devices and diagnostics.The company can continue to offer attractive returns in the long run, despite the current modest upside.","Shares of healthcare giant Abbott (ABT) remains in an uptrend trajectory this year after posting Q2 2019 financial results on July 17 that slightly missed revenue but beat EPS and raised the full-year 2019 outlook, based on the positive prospects across its businesses lines.I consider that investors' bullish sentiment on the stock is largely justified as the company features a diversified pipeline of new products in very attractive areas, such as structural heart, diabetes care and diagnostics, building a foundation for a sustainable top-tier growth and solid shares price performance over time.Source: TradingviewAfter having carried out a strategic business shift through the acquisition of St. Jude Medical and Alere occurred in 2017, Abbott has significantly advanced its presence in long-term growth areas such as diagnostics and cardiovascular medical devices. The chart below illustrates the increasing participation of these areas in Abbott overall business.Source: Company's fillings, summarized by the authorAs a remark, the Devices segment was formed in 2019 by the consolidation of Cardiovascular and Neromodulation with Diabetes Care business. In this new area there are several key growth drivers for the company, as highlighted below:MitraClip: It is a market leading device for treatment of mitral regurgitation, a highly underpenetrated market. FDA has recently approved the fourth generation of this device with new options when treating mitral valve disease. In Q2 2019, it had global sales growth of more than 30%. Furthermore, FDA approval in March 2019 for an expanded indication addresses the secondary form of mitral regurgitation and increases the amount of people that can potentially be treated with MitraClip.FreeStyle Libre: It is a continuous glucose monitoring system for patients with diabetes, which doesn't require a finger stick. With diabetes affecting more than 80 million people around the world, Abbott targets this product to address the mass market at affordable prices. With FreeStyle Libre being reimbursed for approximately 75 percent of people with private pharmacy benefit insurance, recent adoption of this product has been very promising, with worldwide organic sales growth of roughly 73% in Q2 2019 versus the prior year. Looking forward, benefits for users could sustain business traction. As an example, a recent study showed improved control of average HbA1c levels in patients using FreeStyle Libre. In addition, there is also optimism from management regarding Libre 2 to be designated as an integrated continuous glucose monitoring (iCGM) system and thus deployed as part of an integrated system with other compatible medical devices and electronic interfaces.HeartMate 3 Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD): It is another growth area in the heart failure, with growing market adoption of this device, following FDA approval in late-2018 as a long-term use therapy to patients not eligible for a transplant.Overall, Abbott is very well-positioned as a leading player in Devices, as reflected in recent sales results. As shown below, there is double-digit growth in Diabetes, Electrophysiology, Heart Failure and Structural Heart (MitraClip numbers are reported in this area).Source: Company's fillings, summarized by the authorIn the Diagnostics segment, the outlook is also very good, with growing adoption of Alinity family internationally and the recent FDA approval in July of Alinity-S, allowing the blood and plasma screening process to be made more efficiently. With an 80% share in the worldwide blood screening market, Abbott recently closed a deal with Japanese Red Cross, which is the largest Japanese blood screening organization. Besides, due to the increasing demand for blood screening, efficiency pressures and potential demand for hematology and molecular testing, Alinity platform has a significant growth pathway.In order to estimate the fair value of the company, I will consider a revenue growth of 4.5% in 2019, according to the updated guidance, meaning 7.5% organic growth minus 3% of currency impact. I will assume revenue growth of 7.0% for the next 4 years, which is the bottom of the 7-8% range estimated by the management at the Q2 2019 earnings call, considering currency will remain stable in the coming years and new launches will be able to sustain current business momentum.I will also assume EBITDA annual growth of 10%, as the effect of operating leverage to the bottom line of the company, and just below the 10.8% long-term EPS growth expected by analysts,Using the 5-year DFC model and applying revenue and EBITDA assumptions just mentioned, the tax rate of 14.5% informed at the Q2 2019 earnings call and a terminal EBITDA/EV multiple of 19.8, which is roughly the average of peers current multiples and Abbott historical multiples, the projected fair value is $95.94, with roughly 11% upside to the current price level. As reference, the assumptions and calculation details are presented below:Source: Data from Finbox, adjusted by the authorWe can also assess Abbott valuation on a comparative basis with peers, taking into account EV/EBITDA multiple and the respective EBITDA growth forecast. After plotting both metrics in a scatter chart and inserting a trend line (dotted line), we can easy identify those peers above the trend line as the ones exhibiting relatively higher EBITDA growth and lower EV/EBTIDA multiple. Hence, as Abbott (marked in red) is slightly situated above the trend line, it offers higher margin growth relative to its current EV/EBITDA, meaning that, by this criteria, it is a bit undervalued compared to its peers.Source: Data from Finbox, sumarized by the authorDespite the positive outlook, there are several points that should be highlighted as potential headwinds for the company.Firstly, while Abbott is quickly expanding in diabetes care market, Libre 2 does not have FDA approval yet and competitor Dexcom's G6 is only product on the market authorized by FDA as an iCGM. As timeline from regulators is rather difficult to control, the risk for Abbott lies on potential delays to get FDA approval, which could end up impacting somehow the pipeline roadmap and consequently future market share growth.There are also some mature areas in the company's portfolio with relative flattish growth, such as Rhythm Management and Neuromodulation. While management has just increased the sales team, the recovery of these areas may take some time. On the other hand, this improvement will be relevant for the consolidated financial results, as these product lines still account for a substantial portion of the business.On the financial side, given historical acquisitions, Abbott has increased the goodwill and intangible assets in its balance sheet from 23 to 61% since 2017. While current levels are generally stable during the last 12 months, it is a topic that needs special attention due to the potential damage in case of any meaningful impairment or write-off.With several new products in its portfolio in high growth segments, Abbott is very well-positioned to achieve sustainable above market performance both in top and bottom-lines in the years to come.Investors looking to own shares of Abbott will get exposure to long-term growth trends, such as diabetes medicine, cardiovascular minimally invasive therapies and laboratory operations streamline through the Alinity platform.In my view, despite the modest upside, it is worth owning shares of Abbott, given the outlook for the company and its long term potential. Hence, I consider any weakness in the stock prices as an opportunity to add shares of the company to my portfolio."

The consistent growth since the beginning of 2017 coupled with management's projections of further 7-8% revenue growth in 2020 suggests that had it not been for macro market issues Abbott would be close to breaking $100 - especially given the 60% uplift in bottom line earnings the company achieved in Q419.The catalyst for Abbott's sustained period of share price growth can be traced back to the company's January 2017 acquisition of St. Jude Medical, Inc. for $23.6bn which has helped it grow revenues within its medical device segment by 10% and 7.6% in 2018 and 2019 respectively from $10.2bn to $12.3bn, whilst achieving cost synergies that have led to an increase in gross margins from 47.5% in 2017 to 52.5% in 2019.Although Abbott's growth between 2017 and 2019 has been incremental rather than explosive - revenue has increased at a CAGR of 5% and net profits at a 22% CAGR - it has been enough to increase the share price by 110% since the St Jude's acquisition. The company's current product suite looks strong and diversified with several potential breakout stars including the Freestyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring device, MitraClip, an alternative to heart valve surgery, blood and plasma screening solution Alinity s, and pediatric nutrition range PediaSure.Abbott's CEO Miles White will hand over the reins to long-time company Executive Robert Ford in March. White is credited with transforming the company during his 21 years in charge, growing its market cap from $75bn to $149bn - the fact that he is appointing a hand-picked successor suggests that there is a long-term continuity plan in place.In short, Abbott bears all the hallmarks of a long-term hold and the recent drop in share price - through no fault of the company's - makes the stock all the more appealing. The company is already showing signs of returning to share price accretion and its international reach (Abbott makes 64% of net product sales overseas) and brand recognition may find further favour with investors in the current health conscious climate. In the rest of this article I will look at the company's 4 main divisions in more detail and highlight areas of growth and potential headwinds. By hitting its target of 7-8% organic growth for 2020 the company will achieve a satisfactory GAAP EPS of $2.35 - $2.45 (non-GAAP $3.55 - $3.65) and there is also a higher quarterly dividend payment of $0.36 per share (a 12% increase from 2019) providing a further reason to acquire some Abbott stock at a discounted price, that may not remain discounted for much longer.Abbott Established Pharmaceutical Products division performance 2017 - 2019. Source: my table using data from company 2019 10K submission.Abbott's branded generic pharmaceuticals division is primarily focused on servicing emerging markets, notably China, Brazil, Russia and India. A growing global middle class of 3.2bn people - with 88% of the next billion members expected to originate predominantly from China and India - are demanding better healthcare products. Abbott is an early mover in this space with more than 3,000 employees across 130 countries in this division, although the field is competitive with the likes of Sanofi, Pfizer (PFE) and Novartis (NOVN) also contesting market share.Abbott supplies products that treat a range of illnesses including gastroenterology, women's health issues, cardiovascular and metabolic, pain and central nervous system and respiratory drugs and vaccines. As we can see from the table above this division is responsible for 14% ($4.5bn) of the company's total sales. Although growth rates of 3.3% in 2018 and 1.4% in 2019 may seem stagnant Abbott says in its 2019 10K submission that, adjusted for foreign exchange, the rates are 7% and 7.3% respectively.This is also a high margin business with operating margins rising from 19.8% to 20.1% between 2017 and 2019. This segment therefore provides a welcome boost to the company's overall net profit margin which is a little low for my liking, at 11.3%, although it is one of the few criticisms I can level at the company.Abbott Diagnostic Products division performance 2017 - 2019. Source: my table using data from company 2019 10K submission.Abbott's diagnostic product division contributes just under one quarter (24.2%) of total sales revenues and is broken down into core laboratory, molecular, point of care and rapid diagnostics. Core laboratory is the biggest earning division (14.6% of all company revenues), and covers mainly immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology, and transfusion. This segment is home to the Alinity family of products, which have chiefly been marketed in Europe but are beginning to make sales in the US. FDA approval has been secured for Alinity s, a blood and plasma screening system which will be expected to lead the US charge. If it can repeat its overseas success domestically, Alinity's product suite ought to be a major source of growth for Abbott. Alinity also covers molecular diagnostics - a minor segment which has been in decline losing 9% of its sales between 2018 and 2019. The larger rapid diagnostics segment ($2bn sales, 6% of company sales) also experienced a slight year-on-year decline in sales volumes, owing, Abbott says, to lower than expected infectious disease testing sales in Africa. The segment grew nearly 300% between 2018 and 2019, however, contributing to 33% annual diagnostic product sector growth between 2017 and 2018. This is encouraging since it demonstrates that new and innovative products are capable of moving the needle significantly, and Abbott's annual spend on R&D has exceeded $2bn for the past 2 years.Abbott Nutritional Products division performance 2017 - 2019. Source: my table using data from company 2019 10K submission.Abbott's nutritional products segment contributes 23% of the company's total sales and includes the Similac and Isomil brands for children, Ensure and Pediasure for adults, and numerous brands used for enteral feeding in healthcare institutions.Gains in this division have been unspectacular - 4.4% and 2.5% in 2018 and 2019 respectively, but again Abbott say that adjusting for foreign exchange sales grew by 4.8% in 2019, buoyed by new products, an aging population, growing global middle class and higher incidence of chronic diseases.Additionally, sales of adult nutrition products grew by 10% in Q4, driven by the Ensure/Pediasure brand (according to the Q419 earnings call discussion). The company spends less than $200m of its R&D budget on the nutritional products segment, which suggests it is self-sustaining. South East Asia, Latin America, and the US are key markets, with sales in the US recently outperforming.Last - but most certainly not least - Abbott's medical devices segment is its largest (38% of all company sales), most diverse and fastest growing segment - and the one that has, in my view, the most potential for rapid growth.Abbott Medical Devices division performance 2017 - 2019. Source: my table using data from company 2019 10K submission.To begin with diabetes care, revenues have grown by 36.7% between 2017-18 and by 30.6% between 2018-19, largely thanks to Abbott's Freestyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device.Diabetes monitoring is an explosive market thanks to the progress of companies, including Dexcom and Medtronic as well as Abbott, towards the ""artificial pancreas"" - an all in one connected set of devices that can monitor glucose levels and automatically inject insulin using an intravenous pump as and when required, reducing episodes of hypo or hyper glaecemia, and ensuring diabetes sufferers spend more time in the correct range between the two.Abbott estimates that 2m people worldwide are using its Freestyle Libre device and says sales volumes exceeded $1.8bn in 2019 - a 70% year-on-year increase. That makes the Freestyle Libre the most popular CGM on the market although the competition from the pricier Dexcom G6/7 and Medtronic's Guardian Link and Sensor going forward is likely to be fierce. Abbott received CE mark clearance to market its 2nd generation device - Freestyle Libre 2 - in Europe in 2018 but are still waiting for the FDA to approve the device in the US.The Freestyle Libre is currently the most popular CGM in the US but Abbott will be sweating over approval for the next generation device with Medtronic and Dexcom ready to hoover up any impatient users waiting to switch to the latest device. Still, once approved, the new device ought to prove a big winner for the company. Abbott has secured reimbursement for Freestyle Libre in most markets, and the product could potentially cover Type 2 diabetes sufferers - opening up a market of 27.8m people.Besides diabetes, the medical devices segment also includes rhythm management (pacemakers and defibrillators), which generates >$2bn in sales, and is growing sales at nearly 7% per annum, vascular ($2.8bn sales) and structural heart ($1.4bn, 13% growth in 2019).The MitraClip, designed for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation (""MR""), made $700m of sales in 2019 - a year-on-year increase of 70%. In March last year MitraClip was approved by the FDA for a secondary indication of MR which may triple the number of patients who are eligible to use the device - currently, 80,000 people are using MitraClip worldwide. Another trial is now in progress with the goal of widening the market even further.By most measures (based on my research) Abbott is a company on an upward trajectory with a capable management team that has created an efficient, well organised and lucrative set of complementary businesses.The company reported $3.8bn of cash at YE 2019 and total current assets of $15.7bn with current liabilities of $10bn and long-term debt of $16.7bn. To me this suggests that the company makes good use of its cash and doesn't let it simply sit on the balance sheet without being meaningfully employed. A net profit margin of just 11.6% is a little underwhelming and probably one of the main reasons why the company's shares do not trade higher, given the risk that one or two failing business lines could turn the company into a loss-maker. Personally, however, I see enough potential in its 4 business divisions - and especially within medical devices - for the company to widen these margins in the coming years by selling a higher volume of products at scale whilst cutting loose one or two of its lesser performing product lines.Foreign exchange is an ongoing risk for a company that makes the majority of its sales overseas, but the company's growing presence in markets such as Brazil, China and India is also exciting thanks to these country's rapidly growing middle classes. The fact that the global population is aging, leading to higher incidences of diseases, and the growing power of technology within healthcare are also trends that play directly into Abbott's hands. Abbott competes with both larger rivals who have greater resources, and more agile, smaller competitors, which brings the prospect of either making acquisitions, or being acquired, into play, which is another enticing prospect from an investor's perspective.I do not see too many reasons why Abbott cannot emerge from the current market-wide dip and continue to build its share price towards a price above $100. The company's current PE ratio is 32x, and forward PE (by my calculation) for 2020 is ~27 (14x by 2025 if 8% growth can be maintained).There may be bolder investment opportunities in the marketplace for those looking to ""buy the dip"", but for my money Abbott's consistency is attractive, recent share price growth exceptional, and the potential of its tech-enabled monitoring devices could even make the company a break-out success story in 2020/21."
4296955,104812,2019-10-17T05:37:57-04:00,"ABT reported Q3 earnings largely in-line with expectations.Stock is being supported by positive sentiment surrounding products momentum including its 'MitraClip' stents and 'FreeStyle Libre' glucose monitoring system.Valuation multiples above historical range and tight dividend yield suggest the stock is relatively expensive, even as the growth outlook remains positive.","Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a leader in the healthcare sector with a vast portfolio of products across medical devices, nutrition, and diagnostics tools. The company is also recognized as a dividend aristocrat with an impressive 46 consecutive years of annually increasing their dividend with a history that has been defined by steady earnings growth and effective management. The stock is up 100% on a total return basis over the past three years with a good reception in the market from new innovations and recent acquisitions.ABT just announced its Q3 earnings release which in many ways represented a continuation of the same steady growth investors have come to expect. On the other hand, we highlight that as the stock is trading just off its all-time high reached in July, valuation concerns in our view represent some headwinds for more upside in the near term. This article covers the latest earnings results along with our view on where the stock is headed next.Source: FinViz.comABT reported its fiscal Q3 earnings on October 16 with Non-GAAP EPS of $0.84 which was in-line with expectations. GAAP EPS of $0.53 missed by $0.03. The spread here is related to a $554 million charge, or $0.31 per share, for intangible amortization expense and other expenses primarily associated with acquisitions and restructuring actions. Part of this goes back to the ongoing integration of the major $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical in 2016 along with the smaller purchase of Cephea Valve Technologies in Q1 this year.Back at the annual shareholders' meeting in April, CEO Miles White noted that the company has now ""fully integrated"" the recent acquisitions of the past few years and is looking forward to focusing on ""reaping the full benefits from its current market position."" By this measure the expectation is for the spread between adjusted earnings and GAAP measures to converge going forward and profitability to firm which is something investors can look forward to.This quarter, revenues of $8.1 billion were also in-line with expectations and represented an increase of 5.5% year over year on a reported basis. The company notes that ""organic"" sales increased by a wider 7.6% which excludes the impact of the discontinued non-core U.S. adult nutrition segment from Q3 2018. Favorably, expenses between SG&A increased at a muted 2.7% y/y supporting a higher operating margin.Source: Company IRManagement highlights the ""strong performance"" across segments led by medical devices presenting a 10.6% year-over-year organic revenue growth, followed by 7.9% in established pharmaceuticals, 6.6% in diagnostics, and 3.8% in nutrition.Source: Company IRIn terms of specific product segments, the international market for medical devices is a growth driver up 14.3% on an organic basis in Q3. Management highlights the sales of the company's MitraClip stent device for treatment of mitral valve regurgitation is up 32% with favorable COAPT trial data showing the device is able to increase life expectancy and improved quality of life in individuals.The company is also optimistic with its 'FreeStyle Libre' marketed as the first sensor-based glucose monitoring system which is now accepted by Canadian health plans and receives public reimbursement in Ontario and Quebec. In contrast, the product is not yet covered by most U.S. health insurance plans although this could be a future growth driver. In September, it was announced that Abbott was partnering with Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) to integrate user-consented glucose data from the FreeStyle Libre mobile app with Sanofi's insulin pens, apps and cloud software that are currently in development. The trend highlights the direction the industry is moving towards in terms of placing a greater importance on integrated technology.During the conference call, management pointed to the roll out of its 'Alinity' line of lab systems as a growth driver in the Diagnostics segment, which it sees as having an advantage to other alternatives on the market:From the smaller branded established pharmaceutical segment, which represents 15% of total revenues, management noted momentum in emerging markets including India, Brazil, Russia and China. Abbott sees these regions along with several additional emerging countries as representing attractive long-term growth opportunities for Abbott's branded generics product portfolio.For guidance, management sees adjusted EPS in a range between $3.23 and $3.25, which if confirmed would represent a 12.5% increase from the $2.88 reported for 2018. Of note, the guidance here represented a very small drop at the top end of the range from a previous target between $3.21 to $3.27. We believe this narrowing of the expectations led to the initial sell-off on the stock as ABT traded down by nearly 2% on the earnings release, although it paired some of those losses through the day.Source: Company IRIt's clear that Abbott Labs is a blue-chip company with a long history as a leader in its segment and an impressive performance history for shareholders. Our concern here turns to valuation as the stock appears pricey compared to what it has traded on average in terms of historical multiples. The table below includes the most commonly used valuation metrics with data prior to this latest earnings release against the ratios going back to 2009. We point out that between multiples like a GAAP P/E ratio at 49.3x, Price to Free Cash Flow at 34.8x, Price to Sales 4.6x, and Enterprise Value to EBITDA at 22.3x; in many ways ABT is more expensive now than in recent years.ABT valuation multiples. data by YCharts/table authorConsidering the full year EPS guidance of $3.24 at the midpoint, ABT trades with a forward P/E multiple of 24.9x and 40x on a GAAP basis. Keeping in mind that in 2012 ABT spun-off the AbbVie pharmaceutical research business, the ratios prior to that year are not directly comparable; nevertheless, from 2013, it has been a steady climb higher in how the market values ABT assigning a what is essentially a more aggressive premium.Often times such dynamics are explained by either a higher growth rate or expansion in profitability margins. The case of ABT from the chart below it's clear that the gross margin and EBITDA margin indeed have trended higher since what was a weak period in 2016 to approach the highest levels in a decade. The other reasoning that shares of ABT should command a higher premium is based on the perception that the business outlook has improved with an expectation of higher quality cash flows. As long as ABT holds off on any new major acquisition or new restructuring plan, we expect free cash flow to increase as margins stabilize at the currently high levels. This of course is a positive trend, but we believe a larger follow-through with better than expected results will be required for the next leg higher in the stock.Data by YChartsThe other consideration is that the current dividend yield on a trailing twelve-month basis at 1.53% also appears narrow compared to yields investors have received in previous years. Along with the valuation metrics mentioned above, the tight dividend yield suggests the stock is relatively expensive. Still, considering the current operating results and expectations of further earnings growth, we don't see a reason to expect a significant sell-off. We rate ABT as a HOLD, while potential investors may want to look for a potential pullback towards to $70.00 to 75.00 per share level as representing a better buying opportunity.Data by YChartsOverall, this was another solid earnings release with sentiment around the stock largely based on numerous product developments and headlines including clinical trials and regulatory approval updates. Valuation multiples suggest the stock commands a premium and while some ratios appear stretched, we believe the company's leadership position and positive sentiment around its new products will continue to support the stock in the near term.Steady growth can be expected going forward and the main monitoring points for investors should be the evolution of margins and the pace of growth among the smaller product segments which could have the potential to drag lower firm-wide totals should they lose their respective market positions. We see the main risks as related to global cyclical trends with a potential slowdown either in the U.S. or in major international markets likely leading revisions lower in the growth estimates that may drive the stock price lower."
4272188,104439,2019-06-26T09:30:58-04:00,"Abbott has a diversified portfolio of healthcare products that are highly regarded in the market.The firm has demonstrated strong financial results over the years, achieving higher revenues and greater economies of scale.Numerous successful acquisitions have helped the firm both strengthen its market position and score higher cash flows. The firm has delivered a higher alpha than peer-average.The firm has a lower total risk compared to peer-average but slightly higher systematic risk. Current issues include a large debt position.Tests show that the firm has maintained its exposure to big, growth portfolios, combining this with increasing dividends, Abbott is a high potential firm.","Abbott (ABT) is a renowned manufacturer of healthcare products. The firm features a diversified portfolio of branded generics that are manufactured and sold worldwide. In the last five years, the firm has delivered 9.2% CAGR in sales while producing a roughly 12.8% average in net profit margin. The firm has received regulatory approval for several products last year which are projected to feed long-term growth, and combining this with the firm’s acquisition-led growth strategy, Abbott looks like an attractive company.Currently, Abbott is capitalizing on some of its life-saving technologies which include Alinity systems, FreeStyle Libre, MitraClip, Advisor HD grid mapping catheter, HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist device and XIENCE Sierra drug-eluting stent system. Abbott has been steadily increasing its dividends and I expect the trend to continue this year. Abbott expects to achieve organic sales growth of 6.5% to 7.5% for the full year and adjusted EPS of $0.79 to $0.81 which reflects strong double-digit underlying growth partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange effects. Combining all the factors, Abbott is a hold at $85.In its first quarter of the year, the diagnostics segment saw a 10% sales growth, owing to the solid performance of Alinity systems, the firm’s next-generation diagnostics system. The product line is driving growth both in the U.S. region and internationally. Besides converting existing customers to Alinity. In Europe, the firm is also winning competitive bids for new business at a very high rate. In its effort to expand the Alinity line, the firm has increased its launch activities for its hematology system Alinity H and increasing its menu of tests in key markets like China and the U.S. In the years to come, Alinity will have significant contribution in the growth of its diagnostics segment.Image: Alinity SystemDuring the quarter, Nutrition sales increased by 6.5% driven by new product innovations and sales execution efforts. The firm continues to face a growing demand trajectory and achieving above-market growth in Asia and Latin America. The firm’s renowned nutrition brands Similac, Pediasure and Ensure is driving momentum in this segment. In pharmaceuticals, key emerging markets like India, Brazil, Russia and China continue to drive the firm forward, particularly because of the underlying growth in these economies. Although sales growth in pharmaceuticals was 5.5% in the quarter, key emerging markets in the equation delivered 7.5% growth.Last but not least, the HeartMate 3 left ventricular assist device delivered solid market penetration and contributed towards the 10% sales growth. During the quarter the firm filed for CE market for its TriClip device which is the first of its kind, minimally-invasive device for repairing leaky tricuspid heart valves. Abbott plans to initiate its U.S. pivotal trial for TriClip in the coming months.A solid combination of acquisition-led and organically-driven strategy has proven to be impactful for the company. Slow but gradual increases in the gross margin indicate that the firm might be achieving increasing economies of scale. The variability in profit margin is attributed to several factors which include the firm’s increasing expenditure because of research & development, amortization of intangible assets and SG&A.Source: StockrowIn the meantime, dividend and dividend coverage both continue to grow steadily.Source: StockrowA key issue for the firm is its large debt. At the beginning of 2018, Abbott committed to reducing its debt levels and in 2018 Abbott repaid approximately $8.3 billion of debt, net of borrowings, bringing its total debt to $19.6 billion. But it's possible that Abbott could considerably reduce its leverage in the next couple of years given its large cash flows coming in from a diversified portfolio of industry-standard products. Because of its acquisition-led growth, the firm has significant intangible assets, large impairments or write-offs could hurt the financial health of the firm, but so far, things look bright as the acquisitions have proven to be fruitful for the company.In order to quantify various risk measures, I have regressed the returns of Abbott and some of its competitors against the Fama French factors. The peers include Bio-Rad (BIO), Amgen (AMGN), Pfizer (PFE), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Danaher (DHR). Test results show that Abbott’s total risk is less than the average of its competitors but has a slightly higher systematic risk than the peer-average; this implies that Abbott has comparatively lower specific risk compared to peer-average. Abbott has also delivered above peer-average alpha during the calculation period. Except for Bio-Rad, all other firms featured exposure to big, growth portfolios, p-values indicate the coefficients (exposures) were all statistically significant.Source: Calculated by the authorCorrelation table shows that Abbott’s stock returns have the highest correlation factor with the market and the p-values indicate that all the correlation values are statistically significant. The table suggests that the firm’s stock returns are highly correlated with JNJ’s returns.Source: Calculated by the authorAbbott is a high potential firm in the healthcare business. The firm has demonstrated strong financial performance and continues to strengthen its position with critical acquisitions. One of the key risk factors include its large debt position, but its high cash flows could economically service the payments. In terms of risk, the firm has a lower total risk than peer average but slightly higher systematic risk. Tests show that the firm has delivered a higher alpha compared to the peer average. This year could be another strong year for the company and the dividend could go higher. Combining all the factors, Abbott is a hold at $85."
4235920,57252,2019-01-28T07:03:12-05:00,"Abbott posted solid FY18 numbers driven by strong growth in its Diagnostics and Medical Devices business.The firm's cash cows of Nutrition and Established Pharma also grew in the mid single digits.With its history of strong capital deployment and market multiple, shareholders should do well from current prices, though the stock is not undervalued.","Diverse medical conglomerate Abbott (NYSE:ABT) posted solid fourth-quarter results driven by strong growth in medical devices and diagnostic products. Over the past few years, Abbott has been an impressive story of aggressive capital allocation and M&A in order to remake its margin profile after its split from AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). Although the business looks healthy, I think shares look about fairly valued trading at 22x free cash flow. Let's take a look at performance across Abbott's core businesses, and why the current multiple is justified.Diagnostics grew 7% on an organic business in FY18, though the business in total was up 34% y/y on a reported basis to $7.5 billion, driven by the inclusion of the Alere acquisition. Alere was not a deal that management was enthusiastic about after discovering some fraud and product liability, but the rapid diagnostics business did total over $2 billion in sales in 2018. Management noted that the company was able to achieve sales and synergy targets for the year, which should give some comfort, with Abbott's ability to identify new businesses from the outside. In fact, Abbott has taken the business from flat to slightly down to growth.Abbott is also doing well with its new Alinity point-of-care diagnostics system. Abbott has created a nice ecosystem with products spanning the major diagnostics categories including molecular, blood and plasma, integrated hematology, and integrated clinical chemistry, and immunoassay. With a similar workflow and interface, labs are able to reduce training requirements and experience an increase in productivity.For FY19, Abbott expects the legacy business to grow mid-to-high single digits offset by a low-to-mid single-digit increase in the legacy Alere business. Overall, this implies that the business could top $8 billion in sales in FY19.Medical Devices is mostly the legacy St. Jude's business that Abbott acquired in 2017 for $23 billion with Abbott's existing vascular and structural heart business. However, the star of the show recently has been Abbott's Diabetes Care business, where revenue jumped a whopping 35% y/y on an organic basis to $1.9 billion. Abbott received an approval for the FreeStyle Libre, a non-invasive glucose-monitoring product. The product is over $1 billion in global sales with 300,000 new patient adds in Q4'18, with the trend accelerating in the US due to increasing awareness and patient engagement. Although I anticipate there will be more approvals in the future, Abbott currently enjoys a monopoly on an excellent product with low costs and a positive long-term adoption trend.In addition to Diabetes Care, Abbott's Electrophysiology business grew nearly 20% y/y to $1.7 billion, while its structural heart business grew 13% y/y to $1.2 billion. The growth in the Electrophysiology business was driven mostly by cardiac mapping and ablation catheters selling well, and there is a catalyst on the horizon for further growth in 2019 with the US FDA approval of a new sensor-enabled catheter used to treat atrial fibrillation. On the structural heart front, growth has been driven by Abbott's market-leading leaky heart valve device, MitraClip. With some positive trial data for MitraClip and a product pipeline delivering a few new launches in 2019, growth should continue in FY19.Overall, Abbott's Medical Device business looks to be in great shape, and thus management is guiding to high-single-digit sales growth in FY19.Diagnostics and Medical Devices are clearly the heart of Abbott's growth strategy; however, the company has two huge cash cows in its Nutrition business and its Established Pharmaceuticals business. Neither requires a tremendous amount of investment capital due to their respective end-market maturities, but the Nutrition business still contributed a whopping $7.3 billion in sales (+5% y/y organic) and the Established Pharmaceuticals business a solid $4.2 billion in sales (+7% y/y organic).Combined, these businesses likely contributed around $1.5 billion in free cash flow with capital investments of under $200 million in FY17, which I suspect was similar in FY18. Both generate operating margins of roughly 20%. Both of these businesses get less publicity than the faster growing segments of Abbott that engage in large M&A, but these businesses are incredibly valuable and drive significant shareholder value.Coming out of the spinoff of AbbVie, Abbott had a 54% gross margin and operating margin of 12%. In FY19, management is anticipating adjusted gross margin of 59.5%, driving an operating margin of 22.5%. This has been done through a combination of trading up the value chain in assets as well as strong cost cutting and integration of new transactions. All of this P&L improvement will lead to more free cash flow, which I believe could top $5.5 billion in FY19 through a combination of debt reduction and growth in operating earnings.Abbott's capital allocation has been pretty solid. Management does not sit on cash, letting it accrue to the balance sheet. Rather, CEO Miles White aggressively goes after high value acquisitions, repurchases stock, and increases the dividend. Total capital return to shareholders totaled $2 billion in FY18 on top of $8 billion in debt reduction that allows the company to gear up for another deal.Overall, the business is valued at roughly 22-23x free cash flow, a generous multiple no doubt, but not out of line with medical device peers. Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) trades for about 24x free cash flow with a worse record on capital allocation, while Zimmer (NYSE:ZBH) trades at 17x free cash flow with virtually no growth. Becton, Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) also trades a little over 20x free cash flow, so Abbott is not out of line.With White's track record of capital deployment, I think investors will see adequate returns from current prices, but the stock is certainly not undervalued. I would wait for a 10-15% pullback before considering a position."

Metrics such as revenue and free cash flows have performed remarkably well in the past five years.Data by YChartsCompanies in the medical devices industry typically trade at a premium versus the broad market because the segment is particularly attractive in terms of the growth opportunities and the potential for profitability.

The stock is priced at a discount versus the industry average across the four valuation indicators considered.Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123The table below shows a simple discounted cash flow analysts of Abbott stock. The exercise is assuming $4.9 billion in sustainable free cash flow, an initial growth rate of 12% over six years, a subsequent growth rate of 8% over five more years and a terminal growth rate of 3%. The required rate of return is 9%.Based on these calculations, a reasonable estimate of fair value for Abbott would be around $88 per share, indicating that the stock is undervalued by 14% at current prices.Discounted cash flows valuations rely on a multiplicity of assumptions about the future, and they can provide a false sense of precision by offering a single value estimate for a stock. For this reason, these kinds of calculations should always be taken with a big grain of salt. That said, it's good to know that Abbott stock is fairly priced based on reasonable cash flow projections for the business.It's important to acknowledge that valuation is a dynamic as opposed to a static concept, and fundamental momentum can be a powerful return driver for stock prices.The current market price is reflecting a particular set of expectations about the future of the business. If the company delivers better than expected earnings and, expectations about future performance are increasing, then the stock price will probably increase to reflect those improving expectationsAbbott is being driven by strong fundamental momentum, and earnings expectations for the company in both the current year and next fiscal year are significantly increasing in recent years.Data by YChartsValuation should always be analyzed in its due context. A company with superior financial performance and strong fundamental momentum obviously deserve higher valuation levels, there is not much discussion about this. However, it can sometimes be difficult to incorporate the different quantitative metrics in a single tool.The PowerFactors system is a quantitative algorithm available to members in The Data Driven Investor. This system basically ranks companies in a particular universe according to four quantitative return drivers: financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength.Abbott is the top quintile, with a PowerFactors ranking of 97.46. The stock also has elevated rankings across the four dimensions considered: quality (84.4), value (91.18), fundamental momentum (87.8), and relative strength (83.8).Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123According to the backtested performance data, companies with the strongest quantitative rankings tend to generate superior performance in the long term.Backtested performance does not guarantee future returns, and quantitative algorithms should always be interpreted with caution. The algorithm shows that a group of companies with strong quantitative metrics tend to outperform the market over the years. However, this does not really tell us much about what kind of performance a particular company such as Abbott will deliver in a specific year such as 2019.Nevertheless, the quantitative data shows that Abbott is well positioned for attractive returns when looking at the company from a multi-factor perspective.Abbott operates in a competitive industry, and potential disruption from new drugs and technologies is always a relevant risk factor to keep in mind. Besides, there is a lot of public pressure to reduce healthcare costs across the board, and this could have negative implications on pricing power and profitability in different segments.In spite of these risks, Abbott is a solid business trading at a very reasonable valuation, so the stock looks well positioned for attractive returns going forward."
4242292,50452,2019-02-19T22:19:47-05:00,"Abbott Labs is a healthcare conglomerate that has reshaped itself for growth following its 2013 spin-off of AbbVie.The company's large acquisitions of St. Jude and Alere have impacted its performance metrics and stretched the balance sheet. However, the numbers are trending upward again - and quickly.Its expanded presence in high spend healthcare niches such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes are likely to pay off over the long run.The stock is slightly overvalued, but Abbott Labs is a blue-chip company poised for success over the long run. Long-term investors should look for an opportunity to add the stock to their portfolio.","Healthcare is a fundamental need of society, and thus, will always provide a market for the businesses that operate within the space. Because of the fluid dynamics of the healthcare industry (advancing technologies, potential for regulation, etc.), we believe that diversified healthcare companies provide both exposure to growth and safety from having interests in multiple fields. Since splitting off most of its pharmaceutical business in 2013, Abbott Laboratories (ABT) has re-positioned itself in strategic markets for the years to come. The company is beginning to realize success in the form of strong organic growth. This growth, combined with strong fundamentals, makes Abbott Labs one of our favorite long-term healthcare plays on the market.Abbott Labs is a healthcare conglomerate that designs, produces, and distributes a number of products, including pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter products, products for infants, nutritional supplements, and various medical devices. The company operates in four segments: Nutrition, Diagnostics, Established Pharmaceuticals, and Medical Devices. Medical Devices is the largest revenue contributor at just over a third, followed by Nutrition, Diagnostics, and Established Pharmaceuticals. Abbott Labs does business in various markets across the world, with approximately 41% of sales coming from emerging markets.(Source: YCharts)The company has seen strong growth since spinning off AbbVie (ABBV) in 2013. This growth has been both organic and through acquisitions. Over the past five years, revenue has grown at a CAGR of 8.52%, while earnings per share have grown at 14.09%.Abbott Labs has been shuffling its assets a bit, making both acquisitions and divestitures. We see this in the financial metrics from over the past five years. Operating margins have begun to rebound after a short decline. When we look at the conversion rate of revenue to FCF, we also see an uptrend. The company is currently converting a healthy 16.19% of revenue into cash flow. We will want to monitor this in the coming years to see that this performance is maintained. We want to see companies consistently convert at least 10% of revenue into FCF.(Source: YCharts)We see similar volatility in Abbott's cash rate of return on invested capital (CROCI). This measures how efficient management is at deploying company resources by measuring the cash returns that they generate. This is also a basic indicator of a company's competitive ""moat"". We can see that Abbott's CROCI took a big hit following the spin-off. Since then, the metric has trended higher. We will continue to monitor this, as it currently falls short of our benchmark (13+%). It is important to note that a lot of assets have come and gone due to M&A, so it may take time to get a real sense of the company's performance here.(Source: YCharts)The last area of review before moving on is the balance sheet. It is very important for a company to maintain financial discipline. A company with too much debt will become vulnerable to rising interest rates, and risks facing a cash flow problem if the business suffers an unexpected downturn.(Source: YCharts)Abbott Labs stretched its balance sheet in order to absorb its large acquisitions of Alere (worth $5.3 billion) and St. Jude Medical (worth $25 billion). Even though the company remains above our leverage ""warning sign"" threshold of 2.5X EBITDA, it paid down approximately $8 billion in debt in 2018 alone. This has already drastically reduced its leverage, and by end of the current year, we expect Abbott to be within target debt parameters.Abbott Labs technically won't show up on dividend growth screenings, as the spin-off in 2013 disrupts the dividend growth streak on a per share basis. However, Abbott is virtually a Dividend Champion, as the company has raised its payout for 47 consecutive years. The dividend is paid every quarter, and totals an annual sum of $1.28 per share. The dividend's current yield of 1.70% is not likely high enough to appeal to income-focused investors. US 10-year treasuries are currently offering much more attractive yields at 2.67%.(Source: YCharts)While the past several years have exhibited mediocre dividend growth (three-year CAGR of 5.3%), long-term investors should be excited about the potential for strong dividend growth in the years ahead. Abbott has had to rein in the dividend, as major acquisitions stretched the balance sheet after the spin-off in 2013. As the balance sheet gains strength ($8 billion in debt paid down this year), the dividend is likely to see some attention. The current payout occupies just 40% of cash flows, and the company's cash streams are likely to grow in the upcoming years, thanks to Abbott positioning itself in growth niches.(Source: YCharts)Once the balance sheet is back on its feet, we expect comfortable dividend growth in the high single digits. This is on par with the company's upcoming growth trajectory.When it comes to growth, Abbott Labs has done a great job positioning itself in growing niches within healthcare. Its acquisition of St. Jude greatly bolstered Abbott's offerings in cardiovascular care, which is already a prominent area of expenditure within the healthcare field and is still growing.(Source: State of Obesity)Obesity rates continue to climb in the United States, as food products are packed with high amounts of sugar and fat. Fast food products continue to strive to offer the most ""bang for the buck"", leading to larger portions than ever before. The trend has bled into the global population as well.(Source: Washington Post)Over the past several decades, the global obesity rate has more than doubled among women and tripled among men. This is partially due to countries developing economically and attracting Western companies to target these emerging markets for expansion. These trends point to continued opportunity for Abbott Labs and the portfolio of cardiovascular products that it offers. It is similarly lucrative for Abbott's diabetes technology, led by FreeStyle Libre, which now services 1 million patients worldwide (in a market of 400 million people with diabetes worldwide). Abbott is working to grow capacity, as demand is expected to remain strong. The product offers non-invasive means of glucose monitoring.Healthcare is such a core need of society that the strong demand for innovation and quality within the sector mean well for Abbott Labs over the long term. The only major threat that the company faces is the potential damage that increased regulation from governing bodies in large markets could pose. A prime example of this is the current discussion of a single-payer healthcare system in the US. While this is a long way from happening, radical changes to the healthcare industry could potentially have a significant negative impact on the company's business results.The market has responded well to Abbott's strategic moves. Over the past three years, the stock has almost doubled.(Source: YCharts)The current price of just over $75 per share is at the top of its 52-week range. With analysts projecting the company to earn approximately $3.21 per share for FY2019, the stock currently trades at 23.42X earnings.(Source: YCharts)Analyst consensus is that Abbott Labs will grow earnings at a CAGR between 10% and 11% over the next five years, so we view the current earnings multiple as near fair value (perhaps a touch rich). We view Abbott Labs as a top-tier healthcare holding, so long-term investors will likely do fine over a time frame of 5+ years. Given the market's current run higher over the past five weeks, we could see a correction in the share price offering investors a better buying opportunity. If investors were to obtain shares at 21X earnings, the stock would be trading at roughly $67 per share. Shares last broke through this level around the holidays.Abbott's history of performance, and forward-thinking acquisitions have solidified a strong bull thesis, in our view. We are impressed by the company's strong cash flow and the ability to deleverage quickly. As the balance sheet continues to improve, we expect investors to begin seeing increased shareholder returns in the form of dividend growth and buybacks. Abbott Labs is a strong company that deserves consideration for any long-term portfolio.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article.Author Disclaimer: Wealth Insights is an investor and investment author.

4269631,103071,2019-06-11T11:58:53-04:00,"New data released by Abbott on the FreeStyle Libre Continuous Glucose Monitor shows it lowers blood sugar levels across the board by nearly a full percentage point in diabetics.The data is consistent for all type II patients regardless of age, sex, or how much insulin they take or for how long they've been taking it.The monitor is painless and requires no calibration and lasts 14 days, longest on the market.This could make insulin use much more efficient in the US, a market in dire need lower insulin prices, which more efficient use can help deliver.Abbott is relatively weak in the U.S. market, and a relatively reasonable 3.5% market penetration for this glucose monitor can increase Abbott's top line by 50%.","In the rush to wow the biotech world with ever more expensive and cutting-edge drugs, the importance of drug efficiency can get lost in the mix. Drug prices can only go so high before economics kicks in and price increases can no longer be supported. Nobody knows exactly where that point is, but it is clear that the trend to find bigger, better, more expensive blockbusters cannot last forever.Within this biotech backdrop, Abbott Laboratories (ABT) is succeeding by making existing drugs better. And the company may have just hit the proverbial gold mine, this one in diabetes management.Insulin prices specifically in the United States are way out of control and the government is taking notice, to the detriment of the established diabetes players. While getting insulin prices down directly would of course be desirable, the extremely convoluted United States healthcare system and its vested interests get in the way of accomplishing this with any urgency. Another way to attack the problem of high insulin costs then is to help make insulin use more efficient. In other words, help those who already use insulin to better control their blood sugar levels with it. Over time, this cuts insulin waste and helps manage costs without directly influencing the per-unit price. In standard basic economics parlance, bring down insulin demand.This past weekend at the annual American Diabetes Association Scientific Sessions, Abbott demonstrated that it can indeed accomplish this mission. The company’s FreeStyle Libre Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) System was able to show that it could help type II diabetes sufferers lower their A1C hemoglobin by nearly a full percentage point on average over a three month period. The data presented was not of insulin naïve patients either, but rather patients that have been using insulin for an average of 8 years. 360 patients were able to lower their A1C levels from 8.9% to 8%, not with new, better, more expensive insulin products, but rather with a new monitor. That’s a 10% improvement with no new medications taken.Even more encouraging, the data was surprisingly even across all patient subgroups. Meaning, no differences based on age group, gender, weight or even duration of insulin use. There was even improvement in A1C levels across the board, no matter what stage of diabetes the patient had. That translates to better use of existing resources through and through.Even before the new data was published, the market has already been responding to Abbott’s new CGM system quite enthusiastically. It’s hard to see without looking into filings and the specific minutiae of top line details because the segment that the new glucose monitor is subsumed under is Abbott’s smallest and most unassuming. It’s labeled “Other,” which many investors gloss over and forget to pay attention to. But it’s definitely there.Take a look at Abbott’s segmental reporting last quarter, and you’ll find that growth is stalling, at least when taking foreign exchange fluctuations into account. Top line sales in total reportable segments is down 0.1% (page 19) year over year, but then “Other” swoops in with a 35.4% year-over-year growth rate, bringing total net sales up 2%. Total sales in “Other” reached $581 million, up from $430 million in Q1 2018. Of that $581 million, $379 million, or 65% was from sales of the FreeStyle Libre CGM. Sales growth for the monitor alone is over 70%. Now that the data is out, we can expect those figures to go much higher over the next few years.What is unique about diabetes over almost any other disease is that treatment is not just a question of what drugs to take, but one of constant testing, timing, calibration, finger pricking and injections that never ends. It is a constant war of attrition, and sooner or later, patients get tired and lax. Abbott’s new system is currently the longest lasting wearable glucose sensor on the market and since it takes its readings from the interstitial fluid in the skin, it is painless. It is also the only monitor that does not require any user calibration. It’s essentially a turnkey diabetes solution, and the numbers so far prove it.Bottom line, where can this CGM lead Abbott over time? According to the company, it is now in use by 1.5 million patients globally (see link in paragraph 4), which constitutes just 0.35% of the global diabetes market. Extrapolating this, global market penetration of as little as 3.5% would represent a ten-fold increase in current sales figures, which translates to roughly $3.8 billion in quarterly sales, or roughly $15 billion in annual revenues. Last quarter, Abbott’s net sales were $7.5 billion, so this glucose monitor could increase quarterly sales by 50% with just 3.5% global market penetration.With the backdrop of the crisis in insulin prices especially in the United States, it is hard to see how Abbott’s new CGM won’t be pushed hard by U.S. diabetes groups. Keep in mind that U.S. sales for Abbott are currently a weak point in its business structure. Total U.S. sales are only $2.75 billion last quarter, less than half of the International segment. The insulin pricing crisis is centered on the U.S. specifically, and therefore there is no other country where Abbott’s new CGM is needed more acutely.There will be competition for sure, which is why I’m only using a 3.5% market penetration as my initial base case, though it could certainly go higher if Abbott stays ahead of the game and keeps making incremental improvements to the system, not really an outlandish assumption to make.At bottom, because of a simple continuous glucose monitor, Abbott now has a real possibility of breaking into a gigantic U.S. diabetes market that desperately needs cost-lowering solutions, rather than strictly ever newer and more expensive diabetes drugs, even if they are improvements over the status quo from a medical perspective. This is certainly needed as well, but cannot be the exclusive focus in the diabetes sector.A quick snapshot of Abbott’s finances shows a company in balance with a conservative and responsible balance sheet. It is leveraged only 11%, with debt down $8 billion since 2017, about a 30% reduction in total debt load.The biggest near term risk to Abbott’s stock price seems to be beta market volatility, though even from that angle, if we look at Abbott’s price action during last year’s brief bear market, the stock was essentially range bound and never broke through near term support during that time. If general volatility continues due to the ongoing trade war and other destabilizing political factors, the stock has proven that it can withstand this sort of pressure in the past.In the face of fast rising sales from a product that could broadly influence the diabetes market especially in the lion’s den of runaway insulin prices, the United States, then even at all time highs, the risks surrounding Abbott Labs look fairly low, with potential returns looking quite attractive."
4215419,80836,2018-10-29T11:33:07-04:00,"I have already analyzed Abbott Laboratories in the past.After the recent pullback and the Q3 results, it is time to take another look at the company.I will compare it with Medtronic and Becton, Dickinson and Company.","In a previous article, I analyzed Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX) and Medtronic (MDT). I found them to be great companies which are also dividend aristocrats. In the current article, I am going to analyze and try to see whether Abbott Laboratories (ABT) is a more attractive company than Becton, Dickinson and Medtronic. Abbott announced its Q3 results 10 days ago, and it is a good time to take another look at it.The medical devices sub-sector in the healthcare sector is one of my favorite segments of the market. The companies there are not as attractive as the glamorous pharmaceutical companies, with shining patents and blockbuster drugs. Therefore, many times you can find consistent companies for fair valuation which deliver high returns to investors.In this article, I will use the following graph to analyze the company. I will look at the fundamentals, valuation, risks and opportunities. I will then try to decide which company is more attractive for dividend growth investors, who invest for the long term. I already know that BDX and MDT are great firms. Time to look at ABT.Abbott Laboratories engages in the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a broad and diversified line of health care products. It operates through the following segments: Established pharmaceutical products, nutritional products, diagnostic products, cardiovascular and neuromodulation products, and other.The revenue stream has grown significantly in the past several years. The major reason for the growth is the acquisition of St. Jude Medical back in 2016, which was valued at $25 billion. It adds up to the acquisition of Alere at the beginning of 2016 for $5.3 billion. Since then, the company shows continuous revenue growth which is achieved organically. In Q3, the company showed 7.8% organic growth in sales. The organic growth together with the synergies from the acquisitions will support earning growth.ABT Revenue (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsThe earning per share is growing at an even faster pace. Abbott did show double digits earning growth in 2017, and it's on its path for similar growth in 2018 despite the currency headwinds. At the same time, analysts predict that the company will offer low double digits earning growth in the medium term. It will be propelled by cost cutting, organic growth and improved margins.ABT EPS Estimates for Next Fiscal Year data by YChartsAbbott Laboratories is a dividend aristocrat. It may be confusing, and some websites will tell you that the growth streak is much shorter, but this is the truth. Before the spin-off of AbbVie (ABBV) the company was a dividend aristocrat, and since the spin-off it kept raising the dividend payment. The dividend is extremely safe with the payout ratio at 38% based on 2018 earnings. Investors should expect a dividend raise in the current quarter. The initial yield is a little disappointing, but this is a result of capital appreciation as the fundamentals improved in the past year.ABT Dividend Yield (TTM) data by YChartsThe company is also using its earnings to return money to shareholders using stock repurchases. The company is consistently buying back its own shares, and the only reason why the shareholders were diluted was because the company used shares to pay for the St. Jude Medical Acquisition. I expect the company to use stock buybacks modestly in the coming years, as it used to do before the latest mega acquisition.ABT Shares Outstanding data by YChartsThe P/E ratio seems too high at the moment, and the company should have some very impressive growth prospects to justify it. It's over than 10% higher than its two peers, while according to the consensus of analysts, the company is not forecasted to show much higher growth. In fact, BDX is forecast to grow faster, but its valuation is more attractive. Medtronic will grow slower than Abbott, but I am not sure it justifies a 28% higher valuation.ABT PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe graph from Fastgraph.com tells a very similar story. You can see that the average P/E is lower than 20, and it includes the time when the company was also a pharmaceutical company which usually trades for higher valuation. Not only that, it includes the era of zero interest rate, and as the interest rate is climbing, we should expect lower valuations. In my opinion, the company will have to offer amazing growth opportunities to justify its rich valuation even after the 10% drop in the past month.When I look at the fundamentals and valuation alone, I still believe that Medtronic is the most attractive company among the three. It's true that its forecasted froth rate is a little slower than its two peers, but its valuation is by far more attractive. Any improvement in Medtronic will unlock a lot of value to shareholders. At the same time, every correction in the share price of BDX and ABT will make them superior options.Abbott is enjoying global expansion and it enjoys fast growth in emerging markets. Unlike some of its peers, Abbott already enjoys meaningful sales in the emerging markets. It is a leader in major countries like China, India, and Russia, and it plans to keep investing in those markets to achieve rapid growth in the medium term.Abbott has a diversified pipeline and it shows growth across the board. While some analysts hoped for even higher growth, the slide below shows very impressive growth in all the four segments. The most important segment, medical devices, showed the highest growth, and it also beat the expectation of the analysts. The combination of growth in every segment and in every geographical area is a major advantage for Abbott going forward.The St. Jude Medical acquisition creates a leading cardiovascular care business. It offers Abbott an entry into promising Neuromodulation area. It is a major acquisition, that once its assimilation will be completed will be very important for Abbott. It will create a whole new business segment, with some major growth prospects.The company depends on the international markets for almost two thirds of its sales. The interest rate is going up in the United States, and the U.S Dollar is growing stronger. Therefore, the sales of companies like Abbott which sell its products outside of the United States will suffer from currency headwinds. In the beginning of the year the management hoped for currency tailwind, but the opposite has occurred and next year it will suffer from the same issue.The reliance on foreign markets is a good thing for the company, as it allows it to diversify its revenue stream. However, in the current environment, when free trade is at risk due to possible trade wars, the reliance on foreign markets, and especially emerging markets can be a medium-term risk for the company. If China will use tariffs on products sold by Abbott it will hurt the revenue stream in the medium term.The company is also facing some fierce competition from its peers. It operates in fast growing segments, with high margins, and therefore other players are competing with it. In addition, it still has to assimilate both St. Jude Medical and Alere and reduce the long-term debt. The assimilation of Alere is more complicated as its business isn't as stable as the rest of Abbott's business segments.When I look at Becton, Dickinson, Abbott and Medtronic, I find three companies with a very solid future. Now, I prefer Medtronic over Becton, Dickinson and Abbott due to the more attractive valuation. The higher valuation of BDX and ABT is supported by more optimistic forecast. However, I don't think that Medtronic should trade for such a large discount. In the current environment, when we see the interest rate climbing, I prefer companies that offers better valuation and higher margin of safety.I believe that when you invest for the long term, the current discount is meaningful. I don't care about the next three years. I care about the next decade, and even longer. Therefore, I cannot prefer a company that has similar risks and opportunities profile but trades for a higher valuation due to higher expectation for the coming three years. While I prefer Medtronic, if the market is going to suffer from a pullback and the valuation will be closed, I will prefer adding to Abbott over BDX and MDT. At the moment among the three Abbott is my largest position followed by Medtronic and then Becton Dickinson."
4234111,63883,2019-01-17T15:42:56-05:00,"Abbott Laboratories has increased its dividend for 46 consecutive years, which qualifies the company to be a member of the Dividend Aristocrats Index.While the company's dividend history is certainly impressive, we recommend that investors take a closer look at the dividend safety of their portfolio holdings.With that in mind, this article performs a deep dive into Abbott's dividend safety by looking at earnings, free cash flow, recession performance, and debt (including a stress test).","Abbott Laboratories (ABT) is a well-known stock among dividend growth investors because of its impressive dividend history (46 years of increases, qualifying it to be a Dividend Aristocrat).On the surface, Abbott's dividend history may suggest that the company pays a very safe dividend. With that said, we recommend that investors always look beyond dividend history to ensure - without question - that their holdings pay safe dividends.With that in mind, this article will examine Abbott Laboratories' dividend safety relative to earnings, free cash flow, recession performance, and debt. If you prefer learning through videos, you can watch a video analysis on the topic below:To begin, let’s talk about Abbott Laboratories' business model. Abbott Laboratories is one of the largest medical appliances & equipment manufacturers in the world. Only Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) (which also has other businesses such as pharmaceuticals) has a higher market capitalization. Abbott Laboratories was founded in 1888 and has grown into a company valued at $120 billion.It is a well-known dividend stock because of its compelling track record of dividend growth. With 46 years of consecutive dividend increases, Abbott Laboratories is a member of the Dividend Aristocrats Index, a group of elite dividend stocks with more than 25 years of consecutive dividend increases.Looking ahead, investors cannot rely on Abbott Laboratories’ dividend history alone to measure its dividend safety. For the remainder of this article, we will discuss the company’s current dividend safety from four perspectives:First, let’s discuss Abbott Laboratories’ dividend safety in the context of the company’s current earnings.When Abbott Laboratories reported third quarter financial results on October 17th, the company announced that it generated adjusted earnings per share of $0.75 in the three-month reporting period. For context, Abbott Laboratories currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.28 for a payout ratio of 37% in the most recent quarter.Looking out over a longer time horizon, our conclusion is the same. Abbott Laboratories generated $2.07 of adjusted earnings per share through the first nine months of fiscal 2018 and paid $0.84 of common share dividends during the same time period for a dividend payout ratio of 41%.Using earnings, its dividend appears very safe for the foreseeable future.Many analysts believe that comparing a company’s dividend payments to its free cash flow is a better method for assessing dividend safety. Accordingly, we will now compare Abbot Laboratories’ current dividend payment to its free cash flow.Through the first nine months of fiscal 2018, Abbott Laboratories generated $4.5 billion of cash from operating activities and spent $927 million on capital expenditures for free cash flow of $3.6 billion. The company distributed $1.5 billion of common share dividends during the same time period for a free cash flow dividend payout ratio of 42%.Using free cash flow, our conclusion is the same as when we used earnings to measure Abbot Laboratories’ dividend safety, although a second-level analysis was required. The company’s dividend appears safe for the foreseeable future.Companies do not cut their dividends in the good times. Instead, dividends are reduced when companies experience financial difficulties. Accordingly, this section will analyze Abbot Laboratories’ current dividend safety in the context of the company’s historical recession performance.We believe that the best way to measure a company’s recession resiliency is by measuring its earnings per share performance during the financial crisis that occurred between 2007 and 2009. Abbott Laboratories’ performance during this time period is shown here:Abbott Laboratories’ earnings per share continued their streak of uninterrupted increases during the 2007-2009 recession. Accordingly, we have no concerns about the company’s ability to pay rising dividends during future economic downturns.The last angle that we will use to assess Abbott Laboratories’ current dividend safety is by looking at the company’s current debt level. More specifically, we will see how much the company’s weighted average interest rate will need to increase before the company’s free cash flow will no longer cover its dividend payment.Through the first nine months of fiscal 2018, Abbott Laboratories generated $640 million of interest expense and had $23.3 billion of debt outstanding for a weighted average interest rate of 3.7%.The following image shows how changes to Abbott Laboratories’ weighted average interest rate would impact the company’s dividend safety as measured by free cash flow.Source: Sure Dividend CalculationsAs the image shows, Abbott Laboratories’ weighted average interest rate would need to rise to approximately the 16% level before its dividend would no longer be covered by free cash flow. Accordingly, we believe that the company’s debt level is unlikely to impact the safety of its dividend moving forward.Abbott Laboratories' dividend history shows that the company has historically had the ability and willingness to pay rising dividends through a variety of economic regimes.With that in mind, the conclusion of our dividend safety analysis should not be surprising. After examining Abbott Laboratories' dividend safety relative to its earnings, free cash flow, recession performance, and debt, we conclude that Abbott Laboratories' dividend appears very safe for the foreseeable future."

4207947,78545,2018-09-24T13:24:21-04:00,"Expectations were low for the COAPT trial due to disappointing results from French-funded study MITRA-FR. However, some analysts still believed COAPT was different enough to see a more positive outcome.Those analysts were right; COAPT results were overwhelmingly positive. Both primary endpoints were met: Hospitalization and mortality both saw significant reductions.Results should provide a boost to Abbott's stock and positive read-through to other companies pursuing transcatheter mitral valve repair.","On Sunday, September 23, Abbott Laboratories (ABT) presented results from its trial entitled COAPT, for Cardiovascular Outcomes Assessment of the MitraClip Percutaneous Therapy. It tested the MitraClip device on functional mitral valve regurgitation, or FMR. As I had written two weeks ago, while most investors were notably more cautious due to MITRA-FR results (explained later), some bulls did believe that the two studies were different enough to the point where COAPT could still see positive results. In the end, they were right - Abbott's results were overwhelmingly successful, with the audience cheering when the results were shown on screen at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics conference, TCT 2018. This represents a huge success for Abbott, and its stock will likely be rewarded. The MitraClip is an important asset in Abbott's business. While the drug currently only makes up an estimated $300 - $500 million of revenue, it's growing in the double digits, thereby contributing a significant portion to the company's growth plans going forward.MitraClip is a device that treats mitral valve regurgitation (MR) by repairing the valves with a clip. The device is inserted in a minimally invasive way through the use of a transcatheter - an important delivery method given the condition of many patients that have MR. There are two kinds of MR - degenerative mitral valve regurgitation (dMR), and functional mitral valve regurgitation (FMR). The MitraClip had received approval for dMR, but had not yet received approval for FMR in the US (but did have approval for FMR outside of the US). This was important because FMR cases make up anywhere between 60-80% of all MR cases. There is no proven therapy currently for FMR.In late August, results from MITRA-FR (a clinical study funded by France to gain reimbursement there) were presented that examined MitraClip’s effect on patients with FMR. The results showed a miss on all-cause death and unplanned rehospitalizations, and physicians were surprised at the lack of efficacy shown. With COAPT studying MitraClip's impact on FMR as well, analysts were quick to lower expectations for the trial. My best guess at COAPT expectations prior to the release were for a miss on primary endpoints and potentially positive results on secondary endpoints.However, some analysts and investors pointed out differences between MITRA-FR and COAPT. First, the MITRA-FR study was smaller and based in France versus COAPT which was double the size and based in the US. Second, MITRA-FR patients were very ill and included only patients with severe FMR (vs. COAPT which included moderate-to-severe and severe FMR). Furthermore, the primary endpoints were different. These differences were enough for some bulls to believe that COAPT could see more positive results than expected.The bulls were right. The COAPT results presented at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics 2018 conference on Sunday were strongly positive, as results met both primary endpoints of reduced hospitalization and mortality. Of particular importance was the magnitude of the reductions; hospitalization was lowered by 47%, while mortality was reduced by 38%. This is an enormous reduction, and physicians described COAPT as a ""blockbuster"" trial. Results also showed an improvement in quality of life for patients, who suffer immensely from their illness. Source: TCT 2018 conference presentation. Source: TCT 2018 conference presentation. The implications for Abbott sales and the stock price are strongly positive. The lead author noted that 10% of heart failure patients could be eligible for the treatment. With an estimated 2M - 6M in the US suffering from heart failure, this would imply an opportunity of 200K - 600K patients. These numbers in turn would suggest a MitraClip opportunity in the billions. Additionally, given the strength of the results and the excitement from doctors, adoption could be more rapid than initially believed as well. Expect consensus revenue estimates for Structural Heart to move up for Abbott. The positive COAPT results should also bode well for other medical device companies targeting transcatheter mitral valve repair. These companies include Medtronic (MDT), Edwards Lifesciences Corp (EW), Boston Scientific Corp (BSX), and LivaNova (LIVN).This post originally appeared on The Non-Consensus."
4273059,50452,2019-07-01T22:33:36-04:00,"Abbott Laboratories has almost tripled up on the S&P 500 over the past few years. This has stretched the valuation of the stock.The reason for positive sentiment around Abbott is the company's various growth engines in high spend areas of healthcare, such as heart disease and diabetes.Investors should allow themselves to tolerate a higher valuation for Abbott than historical data suggests because of this growth.While the stock remains expensive, even against a higher valuation threshold, investors should consider Abbott if a market correction brings shares down to the $70 range.","With the stock market near all-time highs, many stocks have been pushed to similar benchmarks recently. Whenever this happens, we as investors need to step back and really focus on the fundamentals of a given company in order to avoid the trap of buying into an overvalued stock. An example of this is healthcare conglomerate Abbott Laboratories (ABT). The stock has seen a meteoric rise over the past three years, easily outpacing the S&P 500 over that time frame. While the current share price places valuation metrics out of line with historical norms, Abbott is exhibiting some exciting developments that we believe justify an adjustment to our target entry point. We explore what those are, and lay out where we would find Abbott Labs to be an attractive investment option.(Source: YCharts)Whenever a stock makes a move this pronounced, it's reasonable to assume some heavy swings in the valuation metrics. Considering Abbott Labs is a large-cap company, this is especially true. At more than $84 per share, the stock now trades at 26.4X the midpoint of full-year projected earnings. This is a hefty 73.9% premium to the company's 10-year median P/E ratio of just 15.2X.(Source: YCharts)This has been reflected in its free cash flow streams as well. The company's yield on free cash flow has plummeted to near five-year lows at just 2.97%. Typically, we look for a yield in the 6-10%+ range as an indicator of value.Dividend growth and income investors will also come up short here. ABT's current dividend yield of 1.52% not only falls short of 10-year US treasury yields, but it's also well below the stock's 10-year median yield of 2.57%. When we look at value as a comparable to past performance, the stock is aggressively overvalued. However, there are some reasons for investors to adjust their valuation perimeters. Sometimes a change in the forward trajectory of a business can justify a higher valuation.The company has reinvigorated itself since spinning off the majority of its pharmaceutical business as AbbVie Inc. (ABBV) years ago. The company has diversified itself into non-pharmaceutical areas such as Diagnostics and Cardiovascular/Neuromodulation - areas that have been bolstered by blockbuster acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere over the past few years.(Source: Abbott Labs 2018 Annual Report)This has resulted in several long-term growth engines that are powering Abbott to high-single digit organic revenue growth in recent quarters. The first being the company's continuous glucose monitoring system in Freestyle Libre. This was approved by the FDA last summer, and is rapidly growing. As of the company's 2019 Q1 earnings call, the quarter's worldwide sales tally of $380 million is an 80% jump over last year and pushed the total diabetes care up segment 40% from the previous quarter. Abbott is investing in new capacity to keep up with demand. The long-term expectations of analysts and management indicate multi-billion potential for the popular product.Abbott Labs continues to stay active in the cardiovascular segment with continued innovation. Its latest-generation Mitraclip was given FDA approval during the recent quarter. Cardiovascular will continue to be a growth area for the company. In 2016, a staggering 31% of all global deaths were related to cardiovascular disease. This continues to be a problem as economies modernize and populations pick up poor dietary habits typical of western civilizations. On the other side of the spectrum, you have advances in medicine allowing for better treatment of arrhythmia and other complications of the heart that have been difficult to treat in decades past.Abbott's last major growth engine moving forward is the latest generation of diagnostics equipment in its Alinity line. The company saw sales of its core laboratory equipment grow 10% in Q1. The Alinity line is enjoying a full-scale rollout, including core markets such as the US, and international markets such as China and Europe. With consistent innovation across multiple areas of Abbott's business, growth should be abundant in the years ahead. Analyst consensus is pointing to an uptick in growth, pegging earnings growth at a CAGR of 11% over the next five years.It is for these reasons that we implore investors to consider adjusting the lens through which they view Abbott Labs. We like the company's strategic alignment with high-spend areas of healthcare, such as cardiovascular, diabetes, and diagnostics. While there is possible uncertainty on the horizon as the US faces pressure to consider a single-payer healthcare system, we view pharmaceuticals as a more ""at-risk"" segment when it comes to regulatory headwinds. Abbott faces limited exposure in this regard.We like Abbott Labs for long-term investors as high as 22X earnings considering the expectation for double-digit earnings growth in the years ahead. This means a target price of approximately $70 per share. It's true that shares remain overvalued today, even against this new valuation standard. However, this places shares in a realm where a market correction could realistically provide investors with a shot at acquiring one of the best healthcare conglomerates on the market.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4206140,78545,2018-09-13T16:47:43-04:00,"MITRA-FR results in late August missed primary endpoints and was incrementally negative for MitraClip’s prospects at expanding into the functional mitral valve regurgitation indication.However, numerous experts and analysts continue to believe that Abbott’s pivotal COAPT trial could still see success on 9/23 as the trial design differs in several key aspects.Elsewhere, the company continues to see strong organic revenue growth, and its CGM device, Libre, is outperforming expectations.","Abbott Laboratories (ABT) is a diversified healthcare conglomerate with revenue coming from Medical Devices, Nutrition, Diagnostics, and Established Pharma (generic pharmaceuticals). The stock has performed well as its segments have continued to perform at or above expectations, and the company's recent 2Q results supported this growth trajectory with solid 8% worldwide organic sales growth.Recent discussion around the stock has focused specifically on MitraClip, the cornerstone of the company's Structural Heart franchise. It's important to remember that the drug is a tiny portion of revenue (making up an estimated $300-500 million of revenue), but is also responsible for a decent sized chunk of the company's revenue growth going forward (growing in the double digits).Let's first talk about what MitraClip does. MitraClip is a medical device that is used to treat mitral valve regurgitation (NYSE:MR). MR is a condition in which blood flows backward into the left atrium from the left ventricle. The condition is a debilitating illness that can lead to numerous types of heart failure. There are an estimated 15 million global patients suffering from MR, with an estimated 4-10 million suffering from severe MR.There are two kinds of MR: degenerative mitral valve regurgitation (dMR) and functional mitral valve regurgitation (FMR). In dMR, the mitral valve is structurally damaged, causing the blood to flow backwards. In FMR, the left ventricle is enlarged, which causes the mitral valve to only partially close. FMR cases make up anywhere between 60-80% of all MR cases.MitraClip is approved for dMR globally, and FMR outside of the US (but not in the US). The device is delivered in a minimally invasive way through transcatheter - a useful alternative given that other treatment options generally consist of open heart surgery on bypass. The MitraClip attaches to the mitral valve and allows it close more completely, thereby reducing regurgitation.While the drug has grown solidly since its launch in 2013, growth would accelerate even further with the FMR indication in the US.In late August, MITRA-FR results were presented, which examined MitraClip treatment versus optimal medical therapy for FMR. Results missed its primary composite endpoint of all-cause death and unplanned rehospitalizations. The lead investigator for the trial provided the following summary:“MITRA-FR is a negative study. The safety of the device is confirmed, the efficacy and the reduction in MR is confirmed, but the presence of the MitraClip does not impact the prognosis in this severe MR population.”Industry experts and analysts were quick to translate the results to the upcoming COAPT trial, which will also examine MitraClip’s safety and efficacy in the treatment of FMR (results will be presented at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics 2018 conference on September 23rd). Recall that the COAPT trial will serve as the pivotal trial for FMR indication expansion in the US, and is therefore the key trial to watch.There is a mixed debate on what the COAPT trial might show. The argument against positive COAPT results is not just that MITRA-FR missed the primary outcome, but that some physicians were surprised at the overall lack of efficacy in MITRA-FR; the trial missed in the composite endpoint as well as in the individual components of all-cause death and unplanned rehospitalizations.Another concern among some investors is the potential impact that negative results from COAPT might have on FMR use outside of the US. As a reminder, MitraClip is approved for FMR outside of the US. Note that many analysts estimate FMR use outside of the US at greater than 50% of total MitraClip use. With a negative readout from MITRA-FR as well as from future readouts, physicians may become less inclined to recommend the treatment for patients, even though it has received approval.However, numerous physicians, industry experts, and analysts are not yet ready to throw in the towel on COAPT. There are several differences between MITRA-FR and COAPT that are worth noting:As a result, while the majority of investors see the MITRA-FR results as an incremental negative data point for COAPT and for MitraClip, it's perhaps not as negative as it might initially appear. Consensus now appears to anticipate a negative primary outcome, but some form of positive results (either in secondary endpoints or in one of the two primary endpoints). Investors will be closely watching the results, which are expected to be presented at 7:20AM EST on 9/23 at the TCT 2018 conference. A positive outcome would likely provide a boost to the stock.Another point worth noting is that the results will have implications for numerous other companies such as Medtronic (MDT), Edwards Lifesciences Corp (EW), Boston Scientific Corp (BSX), and LivaNova (LIVN), all of which are pursuing transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) as well. A positive outcome would more than double the TMVR market by opening it up to the larger FMR indication.As mentioned previously, Abbott continues to see strong growth across its numerous other segments. One of the most exciting prospects within the Diabetes segment is the Freestyle Libre. Since its approval late last year, Libre has been widely discussed by investors, and the device has outperformed expectations.Recall that the Libre was the first CGM to not require using a fingerstick to calibrate the device. This makes the device significantly easier to use, and its launch was expected by many to grow the market for CGMs significantly. Note that CGMs provide other benefits as well, including superior management of insulin levels. As I wrote in my Medtronic article reviewing their CGM device, Medtronic expects the CGM market to grow from $1 billion today to $2-3 billion within the next several years.So far, Libre has delivered the growth. The device remains on track to hit management’s guidance of 1 million patients globally by year end (with over 800K currently). In terms of sales, the device grew by over 20% in 2Q18, and consensus expectations are now for $130 million of contribution in 2018 (management is confident in achieving $100 million by 2018). In 2019, consensus expectations are for the device to grow to over $300 million in sales, with some brokers discussing the potential to generate up to $500 million in revenue.Libre has a few other growth drivers for the remainder of the year. First, in late July, Abbott received FDA approval for extending the sensor wear period from 10 days to 14 days, a material increase that should further improve patient convenience. Additionally, Abbott is seeking a pediatric indication and a smartphone app. These three enhancements, combined with the device’s near-term momentum and the longer-term expansion of the market, should drive sustained revenue growth towards the numbers mentioned above.Abbott is seeing solid growth across its business lines after strong 2Q results, with Libre continuing to outperform and drive revenue growth. One of the company's other key growth drivers, MitraClip, saw a potential near-term setback with results from the MITRA-FR trial missing its primary endpoint. However, there is a compelling argument still for potential FMR approval in the US, and investors will have a more complete picture when COAPT results are presented on 9/23.This post originally appeared on The Non-Consensus."
4214175,101378,2018-10-25T06:40:49-04:00,Abbott's sterling management proves itself again and again.Abbott is entering a powerful period of consolidating its hard-fought gains.Abbott is pursuing excellent capital allocation strategies.Risks to consider when buying Abbott.,"Abbott (ABT) is a marvelous company. It has managed its way through difficulties time and again. Most recently, it responded to slowing growth with major acquisitions in 2016. Now in 2018, it has integrated these acquisitions and is set to reap the benefits of its effective strategies.I currently count it as a stalwart in my long-term dividend growth stock portfolio. While I am absolutely comfortable holding my current position, I do not expect to buy more at its current valuation with a P/E (forward) in excess of 21. if it dropped down closer to $60 I will reevaluate. It is a worthy addition for those constructing a watch list for buy and hold growth stocks.I am aware of and understand those who are more sanguine about acquisitions of Abbott at a higher price. In particular, I note a recent WSJ article noting that Abbott merits a premium. Indeed in today's current choppy environment, I find Abbott's positive attributes as I discuss in this article to be particularly attractive.Miles White took the helm of Abbott in 1999. He struggled initially, however, he quickly recovered, installing sound practices that effectively attracted and retained the best available scientific talent. He engineered a flurry of acquisitions and deals in rapid succession.In the process, he undertook the transformative acquisition of Knoll Pharmaceuticals from BASF (OTCQX:BASFY), personally stepping in to assure the deal closed towards the end. This acquisition brought Humira into Abbott's pipeline.Making a long story short, in 2011, Abbott elected to set Humira and other pharmaceuticals adrift into a separate corporation to be named AbbVie (ABBV). Since the split, both AbbVie and Abbott have been highly successful as shown by the chart below:Early in 2016, Abbott's beefy acquisition bets had me asking if it could continue on its winning ways. I was vigilant when it made its St. Judes' acquisition so quickly after its Alere deal, particularly as the Alere deal was raising real questions.I asked, ""Abbott Laboratories: Should I Stay Or Should I Go?"" Seeking Alpha readers were most helpful in convincing me that I needed to stand pat.That was early 2016. Now as we begin to close out 2018, any such doubts appear foolish. Abbott's CEO White played the game to perfection. He both enhanced shareholder value by growing the company, and recognizing the value he was creating; he bought over a million shares in the open market on his own account during 2016.Throughout 2017, Abbott was dealing with challenges. It was dealing with serious issues in its nutrition business in China as it was trying to effectively address the introduction of wide-ranging regulations. CEO White tracks Abbott's approach to this industry-wide issue in each of his 2017 earnings CC's.CEO White's response to a Q4, 2017 earnings CC question on the pediatric nutrition issue in China is illustrative. The response is vintage White. When he sees a potential issue that may be a company-wide problem, he addresses it directly and effectively.Another area of management focus in 2017 was the launch of its new state of the art Alinity system of institutional analytics equipment. This equipment is an important component of Abbott's growth strategy for the next decade.This has been a long slog. Alinity comprises multiple components and requires approval in multiple jurisdictions. During 2017, the story had to do with broadening and perfecting the system and getting it approved.During its recent Q3 2018 earnings CC, Abbott provides an encouraging wrap on Alinity's progress as follows:Earlier, in response to a question during Abbott's Q2 2018 earnings CC, VP Leinenweber had followed up giving color to Alinity's US rollout as follows:Again, back to a Leinenweber Q3 2018 earnings call response on the scale of the Alinity system where it becomes apparent that a successful Alinity rollout is an achievement with loud resonance for Abbott's future:This spells out a scenario where Abbott will be introducing equipment with a new technology over the next several years which will provide it with a revenue moat for a decade or more.In order to close on its 1/4/17 St. Jude and its 10/3/17 Alere acquisitions, Abbott elected to boost its debt to ~$28 billion. As it put it in the lugubrious language of the risk factor section to its most recent 10-K:That was the downside that had my worry lines fully activated back in 2016. CEO White has applied an exceptionally effective salve during Abbott's recent earnings CCs. Abbott's Q3 2018 earnings CC was of a piece with such recent calls. Abbott is paying down debt, rapidly, as CEO White said during the call in response to a question:The really good news comes when shareholders consider the consequences of such financial rectitude. CEO White went on to discuss the salient uses for Abbott's cash generation. They include more debt paydown (yawn) but also more interesting topics like maintaining a dividend payout at a predetermined percent of EPS and investing in growth projects of which Abbott has plenty that promise high returns.White volunteered that Abbott had no external acquisitions in mind that were as attractive as investing in its own organic growth. However, one always needs to understand a speaker's framework of reference. On the subject of acquisitions, I always note that White's framework of reference includes the following Q3 2017 response to an analyst asking if any deals were in prospect at that time. He noted:I will save the very best news for last. If anyone out there dislikes share buybacks, Abbott is the company for you. On the subject of buybacks CEO White stated:Instead of pursuing dubious buyback strategies, CEO White plans to expand growth with initiatives such as increasing worldwide distribution and manufacturing capacity for Abbott's highly successful FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitoring system. The FDA recently approved an enhancement to this system that allows 14-day continuous monitoring.The ""Risk Factors"" section of Abbott's latest 10-K (pp. 9-14) covers a broad swathe characteristic of such filings. It presents a strong reminder of why capable management is so important for multinationals like Abbott with broad product lines.The risks are many and they are daunting. However, I skipped over most of them comfortable that Abbott maintains a clean reputation and productive culture. I will touch on issues that have disrupted Abbott in its recent past as emblematic of the sort of issue that I deem most likely to trip it up again.Abbott sells its products around the world. As Abbott proudly notes on its website:This very global presence which provides Abbott its strong revenue streams presents its own risks. Disruptions in individual markets where it does business can damage its revenue streams and its investments in such locations. An example is Venezuela. In Abbott's 2015 10-K (p. 44), Abbott characterized its Venezuelan operation as contributing 2% to its overall net sales.Venezuela's vicious inflation was a problem for Abbott for several years. Then in 2016, per its 2016 10-K (p.44), Abbott took a foreign currency exchange loss of $480 million. At that point, Abbott's Venezuelan assets had dwindled to 0.1% of Abbott's consolidated assets and further losses, if any, would no longer be material.Another example is China per the discussion of the infant formula issues discussed above.In addition to individual country risk, Abbott relies upon a functioning global economy in order to maximize its potential. Disruption in trade flows or in the global economy present potential risks to Abbott.When asked during its Q3 2018 earnings CC about challenges ahead, CEO White singled out potential currency headwinds that Abbott faces in common with other multinationals. It is clear that CEO White is confident about Abbott's business prospects for the foreseeable future but chary and uncertain of the impact of foreign exchange. In his words:We are currently experiencing turbulent times in the market. Abbott is a dividend aristocrat that not only has the enviable record of financial stewardship implicit in such status but is also a company with a vision. Abbott's four divisions are all growing per its Q3 2018 quarterly graphic below:Abbott is among the world's leaders in each segment. Abbott has kept each segment's products fresh and relevant. As an example, Abbott recently obtained approval for its Heartmate 3 system for patients with advanced heart failure who are not eligible for a heart transplant.Each segment produces products that are in demand today and are likely to be in demand in the future. It is forecasting mid-to-high single-digit sales growth for the balance of the year.I submit that investors will be hard put to find a more attractive combination of management, pipeline and existing products."
4213608,98446,2018-10-23T18:40:52-04:00,Abbott Laboratories showed impressive sales and earnings growth in the most recent quarter.The company also has a dividend streak that's nearing five decades long.I consider the stock to be a core holding and I would love to increase the size of our position.,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) currently makes up just under 2% of our retirement portfolio. I consider the company to be a core holding due to the importance that the products make in the lives of consumers as well as the company’s long track record of paying and increasing its dividends. Our goal is to have the dividends that our portfolio produces pay for our expenses in retirement. I want our core holdings to be among our largest positions as these are the companies that I have the most confidence will continue to pay and raise dividends well into our retirement years. With Abbott Laboratories just releasing earnings results, I think now is a good time to review the company.Abbott Laboratories a global leader in medical devices and equipment. The company has been around since the late 1880s and had $27.4 billion in sales last year. Abbott Laboratories is likely to see sales grow to more than $30 billion this year. Abbott Laboratories has four business segments, including Nutrition, Diagnostics, Medical Devices and Established Pharmaceuticals. Abbott Laboratories spun off AbbVie (ABBV) in 2013. The company completed its acquisition of St. Jude in January of 2017.Abbott Laboratories released third quarter earnings results on October 17. The company earned $0.75 per share, in line with analysts’ estimates, but growing 13.6% from the third quarter of 2017. The company saw revenue increase 12.2% to $7.66 billion, topping estimates by $10 million. This is the fourth consecutive quarter that Abbott Laboratories topped $7 billion in sales.Abbott Laboratories saw 7.8% organic growth, with all four divisions of the company contributing.Source: Abbott Laboratories Third Quarter Earnings PresentationThe Nutrition division saw organic growth increase more than 6%. Currency was a 2.1% headwind during the quarter. Worldwide sales were especially strong, improving 8.5% for Pediatric nutrition in constant currency. Double-digit growth in Asia and Latin America were the main drivers of success for this division. Adult nutrition saw international revenue increase 7.1% in constant currency due increased demand for its line of Ensure products.The Diagnostic division grew sales 42.6%, in large part because of Abbott Laboratories’ purchase of St. Jude. On an organic basis, sales increased 7.5%. This segment was led by cardiometabolic testing equipment that was acquired when Abbott Laboratories purchased St. Jude.The Medical Device segment grew by almost 10% as Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care all saw double-digit growth. Electrophysiology had high demand for Confirm, the world’s first and only smartphone-compatible cardiac monitor. Diabetes Care strength was driven by Abbott Laboratories’ FreeStyle Libre. This product, which doubled sales year over year, allows a patient to monitor their glucose levels without the need for finger sticks. The FDA gave approval for a 14-day sensor, making FreeStyle Libre the longest lasting wearable glucose sensor available.After spinning off AbbVie, the Established Pharmaceutical division specializes in generic drugs in international markets. This division saw sales decrease almost 1% due in large part to a 6.8% currency exchange headwind. In constant currency, Established Pharmaceuticals improved revenues by almost 6%. This division had double-digit sales growth in both Russia and China.Abbott Laboratories narrowed its guidance for the year, but kept its midpoint for earnings per share at $2.88. If achieved, this would represent 15% growth from 2017.Abbott Laboratories’ businesses have performed quite well recently. The stock has responded in kind, up nearly 19% year-to-date and higher by 76% since the start of 2017. While this is great for our capital appreciation, it’s the dividend that makes the stock a core holding in our portfolio. If you include the years prior to the AbbVie spinoff, Abbott Laboratories has increased its dividend for the past 46 years. The company has increased its dividend by 15% over the last five years. This dividend growth steak is one of the longest available to investors in the market. As someone who expects to live off dividends in retirement, this type of growth streak is very attractive.Abbott Laboratories will pay shareholders $1.12 in dividends in 2018. Based off of the midpoint for expected EPS, the company has a payout ratio of just 38.9% for the year. This is very much in line with Abbott Laboratories’ five-year average payout ratio of 40.2%. Even after more than four decades of dividend growth and recent sizeable increases, Abbott Laboratories still has a very low payout ratio. This gives the company plenty of room to maintain and continue raising its dividend, even in the event of a prolonged recession.Shares of Abbott Laboratories currently yield 1.66%. This yield is slightly below that of the S&P 500 ( 1.9%).If you’re not familiar with how I value stocks, I take the current price and compare it to fair values and price targets from a number of different sources to see how over or undervalued shares are currently. I then take the average of these values to determine a price target. For companies that have increased their dividend by more than a decade, which Abbott Laboratories has done, I'm willing to pay 5% above what I consider to be fair value. I'm willing to pay this premium because these are companies that have demonstrated the ability to increase their dividends over different economic cycles.Value Line is my first stop prior to purchasing a stock as I want their rating on the company’s safety and financial strength. Abbott Laboratories receives a 1 for safety and an A++ for financial strength, which are the top ratings that Value Line gives either category.Based off Friday’s closing price of $67.65 and a midpoint for earnings per share of $2.88, Abbott Laboratories’ stock has a price to earnings multiple of 23.5. This is a 19% premium to the stock’s five-year average P/E of 19. Abbott Laboratories’ current P/E is slightly above that of the S&P 500 ( 22.5) as a whole.After earnings results, CFRA raised its one-year price target by $4 to $78. This would give shares more than 15% of upside potential. CFRA’s fair value is $51.90, which would mean shares are trading at a 23.3% premium to their fair value. Morningstar now sees fair value at $60, a $3 increase after earnings results. Still, Abbott Laboratories trades 11.3% above what Morningstar estimates to be fair value. Value Engine has a one-year price target of $74.54, which, if reached, would result in a 10.2% gain. Value Engine’s fair value is $56, 17.2% below the most recent closing price.Average all my metrics out and I find shares of Abbott Laboratories to be 7.6% overvalued. For a company that has more than a decade of dividend growth, I'm willing to pay 5% above what I consider fair value. I find fair value to be right around $62.50. Following the rules of my investment system, I would have to wait until Abbott Laboratories fell to $66 prior to purchasing.Abbott Laboratories had another solid quarter. The company showed double-digit gains for both revenue and earnings per share. The majority of Abbott Laboratories’ businesses showed growth during the quarter, with sales for diagnostics increasing nearly 50%. On top of that, Abbott Laboratories has a dividend growth streak that only a few companies in the entire market can top. With a low payout ratio, the company has ample room to offer dividend increases well into the future. Shares have pulled back slightly in recent weeks and are nearly at my price target.

4189543,104543,2018-07-24T14:07:01-04:00,Predictable and diversified.Safe dividend and highly likely many years with future increases ahead.Wait for a pullback to 55 or lower.,"Much to my surprise Abbott Laboratories (ABT) has only been covered in seven articles so far this year (!). This is surprising to me, considering its good track record both in terms of total returns and dividend growth. ABT has outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin over the last 50 years, and have increased the dividend yearly for almost just as long.Compare this low coverage in ABT to Tesla (TSLA): Nearly 500 articles this year and some articles have close to 1000 comments! That’s fine, but I prefer to go for the reliable, predictable and boring stocks. ABT fits this perfectly.I’m already a shareholder in ABT for about two years. Unfortunately, it’s a small position and I will look to add more when the valuation is at least “fair” or “cheap”. I consider this a “forever” stock and intend to never sell: Don’t trade it, just buy and keep it. Let the magic of compounding do the work.Over the last five years ABT has invested and divested quite a lot: Abbvie (ABBV) was spun off in 2013, the eye care business was sold, ABT acquired St. Jude Medical for about 26 billion (2017) and bought Alere for 5.5 billion (2016). ABT's strategy is to focus more on medical products, while ABBV is research-based pharmaceuticals (and not so diversified as ABT) and thus more erratic/risky income. According to CEO Miles White the purpose of the split was to allow the market to value the two businesses as stand alone entities. In hindsight, ABBV has been the better investment since the spin-off , and it still seems a lot cheaper than ABT.The acquisition of St. Jude stretched the balance sheet a bit, but in hindsight the uncertainty that existed around this in 2016/2017 was a gift as the stock dropped over 20%. The acquisitions increased long-term debt from 15 billion in 2015 to almost 40 billion in 2016. I remember many in the comment sections saying that ABT might have to suspend dividend increases to focus on deleveraging. That has of course not happened, but it illustrates why ABT dropped over 20%. Deleveraging will be taken care of by future growth.ABT operates in over 150 countries, has 100 000 employees and has existed for 130 years.As mentioned above the acquisition of St. Jude and Alere transformed ABT a lot. It was a massive acquisition, St. Jude was acquired for 25 billion and ABT had a market cap of 50 billion at the time. St. Jude was a medical company and thus making ABT much more of a diagnostic/medical company.Currently ABT has the following divisions, ranked by sales (full year 2017):Among all divisions 58% of sales come from emerging markets, and 42% from developed markets.The majority of the sales is outside the US. For 2017 9.7 billion was in the US, and 17.7 was international. That means 65 percent of revenue is generated in international markets.In the table below you find sales ranked by country:Source: note 15 in the annual report 2017.In my opinion the future looks pretty bright for ABT. This is because of its competitive advantage (see below) and estimated growth in worldwide healthcare spending.In the future average age will increase, and (sadly) obesity and diabetes will most likely also increase. In the annual report for 2017 ABT estimates people with diabetes will grow 114% until 2030. They also estimate that over 400 million more people will have cardiovascular disease by 2025. ABT also estimates that “old” people over 65 years will double by 2030 on a global basis from today. And emerging markets currently allocates about half of GDP to healthcare relative to developed countries, and this is of course highly likely to increase over the next decades.A 2014 report by the World Economic Forum estimates that one-third of all global health expenditure will occur in emerging economies by 2022:The quarterly report published on the 18th of July saw sales increase almost 17%, and 8% of this was organic growth. Earnings, which came in at 0.73 per share, beat the company’s own guidance of 0.7-0.72. All divisions show solid growth.At the same time ABT increased projected full-year adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations to $2.80 - $2.90, indicating 14.0 percent growth at the midpoint.The main reason for being a shareholder in ABT is its moat and competitive advantage.Founded in 1888 and with over 120 years of operational history, ABT has acquired and established dominant market share positions in all its divisions. For example, the company’s 50 consumer nutrition brands are number one or number two in 25 countries (source: annual report 2017).ABT owns a lot of intellectual property, and they have continuous CAPEX of 1-1.5 billion dollars a year to keep competitors away (that is about 5% of revenue). And its industry has few players, and thus pricing pressure is reduced. There are four dominant companies as I see it: ABT, Stryker (SYK), Johnson&Johnson (JNJ) and Medtronic (MDT). The high amount of government regulation in these markets, the need for worldwide distribution networks, the high investment cost needed to develop new products and the long list of patents/trademarks, makes it very hard for new players to compete and thus limiting margin pressure. All these factors make ABT able to turn 12 cents of turnover into free cash flow for every dollar in sales, a pretty respectable figure.One thing worth mentioning is that ABT is not cyclical. It’s quite recession resistant, and the stock was among those that fell the least during 2008/09. In early September 2008 it was trading at 28, and the “washout” bottom was in April 2009 at 20, even though it was trading above 20 almost all the time. Revenue from 2008 to 2009 increased 3%, EPS went from 3.12 to 3.69 and free cash flow per share increased from 3.88 to 3.97. Even though the company has changed a bit since then, I think it’s safe to say this is one of the most recession resistant companies around.In addition Abbott’s revenues are widely diversified across divisions, and the company sells several thousand different products. This creates very stable and predictable cash flow, far more secure than most standalone drug makers such as ABBV (none of ABT’s drugs are patented). Overall, many of Abbott’s key risks get balanced out due to its diversification.Its moat is illustrated in its outperformance compared to the market: ABT has since 1992 had about twice the return compared to S&P 500, although the outpereformance has been weak since 2010. Yes, there will be periods over many years where it underperforms, but over the long term I believe this stock will continue outperforming.It is pretty clear this is a well managed company. CEO Miles White has, to my knowledge, been with ABT for at least 25 years. He is 63 years old, but I still reckon he will stay for some more years. During his tenure he has made more than 30 deals.ABT has increased the dividend yearly for 46 years, and I'm pretty confident this will continue for many decades to come. They have paid a dividend every quarter 378 times in a row.Current yearly dividend is 1.12 dollars, which equals a yield of 1.8%. That is about the average yield over the last ten years.However, lately dividend growth has been slow: from 0.88 in 2014 to the current yearly 1.12 equals 6.21% CAGR. That is lower than the 7.5% CAGR in the five years prior to the divestment of ABBV. However, we can expect the dividend to grow in the same speed as the earnings growth, which I believe will be in the high single digits. The dividend is very safe. Current guidance for 2018 of about 2.85 per share indicates payout ratio is at a very low 40%.The company raised its adjusted EPS guidance range for fiscal 2018 from $2.80–$2.90 to $2.85–$2.91 when it presented Q2 on the 18th of July. Further, the company increased its organic sales growth guidance for fiscal 2018 to 6.5%–7.5%.With the current price of ABT at 63, this means forward PE is 22. That is of course not by any means a very stretched valuation, but keep in mind that ABT had on average a multiple of about 17-18 during the last 15 years (according to my own calculations). That, of course, includes ABBV, which is valued less at current prices. In my opinion ABT deserves a higher valuation than ABBV because of more diversification and less risky income.Looking back, ABT quite frequently drops at least 10% from a previous high. The chart below shows the draw down from nearest peak (my own calculation using Amibroker):As recently as at the end of 2016 ABT was trading under 40 dollars. And as the graph indicates, there are almost yearly drops of 10% or more. Be patient and a nice opportunity to add or start a position will surely come.There are only two recommendations for ABT (as it must be extremely overvalued to justify a sell): buy or hold. Most of the time it’s a hold, and once in a while it’s a buy. You just need to be patient and wait for the pullback.I would love to add to my position, but on the same time I would like to have it a bit cheaper. As it is now, I have chosen to invest my capital in other foreign stocks that offer better value.Using the average PE multiple of 18, an entry around 55 or lower seems reasonable. That is 13% below today’s price.To get paid for waiting you can issue puts. For example, currently you receive 85 cents per share for issuing puts at 55 dollars expiring in January 2019. That equals 85 dollar for 100 shares (one contract is 100 shares). That of course means you are obliged to pay 55 USD per share if ABT trades lower in January 2019, even if ABT is trading much lower. But that is the risk you take. And you can buy back and liquidate the position whenever you want."
4188206,50452,2018-07-18T20:38:52-04:00,"Abbott Labs reported Q2 earnings before the bell on July 18th that included a top and bottom line beat, and raised full year guidance.
        The quarter is a sign that growth initiatives are working in all four segments, and the acquisitions are pulling weight.
        The valuation isn't much of a sale on shares by any means, but should be considered fair for the growth you are receiving.
        Abbott Labs is on my ""don't get too cute"" list. If shares slip some, they can work out very nicely for investors with a long term mindset.","Abbott Laboratories (ABT) came out strong when it released its fiscal 2018 Q2 earnings on Wednesday morning. The company topped Wall Street estimates for revenues and earnings, while raising full year guidance in the process. The news has pushed the stock to 52 week highs. While I typically shy away from stocks breaking into new highs, the growth curve of Abbott Labs warrants a conversation about the stock. Find out if shares are worth buying here as we recap the quarter, and look ahead to determine whether shares are a value today.source: Abbott LaboratoriesSecond quarter earnings were released Wednesday morning, and the results were very strong. The company generated $7.767B in revenues, which is an increase of 17% year over year. Individually, each of Abbott's four main business segments contributed to the effort.Nutrition was up 7.3% from last year. Diagnostics was up a whopping 47.2%. Established Pharma was up 10.5%, and Medical Devices are up 11.3% over last year. In all, the revenues were $60M higher than analyst estimates while earnings were $0.02 per share over estimates.The strong leap is partially attributed to the additions of what were formerly Alere (diagnostics) and St. Jude Medical (medical devices). The quarter was so strong, that management upped full year guidance to a range of $2.85 - $2.91 adjusted EPS.The market liked what it saw, and responded by pushing shares to new 52 week highs during the trading session.source: YchartsWhile it may be tempting to discount the quarter some by attributing the ""pop"" in the numbers to the acquisitions, the organic sales picture is very strong as well.source: Abbott LaboratoriesOrganic revenue altogether is up 8% over last year. This high single digit revenue growth could be an indicator of things to come as this $110B company still has room to grow. The company continues to innovate with technological advances in high dollar areas of need within healthcare.source: Abbott LaboratoriesJust in this quarter, Abbott Labs received FDA approval on new iterations of core products such as its ""MitraClip"" heart valve repair device, and ""XIENCE Sierra"" coronary stent system. Its ""Afinion 2 Analyzer"" and ""FreeStyle Libre"" devices offer more effective, and less invasive means of managing diabetes (a disease that costs more than $825B worldwide per year). These are the latest developments in areas of growth among the healthcare industry that Abbott has positioned itself in for the long term.source: Abbott LaboratoriesThe other key to this growth is bringing this innovation not only to core markets, but across the world. Abbott Labs generates approximately 42% of its sales in emerging markets.source: Abbott LaboratoriesThese emerging markets can fuel growth over the long term for Abbott Labs. Countries with huge population demographics such as China and India only have fractional sales compared to the US despite making up 20% of the entire global population. Both countries have developing middle classes that will have the means to access healthcare treatment.The ultimate question, is what to do now? Shares are at new highs, which can make investors a bit uneasy about buying in when the stock is hot. We need to peel back some of the layers.With the company now forecasting earnings as high as $2.91 per share, the stock is trading at about 22.25X full year earnings. While we are starting to approach the mid 20 multiple range (which I consider growth stock territory, and is a level I don't typically like buying into), you have to evaluate the company as a post-acquisition entity. This year's earnings will be 15% higher than 2017.To put this another way, the company has increased its growth rate so we need to determine if the growth justifies a higher valuation. Let's look at cash flows.source: YchartsBecause the company is growing (thus generating more cash flows), the yield on cash flow is actually near its high point over the past three years. I am encouraged by this because the company is growing very well and the share price isn't as bad as ""new 52 weeks highs"" might sound. That isn't to say that shares of Abbott are ""cheap"" because they aren't. I typically look for cash flow yields in the high single digits in order to label them a ""bargain"". Meanwhile, an earnings multiple of 22X is very reasonable for a stock with mid-teen earnings growth - but again, no drastic undervaluation present.I am bullish on the continued growth prospects of Abbott Labs. This quarter is a latest sign that the ""process is working"". The company has strategically positioned itself in growth niches, and the acquisitions are effectively boosting sales. This is all the more key for a long term investment thesis because the growth is needed to help the company deleverage after its two major acquisitions over the years (debt/EBITDA of 4X).The valuation isn't a bargain, but it shouldn't send you running away scared either. It would be fair to consider Abbott Labs pretty close to fully valued - even after the run up post earnings (maybe a smidgen over-valued). It's impossible to predict short term fluctuations, but investors should enjoy steady long term growth that benefits investors over the years to come.I wouldn't get ""too cute"" with the price of Abbott shares. The next time the market hiccups, a 5-7% drop in price would be a gift to long term investors. When it comes to blue chips, the time you spend holding shares can be almost as important as the price you pay."
4185043,100856,2018-07-02T08:55:52-04:00,"Five years ago, Abbvie was spun-off from Abbott Labs.At the time, sentiment about Abbvie was bearish, while Abbott Labs was viewed more favorably.Now, the sentiment has reversed.","At the start of 2013, Abbott Laboratories (ABT) spun off its branded pharmaceutical business, which has traded since then as Abbvie Inc. (ABBV). Prior to the split, Abbott Laboratories was a massively diversified healthcare firm with operations in diagnostics, medical devices, nutrition and pharmaceuticals. It was also a Dividend Aristocrat, having paid shareholders consecutively rising dividends since 1973 - at that point, a 40-year record.That Dividend Aristocrat status was also conferred on Abbvie, in spite of the fact that it has only operated as a stand-alone business since 2013, and therefore has not consecutively raised its dividends for the 25-year period usually required of a firm to achieve Dividend Aristocrat status. That said, Abbvie has been able to continue raising its dividends since the spin-off, while Abbott Labs has also maintained its streak, now having raised its dividend for 45 years straight.At the time, there was a great deal of bearishness about Abbvie, as more than 50% of its revenue was dependent upon Humira, a drug used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. The bearishness stemmed from the fact that Humira was facing a patent cliff in 2016, and there seemed to be little on the horizon to make up for the fall in profits that would occur afterwards. In consequence, holding Abbott Labs and divesting Abbvie seemed the logical thing to do.Now, five years after the spin-off, Abbvie looks like the keeper stock of the two. Non-Humira sales are anticipated to grow from approximately $9.6 billion in 2017 to in excess of $16 billion in 2020, and then to grow to over $35 billion in 2025. Abbvie took seriously the perilous position their over-reliance on Humira and have been investing in R&D consistently, spending around $4-5 billion annually in 2015, 2016 and 2017.In consequence, Abbvie expect to launch approximately 20 new products by 2020, which will enable them to continue diversifying away from Humira - which still mints Abbvie quite a lot of money, making $4.7 billion in net revenue in Q1 2018. Thus, its current valuation looks extremely attractive given its forecasted growth. Currently, Abbvie trades in the low-$90 range with a price-to-earnings ratio of 14.89, a forward P/E ratio of 10.37, and offers a dividend yield of 4.14% with a payout ratio of 65.90%. To be blunt, those who did divest Abbvie back in 2013 should be kicking themselves now, but it looks attractive at present to start a position in.As for Abbott Labs, at present it does not look as attractive an investment, given that it trades in the low-$60 range with a price-to-earnings ratio of 57.76, a forward P/E ratio of 18.95, and offers a dividend yield of 1.84% with a payout ratio of 39.2%. The P/E ratio is considerably higher than the five-year average P/E of 20.39 and the dividend yield is considerably lower than the five-year average yield of 2.10%. (By contrast, Abbvie's current P/E is considerably lower than its five-year average P/E of 20.05 and its current dividend yield is higher than its five-year average yield of 3.16%).Does this mean that Abbott Labs should be sold? Absolutely not. The company remains a diversified healthcare giant, with a great range of branded consumer products that cover cardiovascular treatments, diabetes, diagnostics, medicines, neuromodulation and nutrition. Brands such as EAS Sports Nutrition, Ensure, Freestyle, Glucerna, Pediasure and Similac ensure that Abbott Labs will remain a profitable company that can sustain its impressive dividend record going forward.Furthermore, like Abbvie, Abbott Labs have been diligently investing in R&D, having spent $1.4 billion in 2015 and 2016, and $2.2 billion in 2017. They are ensuring that their pipeline will be robust to continue delivering value for shareholders in the years ahead.To conclude, neither Abbott Labs nor Abbvie are a sell, nor have they ever been. At present, I believe that Abbvie is a buy, and Abbott Labs is a hold, and investors will do well out of both companies in the very long-run.DISCLAIMER: The author is not a financial professional and accepts no responsibility for any investment decisions a reader makes.

4188697,63883,2018-07-20T10:46:38-04:00,"Abbott Laboratories reported second-quarter financial results on July 18, 2018.Its quarterly performance was nothing short of spectacular. Abbott delivered 17% growth in both revenue and adjusted earnings per share.Unsurprisingly, the company's stock surged following the announcement, sending it to new 52-week highs.In this article, we investigate whether Abbott Laboratories is worth buying by providing a detailed analysis of its second-quarter financial performance.","Abbott Laboratories (ABT) is one of the most recession-resistant companies around. Remarkably, the company managed to grow its dividend each year of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.Abbott Laboratories is also very shareholder-friendly. In fact, the company has increased its dividend for 46 consecutive years, which makes it a member of the exclusive Dividend Aristocrats Index. You can see the full list of all 50+ Dividend Aristocrats here.In many cases, the old and established businesses that populate the Dividend Aristocrats list are perceived as boring, slow-growth investment opportunities. Abbott Laboratories is the perfect example of how this is not always the case.In fact, Abbott's recent financial performance has been more characteristic of a growth stock (rather than a stodgy dividend growth stalwart). In the company's recent second-quarter earnings release, the company delivered 17% growth in both revenue and earnings per share.In this article, we analyze Abbott Laboratories in the context of its second-quarter earnings release to determine whether the company is a buy today.Abbott Laboratories is the largest medical appliances and equipment manufacturers in the world. Its only competitors of similar or greater size are fellow Dividend Aristocrats Medtronic (MDT) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).Abbott Laboratories' business is divided into four segments for reporting purposes:As you can see, the Medical Devices segment is Abbott's largest.Moving on, the next section of this article provides a detailed summary of the company's second-quarter financial performance.Abbott Laboratories' second-quarter earnings release delivered excellent growth on both the top and bottom lines. Here are what the numbers look like.Abbott Laboratories generated second-quarter worldwide sales of $7.8 billion, which expanded by 17.0% on a reported basis and 8.0% on an organic basis. The stark contrast between reported and organic sales growth is the result of the (inorganic) acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere, which both meaningfully impacted the company's top line. Still, 8% organic growth across Abbott's business is very strong performance, particularly for a company of this size.Organic sales growth by operations segment was as follows:On a reported basis, sales growth by business unit is very stratified due to the aforementioned acquisitions. For example, the Diagnostic segment saw 47.2% reported sales growth because of the Alere acquisition.Moving down the income statement, Abbott generated adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $1,295 million, which represents 18.1% growth over the $1,096 million generated in the prior year's period. On a per-share basis, Abbott's adjusted earnings-per-share of $0.73 increased by 17.7% over last year's $0.62, benefitting from strong sales growth and modest margin expansion yet partially offset by an increase in the number of shares outstanding.All said it was a very strong quarter from Abbott Laboratories. Here's what the company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Miles D. White, had to say about Abbott's performance in the quarter:As the above quote implies, Abbott Laboratories also increased its 2018 financial guidance with the release of its second-quarter performance figures.More specifically, the company now expects to generate adjusted diluted earnings-per-share between $2.85 and $2.91 in fiscal 2018. For context, the midpoint of this guidance band ($2.88) represents 15.2% growth over the $2.50 in adjusted earnings-per-share generated in the prior year's period.To summarize, it was clearly a strong quarter of financial performance from Abbott Laboratories. Indeed, shares rose by around 3% following the earnings release, pushing Abbott's stock price to a new 52-week high. In the next section of this article, we explore whether or not the company is still an attractive investment at its new, higher prices.Like any equity security, Abbott Laboratories' future returns will come from a combination of dividend payments, earnings per share growth, and valuation changes. We explore each of these components step-by-step to arrive at a conservative conclusion for the firm's future returns.The first component - and the most easily quantifiable - that we will explore is Abbott's dividend payments. Abbott Laboratories currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share which yields 1.8% on the company's current ~$64 stock price.For context, Abbott Laboratories' dividend yield is essentially equal to the average dividend yield in the S&P 500 Index. While the company's current yield does not stand out, income investors should benefit over time as the company continues its multi-decade streak of consecutive dividend increases.Moving on, Abbott Laboratories should also continue to grow its earnings at satisfactory rates moving forward. We can estimate the company's propensity to grow its earnings by considering its historical growth rate, which is displayed in the following image.Source: Value LineAs you can see in the chart above, Abbott Laboratories experienced a significant earnings drawdown in 2013. This was due to the spin-off of its biopharmaceutical unit, which is now publicly-traded as AbbVie (ABBV). Since the spinoff, Abbott has compounded its earnings at around 7% per year. We believe that a similar ~6.5% annualized growth rate is sustainable for this high-quality Dividend Aristocrat moving forward.The last component of Abbott's total return profile is its potential for valuation expansion or contraction. We can estimate this impact by comparing the firm's current price-to-earnings ratio against its long-term historical average. Using the midpoint of Abbott Laboratories' new 2018 financial guidance ($2.88 of earnings-per-share), the company is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 22.1.The following diagram compares the company's current valuation to its long-term historical average.Source: Value LineAs you can see in the image above, Abbott Laboratories is currently trading at a noticeable premium to its long-term average valuation multiple. Accordingly, we are forecasting a low-single-digit (~3%) headwind to the company's returns as its valuation reverts to a level that makes more sense.Altogether, this gives the company a rather lackluster total return profile composed of:With all this in mind, we expect Abbott Laboratories to deliver total returns in the mid-single digits moving forward.Abbott Laboratories has many of the characteristics of a high-quality dividend stock. The company has increased its dividend payment for more than four consecutive decades and its recent financial performance has been nothing short of spectacular.With that said, Abbott's current valuation should introduce a meaningful headwind to its total returns moving forward. This results in a mid-single digit total return estimate that is weak in comparison to other opportunities in our investment universe.Because of this, Abbott fails to earn a buy recommendation from Sure Dividend at its current price. Still, investors who already own shares will likely benefit from continuing to hold their position, particularly if shares are carried at a cost basis far below their current price in taxable investment accounts."
4159417,50452,2018-03-28T02:08:48-04:00,"A quick glance at Abbott Labs would reveal a short streak of dividend raises, as well as mediocre dividend growth over the past several years. This is extremely misleading.
        Abbott's spin off of AbbVie, and recent moves to acquire St. Jude's Medical and Alere have skewed the metrics. In reality, Abbott is very well positioned moving forward.
        Abbott Labs is seeing strong growth with excellent market positioning throughout various flourishing industries.
        This will continue to push cash flows higher, giving Abbott Labs the ability to deleverage and eventually reward shareholders with strong dividend increases.
        Shares are no bargain, but are not grossly overvalued either. Long term investors can still make out well in the long run by paying fair value for excellent companies.","Abbott Laboratories (ABT) currently won't show on very many dividend stock screens. Its current dividend streak is only five years, and dividend growth over the past several years has been lackluster. Don't be misled dividend growth investors. Abbott Labs is a fantastic company that has been through a lot of restructuring over the past few years. First by spinning off AbbVie Inc. (ABBV), followed by acquisitions and divestitures. The current Abbott Labs is well positioned in lucrative markets, and starting to see results. Abbott Labs has the makings of a strong investment choice for long term investors.When you take a first glance, the data doesn't jump out at you. A simple check on Abbott's dividend payments in recent years will reveal that its dividend streak is only at five years. This is dwarfed by rival peers in the healthcare industry such as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (BDX). Over the past three years, the dividend has only risen from $0.96 in 2015, to $1.06 this past year.However, there is a lot more to this story. Abbott Labs has a rich history as a healthcare company that includes 130 years of business, and a global presence that now spans more than 150 countries. Despite its current five year streak, Abbott has continuously paid a quarterly dividend for more than 90 years. The last several years at Abbott Labs has seen quite a restructuring take place. Some of the major changes include:With so much change over the past several years, this is clearly not the Abbott Laboratories of decades past. The ""new look"" company is one that appears positioned in strategic markets and is poised to see growth in the coming years.The healthcare industry is poised to remain a strong growth area. Healthcare currently makes up approximately 10% of global GDP, and this figure will only rise as the global population ages in the decades to come.source: Abbott LaboratoriesOne aspect of Abbott Labs that hasn't gone away, is the drive for continual innovation. Abbott Labs launched more than 20 new products this past year alone.source: Abbott LaboratoriesFor example, Abbott's ""Freestyle Libre"" is a smart glucose monitoring system for the more than 425 million people living with diabetes. This figure is expected to rise another 48% by the year 2045 as the obesity epidemic continues to worsen. Abbott's ""Confirm RX"" insertable cardiac monitor is another example of bringing key medical device technology to the next generation. It is the first smartphone compatible ICM (this is a benefit of the St. Jude acquisition). This also happens to target another growth market. The heart monitoring device market is poised to grow at a steady rate near 6.6% CAGR in the coming years. These two innovative products are examples among others, of Abbott's strategy to align itself in key markets as strong competitors.source: Abbott LaboratoriesAs I mentioned earlier in the article, there has been a lot of change at Abbott Labs. With the acquisitions now in the rear view mirror, Abbott Labs must work to restrengthen its balance sheet (took on a lot of debt during these acquisitions). On the plus side, the acquisitions are already having a positive effect on the business, as Abbott ended the year with a very strong quarter.After the acquisitions, Abbott Labs now carries long term debts totaling approximately $28B. The uptick from last year was primarily due to Abbott taking on St. Jude's debt as part of the acquisition.source Abbott LaboratoriesWhile the acquisitions have loaded Abbott Labs with more leverage than it has traditionally operated with, Abbott is situated pretty well to dig themselves out. I would expect another modest dividend raise this year (most recent raise was 5.7%), as the near term appears to be the most difficult for Abbott. Abbott stated in its earnings call that debt payments will continue throughout 2018. Abbott has little over $4B in notes due in 2019. Abbott's 2017 free cash flow of $4.4B minus dividend payments of $1.8B leave approximately $2.6B left over for debts if we assume cash flows are around the same level in 2018 (they should be higher with sales growth projected at 6%-7%). By paying towards debts this year, Abbott will be able to manage the rest of it as it comes due. After 2019, the road gets easier with remaining debts being very spread out at reasonable amounts.Once this near term debt hurdle is cleared, I see an uptick in dividend growth coming. By then, cash flows should be materially higher considering management's organic revenue growth forecast being in the mid to high single digits. As it is, the dividend currently consumes less than half of free cash flows. Management appears pretty confident about the upcoming growth that the company is poised for. It pegged 2018 earnings guidance at between $2.80 - $2.90 per share, good for 14% year over year growth. Analysts consider this growth realistic, as average estimates have Abbott's earnings growth rate set at just under 12% per annum over the next five years.This leads into our final piece of the puzzle, valuation. As always, a great company can be a terrible investment if the valuation doesn't make sense. With earnings forecasted at $2.90 for this year, shares are currently trading at just under 21X earnings. With the S&P 500 trading at roughly 19X 2018 earnings, Abbott Labs is currently trading at a slight premium to the market. I am OK with this because of the high quality of Abbott's business, as well as the growth prospects we have reviewed thus far.If we look at the yield on free cash flows, we see something interesting.source: YChartsDespite the P/E ratio being a touch high, we are near a three year high on free cash flow yield. Abbott has boosted its value or ""bang for your buck"" on a cash flow basis. I always reinforce my evaluation with cash flows because cash is truly the ""blood"" of a business. Strong cash flows bode well for both investor returns (dividends/buybacks), and potential investments back into the company to spur growth. Even though this figure is the highest it has been in a while, I wouldn't say that shares are ""cheap"". The stock is still priced at a premium to the market, and cash flow yields need to hit the high single digits before I would consider shares to be in a heavily undervalued state. Fair value is probably the most appropriate term that comes to mind when looking at Abbott Labs stock right now.That doesn't have to be a bad thing though. Sometimes it pays handsomely to simply buy a wonderful company at a fair price and hold onto it. If we assume that Abbott Labs succeeds in reaching earnings growth of 12% over the next five years (analyst estimation) and add on the dividend, investors could be looking at total returns averaging 13-14% per annum. Now there needs to be a margin of safety instilled, but you can certainly make money on Abbott at current levels over the long term.It is important to keep an eye on the horizon when you are evaluating potential investments. You also can't judge a book by its cover (or what a stock screener tells you). This is certainly the case with Abbott Labs. When you take a deeper look into the company, you will see a restructured company that is poised to grow in the coming years. By taking strategic positions within lucrative niches (in an always growing healthcare industry) and driving forward with innovative products, Abbott is setting itself up for success over the long term. It ended the year on a strong note, and dividend growth investors should be rewarded once it clears its 2019 debt bottleneck. This stock is one to buy, hold, and reap the rewards of patience."
4157089,103021,2018-03-19T06:00:00-04:00,"Recent expansion attempts and regulatory pressure in emerging markets have offset recent success in China and India, leading to poor segment performance.Negative growth rates in Q1, Q2 and Q3 were recovered by a strong final quarter, but this certainly doesn't mitigate the concerns over performance in a now-crowded infant formula market.Higher than median multiples indicate overvaluation.","Please take note this is only one aspect in weighing the attractiveness or non-attractiveness of the company mentioned as an investment and should not be used independently of other factors. This article examines one segment of the company's business, and many other factors are not addressed. This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.Figure 1: Abbott - A Promise for Life, Source - VimeoDespite most products following long-term healthcare trends in both developed and emerging markets, Abbott Laboratories' (NYSE: ABT) Nutritional segment seems to be weakening to the point of revenue stagnation. Their end of fiscal year report proved that despite revenue increasing by 33.1%, this only translated to nutritional segment growth of 0.4%. Further, when benchmarked against the industry, its higher than average multiples and a lower than average dividend yield change my opinion on the company, despite current investor sentiment and strong 2018 expectations.Abbott's Nutritional segment can be categorized into Adult and Pediatrics products. They brand themselves as a company providing science-based nutrition needs of people with chronic illnesses. For example, products such as Glucerna, Jevity, Juven, Nepro, Oxepa, and ProSure have provided support for patients suffering kidney disease through to those with cancer-induced weight loss. Most aspects of their product line, including Similac infant formula, have been extremely successful. Despite this, recent expansion attempts and regulatory pressure in emerging markets have offset recent success in China and India, leading to poor performance. Sector fragmentation may continue to force the company out of its world-leading position, but without a detailed revenue breakdown in their nutritional segment, I can only draw negative opinions from the segment-specific figures quoted.Figure 2: Abbott Laboratories Fourth Quarter 2017 and Full-Year Nutritional Segment Results.Negative growth rates in Q1, Q2, and Q3 were recovered by a strong final quarter, but this certainly doesn't mitigate the concerns over performance in a now-crowded infant formula market. Quarter 1 is a great example of this. International sales declined 12.2% due to increased competition in the Chinese infant formula market. Soon after, the new addition to Abbott's infant formula portfolio provided above-market growth. Nevertheless, segment growth was still poor. Most of these figures are unsurprising, but they are worth recalling as Abbott seems to currently have an overly bullish investor sentiment that I think is unjustified. Why has nobody highlighted segment performance? Figure 3: Abbott Laboratories Fourth-Quarter 2017 and Full-Year Results.2017 proved to be a strong year for Abbott, at least in Diagnostics, Established Pharmaceuticals, and Medical Devices. Upon reading these figures, I was disappointed to see that despite total reported sales growth of 31.3%, this translated to 0.4% growth in its nutrition segment. Historically, strong performance in products such as Ensure could be seen clearly in topline growth. This simply isn't the case anymore. The active choice to include regular exercise and eat a well-balanced nutritional diet has recently risen in popularity, resulting in a global increase in the number of people leading healthy lifestyles. Being a world leader in the nutritional segment means that macro trends such as the above are sure to influence Abbott's revenue. Moreover, one would expect interdependency between the two given their ""products for active people on the go and nutritious snacks for healthy-living adults"" and ""balanced nutritional supplement that supports healthy growth and development"" - Abbott Annual Report 2016 page 31.A natural question to ask is to what extent is this relationship playing a role in segment growth and future behavior? It is hard to place a definitive figure on how dependent segment revenue is on macro trends - this is due to a lack of product-specific revenue quotation in financial reports. For forecasting purposes, suppose that Abbott's adult nutritional product line is restricted to Ensure and ""Performance Nutrition,"" namelyFigure 4: Abbott Laboratories Historical US Nutrition Revenue and US Healthclub revenue, Source - SEC, IBISWorldUsing US Healthclub historical and future revenues quoted by IBISWorld as a benchmark provides trustworthy foundations for conclusions, not to mention that the company flaunts a rank-one market position in the United States. Poor performance in its adult product line has generated additional dependencies on pediatric products moving forward. This is less than ideal as persistent challenges in the Chinese markets have exposed weaknesses on a once strong pipeline, with future recuperation now uncertain. Fixing a mean growth rate for the pediatric line and forecasting its adult line using the benchmark results in a 5.13% revenue growth over the next four years. Although the above forecasting is exclusive to the US market, this is a global trend and hence the figures provide refreshing insight into future pipeline performance.Challenging the assertion of whether this relationship is meaningful is the research paper written by Stefano Dellavigna and Ulrike Malmendier at University California Berkeley - Paying Not to Go to the Gym. People take out memberships at health clubs and although paying do not attend. With a positive trend in the number of people wanting to lead a healthy lifestyle, regardless of whether they go to the gym, health club revenues will continue to soar. Ultimately, this will have a direct consequence on the company's nutritional product revenue as people who don't go to the gym are less likely to buy premium products.Figure 5: Author's Comparable Company Analysis, Source: Financial TimesIn conjunction with the trend analysis above, I conducted benchmarking for Abbott against the sector. A common market theme is that Abbott is a safe dividend company with future growth potential. Higher than mean multiples, unfortunately, don't form the same opinions. Suppose we calculated implied share price using 2018E EPS stated in their fourth quarter 2017 results. An implied share price of $43.4 – $44.6 indicates that ABT is trading at a 27% premium.Blaming low net income in 2017 for the valuation, observe share price implied by EV/EBITDA and return on equity (ROE). EV/EBITDA returns an implied share price range of $27.8-$28.9. This isn't a fair valuation. Industry ROE is between 8.6% and 11.4% whereas Abbott's is 1.4%. Additionally, worth mentioning is the lack of growth in the nutritional segment. There's a slight positive trend overall, but my point of nutritional revenue stagnation is easily verified. A key theme that this model creates is that perhaps there are more attractive companies right now in the sector.Despite my negative view displayed on Abbott, its heavily diversified product line has allowed for large revenue growth, double-digit projections for FY2018, and market insulation from sector-specific behavior. The company reports a full-year 2018 EPS guideline of $2.80 to $2.90, with the midpoint reflecting a 14% growth.Generic pressure sector pressure and macro trends will continue to affect the company but my concern still lies in their nutrition business. Sector benchmarking points toward overvaluation, from a multiples stance, but this isn't the sole factor one should consider when choosing an investment. A global business with market leading products need not be cheap when you have revenue security."
4188837,21151,2018-07-20T16:28:29-04:00,"ABT benefits from several growth vectors for the upcoming decade.This company is a Dividend Aristocrat and will soon become a Dividend King.However, AbbVie is still the better part.","After spinning off its researched-based activities into AbbVie (ABBV) a few years ago, Abbott Laboratories (ABT) has concentrated its focus on various medical devices, nutritional products, and branded generic medicine distributions. Strong from major acquisitions in 2014 and 2017 (Notably St. Jude Medical which opens the door wider to the cardiac devices business), ABT shows several growth vectors for the future. ABT is also a strong dividend paying stocks with over 46 consecutive years with a dividend raise. ABT definitely shows a strong profile. After posting strong organic sales in all its divisions, it's time to decide if ABT should be in your portfolio or on your watchlist. Ignoring this stock would be a mistake.Abbott Laboratories is a healthcare company that manufactures medical devices, blood glucose monitoring kits, nutritional healthcare products, diagnostic products, and equipment, and branded generic drugs. ABT shows over 130 years of existence, more than 99,000 employees and operates in over 150 countries. Abbott's reputation is well established. The company develops products in four different segments: Diagnostics, Nutrition, Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals.Source: ABT websiteThe company counts 35% of its sales from the U.S., 25% coming from international developed markets and 40% of sales coming from emerging markets. This offers investors a great diversification, while ABT will always find a growth vector across one of its geographic segments. According to ABT Investors presentation ( January 2018), the company is already #1 in Columbia, Peru, Chile, #2 in India, and #5 in Russia for established pharmaceuticals products.On July 15th, ABT reported the following quarter:Non-GAAP EPS of $0.73, up by +17.7%, beat estimates by $0.03.Revenue of $7.77B, up by +17.0%, beat estimates by $60M.Dividend of $0.28/share, no increase.What the CEO said,Source: ABT Q2 presentationSource: YchartsABT has its eyes on emerging markets with the constructions of facilities in India and China for its established pharmaceuticals division. This will help the company to streamline its distribution network of generic drugs. As Abbott is already well-established in many emerging markets, it should be able to surf on this tailwind going further.Second, Abbott's new FreeStyle Libre blood glucose monitor should establish new standards in the diabetes care landscape. In their most recent quarter, Diabetes care sales increased by 39.8% (33.6% organic), led by rapid market uptake of this new device.Third, ABT has gained lots of experience in acquiring and integrating companies over the years. In early 2017, the company acquired St. Jude Medical for $25B. When ABT adds another company to its portfolio, it is not only generating synergy, but it also improves its diversification. After St. Jude acquisition, ABT became a major player in the cardiovascular device playground. As population ages, I'd say it's a very good place to become a leader!ABT has posted 46 consecutive years of dividend increase. Don't get fooled by the graph below showing a ""dividend cut"" in 2013. This is related to the ABBV spin-off.Source: YChartsWhile the spin-off unlocked lots of value for investors, it left ABT as a low yielding stock. If you compare ABBV recent success and dividend yield (about 4%), you may want to switch money to Abbott's better half.Source: YChartsHere's a good example of why I look at both payout and cash payout ratios. While new accounting rules hurt EPS, ABT shows it has more than enough cash flow to continue its way to become a Dividend King (50+ year with dividend increase) going forward. Shareholders can expect mid-single digit dividend growth going forward.First, any pharma is not shielded against product quality issues leading to recalls. What happened back in 2013 still has an impact on China's sales today. Medical devices are subject to recalls.The second possible downside resides within ABT's competitors. There aren't many players in their business segments, and each company is investing massively to bring the next innovation in their niche on the market. Once in a while, one company brings a game changer in the market, leaving its competitors aside. ABT is going against other big players like Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) for some of its devices. There are lots of money allocated to R&D, and nothing is won for Abbott.ABT shares have enjoyed a strong uptrend in the past couple of years. While the company shows many growth vectors, it seems that we are a bit late for the party as the PE ratio is already around 22.Source: YChartsIn order to have a better idea of what would be the perfect entry point for ABT, I ran a dividend discount model calculation. I've used a rather generous 6% dividend growth rate with a discount rate of 9% as the company is well diversified and shows limited risks. Unfortunately, the DDM calculations can't show any value at the current price.Please read the Dividend Discount Model limitations to fully understand my calculations.I don't think the stock will plunge back to $40 anytime soon, though. I think ABT is a strong dividend payer that is being fully priced (probably a little bit overvalued). Therefore, it's a good addition on your watch list, but wait for a potential dip before entering a position.ABT has shown that it is a shareholder-friendly business, doubled with a growth by acquisition model. I can see how it can fit in my dividend portfolio. Unfortunately, the price is just not right at the moment.Instead of buying ABT, I think that ABBV is a better option. After a strong start in 2018, the stock went from nearly $120 to low 90s, making a great opportunity.

This guidance was also better than expected.The company's underlying business is firing on all cylinders. This article analyzes whether Abbott is still a buy today.","Abbott Laboratories (ABT) is one of the most stable dividend stocks around. With 46 years of consecutive dividend increases, the company is in elite company. Abbott is a member of the Dividend Aristocrats list, a group of companies with 25+ years of consecutive dividend increases.It isn't just Abbott's dividend payment that is stable. The company's presence in the healthcare sector means that its earnings, revenues, and cash flows are also resilient to downturns in the broader economy. Abbott has increased its earnings in 14 out of the last 15 years (after adjusting for the AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) spinoff).But how strong has the company's recent financial performance been? On January 24th, Abbott Laboratories reported financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2017.This article will analyze Abbott's performance in detail and determine whether the company earns a buy recommendation at current prices.Abbott's fourth quarter earnings release delivered robust growth on both the top and bottom line.On the top line, Abbott's fourth-quarter worldwide sales increased by 42.3% on a reported basis, primarily due to the St. Jude Medical acquisition that closed in early 2017. Excluding one-time charges and acquisitions, Abbott's comparable operational sales increased by 7.7% in the fourth quarter.Source: Abbott Laboratories Q4 Earnings InfographicAbbott's bottom line saw GAAP diluted earnings per share of ($0.50), largely due to a one-time $1.46 billion expense related to U.S. tax reform. Excluding non-recurring items, Abbott's adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.74, at the high end of Abbott's guidance band of $0.72 to $0.74.The company's full-year figures were similarly impressive. GAAP worldwide sales increased by 31.3% over 2016's figure while comparable operational sales increased by 4.9%. On the bottom line, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.50 increased by 13.6% over the $2.20 reported in the prior year's period.Here's what Abbott Laboratories' Chief Executive Officer, Miles White, had to say about the company's financial performance in the quarter:Altogether, it was an excellent quarter from Abbott Laboratories. The company's 2018 guidance (discussed below) indicates that this momentum should continue into the next fiscal year.Abbott also provided guidance for fiscal 2018 when it reported fourth quarter earnings. The company expects full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be in the range of $2.80-$2.90, which implies 14.0% growth at the midpoint.On a GAAP basis, earnings are expected to be significantly lower: $1.22 to $1.32. This is because Abbott forecasts net specified items that are nonrecurring in nature to decrease earnings by approximately $1.58 per share.Abbott also noted that debt repayments will be a key focus in 2018. Abbott's fourth quarter earnings release stated: ""Abbott has stated its commitment to reduce its debt levels following the recent acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere, Inc."" and, later, ""In January 2018, Abbott repaid $4.0 billion of debt and anticipates additional debt repayments throughout 2018."" The company's focus on devleveraging its balance sheet is welcome by us here at Sure Dividend, and should be appreciated by conservative investors.Without a doubt, Abbott's business is firing on all cylinders. Unfortunately, the company's stock price is not as attractive. In the next section of this article, we'll explain why Abbott does not garner a buy recommendation from Sure Dividend.Abbott's fourth quarter earnings release shows that the underlying business is performing extremely well. With that said, just because Abbott is a great business does not mean it is a great stock. This section will analyze Abbott's current valuation to determine if the company still merits investment at current prices.Abbott's recently released 2018 financial guidance calls for adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.85 at the midpoint. After a nearly 4% rally following its earnings release, Abbott is currently trading at a stock price of $61.49. This implies a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.6.An earnings multiple of 21.6 is below the average multiples in the S&P 500. Still, this is well above where Abbott should be trading given its valuation history. The following image illustrates that Abbott's price-to-earnings ratio is far above its long-term historical average.Source: Value LineAbbott Laboratories' current price-to-earnings ratio is 21.6 and its average price-to-earnings ratio over the last decade has been 16.2. The company is clearly trading at a premium to its 'normal' valuation. While one could argue that Abbott's premium valuation is justified by the elevated multiples seen across the rest of the equity markets, we believe that Abbott's valuation will be a negative contributor to the stock's future total returns.Still, investors may yet realize attractive total returns thanks to Abbott's impressive growth prospects. 2018's guidance calls for 14% earnings growth, and Abbott has a long history of steadily increasing its earnings over time (shown below).Source: Value LineNote that Abbott's significant decline in earnings in 2013 is due to the spin-off of its pharmaceutical business AbbVie, which remains publicly traded today. Excluding that one-time earnings drop, Abbott has compounded its adjusted earnings-per-share at 7.3% per year over the last 15 years. Looking ahead, we believe that continued 6%-8% annualized earnings growth is feasible for this Dividend Aristocrat, which give the possibility of near-double-digit total returns after including Abbott's 1.8% dividend yield.Abbott's fundamental characteristics are very attractive, yet there's no question that its valuation is stretched today. Due completely to its valuation, the company does not earn a buy recommendation from Sure Dividend. It remains a hold (and a strong one, at that) for the conservative, long-term investor.This was another excellent quarter from Abbott Laboratories. The company continues to meet and even beat Wall Street expectations - according to its Investor Relations website, Abbott has achieved an earnings beat in 41 out of the last 45 quarters.While there's plenty to like about Abbott's business, we can't quite recommend its stock due to one factor: its valuation. Abbott is trading well above its normal valuation multiples. Accordingly, we rate the company as a hold and recommend that investors wait to accumulate shares of this high-quality business until it trades closer to our perception of its fair value (around 16x earnings, or perhaps slightly higher)."
4132744,24206,2017-12-19T12:15:22-05:00,"On an absolute basis, Abbott Labs has rallied about 40% this year.The stock has a current PE of 45.75 and PEG ratio of 3.94; this is a very expensive issue.The stock has only moved sideways since its latest earnings report (which was very positive).  This means the good news is already baked-into the stock's price.","In my first article of this series, I outlined my reasons for believing we can expect a slowing market rally in 2018. Add the following data to that analysis:The Factset trailing PE ratio is the highest its been in 10 years. There’s nothing, of course, to prevent it from moving higher. But, were' clearly in very expensive territory. Assuming this analysis is correct, it’s a good time to sell some winners. Next up on my list is Abbot Labs (ABT). While this might seem like a counter-intuitive call, bear me out.First, they have a great balance sheet:The current and quick asset ratios are both above 1, indicating ample short-term liquidity. While their days of inventory on hand has inched higher over the last 10 years (rising from 92-101), their receivables turnover ratio has also increased, keeping their cash conversion cycle fairly constant. They also have tremendous free cash flow. They did have a problem with their income statement. On an annual basis, total income decreased from $39.8 billion in 2012 to $20.6 billion in 2016. And despite a company-wide cost cutting program, we’re not seeing any meaningful decline in expenses. Cost of goods sold is down a touch from 45.53% in 2014 to 43.27% in 2016, but their operating expenses are constant over the same time period (41.64% v. 41.5%) while their net margin has decreased substantially, falling from 11.28% in 2014 to 6.71% in 2016.But they just had a great quarter – reporting a solid sales increase:And, the best part of the earnings report was the 20%+ increase in cardiovascular sales, indicating their acquisition of St. Jude Medical is paying off.So, why sell this great company? There are a number of reasons. First of all, it’s expensive. The current PE is 45.75, making it the 13th most expensive stock (out of 75 companies) in the medical appliance and equipment group. The forward PE is a bit more manageable at 19.64 (making it the 28th most expensive company) but the PEG ratio is 3.94, meaning investors are paying a lot for growth. If your goal is to buy cheap and sell when high, there are the kinds of valuation readings that would indicate its time to sell.Then we have a modestly bearish technical picture, starting with the weekly chart.The St. Jude sale closed at the beginning of 2017 when ABT was trading ~$40/share. The stock is now trading in the mid-50’s, which is a 40% increase. Since the start of the year, ABT has seen three advances followed by sell-offs. Prices recently broke the near-year-long trend line. Over the same period, the MACD has advanced; it is low at its highest level in the last three years and has also given a sell-signal. The daily gives us further reason to sell:Prices broke the multi-month trend line at the beginning of September. The stock is now consolidated gains between 53-57. But despite a great earnings report at the beginning of November, the stock moved sideways instead of rallying. Finally, notice the declining momentum.And then there’s an increasing weakness in the sector. Out of all the market sectors, the medical appliance and equipment sector is 45/206 on current PE, 63/206 on forward PE and 57/206 on PEG ratio. The pace of the upward trend is declining:Most of this sectors gains came during the first three quarters of the year. Since the end of August, prices are up 10%. And notice the dip at the beginning of December; while the broader market was making continual new highs, this sector was lagging. And out of 75 companies in the group very few have strong charts. Instead, most issues are treading water or moving lower. There’s an old Wall Street Adage: buy the rumor, sell the news. That’s the perfect description of Abbott Labs this year. The stock has rallied 40% since its acquisition of St. Jude Medical. But now it has risen to very high levels and simply moved sideways in response to a great earnings report. If you made money in ABT this year, take some money off the table and sell.This post is not an offer to buy or sell this security.

4142764,101378,2018-02-02T16:10:06-05:00,Abbott's dividend aristocracy places it among the very top.Abbott's growth drivers - medical devices.Abbott's growth drivers - diagnostics.Finding an entry point for Abbott is seldom easy.,"Dividend growth investors place great faith in reliable growing dividend streams. Abbott (NYSE:ABT) stands out on that metric as I will document. Abbott also has another characteristic which I regard as more forward looking. Abbott has an unparalleled clutch of new products. By and large, they are products in areas of Abbott's core competencies. Accordingly, they dovetail into its current operations without upset or risk.The thesis of this article is that Abbott's dual characteristics of dividend constancy and new product growth drivers make it a favorable investment target in this overheated market.Abbott has been on a run in 2017. ""No big deal,"" you say, ""lots of stocks had healthy runs in 2017."" Certainly that is true. However, when you look at Abbott's performance in terms of revenue, absolute sales price and total return basis over the decades, Abbott's true exceptionalism becomes more clear. The chart below shows incredible value and resilience over a nearly 50 year span.ABT data by YChartsTry matching that. It's no easy task. Abbott is a dividend aristocrat, but it is not just any dividend aristocrat. Its bloodlines go way back. Noting that dividends are key aspects of its investment identity, Abbott boasts of dividend growth and constancy that few can touch, as follows:History, no matter how prolonged, is comforting; however, shareholders dare not focus on the past for too long. The inscrutable future is what truly matters. On that score, Abbott seems equally solid. CEO White has key healthy growth drivers in two of his essential divisions, as discussed below.The graphic below shows the relative percentage revenues of Abbott's four divisions as reported in its Q4, 2017 press release; it helps to give context to Abbott's growth story. Abbott's total sales for 2017 were $27.39 billion:Medical devices, with sales exceeding $10 billion, is its largest (38%) division. Before its acquisition of St. Judes, Abbott's fiscal 2016 medical devices' sales were roughly half this amount. For 2016, Abbott reported 4.5% operational growth for the medical devices division. For 2017, with St. Judes becoming fully integrated, medical devices' sales are double with comparable operational growth of 5.7% for 2017 and 9.6% for Q4, 2017.For 2018, Abbott is guiding for adjusted per share sales of $2.80-$2.90, compared to its 2017 per share revenue of $2.50. New products will serve to underpin this growth. The division leading in the new product arena is medical devices. During Abbott's Q4, 2017 CC, CEO White was positively effusive when discussing its wide array of new products:Now that St. Judes' devices are included within Abbott's stable, Abbott has new devices generating sales to serve a broad spectrum of cardiovascular conditions. This gives its sales force premier entrée into the largest systems of payers and users assuring that Abbott's heart devices are part of the conversation whenever there is need.Abbott is not just a shop for cardiovascular medical devices. It also has devices to address chronic pain which White discusses briefly, as follows:Last, but certainly not least, there is diabetes care. This is of double importance for Abbott insofar as it provides supercharged growth and assists its CEO in connection with personal monitoring of his diabetes.In connection with the growth aspect, CEO White described the following in Abbott's Q4, 2017 CC:Abbott's diagnostics division sports two notable pathways for growth. The first and most exciting has to do with Abbott's Alinity family of diagnostic devices. This program is the one that I expect will be most positively transformative for Abbott over the next decade.It constitutes a systematic rework of Abbott's core diagnostic systems across every area in which it operates. Abbott expects the launch to take place over a series of years. Abbott began gathering CE Mark approvals for components of the series in the EU in 2016; it has begun gathering FDA approvals in 2017.The Alinity family of products will result in growing revenues for Abbott over the years as laboratories around the world upgrade their equipment. In the Q4, 2017 CC, CEO White pointed out how Abbott has generated 5-7% growth from aging systems. Now that Abbott will be entering the market with its new state of the art Alinity diagnostic equipment, expectations for ramped up growth are obvious.The scope of the Alinity opportunity is monumental. White describes the Alinity system and its rollout as follows:Such an optimistic view from a less accomplished executive than CEO White would be excusably taken with a large grain of salt. However, in this case the strategy is simple and appropriate; it requires a roll-up and replacement of existing equipment primarily in institutional settings. There is no reason to expect that a company with Abbott's proven record of accomplishment cannot pull it off.The second area of growth in diagnostics seems more challenging, although I believe Abbott also will pull it off. This is the piece that Alere brought to the table. Abbott is still in the process of integrating Alere into its business. The goal for CEO White is to take over a leadership in rapid diagnostics, one of the last areas of diagnostics where Abbott is not already there.Bringing Alere to heel has required Abbott to replace its entire management. White characterizes the process as proceeding at warp speed. He is very pleased with how quickly and effectively the new integration is taking place. Still, he sees it taking several years before point of care diagnostics at Abbott matches its general growth in the economy.Ever the optimist, after explaining how it will take time for the Alere piece to reach its full potential, White states:Abbott's 2017 run from ~$38 to ~$58 reflects an increase exceeding 50%. Already in 2018 (today as I write 2/1/18) it has tacked on another $4.00 a share.Surely Abbott is entitled to a breather. The market will give back some portion of its gains at some point. Of that there can be no doubt. The problem is we do not know when, nor how much.The reason investors should include Abbott among their top tier of stock investments is because of its long time track record of growing dividends and because of its strong growth drivers as discussed above.Dare one buy this name now that it is trading ~$62.00? Let's take a look at its F.A.S.T.Graphs chart below:With the share price on a seven year frame starting to wander well above its blue line reflecting its normal P/E ratio of 20.9, there can be no doubt that Abbott is expensive. However, its track record of performance along with its growth drivers are sufficiently attractive to merit steady acquisitions of the name over time until one reaches a full position.In my most recent article on Abbott from October, ""Abbott's Inviting New Allure"", I fretted of the pain in buying in at $55.60. Today it closed at $62.18.My first detailed analysis of Abbott in ""Abbott Laboratories: Should I Stay Or Should I Go?"" saw me fretting about its inelegant acquisition of Alere. I have learned since that Abbott keeps on chugging in the face of such issues. As savvy readers pointed out at the time, (Abbott was trading <$40), it was nothing more than a buying opportunity.The person who understood this best was Abbott's longstanding CEO and Chairman White. He bellied right up to the bar. He ordered a full bottle of Abbott, >$40 million. In subsequent quarters, his strategy of having Abbott buy St. Judes has proven to be brilliantly effective.Over the next several years Abbott should grow at a healthy clip. Its dividend should grow too at an increasing pace as it begins to pay off the debt acquired in connection with its acquisitions.All investments carry risk. Abbott has a worldwide footprint so risk could pop up for it in dozens of areas. It has taken quite some time to shake off upsets in its nutrition division in China and generally the debacle in Venezuela has been costly for the company.At the current time Abbott looks to have a period of positive growth catalysts that predominate over risks on the visible horizon. It is fully valued, overbought if you will. Nonetheless, incrementally acquiring shares in this company over time makes good sense for those who want to build a position in a solid long term growth investment, collecting dividends along the way."
4117278,101378,2017-10-27T10:16:48-04:00,"Abbott's 2016 was consumed with Alere and St. Jude acquisitions.2017 saw closing of both and substantial integration of St. Jude, with the smaller Alere integration just beginning.2018 shows great potential as Abbott works towards a growthier new normal.Buying-in presents difficult choices.There are always risks.","To date, Abbott (NYSE:ABT) has had a gratifyingly successful 2017. Its stock has risen smartly from <$40 to ~$55, a share price increase approaching 40%. I am expecting it to consolidate these gains over the balance of 2017. As 2018 approaches, Abbott presents excellent prospects for outperformance in a generally overheated stock market.As I will show, Abbott's established pharmaceutical business is already forecast for double-digit sales growth. Abbott's other three divisions are benefiting from acquisitions, in the case of devices and diagnostics, and from regulatory adjustment, in the case of nutrition.I am looking for Abbott's Alere integration to produce surprises in 2018. Some will no doubt cause regret. On the whole, however, I expect Alere to round out Abbott's portfolio in a highly rewarding fashion.Abbott contracted to buy Alere (""ALR"") for a hefty $5.8B on February 1, 2016. The acquisition was never very popular with Abbott's existing shareholders. Litigation between Abbott and Alere resulted as Abbott questioned the deal when Alere turned out to have unexpected legal issues.The dispute was finally settled on April 14, 2017, with Alere taking a small haircut on the purchase price. Following the settlement, the acquisition moved to closing without continued public upset.Abbott's St. Jude's acquisition proceeded without any lengthy delays. Abbott first announced the $25B St. Jude's deal on April 28, 2017. As mentioned below, there were certain hiccups in this transaction as St. Jude faced FDA scrutiny of certain of its implantable heart devices.Nonetheless, Abbott remained enthusiastically committed to its St. Jude acquisition from the time it first inked the deal through closing.The St. Jude merger closed on January 3, 2017. Abbott has already achieved substantial integration of St. Jude. The Alere deal suffered a painful birthing; it had begun several months prior to St. Jude's but did not close until nine months later on October 3, 2017. Integration of the smaller Alere is in its earliest stages.Overall, the St. Jude acquisition has been quite positive; albeit there have been a series of disconcerting FDA interactions which have marred what has otherwise been a thoroughly successful integration.Such interactions include potential battery issues with certain St. Jude defibrillators. The FDA issued a stern warning letter on April 12, 2017. This letter cited St. Jude's failure to take adequate corrective action to address previously identified risks of premature battery depletion.The FDA also issued its safety communication dated August 29, 2017, citing cybersecurity vulnerabilities on certain installed St. Jude pacemakers. The FDA approved Abbott's security patch, issuing its notice to serve as a recall. The recall applied to so-called CRT-P, but not to CRT-D. A Google search for the difference between the two returns the following brief explanation:The 8/29/2017 FDA communication included the following:To date, I have found no indication of new developments on this front. The latest information I have found is a recent 10/19/17 article which cites no new specific concerns but rather addresses lessons learned from this first FDA implantable device recall.Abbott achieved its growing stock price despite its stodgy growth profile. 2018 should see positive developments in the area of growth.In connection with Abbott's recently completely Q3, 2017 CC, Abbott issued the following graphic. I have added forecasts in red from the CFO's CC presentation setting out Abbott's latest sales growth (""SG"") expectations by division. I include it below as a quick reference:This graphic shows that Abbott's smallest division (established pharmaceuticals) is set for the strongest growth, with its largest (medical devices) pitching in with solid mid to high single digit growth. Nutrition and diagnostics are growth laggards.During the CC, CFO Yoor noted that the impressive device growth was primarily attributable to:These are the areas that gave Abbott its pizzazz during Q3, 2017. St. Jude contributed to these results, adding to Abbott's already robust heart device portfolio and contributing its diverse neuromodulation devices.Newly developing techniques for using neuromodulation to counteract pain are entering the market as the opioid crisis ravages communities. According to Abbott's new director of neuromodulation:Diabetes, heart disease, and pain management are three areas where countless patients have dire need of relief. These three conditions contribute several points of growth to Abbott's largest division, a fact that bodes well indeed for Abbott's ongoing growth prospects.Nutrition and diagnostics give bulk to Abbott's mix of businesses but currently lack exciting sales growth forecasts. Abbott's last several CCs lay out the nagging problems that its China business has posed for Abbott's nutrition division.This quarter, Abbott appears to be turning the corner on its China nutrition problem. China has a new regulatory framework fully in place, with Abbott now having gone through the difficult process of restocking its nutrition inventory so that it is fully compliant with the new requirements. I look forward to nutrition's growth trajectory tilting upward as it reaps the benefit from this arduous process.As for diagnostics, CEO White acknowledged that the double-digit accretion figures targeted when Abbott first announced the Alere deal were now uncertain. Nonetheless, after a few quarters, it is fully reasonable to expect that Abbott will positively shape Alere's diagnostic businesses. Once that process plays out, diagnostics will have scale and potential.In early 2016, when he announced Abbott's Alere transaction, CEO White cited an extensive palette of expected growing synergies in both sales and operations. I submit that CEO White's brave words from his Q2, 2016 CC, during the height of the Alere imbroglio, will prove the wisdom of this deal:In the current stock market environment, attractive stocks tend to be highly priced. Obviously, Abbott's recent 40% run has impacted its place on the value chain. F.A.S.T. Graphs™ provides an approach to assessing this issue. The F.A.S.T. Graphs™ chart below:reflects Abbott's six year path following its 2013 separation from AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV).The blue, black, and the orange lines are key depictions in the F.A.S.T. Graphs™ system. The blue line reflects Abbott's calculated normal PE over the six-year period shown. The black line reflects Abbott's monthly closing stock price over the last six years. The orange line reflects Abbott's PE ratio calculated in accordance with the Graham Dodd Formula ""GDF"".In today's overheated market, the black line on F.A.S.T. Graphs™ charts for many attractive stocks, not under some grim cloud, likely meanders above their orange and blue lines. Such is the case for Abbott as shown above. Such potential overvaluation is not determinative in any sense as the following caveat from F.A.S.T. Graphs™ makes clear:I tend to be one to focus on potential gains rather than risks. In the case of Abbott, this is particularly true because of its exemplary track record of positive execution. As CEO White proudly noted during Abbott's Q3, 2017 CC, in response to an analyst question:Wow! Wouldn't it be great if Abbott could bottle its execution prowess and sell it to companies in need?Unfortunately, that is not possible. However, once a company has a culture of engrained excellence in execution, as is true of Abbott, it seems likely to continue.Abbott's culture will get a test as it on-boards Alere. Rightly or wrongly I have pegged the Alere operation as subpar in terms of execution, given its miscues that so delayed the Abbott acquisition. In order for Abbott to achieve its full potential, it needs to turn Alere around, hopefully sooner rather than later.In his Q3, 2017 CC, CEO White discussed Alere in his opening remarks, and he also fielded several questions on Alere. In his opening remarks, he set out the rationale for the Alere acquisition as follows:The first question during the CC was on Alere. It elicited a wide ranging response as follows:In response to a follow-up question on 2018 growth expectations for Alere, CEO White accepted low single digits as, but only as, a preliminary target.A later questioner drilled into accretion expectations. This question accepted that there would be slippage compared to the original expectations. He asked if half would be a reasonable placeholder. The fact sheet Abbott published when announcing the deal listed accretion as:In response to the question, CEO White noted that it had taken Abbott six months to interlace St. Jude into its operations. He then noted that the ""glue was still drying"" on the process. Abbott had had only days on Alere so far. It had a good running start, no more. Then, White described his integration process and status as follows:So, when it comes to risks, we have an important integration taking place with a target company which has made recent news headlines for bad reasons. We have a CEO who is responding coyly to questions on accretion or the new acquisition achieving low single-digit growth.We also have potential reflowering of FDA probes into St. Jude pacemakers. These are recognized known unknown risks. We also have whatever known unknowns lurk in Abbott's 10-K risk section. Large-cap medical instrument companies operate in an arena featuring all matter of patent disputes, tort litigation, and other hurdles. Then, there are wider market risks.As I submit this article to SA, Abbott is up a bit on the day to ~$55.60. At this price, its dividend is a modest <2%. Insofar, as it took on considerable debt in connection with its new acquisitions, it is not likely to increase its dividend at any rapid pace. Accordingly, I am not tempted to add shares for the time being as much as I like its longer term prospects.We are in a situation where I regard Abbott's business as quite attractive, alluring if you will. However, the stock at its current price seems less so. Over the next few quarters, I am looking forward to watching as Abbott's four businesses join together to show their powerful growth potential.Abbott has a marvelous grouping of businesses. Established pharmaceuticals is already growing like gangbusters. Medical devices has three powerful franchises driving it upward on the growth curb. Diagnostics has its new Alere acquisition to school in the ways of effective execution. Nutrition has its China puzzle almost solved.The future is looking excellent for Abbott."
4112517,63883,2017-10-09T14:27:15-04:00,"Abbott Laboratories is one of the highest quality healthcare stocks available.The company is likely to generate rising dividend income for years to come.Unfortunately, Abbott is currently trading above its historical average valuation ratio.","By Nick McCullumAbbott Laboratories (ABT) is a very well-known dividend growth stock, and for good reason.The company is a member of the exclusive Dividend Aristocrats list, a group of elite dividend stocks with 25-plus years of consecutive dividend increases. You can see all 51 Dividend Aristocrats here. The following infographic contains additional details about the importance of investing in quality dividend stocks and how Abbott Laboratories fits into this framework for self-directed investors.Source: Abbott Laboratories Investor RelationsThe remainder of this article will discuss the investment prospects of Abbott Laboratories in detail.Abbott Laboratories is a diversified healthcare corporation with a market capitalization of $95.6 billion. The company was founded in 1888 and is headquartered in Lake Bluff, Illinois.The company operates in four main segments:The company’s nutrition segment is characterized by market leadership. It is the No. 1 pediatric nutrition provider in the United States and some other geographies. Moreover, the segment’s performance has improved considerably in recent years as operating margin has improved in each and every year since 2011.Source: Abbott Laboratories Presentation at the 2017 JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, slide 7The company’s branded generic pharmaceuticals segment is entirely focused on the emerging markets, with an emphasis on BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China).Source: Abbott Laboratories Presentation at the 2017 JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, slide 8The company’s Diagnostics segment is more geographically diversified than the branded generic pharmaceuticals segment. About 30% of the company’s revenue is generated in the United States while 30% is generated in non-US developed markets and 40% is generated in emerging markets. Similar to the Nutrition segment, the Diagnostics segment has seen significant operating margin improvements over the last several years.Source: Abbott Laboratories Presentation at the 2017 JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, slide 9Abbott Laboratories’ last segment is the Medical Devices unit. This segment was bolstered significant in recent times with Abbott Laboratories’ acquisition of St Jude Medical, which helped to segment to grow sales by nearly 90% in the most recent quarter.Source: Abbott Laboratories Presentation at the 2017 JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, slide 10Clearly, Abbott Laboratories operates a highly diversified business model with a presence in many different sectors of the healthcare industry.The next section will discuss the company’s growth prospects in detail.Over time, Abbott Laboratories has shown the capability to reliably grow its adjusted earnings per share over time. The company’s adjusted profits per share over the past decade are shown below.Source: Value LineNote that Abbott Laboratories spun off AbbVie (ABBV) in 2013, which explains the sharp drop-off in apparent earnings. Make no mistake -both businesses have performed well since the spin-off. Today, if an investor held onto their shares of both companies, their per-share earnings would total $7.02. This is up significantly from the $4.99 (growth of 8.9% per year) of adjusted earnings-per-share reported by the pre spin off Abbott Laboratories in 2012.Looking ahead, Abbott Laboratories has two major growth prospects that will help its business to become increasingly more profitable over the years to come.The first is the aging population, both domestically and within the United States. In 2015, the percent of the global population that exceeding age 65 was 8.5%. This proportion is expected to nearly double over the next thirty-five years, to 16.7% in 2050.Source: Abbott Laboratories Presentation at the 2017 JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, slide 5The second broad tailwind that will benefit Abbott Laboratories is the company’s focus on emerging markets, which is particularly true for its Branded Generic Pharmaceuticals segment.Many of the countries that this segment is focused on spend a very small proportion of their overall GDP on healthcare, a rate that is expected to increase in the future.Source: Abbott Laboratories Presentation at the 2017 JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, slide 6The aging domestic population combined with the rather low focus on healthcare spending in emerging market countries should leave Abbott Laboratories plenty of room to grow for the foreseeable future.Abbott Laboratories’ competitive advantage is two-fold.The first component is its remarkable brand recognition among its consumer medical products, particularly in its Nutrition segment. Led by noteworthy products like the Ensure meal replacement supplement, Abbott Laboratories brands allow its sales to stand strong through even the worst economic recessions.The second component of Abbott’s competitive advantage is its focus on research and development. The company’s R&D expense over the last several years is shown below:Abbott’s Laboratories’ investments into research and development show that the company is willing to play the long game, building out its product pipeline and improving its long-term business growth prospects.As a large, diversified healthcare business, Abbott Laboratories is extraordinarily recession-resistant. The company actually managed to increase its adjusted earnings-per-share during each year of the 2007-2009 financial crisis.Abbott Laboratories remarkably managed to grow its earnings-per-share during the global financial crisis – one of the mot economically difficult time periods on record. We expect this recession-resistant Dividend Aristocrat to perform similarly well during future downturns in the business environment.When Abbott Laboratories reported second quarter earnings in July, the company updated its full-year adjusted earnings-per-share guidance to $2.43-$2.53 (up three cents from $2.40-$2.50 previously). This performance forecast gives investors a benchmark by which to assess the company’s current valuation.Abbott Laboratories is currently trading at $55/share. Using this price combined with the midpoint of the company’s new guidance ($2.48) gives a price to earnings ratio of 22.2.The following diagram compares Abbott Laboratories’ current valuation to its long-term historical average.Source: Value LineAbbott Laboratories’ current valuation is noticeably higher than its long-term average. While right now may not be the best time to purchase shares of this high-quality business, total return may still be satisfactory particularly when adjusted for the low-risk nature of Abbott’s business model.The other major component of Abbott Laboratories’ future total returns will be the company’s earnings-per-share growth. As we’ve seen, the company has a proven ability to grow earnings in the high-single-digits each year. We expect that this growth is likely to continue and investors can reasonably expect 7%-9% adjusted earnings-per-share growth moving forward.Lastly, Abbott’s total returns will receive a boost from the company’s dividend payments. Abbott Laboratories currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.265 which yields 1.9% on the company’s current stock price of $55.In sum, Abbott Laboratories’ expected total returns will be composed of:... for expected total returns of 8.9%-10.9% before the (likely negative) impact of valuation changes.Abbott Laboratories has many of the characteristics of an appealing dividend investment:While the company’s current valuation exceeds its long-term average, Abbott Laboratories remains a strong hold and we recommend that investors buy this high-quality stock on any notable dips.Abbott Laboratories is a high quality dividend growth stock trading, but it isn't the most attractively priced stock around.

4110127,39141,2017-09-28T04:27:04-04:00,Abbott Labs cruising at a multi-year high.Acquisition of St. Jude Medical is driving growth higher.Abbott is valued well above its average.,"If you've been long Abbott Laboratories (ABT), the market has been pretty good to you as of late.Courtesy of Google Finance.Shares of this medical conglomerate have been rising and rising all year. I believe the reason for this is that the market is gaining confidence in the company's bold acquisition of St. Jude Medical, a leading medical device maker. The St. Jude acquisition brought with it a promise of enhanced EPS growth over the years, even if it decelerated dividend hikes in the short term. Management expects EPS growth in the double digits, and it now seems like the market is understanding this and responding accordingly. As for myself, I actually sold shares a couple months ago, so I've missed out on the latest upward action from Abbott. Shares of Abbott sit at quite a high valuation right now, but there's no denying that management is on track to achieve considerable synergies, and also to re-accelerate dividend growth by next year. This article takes a look at ongoing progress from Abbott Labs, as well as its revised EPS outlook. This article also takes an updated look at Abbott's valuation. Making progressAbbott's acquisition of St. Jude Medical in 2016 was a huge one; for about $30 billion in cash stock and assumed debt altogether. This acquisition was announced last year, and since then the acquisition has eclipsed all other operational news. Such was the case this quarter as well. Management expects to achieve $500 million in cost synergies from the St. Jude acquisition by 2020, and as of last quarter, the company remains ""on target"" to achieve that. The company is also on target for 29 cents per share of earnings accretion by next year and 21 cents per share of accretion this year. In the second quarter, comparable revenue increased 2.9% year-on-year. Abbott is a conglomerate, with separate businesses in pharmaceuticals, nutrition, diagnostics and devices. Pharmaceuticals lead the way with 4.1% revenue growth, diagnostics grew 3.8%, and comparable devices sales increased 3.2%. Nutrition lagged behind with comparable sales growth of 0.6%. Management's new EPS guidance has a midpoint of $2.48, which would be a double digit gain from the $2.20 per share earned this year. Since 21 cents per share of that gain is coming from accretion from St. Jude, you can see that it is the acquisition that is driving the growth here.On the full year, pharmaceutical sales are expected to grow high single digits, nutrition expected to grow by low single digits, diagnostics by mid single digits, and devices by double digits, lead of course by the St. Jude portfolio. Priced for perfectionAbbott is at quite a high value right now, which makes me reluctant to recommend it, but it's not too terribly hard to see why shares are valued so high. If we look at forward earnings projections, analysts expect double digit EPS growth until at least 2020. I don't give particularly much credence to analyst forecasts greater than twelve months, but it is clear that the consensus is for high EPS growth. I expect the management to return to double digit dividend growth in 2018, and I have a feeling that is really spiking the share price. Personally, I'm of the belief that once the acquisition synergies are achieved, and most of the low-hanging fruit has already been grabbed, earnings growth could slow considerably. Abbott has much of this growth already priced in, in my opinion. Shares are currently 21.9 times trailing earnings, and, according to data from FAST Graphs, Abbott has averaged 16.9 times over the last ten years. That's a premium of 29.5%, which makes Abbott too steep for me. In my last article on Abbott, written on January 16th, I said that I would recommend buying shares if it got to the point where shares yielded 3%, or a share price of a little over $35. That obviously didn't happen, and today shares are at $52. Nevertheless, I recommend caution at this high valuation. If growth investors keep piling into Abbott Labs, shares could definitely continue to run higher. I expect 2017 to be a good year for Abbott, and perhaps 2018 as well, but beyond that it is hard to predict. The stock may have gotten out in front of its skis here, and value investors and dividend investors aren't likely to hop back into this one unless shares come down substantially.

On a comparable operational basis, sales growth was still a healthy 5.6%.Adjusted earnings per share of $0.66 came in at the high end of management's guidance of $0.64-$0.66.We continue to like Abbott as a long-term, buy-and-hold investment. However, shares are expensive and investors would do well to wait for a better entry point.","By Nick McCullumAbbott Laboratories (ABT) is a legendary dividend growth stock, and for good reason: the company is one of only 51 Dividend Aristocrats.The Dividend Aristocrats are an exclusive group of dividend stocks with 25 years-plus of consecutive dividend increases. Abbott is one of the leaders in this list of already impressive stocks, as its 45-year record of consistent dividend increases is nearly sufficient to qualify the company to be a Dividend King (stocks with 50 years-plus of consecutive dividend increases). On October 18, Abbott Laboratories reported financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The company's performance was very strong, with double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth and mid-single-digit revenue growth (after adjusting for the impact of acquisitions).This article will analyze Abbott's earnings release in detail and determine whether the stock still holds appeal for dividend growth investors.Business OverviewAbbott Laboratories is a global healthcare company. Founded in 1888 and headquartered in Lake Bluff, Illinois, Abbott has grown to be a leader in the healthcare industry. The company has a market capitalization of $97 billion, serves people in more than 150 countries and employs approximately 94,000 people. Abbott's business is divided into four segments for reporting purposes:Abbott's Medical Devices segment is the company's most important. The contribution of each segment to last quarter's revenue can be seen below.Source: Abbott Laboratories Third Quarter Earnings Infographic The company's medical devices segment was bolstered significantly with the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, which closed in January of this year. This had a significant impact on the company's performance in the recently announced third quarter, which is discussed below. Third Quarter Financial PerformanceThere was a lot to like about Abbott Laboratories' third quarter earnings release.On the top line, sales of $6.8 billion increased by 28.8% over the prior year's period. This is almost unbelievable growth for a company the size of Abbott.As implied earlier, though, the acquisition of St. Jude Medical was one of the primary drivers of this eye-popping revenue increase. On a comparable operational basis, Abbott's sales increased by 5.6% - still healthy top-line growth for a large, blue-chip stock like Abbott.The comparable operational sales figure includes St. Jude's performance during the 2017 and 2016 quarter, even though the operating unit was not owned by Abbott during the prior year's period. A reconciliation between GAAP revenue and comparable operational revenue can be seen in the following table:Source: Abbott Third Quarter Earnings Release, page 17On the bottom line, performance was similarly strong. Abbott reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.66 in the quarter, which represents an 11.9% increase from the prior year's share net of $0.59. Abbott's cost controls and share repurchases allow the company to continue growing its adjusted earnings per share faster than revenue, a trend that we're definitely happy to see. Sure Dividend is not the only member of the investor community that's pleased with Abbott's performance. Here's what Abbott's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Miles D. White, had to say about the company's performance in the quarter:Speaking of guidance, Abbott's earnings release included an important narrowing of its full-year earnings forecasts. The company's management now expects the following for fiscal 2017:The stark difference between Abbott's GAAP and non-GAAP earnings guidance stems primarily from acquisition-related charges for both the St Jude Medical transaction and the Alere transaction. The company noted the following in its third-quarter earnings release:To sum up, Abbott delivering mid-single-digit growth in adjusted revenues and double-digit growth in adjusted earnings per share. We are happy with the company's performance, and believe it is well-positioned to continue outperforming thanks to some meaningful growth prospects introduced by the Alere acquisition (discussed below). Growth ProspectsAbbott has a number of compelling growth prospects, of which one of the most significant is the company's strategically important acquisition of Alere, which closed on October 3rd. The following excerpt from Abbott's press release announcing the transaction's close gives some insight into why Abbott's management team wanted to purchase the Alere business:Investors should be delighted that the Alere acquisition was successfully completed. While not nearly as large as the St. Jude Medical transaction ($5 billion compared to $25 billion), there was significantly more uncertainty surrounding the potential completion of the Alere transaction. Abbott had filed suit in December to terminate the then ~$5.8 billion acquisition, citing a ""substantial loss"" in the value of its potential acquiree. Abbott's stance changed when Alere agreed to be purchased for $5.3 billion ($500 million less than the original purchase price), which led to the deal closing earlier this month. The purchase bolsters Abbott's in vitro diagnostics presence and should be capable of generating some meaningful supply chain and distribution synergies. In the first full year following the acquisition (fiscal 2018), Abbott's management believes that Alere will add $0.11-$0.13 to the company's adjusted earnings per share (a ~5% increase if management's guidance for this year proves correct). The Alere acquisition is likely to help Abbott's earnings grow at an adequate clip going forward. Investors should also note that the company has a very impressive track record of compounding shareholder wealth:Source: Value LineNote that Abbott Laboratories spun off AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) in 2013, which explains the noticeable downturn in earnings for that fiscal year. Make no mistake: both businesses have continued to perform exceptionally well since the spin off, and if an investor held onto their Abbott and AbbVie shares until today, their claim on per-share earnings would have grown at a CAGR of 9.2% over the past 15 years.Looking ahead, we believe that Abbott is capable of 6%-8% annual growth in adjusted earnings per share over full economic cycles. Valuation and Expected Total ReturnsAbbott is expecting its full-year adjusted earnings per share to fall in the range of $2.48-$2.50. Using the midpoint of this guidance band ($2.49) combined with the company's current stock price of $55.94 implies a price-to-earnings ratio of 22.5x for this high-quality dividend stock.A price to earnings ratio of 22.5 is not outrageous for a company like Abbott that has a robust track record of consistently building shareholder value over time. However, investors need to recognize that the company is certainly trading at a premium to its long-term average price to earnings ratio.For evidence, consider the following image, which compares Abbott's current valuation to its average valuation over the last decade. Source: Value LineAbbott's current price to earnings ratio is 22.5 and its 10-year average price to earnings ratio is 16.2. While the company is certainly one of the most high-quality businesses around, it fails to garner a buy recommendation because its stock is pricey relative to its historical averages (just like many of the best companies right now).Abbott remains a long-term hold for existing investors, while potential investors should wait for slightly better prices to initiate a position.Final ThoughtsAbbott Laboratories' third-quarter financial performance exceeded the market's expectations. The company delivered double-digit adjusted earnings-per-share growth and mid-single-digit revenue growth (which was nearly 30% higher on a GAAP basis).Abbott Laboratories continues to fire on all cylinders, but the company is a bit too pricey to earn a buy recommendation. We recommend waiting for better buying opportunities in this high-quality Dividend Aristocrat. Abbott is a high-quality Dividend Aristocrat, but the stock's valuation prevents us from issuing a buy recommendation.

4105090,103394,2017-09-07T16:16:20-04:00,"Abbott has obtained FDA approval for its LVAD medical device HeartMate 3, which I believe will act as a catalyst to drive the stock up.Wells Fargo Securities senior analyst Larry Biegelsen said HeartMate 3 will help Abbott take market share from Medtronic.I agree. Medtronic's LVAD business will face a significant challenge if it failed to get FDA approval for HVAD for destination therapy.","Abbott Laboratories (ABT) recently announced it has obtained FDA (food and drug administration) approval for its medical device HeartMate 3, reported StarTribune. The share price of Abbott Laboratories is hovering around all-time high of $51. StarTribune said:Does this imply share price of Abbott Laboratories will cross the all-time high and rise significantly beyond that? Let’s get deeper inside the story.The device pumps blood for heart-failure patients. The device has a a fully magnetically levitated propeller compared to a propeller mounted on bearings inside HeartMate 2 and other traditional LVADs. Such LVADs can cause ""pump thrombosis,” a condition led by the bio-incompatible presence of the propeller mounted on bearings. This condition leads to blockage in the blood vessel (vein, artery or capillary), which in turn expose patients to the risk of cerebral attack.Image Source: DKfindoutI agree with Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen that HeartMate 3 will help Abbott take market share from Medtronic (MDT). Medtronic acquired cardiac pump maker HeartWare for $1.1 billion last year, and is the main competitor of Abbott’s HeartMate LVAD line (originally developed by Thoratec) with the former’s HVAD (read HeartWare-LVAD). Thoratec received FDA approval for HeartMate 2 in April 2008 for BTT (bridge-to-transplantation), and for DT (destination therapy) the device received FDA approval in January 2010. The company received CE Mark approval in November 2005. Technologically speaking, HeartMate 2 was always remained a better device compared to HeartWare’s HVAD. BTT supports HF (heart failure) patients who are waiting for heart transplantation, and DT supports patients who are too sick for transplant.It’s noteworthy here that Abbott received FDA approval for HeartMate 3 only for BTT, not DT (for DT HeartMate 2 is Abbott’s solution for now). And Medtronic’s current version of HVAD also received FDA approval for BTT. To learn more about Medtronic’s effort to obtain FDA approval for DT, click here.Before being acquired by Medtronic, HeartWare’s plan was developing an advanced LVAD, called MVAD. However, it’s not clear if Medtronic is still interested in developing MVAD. Go here to learn more. In this competitivge landscape, Abbott is far well-positioned than Medtronic in the LVAD market.Abbott’s LVAD business generates a miniscule part of its total revenue. The real story is Abbott’s international presence. The LVAD news is a trigger to boost Abbott’s stock price up.The falling US Dollar would be actually beneficial for Abbott’s future revenue. Let’s take a look at Abbott’s relative valuation in terms of trailing 12-month P/S multiple compared to Medtronic and Johnson and Johnson (JNJ).Image Source: Author (Data: Morningstar)Clearly, Abbott is attractively valued compared to its competitors, and industry average as well. Since Abbott is an international story alongside its competitors, P/S multiple should be the appropriate valuation metric. If the industry average multiple of 4.2x is applied on Abbott's revenue per share, we will get a target price of around $61 for the stock. I believe Abbott is heading towards that mark. When Thoratec received FDA clearance for HeartMate 2 for BTT and DT, FDA didn't warn that it can cause pump thrombosis. The device malfunction was detected later. Similarly, if magnetically levitated propeller inside HeartMate 3 results in any unforeseen complicated condition for HF patients, that might lead to FDA recall. According to an article:I believe HeartMate 3 won't lead to any adverse impacts on patients because the device has gone through extensive trials before getting approval. Although it didn't cause pump thrombosis, other complications might occur. Since heart is an electrically dynamic organ, I'd recommend investors considering this potential risk factor before investing in Abbott."
4099352,98446,2017-08-16T08:52:46-04:00,I want defensive stocks to make up about 50% of our portfolio.I won't buy just any company to get to this level.  I want quality dividend paying companies.Dominion has a 5-year average dividend raise of more than 7%.Abbott Laboratories has been raising dividends for 45 years.Both companies are core holdings in our portfolio.,"With the current bull market more than 8 years old, I am trying to position my wife and I's portfolio a bit more defensively these days. Morningstar tells us that health care, consumer staples and utilities are in the defensive ""super sector"". I, along with most dividend growth investors, tend to group telcommunication companies in this category as well. Companies in these sectors tend to sell products or offer services that people will buy even if the economy is in a downturn. Products like toothpaste, deodorant and cereal are going to be bought in any economy. Keeping the lights on will be a priority for folks, even if times are tough. Having access to life saving medicines and medical devices will always be in high demand. In addition to these products, I would argue that having access to a smart phone has become a necessity among Americans and we will do anything to make sure we can continue to use it. Companies in the consumer staple, utility, health care and telco sectors are one's users are going to purchase regardless of economic conditions. As such, these companies often have solid cash flows and can offer investors robust dividend yields as well as lengthy histories of dividend growth.My ultimate goal is to have the defensive sector make up 50% of our stock portfolio. The ""stickiness"" of the products, dividend yields and dividend growth histories of these types of companies will protect our portfolio if/when the next recession hits. These companies have products and dividends that have survived many different economic environments. The following table represents how much each of these sectors make up of total portfolio. I have chosen to subtract out our 403b programs through our employer and show the percentage of each sector out of just the stock portion of our portfolio. Ultimately, I want the defensive sector to account for 50% of our stock holdings and the cyclical and sensitive super sectors to make up 25% each of our stock holdings. As of 8/11/2017, here is what that break down looked like:As you can see, I am a little short of my targeted allocations for each super sector, but it isn't completely out of whack. I do have some work to do in building up the defensive sector. And that is just what we did on Friday when we purchased shares of Dominion Energy (D) and Abbott Laboratories (ABT).We first bought Dominion back at the beginning of April. At that time, we hadn't yet added a utility stock to our portfolio. I liked what I had read about their Cove Point Liquid Natural Gas facility being built in my adopted home state of Maryland. According to Morningstar, Dominion has a 20-year agreement in place with its partners in Japan and India. The agreement states that Dominion's partners will cover the capital and operating expenses for Cove Point. Morningstar also says that Dominion has exemplary leadership as well as a wide moat around its businesses. None of the other utility companies I follow have both of these ratings.We purchased shares of Dominion Energy on 8/14/2017 at $77.73. At that price, the stock yielded 3.89%. F.A.S.T. Graphs said the PE ratio at that time was 20.9, which is 7.66% above its 5-year average of 19.3. CFRA, formerly known as S&P Capital IQ, says its price target is $77, which would have shares at about 1% overvalued from our purchase price of $77.73. CFRA says fair value is $68.10, meaning shares were a little more than 12% over valued at the time of purchase. Morningstar is more bullish, with a $85 fair value. That would have shares at about 9.35% undervalued. Average these numbers out and I find Dominion Energy to be about 3% overvalued. Considering the company is one of our core holdings, I'm happy to add to our Dominion Energy position at these prices. Any price under $80 would qualify the company for another purchase.When we sold General Electric (GE) last month, one of the stocks we purchased was Abbott Laboratories. Abbott has made our watch numerous times, most recent back in June, but I had never pulled the trigger on the stock. Much of what I wrote about the company then applies today. The company is a leader in nutrition products, diagnostics testing, branded generic pharmaceuticals and, with the addition of the St. Jude purchase, medical devices. The most recent quarterly results had the company beating earnings per share by a penny. Revenues came in above estimates and were up 24.6% year over year. Management said St. Jude, a maker of cardiovascular devices, was up 4% on its own during the quarter. Abbott also raised guidance. CFRA says that the St. Jude acquisition will add $0.21 and $0.29 to the 2017 and 2018 earnings, respectively. The company has raised dividends for the past 45 years.On Monday of this week, we doubled our Abbott Laboratories holdings at a price of $48.97. At that time, F.A.S.T. Graphs said the company's PE ratio was 20.4 and the 4-year average was 19.1. At this level, Abbott was 6.4% overvalued when we made our purchase. CFRA forecasts a 1-year price target of $53, offering us 8.23% of upside based on what we paid for shares. CFRA's fair value is $56.80, meaning shares traded at a 16% discount to fair value at the time of purchase. Morningstar says fair value is $47, or about 4% below our purchase point. Average these numbers out and I find shares were 3.5% undervalued. A beat on earnings and a raise in guidance as well as a lengthy dividend growth history makes me pretty bullish on a company's prospects. I consider Abbott Laboratories to be a core holding for our portfolio and I would have no issue with buying more shares under $55.After buying Dominion Energy and Abbott Laboratories, the defensive sectors now account for 45.14% of our stock portfolio. Not quite the 50% level I'm looking for, but we are inching closer to that goal. I will continue to try to find value regardless of sector, but I would like to make an effort to make our portfolio slightly more defensive. What do you think of our purchases?

4114918,25120,2017-10-19T22:03:30-04:00,"Abbott Laboratories continues to fire on all cylinders with >5% organic growth.The company furthermore benefits from dealmaking, a weaker dollar and recent product approvals.After a 40% run higher this year shares look a bit expensive, certainly if leverage is taken into account, even if the positioning is very good.","Abbott Laboratories (ABT) is a true long-term outperformer. The reason for that is multifold, yet simple. Abbott is great at allocating capital, runs diversified operations while avoiding a conglomerate discount, and operates in structural growth markets.Dealmaking in 2016, accelerating organic growth and recognition of Abbott's great quality have propelled shares 40% higher this year, in a move which seems a bit like an overreaction. This is certainly the case as the realistic earnings multiples come in close to 25 times earnings while the company operates with quite some leverage, which makes it very easy to avoid Abbott despite operating momentum, supported by recent product approvals.Abbott holds leadership positions in multiple areas of healthcare, including Established Pharmaceutical (international), Nutrition, Diagnostics and Medical Devices. The company benefits from the fact that the percentage of people in the world which are over the age of 65 years will double between 2015 and 2050.Other drivers include the fact that healthcare spending as a ratio of GDP is on the increase in most parts of the world and remains lower in developing countries. That means that Abbott's strong foothold in emerging countries creates another boost on top of global aging populations.The company has made some large moves in recent years, notably 2016 has been active. At the time, the company was still in the process of acquiring Alere (ALR) as Abbott only received anti-trust approval to buy the company as recently as September of 2017. Poor economics and issues at Alere made that I was never really enthusiastic about that deal.The much bigger deal was the $30-billion purchase of St. Jude Medical, the maker of cardiovascular devices. To offset the increase in leverage from this deal and the pending acquisition of Alere, the company sold its Medical Optics Business to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in a $4.3-billion deal.At the time, that is September of last year, I concluded that shares were fairly valued in my opinion, as my conclusion was too conservative after shares have run some 35% higher over the past year. The company has benefited from continued growth, recent dollar weakening, good integration efforts and valuation multiple inflation. With shares now hitting new highs, let's revisit the investment thesis given the developments which have taken place ever since.As a reminder, the numbers posted by Abbott are influenced by a lot of dealmaking, including the purchase of St. Jude which closed at the start of this calendar year, as Alere had not yet closed in Q3.Following the St. Jude deal, third-quarter revenues were up 28.8% to $6.8 billion as the 5.6% comparable operational sales growth number is very decent as well, as the company continues to ride favourable demographic trends. Even better, the comparable number for the international business came in at 7.8%, good news as that business actually comprises two-thirds of total sales.The company is now on track to become a $28-billion business, of which medical devices make up +$ 10 billion following the St. Jude deal. This is followed by a $7-billion nutrition business, a $5-billion diagnostics business and an almost as large established pharma business.The nutrition business fared the worst with just 0.8% comparable growth, actually reversing modest declines in the first six months of the year as that remains a challenged business, mostly due to a competitive US marketplace. Diagnostics comparable growth remained solid just above 5%, driven by the core laboratory and point of care business, especially overseas.The 14% increase in established pharmaceutical sales marked a big acceleration from trends earlier this year and was driven by the sound positioning into China, Russia and Brazil, among others. A 5.6% organic growth number for medical devices was strong as well, driven by FDA approvals and integration of St. Jude.Abbott's results vary wildly, depending on which accounting metric you look at. GAAP earnings are seen at $0.98 per share this year, plus or minus a penny. At the same time, adjusted earnings are seen at $2.49, plus or minus a penny.That is a huge gap and warrants an investigation. Reconciliation items totalled $1.9 billion after taxes in the first nine months already, as the full-year gap between both earning metrics is seen at roughly $2.5 billion. Roughly 70% of these items relate to amortisation charges on past deals which Abbott has already been paid for and really does not affect cash flows, unless the company structurally makes bad deals or overpays for them; but one can hardly claim that this is the case given the company's track record.The other 30% is pretty much split evenly between transaction-related costs which are real cash outflows and are associated with dealmaking, and restructuring costs which occur quite often as well at a big conglomerate. One might even argue that restructuring a business while organic growth exceeds 5% means that these expenses are really never zero.So assuming that these two latter costs categories are quite structural, I am adding back 70% of the reconciliation items which cause the gap between roughly $1 in GAAP earnings and $2.50 in non-GAAP earnings. 70% of that gap works out to $1.05 per share, which pretty much implies that I peg realistic earnings at $2.05 or perhaps a bit higher, but certainly not close to $2.50 per share.The company has not filed its quarterly reports for Q3 yet; so for the state of the balance sheet, I am relying on the Q2 numbers as no major deals have taken place as of since. The company held $9.8 billion in cash and another $1.5 billion in other investments, for roughly $11.3 billion in cash-like assets. Regular debt stands at $24.0 billion for a $12.7-billion net debt load. If the $8.7-billion underfunded status of pensions is included, net debt jumps to $21.4 billion. Both these numbers exclude the near $7-billion deal for Alere.With roughly 1.75 billion shares outstanding and realistic earnings slightly surpassing $2 per share, realistic earnings are seen at roughly $3.5-4.0 billion a year. After adding back some $750 million in annualised interest costs and a 30% tax rate, I end up with adjusted operating earnings of roughly $6 billion. Adding back depreciation charges of about $1 billion, while of course ignoring the amortisation charges as I am using adjusted earnings, I peg adjusted EBITDA at $7 billion. This number could be a bit higher if you add back restructuring costs as well.It goes without saying that leverage remains on the higher side for some time to come. Including Alere, net debt stands at roughly $20 billion, or close to $29 billion if pension liabilities are included. That works out to a roughly 3-4 times leverage ratio.There is a lot to like about Abbott. The company has an amazing long-term track record. Not only has it become a good conglomerate in structural growth markets, posting organic growth of 5% or more, it has an excellent track record in dividends as well. The company has been paying out dividends for nearly a century and has raised its dividend for 45 years in a row, even as the 45% run higher so far this year has reduced the yield to 1.9%.Even if I am generous and peg realistic earnings at $2.25 per share, multiples are very elevated at 24 times earnings, for an earnings yield which is just above 4%. This is certainly the case as the company torches along quite a heavy debt load. On the other hand, synergies from Alere and St. Jude Medical could be substantial, as the latter deal alone should bring cost benefits of half a billion dollars. Assuming half a billion dollars in synergies from here onward, a 30% tax rate and synergies could add another $0.20 per share to earnings in the coming year/years. This could boost earnings power to a realistic level of $2.50 per share.Even in that case, it is not prudent to invest into Abbott right now, despite a great positioning and long-term track record. While I have been too cautious this time last year, that is not a reason to step in at these levels, as shorting great companies is always a dangerous endeavour. For now, I can only congratulate management and investors with the achievements so far this year, as I will continue to monitor future developments with great interest, but absolutely have no taste for the shares, even in case of a small dip."
4110538,103547,2017-09-29T08:06:52-04:00,Abbott shares gained nearly 3% after the FDA approved their FreeStyle continuous glucose monitoring device and approval to close their acquisition of Alere.The gain equated to a $2.6 billion market cap increase in one day.Abbott shares are now up 20% in the last six months.Investors should look into the numbers to see if the share gains are justified.,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) was up almost 3% on Thursday, reacting positively to the FDA announcement that their FreeStyle Libre continuous monitoring system had been approved for patients 18 years of age and older. The share run up added nearly $2.6 billion to Abbott's market cap for the day. With the shares up 20% over the last six months, investors should be skeptical about yesterday's price movement.After the FDA announcement, the FreeStyle Libre Flash Monitoring System became the first continuous glucose monitoring product in the U.S. market capable of guiding insulin dosing without the need for calibration with a finger prick test.The company's diabetes monitoring franchise is playing catch up with Medtronic (MDT) and Dexcom (DXCM), both of whom already had continuous glucose monitoring products in the U.S. market. Abbott's FreeStyle Libre continuously collects data for up to two weeks and has a smaller form factor than the competing products. However, the user must download data from the device, and the device is not capable of independently alerting users to dangerously low glucose levels. The lack of an alert system is a critical drawback for many users.It is estimated that there are approximately one million individuals 20 years of age and over in the U.S. living with type one diabetes, giving a rough estimate for Abbott's target market. Each sensor for the U.S. market is expected to last approximately 10 days and the price will be similar to the $69 price charged in Europe, before insurance. For one year, this would equate to nearly $2,500 per patient before insurance.While the FreeStyle device has several advantages over the existing technology, there is no assurance that it will be broadly accepted given that the device lacks the active alert capability that many patients will feel is essential. There is also a question of how much pricing power Abbott will have given that there are competing products. The table below gives two possible scenarios, with vastly different outcomes for Abbott shareholders.If we assume the low end scenario and assume that Thursday's run up was strictly due to the FreeStyle announcement, that would equate to valuing the business at around 36 times gross profit. On the other hand, the high end estimate would equate to a cheap 4.8 gross profit multiple. Only time will tell if the market response to the announcement was rational.As a large conglomerate, Abbott has many other potential growth opportunities. The company spent $1.4 billion on R&D in both 2015 and 2016. In their 2016 10-K, Abbott mentions that the Established Pharmaceuticals segment has more than 400 development projects underway.A list of Abbott's vascular product pipeline projects includes their Portico Re-sheathable Transcatheter Aortic Valve System. The Abbott offering will face stiff competition, as the market pioneer Edwards Lifesciences Corp (EW) and Medtronic have had several years to establish a head start on the transcatheter aortic valve market.In their Q2 release, Abbott highlighted the new insertable cardiac monitor, Confirm Rx, from St. Jude Medical. The device is used to help identify infrequent heart rhythm abnormalities that can cause fainting, and potentially death. The device uses the patient's smartphone to transmit monitoring data to a physician. Medtronic's Reveal LINQ provides similar functionality; however, it requires their MyCareLink wireless monitoring system to transmit data to a monitoring service. Abbott's technology appears to have an advantage in replacing a dedicated monitoring system with the ubiquitous smartphone.Abbott submitted their new Quadra Assura cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) for FDA approval during the second quarter. The technology will have to compete against Medtronic's MRI compatible SureScan pacemaker line, which received FDA clearance for their CRT-D product in February of 2016.Abbott also mentioned that the Alinity hq hematology system received the CE Mark. The product joins a crowded hematology market that includes competitors Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY), Sysmex (OTCPK:SSMXY), Danaher's (DHR) Beckman Coulter, and new entrant Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY). Taken together, it appears that Abbott has many opportunities to grow, but it will likely be slow going given that many of their new products will be competing with established products from their rivals.Abbott has struggled with slow revenue growth, declining profit margins, and earnings declines since their 2013 spin off of AbbVie (ABBV). Abbott acquired St. Jude Medical in hopes of jump starting growth, paying an enterprise value of $30.7 billion. St. Jude reported 2015 earnings of $880 million and Abbott anticipated pre-tax cost synergies of $500 million by 2020, so Abbott will have to drive innovation in the St. Jude portfolio to justify the price.ABT Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsFrom the Q2 earnings release, we can get a sense of how the St. Jude Medical business acquisition is performing under Abbott so far. Several business segments are new to Abbott, so their numbers can be directly compared to St. Jude's performance prior to the merger. The Rhythm Management and Heart Failure segments both had sales declines, with a combined revenue decline of $145 million. The Neuromodulation business saw an increase in revenue of $126 million dollars, a 49.4% increase.The Electrophysiology segment, which consists mostly of legacy St. Jude products, generated $58 million in additional revenue for the first half of the year. While it is still too early to say if the St. Jude deal will work out, there are two previous deals that Abbott made that investors can judge.Table from Abbott Q2 earnings releaseTo help fund the St. Jude Medical deal, Abbott sold their Medical Optics business to Johnson & Johnson for $4.325 billion last year. Abbott had acquired the business through their purchase of Advanced Medical Optics for $2.8 billion in 2009. Not all of the sales price represented an increase in the value of the business, as Abbott had added OptiMedica to the segment in 2013 for a $260 million upfront cash payment, plus up to $150 million in milestone payments.In terms of revenue, the business hardly grew under Abbott. Advanced Medical Optics generated revenues of $1.185 billion as an independent company in 2008, while the unit operating as Abbott Medical Optics had $1.195 billion of sales in 2016. In the 2016 annual report, Abbott disclosed that profits for the segment totaled only $30 million in 2016 and $64 million in 2015. Given the lackluster growth and profit margins, it appears Abbott was fortunate to get a good price for a unit with lackluster performance.Abbott received 110 million shares of Mylan Inc. (MYL) in 2015 in exchange for their developed markets branded generics pharmaceutical business. The 2015 annual report stated that the shares were worth $5.77 billion at the time.Abbott sold 40.25 million of the Mylan shares for $2.29 billion in 2015, just prior to the precipitous decline in Mylan shares. The sale resulted in a tax bill of $71 million in 2015. With Myland shares currently trading at around $31, the remaining Mylan stake is valued at just over $2.17 billion.At the time of the sale, Abbott stated that the unit had sales of approximately $2 billion. The 2015 10-K lists the combined net sales for the developed markets generics pharmaceutical business and animal health business at $2,076 billion, with $505 million in earnings before tax for 2015.Assuming that profit margins from the two units were equal, this would equate to approximately $475 million in earnings before tax for the generic pharmaceutical business that was sold to Mylan. Using the current value of the Mylan shares, Abbott received a price to earnings before tax multiple of 9.4 for the unit. To date, it does not appear that Abbott received a good value for the business. The company has stated that they do not intend to be long-term shareholders in Mylan, but it seems that they are waiting until the share price recovers before liquidating the position.Thursday was a big day for Abbott, as they also received approval from the Federal Trade Commission to close their deal to acquire Alere (ALR), contingent upon the sale of Alere's blood gas and cardiac market testing systems. The deal was first announced in early 2016, with Abbott offering $56 per share. After a series of revelations and lawsuits, the two parties agreed to an amended price of $51 per share. Alere's delayed 2016 10-K filing includes four years of restated earnings, and shows that they averaged a loss attributable to shareholders of $45.4 million per year over the last five years. Abbott will have their work cut out for them in trying to recover the ~$4.4 billion price that they paid for Alere.In their Q2 earnings release, Abbott provided full year earnings guidance of $1.03 to $1.13 per diluted share on a GAAP basis and adjusted earnings of $2.43 to $2.53 on a diluted basis. At a closing price of $53.68, that equates to a price to earnings ratio of 21.6 based on the middle of the adjusted earnings guidance. Shares are currently trading at approximately 20x operating cash flow and over 27x free cash flow.ABT Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) data by YChartsAbbott has significant liabilities, which have grown recently due to the St. Jude and Alere deals. In their most recent 10-Q, Abbott lists long-term debt of $23.8 billion, current liabilities of $6.8 billion, and $8.7 billion in post-employment obligations, deferred taxes, and other long-term liabilities. Those liabilities total $39.3 billion, while current assets totaled just shy of $20 billion. Total liabilities less current assets comes out to $19.6 billion, which comes out to ~4.5x trailing 12 month operating cash flow. While manageable, investors will want to see the debt load reduced as the company completes the integration of St. Jude and Alere.ABT Total Liabilities (Quarterly) data by YChartsAbbott is a dividend aristocrat, having increased dividends for 45 consecutive years. The company currently pays a dividend of $0.265 per share, with the last dividend increase being $0.005 per share for their February 2017 dividend payment. The payout ratio on a reported earnings basis has exceeded 100% in the last year, explaining the slowing dividend growth rate.ABT Dividend data by YChartsThe dividend payout does not appear as bad on a free cash flow basis, but it has still been trending higher over recent years. Dividend growth in the near future will likely be muted as the company pays of debt from the St. Jude and Alere deals.ABT Total Dividends Paid (TTM) data by YChartsAbbott Laboratories is currently in a dynamic time, with two major acquisitions to integrate and a host of new products coming to market. While there is hope that the new products and St. Jude acquisition can return the company to earnings growth, a string of bad deals (Alere, Mylan, Medical Optics, etc.) and a large liabilities should give investors pause. I believe that the shares are currently overvalued, and will be looking to exit my current position in Abbott.Let me know what you think about Abbott's future prospects.

4090676,45851,2017-07-26T12:05:11-04:00,"Abbott Laboratories recently reported strong second quarter results. Following the earnings announcement, Abbott closed higher, with share prices now up 30% from the start of the year.Abbott Laboratories is a member of the S&P Aristocrats Index, which tracks companies that have annually increased their dividend for 25 consecutive years.Given the stellar earnings report, which included a full-year EPS boost, we have ourselves asking, ""Is now the time to buy Abbott?""","Since the start of the year, Abbott shares have been climbing steadily upwards, with a few minor stumbles and pauses along the way. Following its latest earnings announcement, Abbott was up 2.8% higher than its previous day close, and is poised to break its all-time high of $51.74 set last July 2015.Major Points of the Earnings AnnouncementAbbott second quarter 2017 results released on July 20 basically reinforces and confirms investor confidence in the company.So is Abbott Still a Buy at these Levels?At its July 20 closing of $50.85, Abbott is trading at a forward P/E of about 20.5X assuming a full year 2017 EPS estimate of $2.48. For a company like Abbott within the broader health care industry, its current share price could be near the upper end of its normal P/E range.This is not to say that Abbott is fully valued as analyst price targets for Abbott go as high as $58 with the average at around $52.50. Moreover, you can argue that a company like Abbott deserves to trade at a higher P/E. However, with Abbott share prices near its all-time high and having climbed by 30% from beginning 2017 levels, buying the company with the aim of near term capital appreciation should be tempered with some caution.Dividend OverviewIn its corporate website, Abbott emphasizes the importance of dividend payouts as part of its company heritage and investment identity. Since 1924, the company has declared 374 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased its dividend payout for 45 consecutive years.Current dividend yield is 2.1%. Annualized dividend payout is $1.06 per share, payable quarterly. Payout ratio is fairly high at 110%, which is indicative of the importance the company gives to dividend growth and maintaining the regularity of dividend payments.With its strong sales growth and market position, both in domestic and overseas markets, a cautious buy is recommended. We wouldn't recommend buying the house on Abbott, however it is particularly attractive for dividend income buyers given the company’s established track record in dividend payouts."
4086903,56142,2017-07-11T10:01:43-04:00,"Defensive consumer health care and medical product companies may perform better in a recession and bear market soon.Stabilized earnings and free cash flow into 2018 will help the company pay down debt, increase share repurchases and raise the common dividend.A low price to sales valuation could mean Abbott will outperform its peers for several years.Abbott has strong buying momentum and is beginning to lead the health care sector this summer.","Defensive large caps in the consumer health care and medical products category have witnessed decent buying trends during 2017. Abbott Labs (ABT) in particular seems to be playing catch up to the higher valuations of peers and competitors, after lagging the equity performance gains in the health care sector for several years. The 2.2% dividend yield at today’s $48 share price is an attractive proposition for income investors. The real kicker for earnings and free cash flow growth in 2017 and beyond is coming from the St. Jude Medical merger completed in January, as cost savings and synergies are realized. The current net profit and free cash flow margins on sales appear ready to move smartly higher, closer to competitor levels the next few years.Management expects 2017 to be a year of transition in terms of earnings, with 2018 showing much better improvement in free cash flow. In April’s conference call on first quarter results, the company gave guidance for $2.45 in adjusted earnings during 2017,Conservative balance sheetOne of the draws for conservative, defensive investors is the consumer health care and medical device sector’s usual low debt/leverage level vs. the rest of the stock market. Abbott’s debt number is somewhat higher than peers after completing the transformational merger with St. Jude, but still well below the blue-chips that have bearish leverage setups.Interest expense on $20 billion in net debt, total debt minus cash and short-term investments, is running around 4% annually, at $800 million. Free cash flow [FCF] against total liabilities, net of current assets, is manageable. With $4.7 billion in estimated FCF for 2018 ($2.75 per share projection by Wall Street analyst consensus) vs. $20.5 billion in “adjusted” total liabilities presently, Abbott could theoretically pay off all net liabilities in 4.4x years. We are subtracting $19 billion in current assets like cash from $39.5 billion in total liabilities, as listed in the latest March quarterly filing with the SEC.This measure of financial flexibility is relatively conservative and positive for shareholders vs. the average stock, while slightly leveraged vs. its medical product peers. For comparison, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has an equivalent liability ratio of 1x yearly expected 2017-18 free cash flow generation, adjusted for liquid current assets. Medtronic (MDT) is 4.5x years, Stryker (SYK) is under 1x, Baxter (BAX) is under 1x, and Becton Dickinson (BDX) is a high 9x [before the CR Bard (BCR) acquisition, Bard stood at 1.5x as a standalone]. Health care pharmaceutical giant Merck (MRK) retained a 3x multiple of net adjusted liabilities to FCF, while Pfizer (PFE) held net liabilities equal to 4.8x expected annual free cash flow.On the flip side, many large caps I recommend investors avoid hold substantially greater leverage. The General Electric (GE) total liability sum, minus current assets, sits at 9x consolidated company FCF annualized [before the Baker Hughes transaction is considered]. AT&T (T) is trading at a whopping 13x equivalent ratio [excluding the Time Warner merger yet to be consummated]. Exasperating the high debt and IOU situation, a host of large cap industrial companies in America are witnessing overall sales in decline, and profits set to move into reverse if the economy stumbles.Abbott’s low price to sales valuationNot only is Abbott adding St. Jude sales in 2017, but it is close to officially acquiring another $2.5 billion in revenues from the Alere (ALR) takeover at less than 2x sales.Using today’s configuration, Wall Street 2018 forecasts call for $2.75 in free cash flow, on $28 billion in sales [excluding the Alere purchase numbers]. Abbott/St. Jude by 2018 is projected to generate $16.50 in sales per share, alongside a strong 17% net free cash flow margin on revenues. Using the current equity capitalization, Abbott is priced at 2.9x forward sales, down from 3.1x trailing results. Historically the last 20 years, 2x sales has proven an excellent low point to aggressively accumulate shares, while prices above 4x trailing sales have been a good area to lighten up and sell, all else being equal. Fair value based on sales would be just under $50 a share at Abbott’s historical average ratio of 3x.However, since most stocks are trading well ABOVE any normalized long-term valuation metric of sales, a 4x sales number by late year could bump Abbott’s fair “relative” value closer to $65, about 35% higher than today’s quote. Historically, its price to sales ratio has averaged nearly double the S&P 500 capitalization ratio on sales at the time. Since U.S. stocks are priced at a modern high of 2x sales right now, my argument is Abbott may be quite undervalued at 3x sales vs. alternative investments.See the Yardeni graph below highlighting the S&P 500’s record valuation vs. underlying revenues. The latest reading has eclipsed the previous year 2000 historic peak. The typical S&P 500 stock is trading at a 50% premium to its 10-year and 25-year average of price to sales nearer a 1.4x multiple.Abbott’s 2.9x forward sales is one of the lowest ratios in the large cap, health care sector. Price to forward sales is estimated using available Yahoo! Finance Wall Street analyst consensus numbers. For comparison, peer and competitor Johnson & Johnson trades at 4.5x the consensus 2018 estimate of revenues, Medtronic 3.7x, Stryker 4.0x, Baxter 3.1x, and Becton Dickinson 3.6x (BCR 5.5x). The biggest pharmaceuticals are priced at ratios the same or higher on sales, with examples Merck at 4.3x and Pfizer at 3.7x to compare.Any way you cut it, if Abbott can increase profitability on its newly acquired units, Wall Street will eventually price the company at a higher sales multiple - similar to its peers.Strong technical momentumAbbott’s stock performance is starting to lead the sector, after several punk years of going nowhere. You can see the increasingly positive trend on the graphs below. I am charting Abbott vs. the S&P 500 blue-chip index, the Health Care Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLV), and the other individual peer companies discussed in this article over time periods from 3-12 months.On the 2-year chart below, I really like several strings of 6-8 up days the last six months, and the strong trend in the daily On-Balance Volume [OBV] line.Clearing the former volume resistance and high trades in the mid-$45 a share range during June is quite positive. You can also view the point and figure chart below that highlights the $49.50 to $50 area as the last major resistance to new all-time highs, post the AbbVie (ABBV) spin-off in January 2013.Final ThoughtsBuying on weakness into the $46-47 price range may prove a best-case scenario for new Abbott positions. An overall market decline during late summer and/or the fall could slow Abbott’s strong 2017 advance. Nevertheless, a break above $50 would be a welcome long-term development.Government health care reform is the biggest outside and unknown risk to the medical product sector. Any price fixing authority given to Medicare would be a huge negative. On the bright side, a full repeal of Obamacare would bring lower taxes on medical devices, one of the revenue additions to pay for the program’s benefits to individuals. Plus, if Trump succeeds in lowering tax rates for businesses, Abbott could be a marginal winner.Based on relative sales ratios to the S&P 500, Abbott could be worth closer to $65 in the high valuation Wall Street world we call home during 2017. The $1.06 dividend payout leaves around $2.8 billion in yearly free cash flow to use for stock buybacks, new asset acquisitions, higher dividend payouts and debt reduction. The company has plenty of options and ammunition to continue growing underlying operations.An additional argument to consider ownership is this defensive stock holding has traditionally outperformed the S&P 500 during recessions and large bear markets. Sales are not completely recession proof, but Abbott has proven over the years that slow growth in the U.S. economy does not usually trickle down to its top or bottom line.Please view this article as just a small part of your research investigation into Abbott Labs as an investment option. Don’t be shy consulting a registered investment adviser regarding the pros and cons of owning Abbott in your specific portfolio configuration."
4077630,21877,2017-05-31T10:04:50-04:00,,"In March Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) pulled the control unit for its HeartMate II pump off the US market. The FDA has now designated the recall class I – the most serious type – making public the fact that 26 patients have died after replacing their controller.At first blush this sounds like a disaster for Abbott, but options for the severely ill patients who use these devices are very limited. For one thing the main rival, Medtronic's (NYSE:MDT) HeartWare, has also seen class I recalls. For another, a follow-on HeartMate device is close to US approval. But reports of deaths will doubtless alarm many of those using this device, and Abbott's insistence that software updates will help in the meantime is unlikely to reassure.The HeartMate II’s controller helps power the system, being connected to the implanted pump via a lead under the skin. It is itself powered by batteries or connected to the mains. Patients are given two of the units in case one malfunctions.The process of changing controllers is quick and straightforward – if the patient is able-bodied and fairly technologically literate. But it does necessitate the pump stopping for a moment, causing dizziness or discomfort, and patients are advised to lie down as they do it.In its recall notice, the FDA states that Abbott-Thoratec has received 70 reports of incidents linked to the pump, including 19 injuries and 26 deaths. All the deaths occurred when patients tried to change the controllers outside a clinical setting. The FDA now recommends that the process of changing controllers be done in hospital.Abbott is recalling nearly 29,000 controllers and replacing them with new devices with upgraded software and new leads. Some patients already have these new controllers, but with software that is not the most recent; they will get software updates.Deals within dealsThoratec was the originator of the HeartMate product line. It was bought by St Jude Medical (NYSE:STJ) for $3.3bn in 2015, and St Jude fell to Abbott in a $25bn deal that closed in January 2017. These nested acquisitions make recent sales of the devices hard to track down; in its final annual report St Jude stated that “Thoratec products” made $136m in 2015, but it is not clear whether this accounts for a full year of sales. When Abbott released its annual report in February sales of the HeartMate franchise were not broken out, and in any case the company had only been integrated for a month or so.A similar situation attains with Medtronic's competing HeartWare product. The inventor, also called HeartWare, was bought for $1bn in a deal that closed in August. In its fourth quarter 2016 results, released today, Medtronic does not break out HeartWare sales.Both products have had repeated trouble with their controllers, power leads, batteries or other parts. Medtronic conducted a similar class I recall just this February, for instance.Whatever revenue Abbott gets from the HeartMate II seems likely to dip, if not significantly – and then there is the cost of the recall itself. Perhaps getting the next-generation HeartMate 3 device approved in the US will help plug the hole.The HeartMate 3 is currently in its pivotal US trial which aims to prove its noninferiority to its forerunner. It hit its first primary endpoint, survival at six months, back in November; data on its other primary goal, two-year survival, ought to emerge towards the end of this year.Device recalls, even class I recalls, are an accepted risk of development, particularly when it comes to complex machines that give patients with poor prognoses a shot at life outside a hospital. The two product franchises contesting this market are not perfect but appear to be fairly evenly matched, and it is not clear that new patients would gain anything from prioritising one over the other. As long the HeartMate franchise stays on the market, there will be demand for it."
4080741,22742,2017-06-12T09:33:22-04:00,Abbott Labs by the numbers.Johnson & Johnson by the numbers.A side-by-side comparison.Using the Friedrich Algorithm to compare.,"Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) by the NumbersLooking at the annual revenues chart may be disconcerting, but reality is not as bad as it looks. At the beginning of 2013, Abbott spun off AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) to shareholders (I was fortunate to be one at the time). My data source picked up the restated numbers reported by ABT for 2011 and 2012 as though the companies had already split. In reality, the revenue for ABT did not drop until 2013 post-split. But no matter how one looks at the result, for those holding ABT shares, only revenues have been relatively flat since the spin-off. The compound annual rate of growth since then has been 2.3 percent.All of the charts in the next two sections were created by Mark Bern, CFA, using oldschoolvalue.com as a data source:The annual earnings chart below is impacted by the same event as revenue. The compound rate of growth in earnings since the spin-off has been a negative 18.4 percent per year. Now that is not something to cheer about.Dividends, of course, were cut when the companies split with the shareholders of ABBV, getting the better end of that bargain, but the rate of dividend growth since the split has been 22.2 percent. This does not align well with lower earnings, meaning that shareholders can expect the rate of dividend growth to moderate considerably in the future.I wanted to include a chart for each company to illustrate the net issuance, including buybacks and options exercised, and how the two components impact the final net result. Other than 2007 and 2011, ABT has been buying back shares each year on a net basis. The net figure is what I use when comparing FCF (free cash flow) versus the combination of dividends and buybacks.In the next chart, which compares FCF to net buybacks and dividends, the important bar to keep track of is the grey one which represents what is left over. As long as this bar is positive, the company should not need to increase debt to offset the difference. In recent years, the grey bar has fallen to near zero or negative. We will see the results in the next chart:Now, we look at the annual change in net debt for ABT. I do not mind this number being positive as long as the ratio of debt to equity remains relatively stable. However, the addition of debt in the most recent year is the result from the acquisition of St. Jude Medical (NYSE:STJ), which will increase assets, revenue and earnings. But the ratio of debt to equity jumped from 42 percent to 101 percent from 2015 to 2016. Management has begun the arduous effort to bring that ratio back down in 2017, but has a good way to go to get it back to a more reasonable level having used excess cash to pay nearly $4 billion of debt principal.A look at the chart below shows another impact of the recent acquisition: shares were issued with no effect on cash flow. In 2016, the net change in shares outstanding increased for the first time since 2012. With an increase in shares outstanding of over 17.5 percent, we will need to see a commensurate increase in earnings to keep from diluting shareholders.Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) by the NumbersIt seems as though JNJ is always acquiring new assets and selling a few here and there. This can have an impact on revenue that shows up in the compounded annual growth rate. One would hope the overall impact to be positive. In the case of JNJ, the jury is out in terms of revenue growth. The compound rate of growth over the last 10 years has been a paltry 1.64 percent per year.But a better gauge of the acquisition strategy is the impact it has on earnings. In the following chart, we see a somewhat better picture, albeit one that contains some down years as well as up. The important factor for me is to look at the compound rate of growth over the period, which is 4.57 percent. That is better than the result for revenue, but nothing to get too excited about. On the other hand, JNJ is more of a dividend investors' paradise than a source of appreciation. Of course, with the search for yield in recent years, demand for a AAA credit rating and rising dividends has provided owners of JNJ shares some of both.Consistently rising dividends is possibly the most encouraging feature of JNJ for investors. The compound rate of growth in dividends over the past 10 years is 7.04 percent. There is something to be said for consistency and JNJ has definitely come through for investors on that measure.Below is the chart for JNJ that includes the stock issuance, buybacks and the net impact of the two. JNJ has consistently been able to buy back shares. However, as we will see a little later, acquisitions sometimes require issuance of shares and result in periodic increases in shares outstanding.JNJ is generally able to fund dividends and share repurchases from its free cash flow, but occasionally, as in 2012 and 2016, it comes up a little short. Fortunately, JNJ has accumulated a respectable cash hoard, which affords it some flexibility in this area.Well, here we go again! Debt increases each year have been reasonable in that the ratio remained stable within a range until 2016. Recent acquisitions have required JNJ to add more debt, which resulted in an increase in its debt-to-equity ratio from the mid-20s range to the high-30s. Of course, to keep things in perspective and increase to below 40 percent in this ration is far better than an increase to over 100 percent. The debt level of JNJ remains very manageable and is unlikely to threaten its AAA credit rating, one of only two U.S. companies that have been able to maintain that rating. The other is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in case anyone was wondering.The following chart shows that JNJ continues to reduce shares outstanding over the long term even with acquisitions.Finally, I decided to include one more chart for JNJ because the company does do a lot of acquisitions regularly. This one just shows the cost of acquisitions per year over the last 10 years. This sort of exemplifies just what a behemoth JNJ is when one considers its ability to constantly spend one to $4.5 billion per year, acquiring new assets and smaller companies.Comparing the twoThe table below lists some of the metrics I described in the charts above as well as a few other key ratios that investors may like to consider, as well a few I thought pertinent.Revenue growth is low for both companies, but perhaps more important is how much each is able to convert to the bottom line. In this metric, JNJ is the clear winner. ABT has been able to increase its dividend at a much higher rate than JNJ, but the payout ratio and reduced earning power of ABT raise the question as to how much management will be able to raise the dividend in future years. I like consistency and the higher probability of future increases that JNJ offers. The debt-to-equity ratio also favors JNJ since the ratio for ABT is double that of JNJ. ABT may be going through a significant transition period due to its relative large recent acquisition, but there is absolutely less risk in this area presented by JNJ. The P/E ratio nod goes to JNJ, but the Price to sales and book value ratios favor ABT. My favorite ratio on this table is the Price to FCF, and here the lower the number, the better. JNJ is clearly priced more favorably than ABT on this basis. JNJ also allocates a larger portion of revenue toward R&D, which should bode well for the future. Both companies have a healthy cash balance on the books, but JNJ is in better shape with the lower debt-to-equity ratio, which, when combined with the cash position, provides JNJ with more flexibility in its capital structure.Using the Friedrich AlgorithmLooking at the two companies through the lens of the Friedrich Algorithm, we can see some significant differences. First up is the FROIC (free cash flow return on invested capital) ratio. Both companies had FROIC above 20 percent at the beginning of the 10-year period we analyzed and both are lower. But JNJ has been by far the more consistent of the two having not fallen below 15 percent in any year while ABT has been more sporadic with a low of five percent and spending half of the period below 15 percent.Source: AskFriedrich.comSource: AskFriedrich.comAnother concern we have is when the ""Badwill"" (goodwill plus intangible assets) is more than 33 percent of total assets. ABT sports a Badwill ratio of 52 percent as of it March 31 reporting period. It has been here before and worked its way down to a more appropriate level over time by writing down the excess costs of acquired assets and amortizing its intangibles (mostly patents that will expire over time). But JNJ has managed to keep this ratio below our 33 percent level that results in a warning.I won't go through all the various ratios and bore readers to death, but one can see at a glance that JNJ offers more consistency than ABT. Red is bad, and green is good. ABT has much more red showing up in the datafile above, especially in the most recent year and TTM (trailing twelve months) columns, than does JNJ.JNJ is the clear winner in this comparison, so now I want to take one last look at how it fares on a forensic accounting scale. In addition to our Friedrich algorithm, I rely on a tool that I found to be very useful in verifying our work. The Forensic Accounting Stock Tracker (FAST Model) helps identify companies that may be resorting to more financial tricks to make analyst estimates. The model helps pinpoint where management might be aggressive with revenue recognition, cash flows, the balance sheet, and also takes into account valuation and other metrics. Here is an example of the FAST Models results for JNJ:Source: Forensicstocks.comThe score of C sort of says it all. Low scores on revenue recognition, expectations and valuation make sense (at least on two of the three). The expectations is low since it is a relatively slow growth machine. Valuation is obviously scoring low because the stock is overvalued. Revenue recognition may be less of a problem but something to dig into further when one is considering the stock as a future investment.ConclusionFriedrich considers a fair value (Main Street Price in the tables above) for JNJ to be $103.88 and for ABT $27. A second opinion from oldschoolvalue.com shows a fair value for JNJ of $114.47 and for ABT of $16.83. Current prices for the two are: JNJ $131.53; ABT $47.29.Both companies are overvalued based upon our analysis and valuation of FCF. We consider JNJ a strong hold and ABT a sell at the current price levels.If you have any questions, please feel free to ask them in the comment section below and don't forget to hit the ""Follow"" button next to my name at the top of this article.

4086766,21151,2017-07-10T17:34:21-04:00,"Since 2013, Abbott Laboratories went through a transformation with the spin-off of ABBV and 2 major acquisitions.ABT benefits from several growth vectors for the upcoming decade.ABT shows a strong dividend profile.","Investment ThesisAfter spinning-off its researched-based activities into AbbVie (ABBV), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) has concentrated its focus on various medical devices, nutritional products and branded generic medicine distributions. Strong from major acquisitions in 2014 and 2017, ABT shows several growth vectors for the future. ABT is also a strong dividend paying stocks with 45 consecutive years with a dividend raise. ABT definitely shows a strong profile. Let’s take a deeper look to see if it’s worth your money now.Understanding the BusinessAbbott is a health care company that manufactures medical devices, blood glucose monitoring kits, nutritional healthcare products, diagnostic products and equipment, and branded generic drugs. With over 125 years of existence, over 94,000 employees and operations in over 150 countries, Abbott reputation is well established. The company develops products in four different segments:And owns several well-known brands such as the following:Source: ABT websiteIn their most recent quarterly results, ABT reported strong growth coming from Established Pharmaceuticals division (+7%, +13% if you exclude Venezuelan operations). Providing branded generic medicines in emerging markets where distribution channels are underdeveloped is clearly a growth vector for this pharma.The company currently shows 58% of its sales coming from developed market and 42% coming from emerging markets.RevenuesSource: YchartsThe revenue drop in 2013 isn’t a real one. ABT proceeded with a spin-off and created AbbVie (ABBV). Since 2013, ABT is concentrating on diversified products including medical devices, diagnostic equipment and nutrition products, while AbbVie would operate as a research-based pharmaceutical manufacturer. You have a better vision of ABT's revenue growth starting in 2013:Source: YchartsNote that the recent growth is due to the acquisition of St. Jude Medical as stated in ABT's most recent quarterly statement. Comparable operational sales only rose by 3.2%.source: ABT Q1 2017 Press ReleaseThe company benefits from several growth vectors in the future. In addition to the acquisition of St. Jude Medical (which opens the door wider to the cardiac devices business), ABT will also show growth in delivering existing medicine to emerging markets. The development of their latest Freestyle libre blood glucose monitor should also help revenues in the future.ABT went into a recall issue for its infant formula in China back in 2013. This still affects offshore sales growth potential for the nutritional division. In their most recent quarter, international sales were down 12.2%, mainly due to the situation in China.EarningsSource: YchartsAs you can see, ABT's main challenge isn’t sales growth, but earnings growth. Management is working on streamlining their distribution channels and had recently invested in building facilities in China and India in order to lower cost of operations and prepare for additional sales growth in emerging markets. When we look at ABT's competitors, we notice how management has work on their plate to improve their operating margins:Source: YchartsI think this will be a key point in the upcoming years in order to unlock additional value for investors. ABT shows interesting growth vectors; now it’s time to focus on generating more profit out of them.Dividend Growth PerspectiveABT is part of both Dividend Aristocrats and the Dividend Achievers list with 45 consecutive years of dividend increase. The Dividend Achievers Index refers to all public companies that have successfully increase their dividend payments for at least ten consecutive years. At the time of writing this article, there were 265 companies that achieved this milestone. You can get the complete list of Dividend Achievers here. Source: YchartsAs previously mentioned, the “drop” in dividend payout is also linked to the spin-off in 2013. The company has been steadily increasing their payouts year after year. Is this situation sustainable over the long haul? Let’s look at their payout ratios:Source YchartsABT shows a solid payout ratio of 59.34%, leaving plenty of room for additional increase in the future. While looking at the cash payout ratio, it jumps from 36% to 107% due to the acquisition of St. Jude. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason to think that ABT will not increase its dividend this year and the following.Potential DownsidesABT seems to be in a good position to benefit from a decade of steady growth. However, some clouds could bring rain over the company. First, any pharma is not shielded against product quality issues leading to recalls. What happened back in 2013 still has an impact on China’s sales today.The second possible downside resides within ABT's competitors. There isn’t many players in their business segments and each companies is investing massively to bring the next innovation in their niche on the market. Once in a while, one company brings a game changer in the market, leaving its competitors aside.Overall, investors shouldn’t be worry too much about any potential down fall for ABT in the upcoming years.ValuationThe last section of my analysis is about valuation. While ABT shows a strong profile and meet my 7 dividend growth investing principles, it doesn’t mean that it is trading at a good price.The first valuation method I use is to look at the past 10 year of PE history. This gives me a good indication of how the market values the stock:Source: YchartsDue to many major activities (like the spin-off, the acquisition of CFR+Veropharm in 2014 and the acquisition of St. Jude in 2017), it is hard to determine if the current PE of nearly 50 is a “real one” or not. The company currently shows a forward PE ratio of 19.55 (source Ycharts).To get a better idea of how much ABT is worth, I use a double stage dividend discount model. Since management is already working on improving their margins and ABT shows various growth vectors, I will use a 8% dividend growth rate for the first 10 years and reduced it to 6% as a terminal growth rate.Source: Dividend Toolkit Excel calculator spreadsheetThe company seems overpriced by about 10%. This probably tells you the market has faith management will unlock additional value to shareholders by improving their operating margin.Final ThoughtI think ABT is a solid company with a bright future. Management has gone through a major transformation of the business model since 2013 through a spin-off and major acquisitions. I believe ABT is well positioned to grow their international sales in the upcoming decade and will continue to reward their shareholders with dividend increases. However, I would wait for a dip in the market to find a better entry point.Disclaimer: I do not hold ABT in my DividendStocksRock portfolios.The opinions and the strategies of the author are not intended to ever be a recommendation to buy or sell a security.

        However, uncertainty related to compliance and litigation hangs around these acquisitions, making them high risk high gain assets.","Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of those few companies which managed to surpass both analyst expectations as well as their own guidance in EPS performance in 1Q 2017. And yet, the company,has continued with its conservative guidance for 2017.With a market capitalization of around $75.5 billion and annual revenues close to $20.8 billion, Abbott Laboratories seems to be coming out of the shadows of its complicated acquisition in 2017. I believe this company is considerably undervalued as compared to its peers and hence a solid buy opportunity for investors. In this article, I will explain my thesis for favoring Abbott Laboratories as investment option in 2017 in greater detail.Abbott Laboratories is banking on core laboratory and point of care segments as major drivers for future growthWhile molecular diagnostics has been on a slow growth trend due to planned scale down of the company in all testing areas except in infectious diseases, both core laboratory and point of care diagnostics have been witnessing a robust rise in demand. With the launch of new Alinity instruments for immunoassay, clinical chemistry, blood screening and point-of-care, this trend will definitely continue in 2017. In late 2017, Abbott Laboratories plans to launch alinity instruments for hematology and molecular diagnostics in Europe, while the same are scheduled to enter USA in 2018. This may prove to be a much needed boost to the company's molecular diagnostics segment in future years.St.Jude Medical has catapulted Abbott Laboratories to a leadership position in medical devices segmentAnnounced on April 28, 2016, Abbott Laboratories' acquisition of St.Jude Medical is seen as a fast track way for the combined company to reach a leading position in every area of the $30 billion worth cardiovascular market. The acquisition has added to both Abbott's existing portfolio as well as research pipeline and can make the combined company a dominant medical device player in other three areas such as vision care, neuro-modulation, and diabetes care. The deal is also set to strengthen Abbott laboratories position in medical devices segment in 100 countries in the world. Including revenue expansion opportunities as well as cost benefits, acquisition of St.Jude is expected to result in pre-tax synergies close to $500 million by year 2020.While synergies of the Abbott - St.Jude Medical deal are fairly obvious, the main question is about the timelines by which they will be materialized.In April 2017, Abbott Laboratories was issued a warning letter with reference to faulty devices manufactured by St.Jude Medical at its Sylmar facility. While FDA has currently continued with the review of a new MRI compatible implantable cardioverter-defibrillator or ICD manufactured at this site, it definitely increases uncertainty related to the device's approval.Abbott Laboratories considers this problem to be manageable. The company believes that its expertise in GMP may help satisfactorily address FDA's concerns.Despite reduced acquisition price, uncertainty related to Alere business continues to haunt Abbott LaboratoriesAlere has definitely added a robust point-of-care testing portfolio, a very attractive segment in the in vitro diagnostics segment, in Abbott's kitty.However, till date, Alere has caused loads of buyer's remorse to Abbott Laboratories. Since the announcement of the deal on February 01, 2016, things took a very ugly turn. In its 1Q 2016 earnings conference, Abbott first lamented about Alere failing to publish its 10-K results for the previous year. The situation continued in 2Q 2016 and was only remedied in 3Q 2016.In March 2016, U.S. Department of Justice or DOJ issued a grand jury subpoena to Alere, questioning the company about its sales practices Asia, Latin America, Africa, as well as certain matters that fell in the ambit of U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.In July 2016, Alere received another subpoena from U.S. DOJ, this time, seeking records for the company's Medicare, Medicaid and Tricare billings related to patients tested at company's Austin, Texas pain management laboratory, all the way back to year 2010. Further, there were also some permanent device recalls for Alere due to faulty results.November 2016 bought in more bad news. Alere lost Medicare reimbursement status for the diabetes division of its subsidiary, Arriva Medical, on charges that it had claimed compensation for 211 deceased people.Abbott Laboratories considered these adverse developments to be material and sought to terminate the purchase agreement by offering penalty of around $30 million to $50 million. Alere, however, refused to budge and continued with its claim that Abbott should complete this transaction. Hence, in 2016, both the companies were locked in a legal battle over this issue.However, on April 14, 2017, both companies amended their original acquisition agreement and hence conclusively ended the litigation. While the new acquisition price has been reduced by around $500 million to $5.3 billion, it does not imply that problems with Alere have vanished.Abbott will still have to bear the brunt of litigations, investigations, and product recalls related to Alere. These problems will definitely affect the combined company's profitability, at least in the short term.Despite regulatory uncertainty in China, Abbott Laboratories is confident of regaining growth for its nutritional segment beyond 2018.Multiple competitors and subsequent oversupply in pediatric nutrition segment in China has been a major emerging market challenge for Abbott Laboratories since 2016. However, with new food safety laws expected to be implemented by end of 2017, Abbott is confident of recapturing its market share due to flexible and extensive supply chain and manufacturing network. The company has also realized importance of digital distribution channels and is making a conscious effort to shift to them from traditional modern sales channel, historically considered to be the company's strong area.I consider Abbott Laboratories to be an undervalued assetAbbott Laboratories is currently trading at EV/Sales LTM multiple of around 4.07x, slightly lower than the median multiple which is around 4.13x. The forecasted average three year revenue growth rate for the peer group is around 4.0% and the median EBIT margin is 23.1%. Abbott Laboratories is expected to grow its revenues at 12.0% in the next three years on CAGR basis and has a forecasted three year average EBIT margin of around 22.0%.If we run a regression with forecasted EBIT margins on independent axis and EV/Sales LTM on dependent axis, Abbott Laboratories' risk adjusted EV/Sales multiple comes to be around 4.04x. However, if the regression line is shifted to the right to account for the company's much higher than average forecasted revenue growth rate, the EV/Sales multiple needs to be in the range of 4.4x to 4.5x. Based on these values, Abbott Laboratories' risk adjusted market capitalization comes to around $ 86.8 billion to $89.0 billion. The number of outstanding shares forAbbott Laboratories is around 1.73 billion. Hence, the company's risk-adjusted target share price should be in the range of $50.1 to $51.5, which will be a return over current share price of around 14.6% to 17.7%. Hence, retail investors can consider adding this stock to their portfolio in 2017."
4070818,102916,2017-05-08T18:10:19-04:00,"ABT is not able to sustain its dividend growth rate at the current payout ratio.This suggests a modest overvaluation of 5%.However, none of these is relevant since the dividend is very safe and a higher payout ratio seems likely.A payout ratio of 71.3% suggests a modest 7%.","IntroductionAbbott Laboratories' (NYSE:ABT) average dividend growth of the last five years was 1.9%, and the average payout ratio was 57.2%. However, ABT will not be able to sustain its dividend growth rate of 1.9% and its payout ratio of 57.2% in the upcoming years. This suggests that ABT has a modest downside potential of 5%. However, the stock has a modest upside potential of 7% if ABT were to up its payout ratio to 71.3%. In other words, ABT is roughly fairly valued based on its dividend stream. This is good news for dividend investors since it means that capital depreciation is unlikely. I will demonstrate this by presenting historical data, zooming in on the growth forecasts, by extrapolating where needed, and finally, I will use all the data and decide with a DDM-model whether the dividend streams are under- or overvalued.Historical dataThe average dividend growth was calculated by summing up the dividend growth rates of the last five years, followed by dividing them by five. The same was done for the payout ratio.The chart above shows the dividend growth and payout ratio for the last five years. Although the dividend growth is very volatile throughout the years, the payout ratio shows a minor upward trend. This means that ABT is actually allocating more of its FCF to its shareholders. The average dividend growth between 2012 and 2016 was 1.9%, and the average payout ratio was 57.2%. A dividend growth rate of 1.9% is fairly low and sounds sustainable at first, but we have to dig deeper to figure out whether this is true.Dividend flows The table above shows the dividend growth at a rate of 1.9% and the FCF needed at a 57.2% payout ratio for the next nine years. When looking at the table and the historical free cash flows, one would think that this is sustainable. Now, we have to figure out whether this could be realistic. Therefore, we have to look at the historical revenues, and zoom in on the growth outlook.Some important growth forecasts from management which can be read in the 4Q2016 transcript:""For established pharmaceuticals, we forecast high single digit operational sales growth for the full year 2017 with balanced above-market growth across our key emerging markets, and we forecast low to mid-single digit growth for the first quarter."" - CFO Brian YoorNo outlook is given for the Vascular and for ""other"" income, therefore the growth of 2016 will be extrapolated for those revenue generators. By using the growth outlook from management and extrapolating where needed, we get the following the table:I chose the lowest growth outlook possible in the given brackets to create the most conservative outlook. This means that the possible upside potential for the stock is somewhat suppressed by my conservative approach. The FCF yield is based on the FCF yield of 2017. If the segments keep growing at growth rates that are similar to that of 2017, the FCF will be enough to sustain the dividend at a growth rate of 1.9% and a payout ratio of 57.2%.Theorizing about future payout ratiosIt's always good to make a few different scenarios about the future, since no one knows what will happen. Therefore, I will use two scenarios.A) Payout ratio stays at 57.2%B) Payout ratio will be changed to 71.30%A)A payout ratio of 57.2% means that the company will not be able to grow its dividends at a rate of 1.9% per year. This is because the estimated payout ratio in 2017 is already higher, namely 71.30%, than the payout ratio of 57.2%. By using a DDM-model, we can figure out whether the dividend streams are overvalued in this scenario. The final year 9 uses a 2% growth rate, as to keep up with historical inflation.According to scenario 1, there is a 5% downside potential, which means that the dividend streams are slightly overvalued in this scenario. Most investors apparently do not agree with this since the current stock price is obviously in disagreement with this assessment. This implies that they expect a higher payout ratio in the future or that they expect the company to generate more free cash flow. More free cash flow generation is likely, since I used the lowest growth rates possible relative to management's guidance. Lastly, a higher payout ratio is not so strange if we look at the historical payout ratios of ABT.B)A payout ratio of 71.3% is enough to support nine more years of a 1.9% CAGR (compounded annual growth rate). This means that the dividend streams are undervalued. The upside is roughly 7% at this payout ratio.ConclusionAlthough I used the most conservative outlook in my calculations, there is still some upside potential for this stock. The dividend stream appears to be slightly undervalued. Keep in mind that I used conservative growth rates, which might have suppressed a more generous upside potential. All in all, ABT seems to be a solid dividend payer.Sources: All images are from my excel sheet and the data used in the sheets are sourced from the SEC filings."
4063113,21877,2017-04-18T13:48:30-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has brought down the cost of its acquisition of the diagnostics maker Alere (NYSE:ALR), but some might say that it is still overpaying. First announced at a price of $56 per share for a total value of around $5.8bn, the deal will now go ahead at $51 per share, or $5.3bn.This marginal reduction in the financial outlay comes despite Abbott's seemingly strong case that a material adverse change had occurred in Alere's long-term prospects, following missteps including missed reporting deadlines, two separate US Department of Justice investigations and a market withdrawal of one of its technologies amid accuracy concerns. Abbott must now focus on making this deal work - or strengthening its operations in other areas to compensate.Abbott's efforts to extricate itself from a deal that looked increasingly poor culminated with a lawsuit against Alere being filed late last year. The list of disasters and disappointments associated with Alere at that point was already pretty long (Can Abbott kill the Alere deal?, December 8, 2016).What now?Abbott must now make the best of the situation in which it finds itself. But it is beset by other woes which mean it probably cannot look to its cardiovascular business - the only other unit larger than diagnostics - for rescue. Last week the company withdrew its Absorb dissolving stent from market in Europe, with the exception of post-marketing registries (Abbott's troubled Absorb stymied in Europe, April 10, 2017). And its other recent acquisition, that of cardiovascular device maker St. Jude Medical (NYSE:STJ), has also brought trouble.Last week the FDA sent a letter to Abbott stating that St. Jude had sold defibrillators knowing that the type of battery used in them could in some cases be drained rapidly, before recalling the defibrillators last autumn. St. Jude did not inform its own management or a medical advisory board that the battery problems had led to the death of a patient.The devices are the Fortify, Unify and Assura defibrillators, manufactured at a plant in Sylmar, California, which the FDA inspected in February. In the same letter, the FDA also warned of cybersecurity risks with the Merlin@home software, used in a monitor also made at the Sylmar plant.Abbott responded to the FDA's criticisms in March, but the FDA has found the response to be insufficient. It has given Abbott 15 working days to implement further fixes; if the group does not address the FDA's concerns fully this time it could be liable to seizure, injunction, and civil money penalties, the agency said.Perhaps Abbott can find respite in its other segments, diabetic care, neurology and ophthalmics. But these are much smaller than cardiovascular or diagnostics, and it would take significant investment for them to have a marked effect on Abbott's bottom line. Considering how its last two major deals have gone, growing these units through M&A could be considered a risky strategy."
4062710,52612,2017-04-24T05:14:09-04:00,"Abbott has aligned its business growth with long-term healthcare trends, including selling branded generic pharmaceuticals in developing countries and bolstering its cardiovascular medical device business for the aging population.Abbott's acquisition of St. Jude Medical both strengthens its long-term outlook in the cardiovascular medical device market and has an immediate, positive effect on its stock.Investors can expect Abbott to continue to use acquisitions, divestments or spin-offs for reorganizing its various business segments to adapt to changing market conditions and ensure steady and continuous growth.","Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is at its business best when it comes to testing the healthcare environment and reinventing itself for changing times. Through acquisitions, divestments and spin-offs, the company has recently made many business adjustments to align its growth with long-term healthcare trends such as increased healthcare demand from the aging population, improving healthcare access in emerging economies and managing increasingly prevalent chronic diseases.Abbott Labs is keeping its focus where it belongs, from cardiovascular medical devices for older generations to branded generic pharmaceuticals in fast-growing economies and innovative testing and monitoring devices with data-decision software for diabetes management. As a result, the company is well positioned to deliver continuous wining performance with reliable sales growth.One such realignment is its $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical, a leader in the market for cardiovascular medical devices with complementary product lines to those of Abbott Labs. The deal can have a lasting impact on Abbott Lab's sales and earnings because of their combined ability to provide complete offerings in cardiovascular medical devices for the aging population. The transaction is expected to be accretive to Abbott Labs' earnings in the first full year after its close on Jan. 4, 2017, positive on Abbott Labs' stock price.Let's first take a look at how Abbott Labs stock is valued before and since the acquisition. As of Dec. 31, 2016, prior to the completion of the acquisition, Abbott Labs had total shareholders' equity of $20,538 million and 1,473 million shares outstanding, or $13.94 in book equity per share. The stock closed at $39.05 on Jan. 3, 2017, the day before the announcement of the completion of the acquisition. So at that time, the market valued Abbott Labs stock at a price-to-book ratio of 2.8 ($39.05/$13.94).Now, let's figure out the total shareholders' equity and the number of shares outstanding for the combined Abbott Labs and St. Jude Medical (Abbott Labs paid for the acquisition partially with its stock). Since Abbott Labs has yet to release its Q1' 2017 financial results, we can derive those figures based on publicly available information on the financial term of the acquisition, which shows Abbott Labs paid $46.75 in cash and 0.8708 Abbott Labs shares for each St. Jude Medical share. We'll also use the financial results last released by St. Jude Medical for its Q3' 2016, ended on Oct. 1, 2016, which reported the company had total shareholders' equity of $4,486 million and 283.45 million shares outstanding.Total shareholders' equity for the combined Abbott Labs and St. Jude Medical is presented in the table below:*$46.75/share x 238.45 million St. Jude Medical sharesThe combined total number of shares outstanding for Abbott Labs post acquisition is shown in the table below:*0.8708 new Abbott shares x 283.45 (St. Jude Medical shares)Therefore, the estimated book equity per share after the acquisition can be computed as: $13,876.45 million/1,719.83 million shares = $8.07.Since the acquisition completed on Jan. 4, 2017, Abbott Labs stock has been trading up and reached its 52-week high of $45.72 on Mar. 10, 2017. As of Mar. 31, 2017 when research for this article was being conducted, the stock traded at $44.41, which implies a price-to-book ratio of 5.5 ($44.41/$8.07) by the market, almost doubling the P/B ratio for Abbott Labs stock before the acquisition. With additional earnings from deal synergies and cross-selling expected to be accretive within the first year following the completion of the acquisition, Abbott Labs can see an immediate bump to its equity book value per share. This will support its stock to go higher for the rest of 2017, assuming also the use of the 5.5 P/B ratio.Now, we'll forecast 2017 earnings for both St. Jude Medical and Abbott Labs using a logarithm-modified straight-line model, expressed as Y = a*X + b, where Y is the earnings, X is the corresponding year, a is the slope of the line graph and b is the line's intercept on the Y axis.Estimates of 2017 earnings for St.Jude Medical:*2009 to 2011 earnings**2012 to 2015 earnings(1) (880 - 777)/(2015 - 2009)(2) 777 - 17.1667 x 2009(3) 17.1667 x 2017 + (-33,710.9)(4) (2.944 - 2.890)/(2015 - 2009)(5) 2.890 - 0.009 x 2009(6) 0.009 x 2017 + (-15.19)(7) 10^2.963Estimates of 2017 earnings for Abbott Labs:*2009 to 2011 earnings**2012 to 2016 earnings(1) (1400 - 5746)/(2016 - 2009)(2) 5746 - (-620.857)*2009(3) -620.857*2017 + 1,253,048(4) (3.146 - 3.759)/(2016 - 2009)(5) 3.759 - (-0.0876*2009)(6) -0.0876*2017 + 179.75(7) 10^3.06Estimates of 2017 total earnings and EPS for the combined Abbott Labs and St.Jude Medical:[1] $918 million/1,719.83 million shares[2] $1,148 million/1,719.83 million shares[3] EPS accretion from the acquisition expected to be $0.21 in 2017[4] $0.21/share x 1,719.83 million sharesApplying the 5.5 P/B valuation multiple, an additional $1.41 in book equity per share in 2017 would add $7.76 ($1.41 x 5.5) to Abbott Labs' stock price by the end of 2017. In other words, the target price for Abbott Labs stock at the end of 2017 is set to be $47.12 ($39.36 + $7.76), an increase of $7.76 from where the stock was on Jan. 4, 2017. This would amount to an annual gain of 19.7% ($7.76/$39.36), or a smaller rise of 3% from the stock's 52-week high of $45.72.Relying on P/B ratio alone may not know whether the market valuation really reflects a stock's fair value. However, if supported by return on equity, especially when compared with those of a company's closest peers, the P/B ratio can be a reasonable value indicator. Return on equity directly adds to a company's equity book value, and the market is likely to value a stock more if the business has a better ability to generate return on equity. Thus, the more a company's return on equity is, the higher its stock's P/B ratio should be, and vice versa.Now, we'll determine if Abbott Labs' 5.5 P/B ratio is a reasonably fair valuation multiple by comparing it with those of its peers in connection with each company's respective return on equity. All relevant data are presented in the table below:Notes below to financial measures concerning applicable dates apply to all companies but Abbott Labs whose analysis assumes the post-acquisition stance as illustrated throughout the article.* stock price is as of April 11, 2017.** book value/share is as of Dec. 31, 2016.*** earnings are for 2016.**** book value is as of Dec. 31, 2016.[1] $9,550 million/375 million shares[2] $5,778 million/39 million shares[3] $6,733 million/1,362 million shares[4] $52,063 million/1,399 million shares[5] $9,669 million/201 million sharesAll five companies used for the purpose of valuation comparison are Abbott Labs' top competitors with a market capitalization of at least $20 billion. We don't want to compare apples and oranges and render anything that may be incommensurable. As the data in the table above show, return on equity for Abbott Labs and its peers ranges from 3.2% to 17.5% and P/B ratio varies between 2.2 and 5.5. There's clearly a strong positive correlation between a company's return on equity and its stock's P/B ratio.Abbott Labs has the largest return on equity of 17.5% and also the highest P/B ratio of 5.5. This is followed, as it should be, by Stryker Corp.(NYSE:SYK) and Intuitive Surgical Inc.(NASDAQ:ISRG) with also a double-digit return on equity and a P/B ratio just above 5. Another two companies, Medtronic Plc (NYSE:MDT) and Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.(NYSE:ZBH), with a much smaller, single-digit return on equity, understandably have a relatively lower P/B ratio of 2.2 and 2.5, respectively.One exception is with Boston Scientific Corp.(NYSE:BSX), which has a higher P/B ratio of 5 on a comparably smaller return on equity of 5.2%. This, however, could indicate an overvaluation for Boston Scientific, considering how its peers are valued based on the merit of their return on equity. By the same token, given the relative level of Abbott Labs' return on equity, a 5.5 P/B valuation multiple is provably reasonable for its stock.The downside risk, however, does exist. The earnings situation could be less optimal than the forecasts a year from now, potentially coupled with no earnings accretion from St. Jude Medical to Abbott Labs in 2017. This would negatively affect the company's return on equity and consequently, its stock's P/B ratio might revert back to the level of 2.8 as seen before the acquisition.Abbott Labs' debt situation is another cause of concern for a potential bear case. Abbott Labs saw its total debt level balloon into $21.6 billion as of Dec. 31, 2016 from $8.6 billion a year earlier, mostly as a result of funding its St. Jude Medical acquisition. Following the deal completion, Abbott Labs also assumed the debt from St. Jude Medical, which had $5.4 billion in long-term debt as of Oct. 1, 2016. Between debt increase and equity dilution, Abbott Labs now has a debt/equity ratio of 1.9, the highest by a mile among its main peers and comparing to the industry as a whole. The heavy debt load will no doubt limit Abbott Labs' financial flexibility, impeding capital allocations and even dividend payments.The good news is that the business of Abbott Labs is not one trick pony, and the company has made strategic moves in other areas of its operations. For example, Abbott Labs has refocused its pharmaceuticals by spinning off its research-based specialty biopharmaceuticals as a new company named AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) in January 2013, while retaining the branded generic pharmaceuticals to form its established pharmaceuticals business segment. The separation saves Abbott Labs $2 to $3 billion annually on research and development, while allowing the company to zero in on selling cost-effective branded generic pharmaceuticals, especially in developing countries where the need to improve healthcare access is much greater.In fact, in February 2015, Abbott Labs sold its developed markets branded generic pharmaceuticals business to Mylan N.V., and in exchange received 110 million Mylan's ordinary shares, but has since unloaded more than one-third of the shares. To double down on its emerging market focus, Abbott Labs in 2014 spent $2.9 billion in cash to acquire CFR Pharmaceuticals S.A., a Latin American pharmaceutical company, further expanding its geographic coverage to ensure a steady growth in selling branded generic pharmaceuticals in emerging markets. Its established, or branded generic, pharmaceuticals is now the fastest growing segment among all Abbott Labs' business.On the front of its traditional diagnostics device business, Abbott Labs remains a leader in molecular testing and automation, point-of-care testing solutions and a broad range of blood-testing instruments. On that ground, its proposed $5.8 billion acquisition of Alere Inc. (NYSE:ALR), another leader in point-of-care diagnostics, may matter less and doesn't seem to be as critical as its acquisition of St. Jude Medical whose cardiovascular device business makes up for Abbott Labs' missing pieces in that area. Abbott Labs has actually decided to terminate the Alere deal by filing a lawsuit upon learning about a series of the company's damaging business developments.The bottom line is that Abbott Labs doesn't need such a relatively small deal to strengthen its leadership position in the diagnostics market. Escaping the merger with Alere should elicit positive market reactions for Abbott Labs, as not spending $5.8 billion would definitely help preserve its cash positions. Abbott Labs had only $3.2 billion cash flow from operations in 2016 and to fund its $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical, it increased its long-term debt borrowing from $2.4 billion in 2015 to $14.9 billion in 2016. Saving any cash is a relief at this point, but the outcome of the lawsuit won't be known until after the trial starts in April.A relatively slow growing business for Abbott Labs is its nutritional products segment. Total annual net sales of nutritionals registered a mere 0.3% increase in 2015, while sales of its established pharmaceuticals jumped by 19.3% the same year. For anyone who doesn't know, Abbott Labs used to have a division dedicated to vision and eye health, called Abbott Medical Optics/AMO, but that business is now part of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Barely growing, Abbott Labs' nutrition business is clearly in the mature stage and could end up in a similar for-sale situation as the company's former vision care business. However, this is not to say that its nutritional products segment has no good value.To the contrary, even as a mature business, Abbott Labs' nutritional products command a large sales base, about one-third of the company's total sales. If Abbott Labs ever decides to sell the nutrition business, the chance of its receiving an optimal valuation can't be underestimated. Getting out of the mature business would be a reasonable move and play right into Abbott Labs' wining strategies of taking transformative actions whenever a changing market condition calls for.At present time, by focusing on branded generic pharmaceuticals in emerging markets, strengthening its medical device business in cardiovascular care for the aging population and delving into diabetes testing and monitoring services with digital applications, Abbott Labs is reassuring investors that it's creating new ways to help ensure steady and continuous growth."
4064937,102677,2017-04-25T11:15:54-04:00,"Abbott Labs first quarter report last week beat consensus estimates on EPS and revenue.Medical Devices segment skyrocketed over 100% year-over-year, thanks to a smart acquisition.FDA approvals last year and in this quarter should continue to grow the Device segment going forward, offsetting other weaknesses.","Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) reported first quarter results last Wednesday and topped consensus estimates while providing some mostly predictable segment information. Pediatric Nutritional sales remain weak overseas, while the recent acquisition of device-maker St. Jude Medical made the Medical Devices segment look like it is skyrocketing on a comparable basis.What were the other data to watch, and how did that data compare to the expected results?(Image Source: Company Slides)Abbott Beats Consensus on EPS, RevenueConsensus estimates for Abbott's first quarter report include $0.43 EPS and $6.15 billion in revenue. Abbott reported $6.3 billion in revenue, up nearly 30% yoy, and $0.48 EPS. The dual beats continue the company's EPS streak, which met or exceeded estimates all last year, and improves the revenue performance, which beat in all quarters but the fourth where there was a narrow miss.Abbott had issued first quarter guidance for diluted EPS from continuing operations under GAAP of $0.19 to $0.21 and reported as slightly higher $0.22. Ignoring specified amortization and integration expenses related to the fourth quarter acquisition of St. Jude Medical, the EPS guidance was $0.42 to $0.44, which the company beat by $0.04.Key Segment PerformanceAbbott's business divides into four key segments with the following first quarter results:(Financial Images: Company 8-K)What went into those segment results?NutritionSegment weakness continued to come from the Pediatric Nutrition division particularly the international performance. Reported international sales were down over 12% while operational sales were down nearly 11%. Pediatric's weakness particularly in China was offset a bit by better performances domestically thanks to the recent launches of new infant products.Adult Nutrition had the opposite problem with sales dropping domestically but rising internationally thanks in part to a growing market in Latin America.DiagnosticsThe Core Laboratory division had gained new products through the fourth quarter acquisition of CE Mark, developer of the Alinity systems that include blood and plasma screeners, clinical chemistry, and immunoassay diagnostics. The first quarter report according showed a 3% growth in reported sales and 4.3% operational growth.Point of Care had a similar enhancement with the i-STAT handheld testing system launching and marketing. The division increased 7.5% in the quarter in both reported and operational sales.Molecular Diagnostics was expected to shrink as Abbott continued to reduce the genetics business in favor of infectious disease testing and other more lucrative projects. The division still reported a 3.9% sales increase in both reported and operational though that increase would've been higher without the continuing scale down.Established PharmaceuticalsEstablished Pharmaceuticals, the branded generics division, continued to show strength in the Key Emerging Markets, which contains BRIC: Brazil, India, Russia, and China. BRIC showed a sales growth of 15.2% reported and 12.5% operational.The overall segment was drug down by Venezuela, which was stuffed in the Other category but the first quarter was to be the last for sales in that region. The ceasing of Venezuela sales during the quarter made for a lopsided comparison to the prior year's quarter. Abbott noted that excluding Venezuela from the narrative would have lifted the overall segment sales to 13% reported and nearly 12% operational.Medical DevicesThe Medical Devices segment showed a whopping 100.2% reported sales increase but the comparable operational increase was a more modest 4.5%. The change was largely related to the recent acquisition of St. Jude Medical, which brought along a few notable, top-selling devices.The key products from St. Jude included Ensite Precision, a cardiac mapping system with sales filed under the Electrophysiology division, and two products for the Structural Heart division: MitraClip, a treatment for mitral regurgitation and Portico, aortic valve disease device.The Diabetes segment also predictably grew due to last year's FDA approval of the Freestyle Libre blood glucose testing system. Diabetes Care sales increased 20.2% on a reported basis, and nearly 23% on an operational basis. Note that the diabetes division also benefitted from comparing to a particularly weak prior year's quarter.Final ThoughtsThere weren't any stunning revelations in the first quarter report as far as comparisons to the prior year's quarter. The continued weakness of the Pediatric Nutrition division is concerning. St. Jude Medical will continue to look like a wise acquisition and pushed the Medical Devices year-over-year comparisons through the roof, while the Diabetes division represented more organic comparable growth.Moving forward, Abbott placed the 2017 guidance at $2.40 to $2.50 adjusted, which is unchanged from the previous guidance. The first-quarter FDA approvals for MRI-Conditional labeling for the Assurity MRI pacemaker and Tendril MRI pacing lead and the submissions for similar approval for three other products should continue to drive that Medical Devices segment enough to offset any weaknesses in other areas."
4061630,102165,2017-04-11T06:30:06-04:00,Delaware Court set to hear arguments on April 21st.ABT arguing for a MAC with ALR and hoping to walk away from deal.ALR believes that ABT has been withholding information that will disprove its MAC claim.,"ALR | ABT - Moment of Truth ApproachingI wrote about the Alere (NYSE:ALR) - Abbott (NYSE:ABT) merger back in September 2016. Since then there have been a number of developments which have added further complexity to this situation. To summarize, the following are events that occurred since September 2016 (in no particular order):In short, it has been an epic mess and a headache to all involved, including the Delaware Chancery Court.So where do we stand now?ALR is trading at ~$43.00 which is implying a ~43% implied probability (assuming a closing price of $56 and a break price of $33). I think this implied probability under current terms looks a little low, given the evidence and precedent ALR has heading into the trial date. So why isn't ALR trading higher - implying a more favorable probability of success?Most likely, the market is assuming a price cut. At a recut offer from ABT of $50, the implied probability sits at ~60%, which seems much more in line with all the incremental evidence we have picked up from countless hours of discovery and court transcripts. As such, these are the potential outcomes for ALR as we approach the April 21st court date.ALR-ABT settle out of court and renegotiated price - ALR = $50 (50%) ALR wins in court and the merger is enforced - ALR = $56 (35%) ABT successfully proves a MAC and walks - ALR = $33 (15%)Taking the probability weighted average of these outcomes gets you ~$49.50. Risk / Reward still seems somewhat acceptable.So, with that basic math out of the way, let's turn to likely topics of discussion once the trial kicks off.ALR's Argument:ALR feels it has a strong contract that the Delaware Court should have to enforce. ALR will argue that ABT is exhibiting buyer's remorse and feels hard done as it rushed through due diligence and even outbid itself (as documented in the background to the merger in the proxy). Assuming no settlement before the trial, ALR believes that $56 is achievable and will do whatever is necessary to get the Delaware Court to force ABT to consummate the merger - most likely will be awarding ""Specific Performance.""What has complicated matters is the revocation of Arriva's Medicare billing code and the recent failure to publish its 10-K on time. Had ALR been able to secure a more favorable outcome from its CMS/HHS/ Medicare lawsuit, I believe that ABT's MAC claims would have been severely diminished.ALR was unable to successfully appeal to the DC Court for a preliminary injunction and has since begun the process of working through the appeals ""ladder"" with CMS/Medicare. Given the timing and length of the appeals process, any positive news from this endeavor is highly unlikely.The late filing is an issue and while it does not breach any terms in the DMA - as the language only refers to having 2015 filings in on time - it offers growing evidence that the corporate governance and financial reporting at ALR is a complete and utter mess.Furthermore, ALR's IR reps have been very vague with regards to whether the delay in the 10-K filing will result in a ""revision"" or a ""restatement"" - the latter the worse alternative. With the failure to file the 10-K on March 15, 2017, ALR entered a grace period with its creditors (45-60 days depending on the indenture).The late filing also creates uncertainty with regards to the potential downside on a deal break. Without the filings, there are several large Long Only investors who are loathe to holding ALR despite whatever optical ""cheapness."" We know that Arriva was ~5% of revenues and ~5-8% of EBITDA - most sell-side and buy-side investors have adjusted earnings estimates to assign zero value to Arriva. While this is good, there is also a chance that Arriva could actually have negative value, given the impact of continuing to service clients will have on working capital (A/R will continue to build) without being able to bill Medicare. Given the leverage (~6.5x Net Debt / EBITDA on consensus 2018 numbers), equity value is very sensitive here and material fluctuations in the NWC figure could create some headline noise.Assuming no material change in business from the Arriva noise, ALR has clearly underperformed its index (XHE) and should find some valuation support. Assuming ALR were to have moved in line with the index over the past 12 months, ALR would be at ~$64.00.In addition, to the Arriva and late filing, ALR also contends that ABT's claims that it was unaware of material deficiencies at ALR are untrue. ALR contends that ABT is withholding information shared with its lawyers during its initial due diligence which shows that ABT was well aware of the subpoenas, FCPA investigation, and Arriva situation. This development - unveiled on April 3, 2017, from a hearing on March 31, 2017 - caused the ALR stock to trade up ~10% as many market participants viewed this as a huge boon to ALR. This thinking was tempered the next day as ABT's claims to the contrary and defending its right to ""client- attorney privilege"" were also unveiled.Basically, ALR is arguing that ABT cannot use ""Client-Attorney Privilege"" as both a sword and a shield; and that the information requested (and supported by Special Master Chandler) will prove that ABT was aware of the issues it now claims are a MAC.Naturally, ABT is arguing the other side - that ALR's contractual representations, ALRs' pre and post signing SEC disclosures, the documents exchanged in discovery, and every one of ALR's witnesses confirm that none of the adverse events that have occurred at ALR since January 30, 2016, were ""known"" as of that date. Rather, all these issues came to light post-signing.What is ABT thinking?It's hard to know exactly what ABT's end game is here. To simplify, it just doesn't want to buy ALR given all the hair/issues and that it still needs to fully integrate STJ and keep the leverage in the capital structure relatively copacetic. As such, ABT is trying to argue the following to walk away from the deal:In aggregate, ABT argues that these issues could / should qualify as a MAC. ALR is saying that ABT was aware of most (if not all) of these issues and ABT's due diligence notes will confirm that.Summing it all up $56 seems achievableOn April 21, 2017, Delaware Chancery Court will hear ABT's request for a ruling that all of ALR's slip-ups constitute a MAC. Should the court deny ABT's MAC claim, it is very likely that Glasscock will award ALR ""Specific Performance"" as a remedy to effectuate the merger.However, it is a foregone conclusion that ALR will receive this requested remedy. While it's like ALR will get this remedy (much like Tyson v. IBP), there is no rule written in stone which allows for this type of relief - something to keep in mind.In March, Glasscock told both parties that reaching an agreement would be the best outcome - and that going to court would be akin to a ""maelstrom"" wherein everyone would be unhappy with the outcome. Glasscock does not want to be the first judge to rule on a MAC claim - in my opinion, his experiences with Cooper Tire have scarred him and he is keen to avoid the limelight on such a landmark issue. Moreover, Delaware has a reputation to defend as a target friendly jurisdiction - there will be considerable pressure on Glasscock to avoid setting a precedent with this case.Essentially, Glasscock does not want to rule on a MAC. But does he really want to force ABT to buy ALR, given all the issues over the past year?If push comes to shove, he might just try to find the path of least resistance to avoid forcing ABT to buy ALR - allowing ABT to walk on a technical issue; of which there are plenty.It would be extremely helpful for ALR to get its financials in order and have the 10-K ready before the trial begins. But given ALR's track record over the past year and history of shooting itself in the foot repeatedly, I will hold my breath. During this period as an ALR shareholder, I have often noodled on whether chewing glass and hitting myself repeatedly with a hammer would be more palatable than being an ALR shareholder.Since March, many investors have thought that ABT was the side averse to settling. But reviewing the court docs from last week, perhaps it has been ALR that didn't want to all along - why would it? The contract is strong, Arriva's contribution to EBITDA and Revenue is below the 10% ""soft"" threshold for ""materiality"" and taking a materially lower offer would likely draw scrutiny from shareholders and some legal/fiduciary recourse. Does Glasscock really want to go down in the annals of Delaware law?Consequently, I believe that ABT is likely to fail in its efforts for a MAC and that, assuming no major hiccups from ALR between now and the trial, the merger will be enforced at the originally agreed $56 price. Risk/Reward looks attractive, but as always, do your own due diligence and size appropriately."
4062516,102677,2017-04-14T17:45:32-04:00,"Abbott Labs wil report first quarter results pre-market on Wednesday.Abbott had a year full of acquisitions and FDA approvals that could create first quarter segment growth.Watch out for weakness in Pediatric Nutrition, which took down the segment in the fourth quarter.","Healthcare company Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) will report first quarter earnings pre-market on Wednesday, April 19. Abbott had a busy 2016 and start to 2017 that included a few FDA approvals, the acquisition of CE Mark and St. Jude Medical, and last week's announced its Alere acquisition that will settle a mess of complicated legal matters between the two companies. (Image Source: Company Slides)But what should investors watch out for in the first quarter report?Consensus Estimates and GuidanceConsensus estimates for Abbott's first quarter report include $0.43 EPS and $6.15 billion in revenue. Abbott met or exceeded EPS estimates for all four quarters last year and did the same for revenue in all but the fourth quarter, where the reported $5.33 billion came in just under the $5.38 billion consensus.Abbott issued first quarter guidance for diluted EPS from continuing operations under GAAP of $0.19 to $0.21. Ignoring specified amortization and integration expenses related to the fourth quarter acquisition of St. Jude Medical, the EPS guidance was $0.42 to $0.44.Key Segments and Products to WatchAbbott's business divides into four key segments:NutritionThe Nutrition segment breaks down further into the Pediatric and Adult divisions. Pediatric Nutrition's key products include Pediasure, a toddler nutritional product, and several infant formulas. Adult Nutrition is led by supplemental nutrition drink Ensure.(1Q16 Financial Tables Source: Company 8K)(4Q16 Financial Tables Source: Company 8K)In the fourth quarter, total Nutrition was -3.7% Y/Y on a reported basis and -2.6% on an operational basis. The total was dragged down by Pediatric, which was -5.4% reported thanks to a 13.1% drop in international sales. Adult Nutrition was down a comparatively meager 1.4%.The first quarter report will compare to the first quarter of 2016 pictured above. Check first for Pediatric international performance and see if the fourth quarter weakness is continuing.DiagnosticsDiagnostics breaks down into Core Laboratory, Molecular, and Point of Care. Core Laboratory gained some new products through Abbott's fourth quarter acquisition of CE Mark, which brought in Alinity core laboratory systems including blood and plasma screening, clinical chemistry, and immunoassay diagnostics.Molecular Diagnostics is experiencing a planned reduction in the genetics business to focus on more lucrative arms like infectious disease testing.Point of Care was growth driven in the fourth quarter as Abbott continued to launch and market the i-STAT handheld testing system, which the CE Mark acquisition bolsters.Established PharmaceuticalsEstablished Pharmaceuticals has a much simpler segment breakdown: Key Emerging Markets and Other.The Established Pharmaceuticals segment covers the company's stable of branded generics (not an oxymoron) that are marketed overseas. Products include Synthroid for thyroid issues and cholesterol treatment Tricor. Key markets include Brazil, Russia, India, and China. India alone accounted for 20% of the segment sales in last year's quarter so a slip or growth there could have an outsized impact.Medical DevicesMedical Devices contains Vascular, Diabetes Care, and Medical Optics. Vascular sales are driven by MitraClip, a first-in-class treatment for mitral regurgitation, a malfunction of the miral valve that allows blood to flow backwards.Endovascular is driven by Supera, a type of stent for leg blockages. Diabetes is driven by a series of blood glucose testing systems including the newer Freestyle Libre Pro system that received FDA approval last fall and operates without testing strips, which tend to be a major expense for patients. Medical Optics should show growth due to the recent domestic launch of TECNIS Symfony, a first-in-class intraocular lens for post-cataract surgery vision issues that only received FDA approval last summer.Diabetes Care in particular could benefit from both the FDA approval and the fairly weak prior year's quarter.Final ThoughtsExpect Abbott to at least meet if not exceed consensus estimates. Here's a quick reminder of what to look for in the segments:Check back for my post-earnings results comparison."
4069669,101378,2017-05-05T10:53:50-04:00,The Alere deal was put back in the fold with plenty of work to do.Abbott's shiny St. Jude acquisition hit a speed bump in the form of an FDA facility warning letter.China continues to challenge and beckon.All's well that ends well. The end is nigh — and should be high.,"Abbott (NYSE:ABT) recently reported Q1, 2017 earnings. It started off the new year with a bang. It managed a revenue beat of $190M and an EPS beat of $0.05. These were better than any performance it has managed to muster in the last several years. Bowing to its conservative bent, Abbott was loathe to raise its guidance so early in the year.Its earnings conference call was unusually informative. I am anticipating an excellent year for Abbott.The Alere deal was put back in the fold, with plenty of work to do.When Abbott's star-crossed Alere acquisition was first announced back on February 1, 2016, it carried a rich 51% premium to Alere's pre-deal price. The premium raised eyebrows at the time, but it was a relatively minor deal and Abbott was enthusiastic over its prospects.Alere kept showing up with problems that caused Abbott to start questioning the deal as early as April 2016. Ultimately, Abbott sued to cancel the deal on December 7, 2016. Shortly thereafter on April 14, 2017, the parties announced a settlement with Abbott getting a ~10% discount off the initial deal price.In his CC opening remarks, CEO White briefly mentioned the settlement, pointing out that it would enhance Abbott's position in its diagnostics division. He characterized it as enhancing Abbott's reach in the growth area of point of care diagnostics.The first question in the Q&A asked how the numbers for the Alere deal would look compared to those presented when the deal was originally announced. CEO White talked all around this, memorably characterizing the deal as a ""bit of a fixer upper"". As he warmed up to the subject he pointed to how much he liked the point of care diagnostics business and how the settlement had been a fair one. He finally acknowledged:Realizing that was not entirely satisfactory he affirmed that he would likely give some types of figures in terms of guidance, but that it would be in a range and he was not prepared to do so today.Additional Alere questions elicited little additional information, except when CEO White confirmed that Abbott still had a path to achieving its target ratio of 3.5 times debt to EBITDA by 2018.Abbott's shiny St. Jude acquisition hit a speed bump in the form of an FDA facility warning letter.The Alere deal has presented challenges. Investors have taken solace in the notion that Abbott has recently closed on a much bigger deal. The St. Jude deal moved through the required pre-closing processes in an orderly fashion and without undue drama. As such, it stood in stark contrast to Alere.Abbott shareholders received a jolt on April 13, 2017, when the news hit of an FDA warning letter directed to procedural deficiencies at St. Jude's Sylmar, California plant where it produced implantable heart devices.A Barron's blog reporting the problem estimated it could take 9-12 months to clear it up. It cautioned that the issue raised the following three potential challenges for Abbott going forward:It further noted Abbott's upcoming earnings CC and suggested more would come out during the call as indeed it has. Sure enough, the next question after the one on Alere asked about the warning letter.CEO White advised that Abbott was aware of GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) issues at the site before closing. Abbott had been working with St. Jude and had had a fair amount of dialogue with the FDA on the subject. He averred that Abbott was disappointed with the letter but was fully committed to addressing the issues raised.He indicated that Abbott was fully mobilized to resolve the issues. The resources of the entire company were on call, not just for the Sylmar facility, but all sites, to assure that Abbott fully understands its situation. He noted that Abbott had a ""very strong"" GMP track record with the FDA.The length of time to resolve the issue would depend on the effectiveness of the response and CEO White vouched for the quality of the teams responding. He noted that the FDA continued to evaluate Abbott's other new submissions. He was unwilling to speculate as to whether there would be any other impact. For the time being, Abbott is maintaining its timetables for new product launch dates and approval dates.A second CC warning letter question focused on a plant in Plano Texas, that has had FDA issues in the past. CEO White gave no color on any issues with the Plano plant. Instead, he reaffirmed Abbott's policy of top to bottom review of GMP at all its plants when any one becomes subject to FDA focus. He noted that this was an important reason accounting for Abbott's overall positive GMP record with the FDA.China continues to challenge and beckon.In recent years Abbott's nutrition business, its second largest by revenue, has faced China problems. China accounts for ~10% of Abbott's nutrition sales. In April 2016, reports surfaced of cheap milk powder being repackaged and sold under Abbott's name in China.This type of scandal over which Abbott has little control is especially bitter following so closely on the heels of Abbott's 2014 efforts to expand its dairy facilities in China. China is trying to come to terms with such issues and others. This has resulted in a new regulatory thrust that is a work in process and is roiling the market for all suppliers into China's huge domestic market for infant milk products, including Abbott.For several quarters Abbott's nutrition business has lagged. In Q1, 2017, CEO White reported as follows:China's new rules will become final towards the end of 2017. In the interim, suppliers of infant formula are having to adjust their processes and inventories so that they will be fully compliant.My read of the situation is that Abbott lacks confidence as to the state of the Chinese market during this interim period, when all suppliers are having to adjust and, in some cases, liquidate inventories at reduced prices.However, Abbott is supremely confident that once matters settle, its ""supply chain and product portfolio"", as stated by CEO White, assure that it will come through the process in tip-top shape. Thus, I expect nutrition head winds from China for the balance of this year. The tougher the market becomes the more likely Abbott, with its vast resources and experience, will excel as 2017 gives way to 2018.All's well that ends well. The end is nigh - and should be high.Abbott is a thoroughbred with impeccable credentials. Its performance the last few years has been mediocre. It has refused to rest on its laurels. In addition to its ongoing development programs, Abbott has brought in the St. Jude deal and is in the process of reeling in the Alere deal. These deals have been sucking up a lot of oxygen.Now they are on the verge of moving to a new stage. Over the next several years, Abbott will be solidifying itself as a pre-eminent source of medical devices. Abbott's European diabetes care devices grew by 29% led by its new glucose monitoring system, FreeStyle Libre. The consumer version of this system is awaiting FDA approval in the US.Abbott's pipeline information on its website lists hundreds of active clinical trials as represented by its graphic below together withhundreds more that have either been completed or for some reason were terminated or suspended. It is well worth a visit by any one who seeks confirmation of the continuing vitality of Abbott's ongoing research and development efforts.An SA news item yesterday alerted to a new Abbott initiative towards nutritional supplements prior to, the day of, and the time following surgery. This is a genius idea. It plays both to the growing body of evidence that nutrition is an important factor in positive surgical outcomes and to the growth in surgical procedures. It certainly shows that Abbott is live to opportunity and quick to innovate when the chance arises.Below, I have set out Abbott's F.A.S.T. Graphs chart for the six years following its split from AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). Abbott appears as steady performer even though it has not performed up to its full potential. It faced headwinds of various types through the bulk of this period.Over the remainder of 2017, I expect the power of the St. Jude deal to boost quarterly results. Then by 2018, Alere should also be closed; its operations will start to show improvements as Abbott's management experience and abilities are brought to bear on Alere's recent slipshod performance.ConclusionI touted Abbott as a stock to watch back in early January. I noted that it had been trading in a tight range from ~$38 to ~$45. At the time of this January article it was trading towards the bottom of this range.In the interim, it traded up above $45 for a short period and fell back. Now it is trading again towards the top of this range. For me it will be difficult to add more until there is a pullback. I am going to be watching with a view to adding additional shares when and if it trades back towards the middle of its range."
4061541,21877,2017-04-10T15:10:17-04:00,,"Taking its bioresorbable drug-eluting stent Absorb off the commercial market in Europe after the alarming adverse event rates seen in a recent trial could seem like a damaging move by Abbott (NYSE:ABT), but the company is unlikely to take too great a hit - at least initially.The lion's share of the lost Absorb sales will be picked up by Abbott's other drug-eluting stent, Xience, insulating the company from the commercial disappointment. But Absorb was a means of extending Abbott's domination of the drug-eluting stent segment - Xience brings in nearly $1bn a year - and it is not clear how the group will eventually replace the device.Starting in June, Absorb will only be available in Europe for patients enrolled in clinical registries assessing its long-term performance. This is in response to data from the US approval trial, Absorb III, showing rates of events including heart attack and thrombosis at two years, high enough to prompt the US FDA to issue a warning (Snippet roundup, March 24, 2017).Preliminary data from a 1,845-patient European trial, Aida, also showed a significantly higher rate of thrombosis than Xience at two years. Aida was halted early on safety concerns.Absorb was approved in the US last July based on one-year data from Absorb III - at that time point the event rates were acceptable. The FDA's letter did not recommend pulling the product off the market, and Absorb remains on sale in the US.Reviewing the situationNot so in Europe. A letter Abbott sent to doctors last month says Absorb will be restricted to registries until next summer, at which point ""the situation will be reviewed"". Until then no further Absorb devices will be provided to non-registry sites, which were instructed to cease implantation and return any spare devices they had.And so Absorb sales will slump. EvaluateMedtech's consensus forecasts from mid-March suggested that Absorb sales were to grow from $247m in 2016 to $657m in 2022. Wells Fargo, which even before the two-year Absorb III data and FDA warning pitched more conservative revenue forecasts for Absorb ($115m in 2017 rising to $123m in 2021) said sales would now ""significantly decline"".The good news for Abbott is that it will catch most of the dropped sales with Xience, which elutes the same drug as Absorb and is safer and cheaper. The bad news is that, for precisely these same reasons, the case for using Absorb has been badly damaged if not entirely demolished.Scientific opinion seems to have swung against bioresorbable technology, with an editorial in the NEJM accompanying the Aida results stating that ""there is little rationale to use bioresorbable vascular scaffolds at this time"".For now Xience remains king, but the crunch will come eventually, if only when the patents covering the stent's design, drug coating and polymer expire. According to EvaluateMedtech consensus dating from before the recent ructions, Xience sales were set to slide 8% per year, from $975m in 2016 to $605m in 2022.With things as they are these will not slide so fast, but they will slide. Absorb was intended to make up the shortfall, and Abbott now has no obvious means of compensating."
4045056,89805,2017-02-11T01:46:22-05:00,,"When it comes to dividend growth stocks there are few better choices than the legendary dividend aristocrats, S&P 500 companies which have raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.Investors can read analysis on all of the dividend aristocrats here.Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a dividend aristocrat with a long track record of paying dividends dating back to 1924. The company has also raised its dividend for over 40 consecutive years.Let's take a closer look at this medical conglomerate to see just what makes it so special.With Abbott's stock down more than 15% since its high in 2015, find out if Abbott is reasonably priced today for long-term dividend growth investors.Business DescriptionFounded in 1888 in Abbott Park, Illinois, Abbott Labs is one of the world's largest medical companies. Abbott spun off its research-based pharmaceuticals business AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) in January 2013 and has four main business units today:Nutritional Products (34% of sales): Pediatric and adult nutritional formula such as Similac and EnsureMedical Devices (25%): Devices to treat structural heart issues, such as stents, pacemakers, implantable defibrillators, and products to monitor blood glucose levels.Diagnostic Products (23%): chemical systems to diagnose: cancer, drug abuse, cardiac diseases, fertility issues, infectious diseases, therapeutic drug monitoring, as well as instruments to automate and test DNA and RNA.Established Pharmaceuticals (18%): branded generic drugs to treat a wide variety of conditions including: pain, fever, inflammation, migraines, dyslipidemia (high cholesterol), gynecological disorders, pancreatic insufficiency (diabetes), and hypertension (high blood pressure).Abbott's revenues are widely diversified across segments, and the company sells more than 10,000 different products. This creates very stable and predictable cash flow, far more secure than standalone drug makers such as Pfizer (NYSE:PFE).In addition to product diversification Abbott's business is truly global, with 69% of sales coming from outside the U.S. and providing good access to faster growth opportunities overseas (close to 50% of Abbott's sales come from emerging markets).Business AnalysisAll of Abbott's businesses have some unique competitive advantages. Roughly 50% of the company's total sales are made directly to consumers. These products primarily reside in the Abbott's adult and pediatric nutrition segment and its branded generic drugs.These businesses operate more like consumer packaged goods companies than traditional healthcare businesses in some ways. They benefit from Abbott's decades' worth of marketing spending to build up brand recognition, the company's extensive investments in R&D to understand consumer preferences, and Abbott's deep distribution relationships that help the company maintain prime shelf space where its products are sold.With over a century of operational history, Abbott has acquired and reinforced dominant market share positions in many areas. Abbott is the world's number one player in adult nutrition and is the U.S. leader in pediatric nutrition. The company's 50 consumer nutrition brands are number one or number two in 25 countries.Within branded generics, Abbott is number one in India, Russia, and several other Latin American countries. Abbott's moat in this business is driven in part by the company operating in largely oligopolistic business segments. There are generally just three or four major players it must compete with in most markets, reducing pricing pressure.In fact, Abbott's generic drugs business is 100% focused in overseas markets. Since many of these markets have very weak distribution networks, the company has a big advantage courtesy of its strong relationships with local pharmacies and physicians.Abbott's strong brand recognition allows it to generate healthy margins, and because none of its drugs are patented, it doesn't face patent expiration risk and the kind of ferocious competition that is a major concern for most patented drug makers.The company's medical devices and diagnostics businesses are a bit more challenging to maintain because they require heavier R&D investments to adapt to the industry's faster pace of change. However, Abbott has still managed to hold leading market share in numerous key categories, such as LASIK, blood screening, cataract surgery, and amino-acid diagnostics.New entrants have a hard time challenging Abbott because of the high amount of government regulation in these markets (e.g. pharmaceuticals, medical devices), the steep investment costs needed to develop competitive products (Abbott invests 6-7% of its revenue in R&D), the need for global distribution networks, and the protection provided by patents and trademarks.Through organic reinvestment or bolt-on acquisitions, Abbott can quickly adapt to changing healthcare trends to remain relevant, plugging new products into its extensive distribution network.Despite the company's competitive advantages, however, you might think that Abbott has a major growth problem. Sales, operating margin, and free cash flow per share are all below where they were five years ago.Source: Simply Safe DividendsSource: Simply Safe DividendsSource: Simply Safe DividendsHowever, the apparent decline in sales, earnings, and margins are in fact a byproduct of the company's 2013 spinoff of its patented pharmaceutical division into AbbVie.That, plus the strong rise in the dollar since 2014, has resulted in slower growth than before the spinoff. However, excluding currency effects, each of the company's business units managed to put up reasonable growth in 2016.In addition, the company has done an excellent job leveraging its large size and global ingredient sourcing to generate strong economies of scale, resulting in steadily improving margins across its most important segments.Nutrition Products Operating MarginDiagnostic Products Operating MarginFrom 2013 through 2016, Abbott's overall gross and operating margins increased from 53.2% to 56.9% and from 10.8% to 14.7%, respectively.In fact, thanks to its quality management team, led by CEO Miles White who has been with Abbott for 33 years, ongoing efficiency gains and cost cutting (from streamlining distribution channels and lower cost manufacturing plants) have helped Abbott generate above average margins and returns on capital (adjusted for the St. Jude acquisition).Sources: Morningstar, Earnings ReleaseOver time, analysts expect further margin improvement with operating margins approaching 19.4% by 2019, according to Morningstar. Part of that will be from the $500 million in St. Jude cost synergies that management thinks it can achieve over the next three years.Beyond profitability improvements, Abbott's growth runway appears very long, courtesy of the rapid aging of the global population.Source: Abbott Labs Investor PresentationIn addition, its strong presence in the world's fastest growing economies, where healthcare spending remains far below the world norm, means that its diversified business lines should generate steady growth for decades.Despite Abbott's numerous attractive qualities, income investors need to be aware of several risks.Key RisksLike all medical companies, Abbott Labs faces a few key risks.First of all, while it operates as one of the big four medical device makers (Stryker, Medtronic, and Johnson & Johnson), which limits competition and helps boost margins, each of its competitors is well capitalized and has an excellent track record of innovation over time.In other words, if a rival comes out with a revolutionary new device it can win market share very quickly and force Abbott to go back to the drawing boards to improve its own product offerings.Due to concerns over rising costs, there is also risk that healthcare providers will move to multi-line contracts, meaning bulk purchases of medical equipment that their patients need.Since Abbott's medical prowess is mainly in cardiac and diabetes equipment, this could give it a competitive disadvantage. Even the St. Jude acquisition won't help offset this risk much because that purchase was mainly designed to strengthen its cardiac device business (although it did add neuromodulation for pain control as well).Finally, Abbott's big bet on strong growth in emerging markets is predicated on two assumptions. First, that economic growth in these countries will bounce back from the recent slump, and that their currencies will rebound.Currently the slowdown in China's economy (largely due to unsustainable debt levels) has triggered a crash in commodities that has greatly impacted Latin American growth rates.With U.S. GDP growth relatively healthy and interest rates on the rise, the dollar has strengthened to a 15-year high. That means that when Abbott converts local currency into dollars for earnings (and dividend payment) purposes, much of the growth benefit from its overseas businesses gets offset.In fact, in 2016 the strong dollar ended up offsetting 2.6%, or 54%, of the company's total sales growth. Eventually the dollar should return to lower, historic levels. However, that might not occur for several more years, resulting in ongoing growth headwinds.Finally, in terms of company-specific risks, be aware that Abbott Labs is currently embroiled in a messy legal battle with Alere, a diagnostics device maker it had previously agreed to buy for $5.8 billion ($8.4 billion including debt assumption) prior to striking the deal to acquire St. Jude Medical.That deal has turned into a bit of a nightmare, with Alere failing to file financial statements, having to recall a major product because it doesn't work, and losing Medicare reimbursement.Abbott has spent months trying to back out of the deal. However, if the courts end up forcing the deal to be completed, it could mean harm to Abbott's balance sheet.In fact, on the assumption that the deal is completed S&P recently downgraded Abbott's credit rating from A+ to BBB.In addition to financial risk, large acquisitions such as St. Jude Medical and Alere create execution risk. They represent major capital allocation bets, and management's strategic rationale needs to be right.Overall, many of Abbott's key risks are balanced out thanks to the company's cash flow diversification and numerous opportunities for long-term growth (i.e. the company isn't overly dependent on any one thing to go right).Each of Abbott's four unique segments has different risks and growth opportunities, and the company's geographical diversification reduces overall regulatory risk in any given market as well.Dividend Safety Analysis: Abbott LaboratoriesWe analyze 25+ years of dividend data and 10+ years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend.Our Dividend Safety Score answers the question, ""Is the current dividend payment safe?"" We look at some of the most important financial factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios, debt levels, free cash flow generation, industry cyclicality, ROIC trends, and more.Dividend Safety Scores range from 0 to 100, and conservative dividend investors should stick with firms that score at least 60. Since tracking the data, companies cutting their dividends had an average Dividend Safety Score below 20 at the time of their dividend reduction announcements.Abbott Labs has a Dividend Safety Score of 89, indicating its dividend is very safe and dependable. When it comes to dividends Abbott Labs is a legend, with 93 years of uninterrupted dividend payments to its name.If you adjust for the spinoff of AbbVie, then Abbott Labs, with 45 consecutive years of dividend growth, is not just a dividend aristocrat, but just five years away from becoming a dividend king.Abbott's impressive payout growth track record and safe dividend are due to two main factors.First, the company has historically maintained very conservative EPS and FCF payout ratios, meaning plenty of extra cash to cushion its dividend in bad times. Note that recently the FCF payout ratio has risen to unusual levels due to acquisition-related charges associated with the St. Jude acquisition.Source: Simply Safe DividendsSource: Simply Safe DividendsBased on 2017 earnings estimates, Abbott's projected EPS payout ratio for the year sits at a very healthy 40%. This level provides plenty of flexibility and is especially safe considering the recession-resistant nature of many of Abbott's products.The second big protective factor is the strong balance sheet, even with the uncertainty over the Alere situation continuing.Specifically, Abbott's strong current ratio, low leverage ratio, and high interest coverage ratio mean that Abbott has no trouble servicing its debt or short-term liabilities, even if it ends up forced to pay full price for Alere.Source: Simply Safe DividendsThat's thanks to Abbott having a lower than average debt levels ahead of the ultimate Alere legal outcome. Thus, even if Abbott ends up losing the case, its balance sheet would wind up no worse than the industry average, and it would maintain its investment grade credit rating.Sources: Morningstar, FastgraphsIn other words, Abbott would still have strong access to relatively cheap debt, thus allowing it the financial flexibility to continue growing its business without threatening its payout.Thanks to the company's low payout ratio, solid balance sheet, and dependable cash flow generation, Abbott's dividend should remain very safe for many years to come.Dividend Growth AnalysisOur Dividend Growth Score answers the question, ""How fast is the dividend likely to grow?"" It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth-centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios. Scores of 50 are average, 75 or higher is very good, and 25 or lower is considered weak.Abbott Labs has a Dividend Growth Score of 62, indicating that investors can expect better than average (median S&P 500 dividend growth over the last 20 years is 5.9%) income growth.Abbott's quarterly dividend grew by 8.3% in 2016 and has increased from 14 cents per share in 2013 (immediately following the spinoff of AbbVie) to 27 cents most recently, nearly doubling over the course of three years.With a payout ratio sitting near 40%, Abbott has flexibility to continue raising its dividend even in a challenging environment that temporarily depresses earnings. However, the company's future dividend growth over the course of many years will primarily depend on its long-term earnings and free cash flow growth.Fortunately, even without AbbVie's strong revenue growth, the company should be able to generate long-term sales growth of 4%, courtesy of successful product launches and the continued rise of healthcare spending in developing countries.Analysts project long-term EPS growth close to 11% per year, which could be a bit overly optimistic (very few companies ever achieve long-term double-digit EPS growth).However, ongoing cost cutting and margin growth, as well as steady buybacks, could certainly result in long-term EPS growth of 8-9%, with dividend growth achieving similar levels.ValuationAbbott trades at a forward P/E multiple of 17.3 (roughly in line with the S&P 500's forward P/E multiple) and offers a dividend yield of 2.5%, which is in line with the stock's five-year average dividend yield of 2.5%.With earnings expected to grow at a high-single digits rate over time, Abbott's valuation appears to be reasonable and offers 10-12% annual total return potential (2.5% dividend yield plus 8-9% annual earnings growth), assuming earnings growth forecasts are correct.However, there are a lot of moving parts to Abbott's investment story today that will undoubtedly impact the company's future.From uncertainty with Alere (will Abbott be able to terminate the $5.8 billion deal?) to the recent closed deal to acquire St. Jude Medical, Abbott has made some major capital allocation bets that will take time to play out.Since I already have a full position in Abbott, the stock doesn't appear to be a bargain today, and I prefer to see some of the dust settle with the company's big acquisitions, I'm not looking to add.Closing Thoughts on Abbott LaboratoriesWhile Abbott Labs is currently facing some major growth headwinds, overall the company has proven itself to be one of the best long-term blue chip dividend growth stocks you can own.After all, it's very shareholder-friendly corporate culture, improving profitability, and highly diversified business model is well suited to taking advantage of some of the next century's largest economic mega-trends (especially in emerging markets).While the stock looks reasonably priced for long-term dividend growth investors, management needs to deliver meaningful value from Abbott's recent acquisition of St. Jude Medical. For now, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and remain a long-term shareholder, doing my best to follow the best habits of highly effective dividend investors."
4037082,25228,2017-01-16T13:22:31-05:00,"Abbott Labs has put together an impressive dividend history.
        However, the most recent increase was seen by some as lackluster.
        This article talks about the psychology of this notion and shows you how you could boost that cash flow component if you so desired.","If you look back Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has put together an enviable dividend track record. I'll provide some context to demonstrate what I mean.The company has declared 372 consecutive quarterly dividends - dating back to 1924. Not only that, Abbott Labs has not only paid but also increased this dividend for 45 straight years.And the increases have not been unsubstantial. Going back to 2006, Abbott increased its payout by 7%, 10%, 11%, 11% 10%, 9% and 6% in the years leading up to the AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) spin-off. During that time, despite already increasing its dividend for three decades, Abbott was growing its dividend by an average compound rate north of 9% per annum.After the spin-off the payout was re-based, making the 57% increase in 2014 less relevant. In 2015 the per share dividend was increased by 9% and in 2016 Abbott made an 8% higher payout. You could say that shareholders got used to mid-to-high single digit payout growth year-after-year.So this year's increase - a rise from $0.26 per quarter to $0.265 or ""just"" a 1.9% boost - may seem a bit off-putting. Indeed, this is the lowest increase that you could find going back 25 years. It's still an increase, but it certainly differs from what many have come to expect.As a result, some shareholders were disgruntled. Sort of like when an employee becomes used to a certain raise each year and ""only"" gets a 2% boost. It's still an increase, but it falls short of expectations. I'd like to point out three notions here.For one thing, a fixation on income - especially when we're talking a couple of cents worth of difference - probably won't be the most important part of the investment story. It's still an increase and continues a long and storied payout streak. Much more important to the future of the business (and indeed to the future payouts) is going to be how the underlying profit machine develops in the years to come.Second, this shouldn't have been much of a surprise. Back in April of 2016, when Abbott announced the St. Jude acquisition, slide 4 of the presentation indicated that Abbott was committed to its credit rating and would reduce its share repurchase activity and ""moderate the pace of growth of its dividend."" Granted we didn't know exactly what that would mean, but the expectation was in place.In linking to the first idea, the future viability of this acquisition is apt to be much more important than if this year's quarterly payout equates to $0.265 or say $0.27 or $0.28. Indeed, while a smaller increase may not be perceived as good news to income investors, it certainly is for the business. Instead of getting to an uncomfortable debt level, Abbott is working to remain prudent.Finally, suppose someone is bummed enough about the lackluster dividend increase that they are considering selling their stake. Let's think about what would have been an acceptable level of income. You've come to anticipate 7% or 9% increases, so let's stick with that. From $0.26 per quarter, to the nearest cent, that equates to $0.28 or $0.08 on an annual basis. Think about that, someone is out there upset by the difference of collecting $0.08 per share or $8 per 100 shares this year.Granted this compounds over time, but so too can the prudence of Abbott's strategy. The good news is that you don't have to outright sell if you truly wanted to capture that extra tiny bit of income.Here's a look at some available call options for Abbott labs for the January 2018 expiration date:Note that I have no special preference for this expiration date (many prefer shorter time periods) but it does show the annual picture fairly well.The first column indicates the strike price or the price at which you would be agreeing to sell at least 100 shares of Abbott. Next you have the ""net"" premium, which takes the most recent bid less $0.12 per share for frictional expenses.The third column highlights the ""extra"" yield that this would represent (which may be taxed differently than dividends). And the final column highlights the maximum gain - including sale and option proceeds but ignoring potential dividend payments - should the option be exercised.You can see that the last strike price - $55 - relates to our discussion above. If you truly wanted to generate that extra $8 in income per 100 shares you could agree to sell your Abbott shares at a price of $55.Now one of two basic things occur: either the option is exercised or it is not. If the option is not exercised - as would be the case with a price of less than $55 - you continue to hold your Abbott shares, keep receiving dividend payments and also have that $8 in ""extra"" income to boo - you got your accustomed cash flow increase. Granted there is no guarantee you could do this again next year, but for this year you have slightly boosted that income stream.If the option is exercised, your total return will be 34.6% to ~37% depending on if you collect dividend payments along the way. The downside is that shares could go higher, but I'd hardly consider a 35%+ return in the next year as a poor result.Now it should be underscored that I'm not advocating this route. Instead, it's about pointing out that if you are truly disturbed by a few cent dividend increase difference - which could very well work out better in the long-term run anyway - you can do something about it.And this applies for different option agreements as well. You could effectively double your dividend yield by agreeing to ""cap"" your gain at 17% in the next year. Or you could receive an upfront yield close to 7% if you're willing to ""cap"" your gain closer to 9% for the year. The point is that you're not an idle party in this. There are quite literally options available to you if you so desire to boost your income by a little or a lot.In short, Abbott's most recent dividend increase may not be perceived as good news by income investors, but I think there's a lot of important counterpoints. For one thing, it could ultimately prove to be a prudent move for the long-term longevity of the business. For another, this was something to be expected - management told you nine months in advance. And finally, if you're still dissatisfied you have alternatives available to you."
4045121,50452,2017-02-12T04:39:50-05:00,"Abbott Labs is a diversified healthcare giant, with a long history of making investors wealthy.
        The company structure has changed some since it split off AbbVie in 2013, but Abbott's recent acquisition of St. Jude Medical has earnings growth primed for the future.
        Despite healthy earnings growth, and a fantastic dividend track record, shares are trading at attractive values making Abbott Labs worth a look in a stock market at all time highs.
        Stock prices somethings go ""flat"" for extended periods of time. Have no fear, quality company + earnings growth + time = long term wealth.","Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) is a diversified giant among the healthcare industry. With a shining dividend track record, and consistent earnings growth going back decades, investors have profited from extended holding periods. Even though the structure of the company is now different from prior to 2013, the company has set itself up for future growth. This article will examine how it has done so, and why shares are a ""fair deal"" worth holding for the future.There is a famous story about Grace Groner, a secretary of 43 years for Abbott Laboratories. She bought three shares in 1935 for a total of $180 (a little over $3K in today's dollars). She never sold a share, and kept reinvesting dividends. At the time of her passing in 2010, those three shares had grown via splits, dividend reinvestment, and appreciation to over 100K shares, worth more than $7 million. It is one of the greatest real life examples of wealth compounding. While it is fair to call this ""an extreme case"", Abbott Labs has continued to generate returns for investors throughout the decades. An investor who grabbed $10,000 worth of Abbott stock in 1995 would have generated a ""ho-hum"" annual return of over 10% annually by simply reinvesting dividends, and holding.The engine that drives consistent performance like that is two-fold. First, Abbott Labs has been able to consistently grow earnings over time. This directly correlates to the second leg of wealth generation, which is consistently increasing dividends. The below chart captures earnings per share, and dividends per share paid over time up until just before sister company AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV) was spun off in 2013.In fact, Abbott Labs has raised its dividend payout for 45 consecutive years. This is important to know because Abbott's dividend paid per share of ABT was technically reduced when AbbVie was spun off, so Abbott Labs will not show up on standard screens for companies with consecutive dividend increase streaks (i.e. Dividend Champions).With Abbott Labs spinning off its pharmaceutical pipeline as AbbVie, leaving only the ""generics"" brand pharma division, the make up of Abbott Labs changed. The remaining entity consists of four branches - medical devices, established pharmaceuticals (generic brand), diagnostics, and nutrition. However, the ""new look"" Abbott Labs has wasted no time bolstering itself for future earnings growth. Abbott recently closed its enormous $23B deal for St. Jude Medical on January 4th. This deal is an enormous boost to Abbott's medical device business, resulting in a portfolio with strong positions throughout the cardiovascular device market. This market is a high growth area of healthcare, and is continually expanding.source: Smithers ApexAbbott Labs has also moved to boost its diagnostics business with the pending acquisition of diagnostics firm Alere (NYSE: ALR) worth (at the moment) $5.8B. However, the deal has since been mired in controversy with Abbott Labs currently trying to back out of the deal. A summary of these events surrounding the deal can be found here. While European regulators recently approved the deal, there is certainly more to come and anything beyond this would be speculation at this point.Even without factoring in any potential effects of the Alere acquisition, Abbott continues to hum along on a growth curve of high single digit - low double digit EPS growth. Management has given an EPS growth forecast of 11% for 2017 with estimated earnings falling between $2.40 - $2.50 per share, and consensus analyst estimates point to this growth rate holding for the next five years. Abbott's dividend of $1.06 per share is less than half of its 2016 earnings per share of $2.20 resulting in a low pay out ratio, leaving room for future increases - even if earnings growth hits a snag. Some investors may have raised an eyebrow this year when Abbott's dividend increase was a meager 1.9%, however this was prudent by management to keep its finances in check as it digests St. Jude, and potentially Alere. Abbott Labs took out $15B in debt to fund the St. Jude acquisition. I believe that Abbott will get its dividend back to a growth rate in the 9-10% in the near future to match its earnings growth. Look at recent history. In 2013, the year of the AbbVie spinoff, Abbott Labs paid a quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share. In just over four years, that dividend has almost doubled at $0.265 - and will likely complete its lap of the 2013 dividend by reaching $0.28 with this year's increase.Mr. Buffett once said:""It's far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.""I certainly classify Abbott Labs as a wonderful company given its historical record of consistent wealth generation, and future prospects in the lucrative healthcare market. However, even a quality company such as Abbott Labs can disappoint if purchased at too high a valuation (talk to anyone who bought Coca-Cola stock in the late 90s). Fortunately, shares of Abbott Labs look like a ""fair deal"" at today's prices. While not on the clearance rack (what is in today's market?), someone looking to buy and hold will do just fine in the long run paying 19X TTM earnings. Abbott is trading at 17X 2017 earnings, which for a company that is expected to grow earnings (and likely the dividend) at a 9-11% clip through the early 2020s, looks like a bargain next to some other blue chip names out there in a market that is at all time highs.Some investors may be frustrated that the stock price has sat in the low $40s since summer of 2015. It is important to remember that stock prices are not linear. There are often times when prices are stagnant while the earnings continue to grow. Then seemingly out of left field, the share price will ""play catch up"", and appreciate rapidly in a short amount of time. Something similar happened to shares of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) in the mid 2000s. Shares traded in the low $60s, for a few years while earnings continued to grow. Had investors abandoned ship, they would have missed the eventual surge of capital appreciation resulting from shares racing past $100 five years later. With such a long period of ""stagnation"", you wouldn't think it but Johnson & Johnson has compounded annually at a rate of 11.5% (with dividends reinvested), while the market trailed behind at 8.5% over the past two decades. Not bad for what investors at one time probably called ""dead money"".This brings us back to Abbott Labs. A lesson can be taken from Grace Groner, even though she probably found the success she had unintentionally. Investors that latch onto high quality companies with growing earnings and increasing dividends, and hold for long periods of time typically end up doing quite well. Abbott Labs is a highly diversified healthcare conglomerate that after spinning off AbbVie, has boosted its medical device business to continue its long tradition of inflation topping earnings and dividend growth.

4037055,39141,2017-01-16T09:14:39-05:00,"On January 11, Abbott Labs declared a dividend only 2% higher than that of 2016.This deceleration is a consequence of the company's acquisition of St. Jude Medical.I expect accelerated dividend growth in 2018, and perhaps a return to double-digit dividend growth at that time.","If you've been long Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) for multiple years, as I have, then this latest dividend increase doesn't seem like much. Typically, this large medical conglomerate raises its dividend in the first quarter of each year. In each of the last few years, the company has raised that dividend by double digits, or at least high-single digits.This time around, Abbott raised its dividend by only 2%, from 26 cents per quarter to 26.5 cents. This tends to happen to companies; dividend growth can decelerate over time. This is especially so for high dividend growers. Dividend growth investors might be tempted to sell Abbott Labs and look elsewhere, but I don't believe they should do that. This article explains why I believe Abbott Labs remains an excellent choice for dividend growth, even after this year's nominal increase.Well-telegraphed slowdownThis ""deceleration"" of the dividend was, in fact, announced to investors well in advance, and is a result of Abbott's acquisition of St. Jude Medical, the iconic medical device maker, back in the middle of last year. St. Jude had a market cap of $25 billion, and was purchased for a hefty premium of 41%. The cash portion of this acquisition was paid for in new debt, and the end result was that Abbott Labs was downgraded to Baa3 by Moody's.For exactly this reason, Abbott decided to ""decelerate"" its dividend growth. In my previous article on Abbott Laboratories, back on June 29th, I predicted that Abbott would moderate its dividend growth until 2018. So far so good. Whether Abbott Labs re-accelerates its dividend depends a great deal on how well the company executes on this acquisition and how well St. Jude Medical's device business does going forward.I continue to have confidence in pro forma Abbott Laboratories. The St. Jude acquisition, while quite expensive, adds a valuable array of medical device assets, with a particularly strong position in cardiovascular devices and neuromodulation patient care devices. St. Jude has quite a few upcoming devices in both of these fields. I believe that this will drive growth in Abbott Labs for some time.What to expect going forwardWe don't yet know the exact effects of this landmark acquisition, but I think we will have a lot more clarity once the company comes out with its 2017 guidance later this month. However, Abbott does have the following revenue expectations for the fourth quarter of 2016, which could be something of an analogue for next year: Mid-single digit growth in diagnostics, high-single digit growth from generic pharmaceuticals, mid single-digit growth from diagnostics, roughly flat revenue from nutrition, and varying levels of growth for its devices business, including double-digit growth from the diabetes care business.For what it's worth, analysts appear to be expecting double-digit EPS growth in 2017, which will likely be propelled by St. Jude's devices portfolio, but also by a new suite of instruments that Abbott has developed on its own, as well as some growth from branded generic pharmaceuticals. I'm quite happy with double-digit EPS growth, and I strongly believe that it will lead to double-digit dividend growth in 2018. Investors will have to wait another year for that. Patience is a virtue. In the meantime, Abbott Labs is a solid business to own.Is Abbott Laboratories a buy?Courtesy of Google Finance.I've owned Abbott Labs for about half a decade now, but I admit that I haven't added shares in a while. According to data from FAST Graphs, Abbott has averaged a P/E ratio of 16.8 times over the last ten years. Right now, Abbott trades at 18.5 times operating earnings, a slight premium. I think Abbott continues to be a good growth name, well positioned for a steady increase in medical spending worldwide. However, there are better places to put money into at this time.I would consider buying Abbott Laboratories if the dividend yield came out to 3% or greater. At this dividend payment, that would mean a share price of $35.33, with a price to earnings of approximately 16 times.To conclude, investors should not at all be discouraged by Abbott Labs' slower dividend growth in 2017. This slower dividend growth came about due to a major, transformative acquisition. I believe that we will see dividend growth more akin to what investors are used to in 2018 and beyond.If you're interested in Abbott Labs, feel free to follow me on Seeking Alpha. I am personally long this stock, and will continue writing update articles when doing so is both material and relevant."
4045470,101378,2017-02-13T15:08:02-05:00,Abbott is now >4 years into its current major restructuring.The arrangement has not been kind to Abbott up to this point in time.2017 is Abbott's turn in the limelight.,"IntroductionThe first comment to my inaugural article for 2017 in which I touted Abbott's (NYSE:ABT) as a stock ripe for accumulation at its then current price of $38.41 was somewhat unflattering. It suggested the pick was ""low risk"" and ""boring"". I was glad to see the ""low risk"", but ""boring""... that burned a bit at first look.In a rising market, such as we have at this instant in time, boring is well - boring. In this article, I will show how Abbott has climbed on to a new peg of stability making it even safer and less exciting. This should be a positive not a negative. If the market starts to fall off from record highs, boring and low risk will become rarefied and sought after features.Plus, Abbott's management has revealed in its earnings report that it is actively pursuing strategies that will make it exciting in a conventional fashion. It is pursuing new and expanded market opportunities from a favorable base as a top performer in its devices segment, particularly as relates to cardiovascular, diabetes care and neuromodulation devices.It is working to enhance growth in its nutrition segment; and plans to leave its regulatory induced inventory woes in the Chinese market in the rear view mirror for 2017. The nagging woes of the Venezuela debacle are clearing up. Aside from its earnings report we know that it is pursuing litigation which would allow it to shake the unfortunate Alere situation.Abbott is now >4 years into its current major restructuring.Abbott's big makeover began on January 1, 2013 when it split from AbbVie. The motivating idea behind the split was to separate the higher risk pharma from the remainder of the business. According to Abbott's CFO, Abbott's businesses had:The arrangement has not been kind to Abbott up to this point in time.Abbott, the boring bit, as we know it today retained the ""nutrional, medical device and branded generics businesses"". It also retained its previous corporate name and the architect of the deal, Miles White, Abbott's irrepressible CEO.The high risk, high dividend portion of the business took on the name AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). It was headed by another long time Abbott veteran, Richard Gonzales.The comparative chart of Abbott's share price since the split presents an awful picture. The chart below compares price action of Abbott, AbbVie and two ETFs over this period.ABT data by YChartsSo far no matter how you slice it, It seems that Mr. White's selection of Abbott, in blue on the chart, was a dud. The Abbott piece of the puzzle is underperforming the Biotechnology ETF, its severed brother AbbVie and pitifully, the S&P 500 ETF.Ouch! Mr. White what is going on here?2017 is Abbott's turn in the limelight.Abbott's CEO can't help but recognize how poorly Abbott shows up in comparisons such as shown in the chart above. No problem, it takes time to build out a vision. Five years is ample time. This is the fifth year.This is the year for Abbott to put up or shut up. Judging by CEO White's major recent stock purchases, and Abbott's most recent earnings call, he is expecting it to do just that. While the stock market is generously priced in other names, there are not too many laggards having the quality and potential that Abbott presents.When seen from that perspective, Abbott's dismal comparative price chart shown above presents more of an opportunity than an indictment.During Abbott's Q4, 2016 earnings call Q&A, Kristen Stewart an analyst with Deutsche Bank, asked a question which must be front of mind for Abbott watchers. Politely pointing out that Abbott has now been at its reshaping project for several years, she asked what the plans were for the next several years. She wanted to know if more reshaping or divestitures were in prospect. She also asked for a big picture view of Abbott over the next few years?CEO White gave this question his full attention. He started by setting Abbott's actions over the previous four years into context. He noted how the AbbVie separation left Abbott with considerable cleanup both in terms of administrative issues and structural ones.Perhaps the best way to sum up the end result is set out on Abbott's single-slide slide deck which it presented with its earnings report. On this slide Abbott encapsulates its current business model and latest operational results as set out below:This slide describes a cohesive set of attractive business segments which are growing at sustainable rates which Abbott confirmed with its guidance. Abbott's fine tuning to get to this point allows it to present four carefully sculpted business segments which CEO White promotes as:Keeping the Alere debacle in mind, which has yet to play out, it is encouraging to know that Abbott's mixing and matching days are drawing to a close.RisksAbbott's prospects are rosy, they are not without risk. It is at a stage where execution is critical. The St. Jude's acquisition opens exciting possibilities. It also brings potential liabilities.St. Jude has had execution issues which have lead to scary headines in connection with battery issues in its heart devices. It has had to issue software updates to allay security issues in its pacemakers. As recently as this month Abbott announced that an issue with one of St. Jude's promising heart catheter devices has lead it to issue recall notices on several hundred of the devices.As one of America's preeminent multinationals Abbott is at risk for slowdowns in global growth be they trade related or otherwise.ConclusionAbbott has a unique suite of businesses which its CEO has assembled over his lengthy and distinguished career. These are the ones that he has selected and shaped to best maneuver in the world's current challenging environment.Abbott's businesses are ones which satisfy basic human needs. Abbott has painstakingly built these up over long years and across broad geographies. They are not subject to being easily overturned by competitors. As such they constitute classic wide moat operations.Safe, I hope so. I believe that its management will carry it through execution risks in its St. Jude unit and such other speedbumps as 2017 has in store. Boring, well perhaps quality investments are more important as a source of income and security than as a source of entertainment.In the introduction I highlighted certain of Abbott's initiatives which management expects to kickstart near term growth; these present the prospect that Abbott will open an exciting chapter in its restructuring saga. After four painstaking years of restructuring 2017 is set to be the year when Abbott reaps the benefits of its strategies."
4033864,101378,2017-01-03T03:57:24-05:00,"After a year of challenges and ambivalence for Abbott, January 2017 presents a time of interstitial clarity.Abbott's deals are coming into sharper focus with St. Jude set to close on January 4 and Alere now in litigation.While the market generally appears fully priced, Abbott just raised its dividend and is trading close to its 52-week low.CEO White reportedly invested ~$5 million in November at a price per share higher than its current price.","IntroductionI have been conflicted over Abbott (NYSE:ABT). Back when it announced its St. Jude (NYSE:STJ) deal, close on the heels of its Alere (NYSE:ALR) deal announcement, I questioned whether it was still an attractive holding.For the reasons I set out in this article, I now regard Abbott as both a steady reliable holding and also as a stock that is ripe for accumulation at its current price.Abbott's deals are coming into sharper focus with St. Jude set to close on January 4 and Alere now in litigation.Abbott announced its intention to acquire St. Jude Medical on 4/28/2016. After spending the better part of a year acquiring regulatory approvals to consummate the deal, Abbott was recently able to get Chinese approval, EU approval and US antitrust approval for it to acquire St. Jude.As a condition to these approvals, Abbott had to agree to two heart device divestitures. In its initial presentation touting the advantages of the deal, Abbott included the following slide setting out its prospective dominance in heart devices upon conclusion of the deal.Antitrust regulators apparently concluded that two of the areas where the combination resulted in number 1 ranking market position were too much, so they required a limited set of divestitures. According to a Reuters report announcing the approval:This still leaves Abbott in a powerful position in the cardiovascular device market. A recent Forbes article following the approval points to the importance of scale for companies seeking to serve this market as follows:A recent SA article by Khen Elazar compares these three companies. He states that while of the three Abbott is his largest position, he would not add to it at its current price. He acknowledges that Abbott has multiple attractions but finds several demerits, most notably the star-crossed Alere deal and strong dollar headwinds, which dim his current interest in the stock.I agree with Elazar that both deserve focused attention. On the Alere matter I have discussed it in some detail in prior articles, most recently and in most detail here.There is no clarity as to the ultimate resolution of this deal. However, I do not see any realistic prospect that its actual resolution will be any more damaging to Abbott than its nebula is currently. In other words, I do not currently downgrade Abbott's mid- to long-term value based on the Alere matter.To the contrary, I see a likelihood that this deal will fade in importance now that the St. Jude deal is about to close and Alere's issues are in litigation. If I am correct in my assessment that Alere will lose its negative pungency as the positive synergies of the St. Jude deal start taking shape, then this should serve as a positive catalyst for the company.As for the strong dollar, that is a longstanding concern for many US companies. I do not regard the strong dollar as a reason to avoid investing in any US multinationals, particularly those with a proven management team and a diverse portfolio of attractive products. I consider Abbott as having an extremely capable management and likewise a diverse portfolio of attractive products.While the market generally appears fully priced, Abbott just raised its dividend and is trading close to its 52-week low.Investors are in something of a quandary at the current time as we venture into 2017. The market seems fully priced, yet there are few, if any, attractive alternatives. Accordingly, I am trying to pick through to find the least bad alternatives.Abbott has been trading in a relatively tight range over the last year from a high of ~$45 to a low of ~$38. It closed out the year towards the low endABT data by YChartsof its range at $38.41.Abbott has long been a favorite of dividend investors. When the financial world was cracking all around it during the 2009 financial crisis, Abbott stood tall. It increased its quarterly dividend from the beginning of 2008 to the end of 2009 by >23%. Abbott continued its dividend throughout.Abbott's aggressive simultaneous pursuit of the St. Jude and Alere deals caught me unawares and led me to question whether it was still committed to its dividend policy. As I have studied the matter in greater detail, I have come to view the matter differently. While the Alere deal seems decidedly unattractive now as it did from the start, I am quite optimistic about the prospects offered by the St. Jude deal.I take Abbott's recent announcement of its latest decidedly muted <2% dividend increase as an indication that it remains committed to increasing its dividend even as it faces operational stresses. Rather than taking a dividend holiday while it navigates these challenging times, it has elected to signal the ongoing importance of its dividend.CEO White reportedly invested ~$5 million in November at a price per share higher than its current price.Abbott's CEO, Miles White, has been at the helm since 1998. He has ushered the company through its glory years. He was CEO in 2001 when Abbott acquired Knoll Pharmaceuticals and with it D2E7, which later became the world's leading drug by revenues for many years under the name Humira. He was at the helm when Abbott spun off AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) in 2012, thereby divesting itself of Humira which had become a disproportionate contributor to the company's revenues.Certainly, no one can have a better bead on Abbott's prospects than its long-time CEO. The fact that he has been loading up on stock in Abbott, including purchases totaling nearly $5 million as recently as November 2016 at ~$40 per share, has to be considered a positive sign. Chances are when the market opens up for the start of 2017, you and I will be able to buy shares at a discount to what he paid.Willow Street Investments has penned several articles, here and here on SA highlighting this and other insider purchases at Abbott.ConclusionAbbott is one of my favorite picks as we move through 2017. I anticipate that its newly augmented cardiology franchise will stand tall. Barclays' (NYSE:BCS) recent 2017 top picks leads off its US selections with none other than Abbott. It sets a price target for the stock of $50.This would put Abbott back at its peak 2015 price. I am not quite that optimistic. I am looking for Abbott to start reporting notably positive quarters once its St. Jude acquisition starts to take hold, hopefully Q2 2017.Where will that take Abbott? I do not offer any target prices. I am hopeful that Abbott's balanced portfolio of businesses, led by its medical device unit, will handily beat the market in 2017."
4036118,103023,2017-01-11T15:25:00-05:00,"Abbott Labs has been working behind the scenes to make its branded generics segment more efficient.It has diversified itself of unproductive assets, but makes strategic acquisitions in emerging markets.The large insider buys are also good for investor confidence.","About 20% of Abbott's (NYSE:ABT) total global annual sales of $20bn comes from its long list of generic drugs. In some ways, this is very safe money because of a number of factors. One, it takes a long, long time - or a lot of money - to produce a catalogue of generics large enough to make meaningful money. Not everybody can do it. Small players find it especially difficult to cope. That is why there is hardly any small player in the global generics market. Two, while entry barrier to the generics field is technically low, the lack of financial incentive actually makes competition somewhat difficult against established players. Three, it is difficult for regional generic players to become global. This business is very low margin; it just doesn't generate enough to sustain marketing on a global scale. And four, not every generic drug is easy to make, and sometimes physicians will prefer branded generics over non-branded ones.Given the factors above, at least a fifth of Abbott's total sales is very well protected from market headwinds. This is not a claim all big pharma can make. We hear every year of one or the other big pharma heading towards a patent cliff or stiff competition - Roche (OTCQX:RHHBF), or Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD), for example, has had such troubles in recent times. Abbott is very protected from such things because it has found for itself a unique niche. It spends very little on R&D, it has very little of the catalytic effect common to other biotechs, it doesn't have PDUFA dates, or trial results dates etc.; basically it is a very safe, boring, dividend-paying company. For a lot of investors, including some insiders, this can be a very attractive investment proposition in the current state of biotech.Speaking of insider buying, CEO Miles White just spent close to $60m buying Abbott stocks this year. This is the largest insider purchase I have come across in recent times. This certainly boosts my confidence in the stock.Abbott has been quietly consolidating its generics segment, diversifying its non-performing assets in the form of its first world generic business, which it sold off to Mylan (MYL) for 110 millions of MYL shares. This sale was a long time coming for Abbott. Year over year, the company had been seeing steadily increasing operational sales in 14 key emerging markets including the BRICS nations, while its generic drugs sales in developed markets were declining steadily. With this divestiture, Abbott is simply re-positioning itself as one of the largest players in the high growth emerging markets. In India, it was already one of the largest generics sellers; now it has a similar presence in Latin America as well. The entire Asian continent now accounts for a third of Abbott's total revenues, and much of this comes from the branded generics segment.Abbott used to have a segment called the Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products, which was one of its five revenue-generating segments. This segment did R&D and produced newly approved drugs. Abbott spun off the R&D and new drugs sections out as AbbVie, and Hospira before that. Then it made a number of critical generic acquisitions, adding to the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment. Finally, it divested itself of its US generics business with the Mylan sale. Today, this segment only manufactures and sells generic drugs outside the US. This is the sort of strategic consolidation that has made Abbott's generics business efficient.Abbott has a long list of branded generic drugs, many of them, like Brufen and Duphalac - household names around the world. Many of these came through its own research, or through historical acquisitions. However, the principal manner in which products were added to the catalogue was through Abbott's own research for its Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products. With this research-based proprietary pharmaceuticals business now divested, the only way to add products to this branded generic catalogue is through acquisitions. Abbott has been carefully making acquisitions ex-US, notably with the $2.9bn 2014 purchase of CFR Pharmaceuticals, Latin America's largest generic pharma company.The CFR acquisition added some 1000 different generic products across markets in Latin America and parts of Southeast Asia. It will also add about $1bn to Abbott's annual sales figures. This more than doubled Abbott's presence in the Latin American branded generics market.In 2014, also, for about $305m, Abbott acquired Veropharm, a leading Russian pharma company, and established a manufacturing footprint in that country, as well as acquired a broad range of some 100 generic products. Total sales from the segment increased to 34.1% in 2015 as a result. Abbott has been in Russia since over 40 years, but it did not have a manufacturing presence until now.Abbott's focus seems to be away from R&D and more towards boring but low-risk healthcare in the form of generics, nutritional products, and diagnostics. In the generics segment, as I just discussed, it has taken a number of strategic steps to consolidate its business and make it more efficient. Effectively, this puts a large chunk of Abbott's revenues in a low-risk shelf, out of the reach of market volatility. Its 2.6% dividend yield adds to the attraction. It is also quite a range bound stock, and right now, it is trading near the middle of its 52-week range. If you are interested in a dividend paying, solid, blue chip, boring, low risk stock, Abbott is one good way to go in 2017."
4035097,101453,2017-01-09T00:12:33-05:00,Abbott’s acquisition of St. Jude Medical closed on January 4.The deal is strong strategically but comes with the financial pitfall of increasing leverage beyond an ideal amount.I look at the acquisition’s effect on Abbott’s capital structure and valuation.,"ThesisAbbott's (NYSE:ABT) recent acquisition of St. Jude Medical (NYSE:STJ) increased its debt load beyond a recommendable amount. The pay-down of this purchase-related debt will reduce Abbott's financial and operational flexibility ahead. Even so, a baseline scenario shows that Abbott is fairly appropriately priced by the market now that the deal has closed.OverviewAbbott recently closed its acquisition of St. Jude Medical on January 4, capping off a process that was expected to close slightly before the new year or immediately after.In the transaction, each St. Jude Medical shareholder will receive 0.8708 shares of Abbott stock and $46.75 in cash per share. This entails that another 248.8 million shares were issued by Abbott for additional financing and also to balance out the amount of leveraging being done to facilitate the transaction. Abbott already had 1,470 million of its own shares outstanding before the deal, raising the aggregate count in the combined entity to about 1.72 billion.The combined entity looks to form a market-leading cardiovascular medical device company. Abbott holds strong market positions in coronary intervention and trans-catheter mitrial repair, while St. Jude Medical brings along complementary product lines in atrial fibrillation, and heart failure devices. With the rate of cardiovascular disease (""CVD"") on the rise, with 2 in 5 US adults expected to have some form of CVD by 2030, demographic tailwinds are in the company's favor.The main concern regarding the deal is not so much strategic, but financial. Abbott will be on-loading a significant amount of debt with the closure of the St. Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions. (Abbott has filed a claim to terminate the $5.8 billion Alere acquisition, which is pending.) The amount of debt is beyond what I believe is healthy for the company and a subsequent de-leverage post-transaction will be needed.With the standard model I use to assess the optimization of a company's capital structure, I provide each company with a synthetic debt rating determined using interest coverage ratios (EBIT/interest expense). These ratings are then converted to various debt costs based on the historical spread between said ratings and the 10-year US Treasury. I then plot out a capital structure curve (taking data points in five-percent increments) to illustrate the company's optimal debt design.From this I determine that Abbott is currently teetering right around the outer optimal point of the curve with a pro forma debt-to-capital ratio of around 30%, or debt to EBITDA of close to 4.5x. I believe that companies should generally take their optimal debt load and assume a debt position of about two-thirds of that amount. This point can be graphically represented by plotting out a weighted average cost of capital (""WACC"") versus debt-to-capital curve, with optimization at the lowest reading on the vertical axis. This helps for the sake of conservatism by helping to control for any unexpected events that may transpire to diminish the company's equity value. As can be plainly seen from the graph below, the value destruction that can be caused from over-leveraging is much worse than the degree that can occur from under-leveraging.(Source: author)To put in terms of share prices, the accretive effects of adding debt up toward the optimal point are fairly minimal, with the drop-off significant.(Source: author)Abbott is less equipped to handle a significant debt burden as it has a larger amount of capital expenditures. I project that the company will achieve around $2.5-$2.6 billion in GAAP net income for the FY2017 due to what should be around $1.9 billion per year in capex (7.0%-7.5% of revenue per year) in equilibrium. The company's dividend program will require $1.6-$1.7 billion in expense from its free cash flow. Assuming the company incurs no growth or deterioration in working capital and that capital expenditures are equal to depreciation expense in the long-run, we can essentially say that net income is the company's free cash flow.That would leave $0.8-$1.0 billion remaining to reinvest back in the company and pay-down accumulated debt. I believe that the company should strive to reduce its debt load post-transaction by about $6-$7 billion. However, with a limited amount of free cash flow, reducing the debt load by this amount could conceivably take several years.This is especially true if margin expansion isn't achieved in a way to generate sufficient earnings growth and if the company has difficulty growing its top-line by more than 3% per year. Each 100-bp increase in year-over-year revenue growth is projected to generate about 140 bps in year-over-year EPS growth.Management expects about $0.26 worth of EPS accretion in 2017 followed by $0.39 in 2018, but these are based on non-GAAP results. Abbott will have about $5 billion in cash to work with, which limits the need for earnings generation for purposes of debt reduction. But a drawdown in cash will limit operational flexibility.I would expect that shareholder initiatives will remain limited to the quarterly dividend payments. Share buybacks will be restricted due to the need to keep balance in its capital structure unless the tactic is needed to ward off any unnecessary dilution to shareholders. Further acquisitions are also unlikely, given leverage restrictions and limited capital.Additional debt issuance would impair the company's credit ratings and be value destructive to the company's share price. Equity issuance would dilute existing shareholders, and current cash balances are needed to keep debt under control. Abbott expects to refinance St. Jude Medical's debt to lower interest costs.ValuationRegarding matters of valuation, if we assume that Abbott will achieve about $26 billion in revenue for the FY2017 as a newly combined entity, depreciation expense at 7.2% of sales (and equal to capex in equilibrium), an effective tax rate of 20%, no working capital growth, and a 1.8% long-run growth rate of the economy, a cost of debt of 4.47%, and a cost of equity of 7.5%, we can sensitize the share price outcomes to both the year-over-year revenue growth rate and EBITDA margin.For the year-over-year revenue growth rate, I developed a range running from 0.0%-6.0% in 150-bp increments. For the EBITDA margin, a 22%-26% range seems realistic, going in 100-bp increments. The sensitivity chart can be seen below. Outputs toward the center of the grid are closer to baseline expectations:(Source: author)The following provides the correspondent upside/downside from the stock price as of the time of writing:(Source: author)ConclusionAbbott's acquisition of St. Jude Medical provides the company with greater product diversification and will strengthen its market position in cardiovascular medical device equipment. However, Abbott should strive to de-lever the company from the amount of debt that must be absorbed to complete the transaction.With its relatively limited free cash flow after capital spending and shareholder initiatives, Abbott will likely need to drawdown its cash balance to a degree in order to help expedite the pay-down. This will likely take several years and will require prudent financial management. Moreover, it will also limit the ability for management to pursue strategic acquisitions moving forward."

In 2016, investors have sold off the company's shares given uncertainty and drama surrounding two of its major acquisitions. Before discussing such acquisitions, we note that ABT's third-quarter 2016 results were better than expected due to the strong performance of its established pharmaceuticals (""EPD"") and medical devices divisions. Additional good news to support revenue growth going forward for the company is the U.S. FDA's approval of the company's Absorb product, the only fully dissolving heart stent, and Tecnis Symfony intraocular lenses for the treatment of cataracts.The company will also benefit from its upcoming acquisition of St. Jude Medical Inc. (NYSE:STJ), which will bring to ABT an industry leading pipeline of products relating to cardiovascular, neuromodulation, diabetes and vision care. ABT entered into an agreement to acquire SJM for $25 billion in April 2016 and the company expects such transaction to close in fourth quarter 2016. Recently, ABT and STJ agreed to sell certain products to Terumo Corporation in an all-cash transaction of about $1.12 billion to help close the STJ acquisition. News reports indicate that European regulators are likely to approve the ABT/STJ deal by the end of November 2016.Although investors face uncertainty as to whether the STJ acquisition will close, they are likely more concerned as to whether the company's announced acquisition of Alere, Inc. (NYSE:ALR) will close and at what price will be paid for ALR if such acquisition does close. ABT's acquisition of ALR, a diagnostic testing device maker, is at a standstill as each company put forth negative allegations towards each other. ALR, in a litigation involving both parties, asserts that ABT is attempting to back out of its $5.8 billion acquisition of ALR purchase by slowing down the regulatory process and threatening to overwhelm ALR with acquisition-related paperwork. ABT, however, asserts that ALR acted deceptively during acquisition negotiations by withholding information about U.S. federal investigations and informing witnesses to lie about its Indian operations. Outside of the litigation between ABT and ALR, ALR was already under investigation by U.S. federal prosecutors in regard to its overseas sales practices under anti-bribery laws. Effectively, ALR is pressuring ABT to complete the acquisition while ABT wants more information to determine whether to move forward with the acquisition given that ALR is being investigated for Medicaid and Medicare billing and foreign corrupt practices. ABT likely wants to back out of the ALR acquisition to avoid 1) inheriting ALR's ongoing investigations; and 2) overpaying for a company far more damaged than ABT realized when negotiating the acquisition. Investors are not confident that the ALR acquisition will close given that ALR shares trade far below the agreed upon acquisition price of $56 a share.No one can conclude with certainty whether a court will order ABT to adhere to the obligations under the ALR acquisition agreement. With each party asserting that the other party is acting in bad faith, it is known that ABT offered ALR about $50 million for its legal costs if ALR terminates the acquisition agreement. ALR rejected ABT's offer. Although we cannot determine the outcome of the litigation between the parties, our belief is that ABT, the more high-powered party to the acquisition, will likely be able to: 1) walk away from the acquisition with a higher payout to ALR; or 2) acquire ALR for a significantly lower purchase amount due to deceptive negotiating practices by ALR during acquisition talks. Regardless of the outcome of the ABT/ALR feud, we believe that the multi-million dollar insider purchase of ABT shares by the company's CEO speaks volumes as to their confidence in regard to ABT's: 1) stand alone prospects; 2) likely ability to close the STJ acquisition; and 3) ability to mitigate damages resulting from its disputed acquisition of ALR. The likely closure of the SJT acquisition will allow ABT to expand its heart device business and allow it compete against larger rivals Medtronic Plc (NYSE:MDT) and Boston Scientific Corp (NYSE:BSX). Not only will the SJT acquisition allow ABT to drive revenue and earnings growth, but ABT's internal research and development will also allow it to drive revenue/profit growth.ABT has been positioning itself for improved revenue and profit growth in the intermediate and long term through various divestitures and acquisitions. In recent years, ABT sold its slow-growth developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business to focus its higher-growth branded generics pharmaceutical business on emerging markets. The company also recently sold its medical optics business to Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to allow it to focus on obtaining leadership positions in cardiovascular devices and its expanding diagnostics business. In addition, ABT's newly approved innovative products noted below are likely to drive revenue/earnings growth.The company currently yields about 2.65 percent, and has an extensive history of yearly dividend increases. Despite near-term STJ and ALR acquisition uncertainties, we believe the multi-million dollar share purchase by ABT's CEO is a significant signal of confidence in the company's intermediate and long-term prospects despite near-term adversities. We also believe that investors should consider the company's shares at or below the CEO's insider purchase price.Third quarter 2016 earningsIn mid October 2016, ABT announced earnings of .59 per share, an increase from .54 in the year-ago quarter. The company recorded revenue of $5.3 billion, a 2.9 percent increase that was negatively affected by adverse currency effects.The company's EPD sales increased 5.3 percent to $1.01 billion where such revenue was impacted by adverse currency effects but recognized increased sales in important emerging markets such as India and several countries of Latin America. Revenue for the medical devices division recorded sales of $1.3 billion, a 6.4 percent increase due to growth in vascular and diabetes care products. The company's medical optics division sales increased 4.4 percent due to continued market uptake of cataract products in the premium intraocular lens market. Nutrition sales, however, decreased 2 percent to $1.8 billion as pediatric nutrition sales decreased while adult nutrition sales increased due to strong sales of Ensure. Diagnostics sales increased 5 percent to $1.2 billion due to sales increases for core laboratory products and point-of-care diagnostics while molecular diagnostics sales decreased as growth in the infectious disease testing business was partially offset by the planned scale-down of the genetics business.ABT increased the mid-point and narrowed its guidance for earnings. The company expects earnings to be $2.19 to $2.21 per share.Recent DevelopmentsABT recognized multiple positive events in the third quarter. The company: 1) received U.S. FDA approval for its FreeStyle Libre Pro system, a continuous glucose monitoring system for healthcare professionals to use with their diabetes patients; 2) submitted for U.S. regulatory approval a consumer version of FreeStyle Libre, to be used by diabetes patients to self-monitor glucose levels; 3) received U.S. FDA approval for Absorb, a fully dissolving heart stent; and 4) received U.S. FDA approval for TECNIS Symfony intraocular lenses for the treatment of cataracts, the first a extended depth of focus lenses for persons with cataracts. In September 12016, ABT announced the sale of its medical optics vision care business, to JNJ for $4.325 billion.CEO insider makes a multi-million dollar purchaseOne of the most positive signs to a potential investor in a company's stock is an insider purchase of its shares on the open market. Recently, an ABT insider made a substantial purchase of the company's shares. On November 10, 2016, insider CEO Miles White made multiple purchases of 369,950 shares at $40.35 to $40.45 for a total cost of about $15,000,000. After such purchase, Mr. White holds 3,111,967 ABT shares, a substantial individual stake in the company. We find this multi-million dollar purchase closer to ABT's 52-week low as significant given that Mr. White's position with ABT is as the CEO of the company. As the ABT director, Mr. White is most knowledgeable about the direction ABT is taking with respect to current and future product offerings, the company's financials, restructuring activities and the company's ability to perform whether the U.S FTC allows it to acquire STJ or not. Mr. White also has the most knowledge as to whether ABT completes the troubled ALR acquisition or not. We also see such multi-million-dollar purchase as a sign of his confidence in the company despite its shares trading near a 52-week low. Mr. White is signaling with his purchase that ABT shares are beginning to represent value at his purchase price while also offering an about 2.65 percent dividend yield. With ABT shares trading at about the insider's purchase price, potential investors with a long-term holding period currently have the opportunity to purchase this company's shares at a price similar to such insider purchase or lower on a continued market sell off.Our viewWe believe ABT is well-positioned within the global healthcare markets, particularly in emerging markets. As noted above, the company sold its developed markets established pharmaceuticals unit, which it expected to experience slow growth. Much of ABT's effort to drive improved revenue and profit growth involves divestitures and acquisitions. ABT, by selling its slow-growth developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business, will allow it to focus on its higher-growth branded generics pharmaceutical business in emerging markets. As also noted above, the company aims to obtain leadership positions in cardiovascular devices and its expanding diagnostics business. Further, ABT's newly approved innovative products noted above in recent developments are also likely to drive revenue/earnings growth. Finally, ABT is in the midst of efforts to improve productivity and efficiency to enhance growth.ABT's forward price-to-earnings ratio is about 18.00 based on 2016 earnings estimates of $2.21, and about 16.40 based on 2017 earnings estimates of $2.43. We believe that, with overall markets at or near record highs, an investor could wait for ABT's share price to pull back to a range of about $36.45 to $38.90 to establish a full position. (A forward price-to-earnings ratio in the range of about to 15.00 to 16.00 based on fiscal year 2017 estimates). Given that ABT's share price is quite close to our buy range and is at about the price paid by ABT's CEO, investors can feel secure purchasing the company's shares immediately. Although ABT is in transition, investors will benefit long term with share price appreciation, dividend increases and share buybacks as the uncertainty surrounding company's multiple acquisitions dissipates.(Click ""follow"" next to our contributor name at the top of this article to follow our upcoming articles on ABT, insider purchases and more.)"
4029690,102479,2016-12-11T06:14:07-05:00,"Third-quarter worldwide sales of $5.3 billion increased 2.9 percent on a reported basis and 4.0 percent on an operational basis.I continue to expect ABT to deliver top-tier organic constant currency revenue growth, ex-Venezuela headwinds in 2016.The sale of Abbott Medical Optics to JNJ and that of certain vascular closure and electrophysiology devices to Terumo Corp. reduces Medical Devices market revenue forecast by ~$1.1 billion.","Source: Generic Pharma FinanceWith franchises in four major health care segments, Abbott (NYSE:ABT) is one of the most diversified of the large-cap Medical Device companies that offers leading products worldwide in nutritionals, diagnostics, medical devices, and established branded generic pharmaceuticals. Approximately 30% of the company's revenue is generated in the United States, another 30% in Western Europe, Canada, Japan and Australia, and the remaining 40% in emerging markets, which include India, China, Russia and Brazil. In January 2013, Abbott completed the separation of its proprietary research-based pharmaceuticals business which now operates as the independent large cap pharmaceuticals company AbbVie. In 2013, Abbott acquired OptiMedica Corporation and IDEV Technologies to further diversify its portfolio.I continue to expect ABT to deliver top-tier organic constant currency revenue growth, ex-Venezuela headwinds in 2016. Despite '16 being a more difficult year for ABT's top- and bottom-line growth trajectories, I continue to believe ABT's business model that is diversified in different markets and geographies should prove its value in the long haul. Although management prepped investors for a slow turn around in the China Pediatric Nutritionals business, they believe that they can manage through the headwinds which are pressuring 3% of the revenue base (and maintain the 5%+ operational revenue growth experienced thus far in 2016. New product cycles in Dx (Alinity), DM (Libre OUS), and Medical Devices (Absorb) will provide meaningful contributions to growth while core strength in EPD, Dx, Medical Devices, and Nutritionals ex the OUS-Pediatric franchise is defensible. Importantly, Pediatric Nutritionals in China represent ~3% of corporate wide revenues. ABT's fundamentals as a standalone are intact and 5%+ top line and double digit EPS growth appear very achievable and sustainable. ABT also set out numerous initiatives across business segments to improve the cost structure which should drive the 50-75 bps margin expansion story.Key factsIn the third quarter, Abbott received U.S. FDA approval for its FreeStyle Libre Pro system, a revolutionary continuous glucose monitoring system for healthcare professionals to use with their patients with diabetes; submitted for U.S. regulatory approval a consumer version of FreeStyle Libre, to be used by people with diabetes to self-monitor glucose levels; received U.S. FDA approval for AbsorbTM, the only fully dissolving heart stent; and received U.S. FDA approval for TECNIS Symfony intraocular lenses for the treatment of cataracts, the first and only extended depth of focus lenses for people with cataracts.On Sept. 16, 2016, Abbott announced the sale of Abbott Medical Optics, its vision care business, to Johnson & Johnson for $4.325 billion. This transaction aligns with Abbott's shaping of its portfolio, which has recently focused on developing leadership positions in cardiovascular devices and expanding diagnostics. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals.I believe that ABT represents a collection of low-risk assets (devices, diagnostic, nutritionals, and pharmaceuticals) that should be able to deliver constant currency mid-single-digit revenue and EPS growth in the ~10% range over the next three years (above the group average of ~8%). The management team has a credible history of creating value for shareholders. The acquisitions of Alere (NYSE:ALR) and St. Jude Medical, Inc. (NYSE:STJ) are both financially accretive for shareholders. Assuming a year-end close of STJ transaction, I estimate $0.19 (~8%) accretion in 2017 and $0.26 (10%) accretion in 2018. This helps the company deliver EPS growth ahead of peers.Operating margin expansion opportunities exist over the next several years in nutritionals and diagnostics.In diagnostics, management has steered away from price-sensitive tenders/accounts, providing stability to pricing, which is driving margin expansion (on track to exceed goal of 20% op margins). In nutritionals, management has taken initiatives to expand operating margins to ~20% in 2015 (up from ~16% in 2012), and I believe there is further potential for margin expansion over time. We believe EPD is a source of margin upside longer-term.Acquisition of STJ makes strategic sense and expands ABT's presence in cardiovascular, heart failure, AF, and Neuromodulation. STJ is highly complementary to ABT and has little overlap with ABT's existing business lines. STJ broadens ABT's presence in Cardiovascular, especially in key high-growth markets such as Heart Failure and Structural Heart, complementing ABT's core stent franchise. STJ also adds a presence in CRM with ICDs and pacemakers, as well as a foothold in other high-growth markets, including Atrial Fibrillation and Neuromodulation. While investors may be concerned that STJ is dilutive to ABT's overall revenue growth profile, I believe the combined company should leverage their respective product and geographical strengths, drive revenue synergies, and accelerate revenue growth.Asset sales, Pediatric Nutrition revenue trends largely explain lower 2018 revenue Estimate.The sale of Abbott Medical Optics to JNJ and that of certain vascular closure and electrophysiology devices to Terumo Corp. reduces Medical Devices market revenue forecast by ~$1.1 billion. I have also reduced my revenue forecast for Nutrition segment based on a reassessment of the Pediatric business following two consecutive quarters where ABT missed my estimates and relatively more bearish commentary from ABT management on the changes underway in the Chinese market. Within Medical Devices, I am encouraged by continued strong results within Atrial Fibrillation and Cardiovascular segments of STJ.Furthermore, the confirmation from STJ management that MRI-safe pacemaker and MRIsafe ICD remain on-track for U.S. approval bodes well for Traditional CRM and Heart Failure segments (CRT devices) in 2017. Management teams of both companies are confident that once these devices are available in the U.S., STJ can quickly recapture market share. If these expectations come true, we should see upside to Medical Devices revenue forecast.I have gained more conviction that the ABT/STJ/ALR combination will be well positioned to generate sustainable 5%+ revenue and 12-15% EPS growth trajectories. STJ's pipeline product cycle with several key products awaiting imminent FDA approval should boost ABT's core cardiovascular business. Management is comfortable with the risks associated with STJ's recent advisory warning and cybersecurity vulnerability accusations. Management clearly still believes STJ represents a strategic fit with significant sales and cost synergies. Scrutiny around the deal has been focused on St. Jude's recent sluggish revenue growth performances relative to peers. Concerns about the path to top-line reacceleration and ABT's new exposure to the flattish Cardiac Rhythm Management industry have driven relatively negative sentiment and ABT share underperformance. I have been positive on the long term prospects of St. Jude's sales growth reacceleration in 2017 and beyond. My STJ top line recovery thesis in 2017 was supported by the Q3'2016 earning results as the strong growth generated by Thoratec, Afib and Neuromodulation offset the CRM weakness.With the 2013 spin-out of proprietary pharma, the new Abbott is a redux of the pre-Humira Abbott, a large diversified medical products company with competitive global franchises in nutritionals, diagnostics, medical devices (industry leading vascular, diabetes, and ophthalmology product lines), and international branded generic pharmaceuticals. Over the next 5 years, I believe ABT is poised to deliver revenue growth of 5-6% and operating EPS growth of 10-11%, making it a standout performer compared to its Medical Device peers. I believe there may be upside to my estimates with potential outperformances from each business unit, better than expected contribution from pipeline products (ABSORB, MitraClip), successful business development initiatives, and margin expansion. My blended valuation analysis (DCF and P/E multiples) supports ABT's diversified business model and I expect ABT shares to outperform the market in the next 12 months.ALR shares trade at a 20% discount to the $56 ABT offer and the discount has improved only marginally from three months ago. Given the lack of public disclosure surrounding the legal dispute, it is difficult for me to forecast when the transaction will close. However, I would put the probability of a favorable resolution at over 50% for two reasons. First, ALR's restatements did not lead to material changes and the company's financials are now up to date. Second, ABT would benefit, in my view, in going ahead with ALR as it will help offset the impact from more difficult market conditions the company faces in China for Pediatric Nutrition. However, I also believe the deal is unlikely to get done at $56."
4032870,67985,2016-12-27T11:50:36-05:00,"Continued insider purchases are a signal to outside investors that the company’s shares currently are at a value-oriented price and that the St. Jude Medical acquisition will close.Such insider purchases also support the belief that the company will resolve its’ ill-fated pending acquisition of Alere, Inc. at a mitigated cost to itself.U.S. regulators are likely to approve the company’s acquisition of St. Jude Medical soon (following the European Union’s approval).The company need not close the Alere acquisition if there are any occurrences relating to Alere that have a “material adverse effect” on the acquisition’s value.Multiple insider purchases indicate confidence in the company’s stand-alone prospects; the St Jude Medical acquisition benefits; and mitigation of Alere acquisition damages.","Continued Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) insider purchases are a signal to outside investors that the company's shares currently are at a value-oriented price and that the company will be able to close its acquisition of St. Jude Medical Inc. (NYSE:STJ) soon. Further, we see such purchases as a signal to outside investors that ABT will be able to resolve its' ill-fated pending acquisition of Alere, Inc. (NYSE:ALR) at a mitigated cost to ABT. As readers may remember, earlier in 2016 investors sold off the company's shares given uncertainty and drama surrounding two of its major acquisitions. On a positive note, a U.S. regulator approval of ABT's acquisition of STJ is imminent (and follows European Union approval of the acquisition in late November 2016). ABT entered into an agreement to acquire SJM for $25 billion earlier in 2016 and ABT and STJ later agreed to sell certain products to Terumo Corporation in an all-cash transaction of about $1.12 billion to help close the STJ acquisition. ABT will benefit from its acquisition of STJ, which will bring to the company an industry leading pipeline of products relating to cardiovascular, neuromodulation, diabetes and vision care. While approval and closure of the acquisition of STJ is likely and beneficial to ABT, the company's pending acquisition of ALR is a more complex scenario that ABT has clearly wanted to back away from ever since ALR revealed information that make it a damaged acquisition target.Early in December 2016, ABT filed a complaint in a Delaware court seeking to terminate its proposed merger with ALR because ABT believes that ALR ""is no longer the company [ABT] agreed to buy when the parties signed their merger agreement in January [2016.]"" ABT is attempting to back out of its $5.8 billion acquisition given that it believes that ALR acted deceptively during acquisition negotiations by withholding information about U.S. federal investigations. (Outside of the litigation between ABT and ALR, ALR was already under investigation by U.S. federal prosecutors in regard to its overseas sales practices under anti-bribery laws.) In its Complaint, ABT pointed out that: 1) an ALR subsidiary billed the U.S. government for services to hundreds of deceased persons over a five-year period, leading to the revocation of its Medicare enrollment; and 2) less than a month after the parties signed the merger agreement, ALR announced that it would be unable to file its 10-K in a timely manner due to an ongoing investigation of revenue recognition issues. In its Complaint, ABT set forth numerous additional problems plaguing ALR since each party entered the acquisition agreement. ALR, of course, believes ABT's lawsuit is entirely without merit by stating that ""none of the issues ABT] has raised provides it with any grounds to avoid closing the merger"" and that ALR has ""complied with its contractual obligations under the merger agreement …."" An important aspect of the litigation is that there is a clause in the acquisition agreement that states ABT need not close the merger if there has been any occurrence that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a ""material adverse effect"" on ALR's value.Investors clearly believe that ABT is likely to be able to walk away from its pending acquisition of ALR with minimal damage to itself or its shareholders given that ALR's shares trade at about $40 a share, far below the $56 per share price that ABT agreed to pay ALR shareholders. As noted below, ABT insiders are also apparently positive about their company's ability to close its acquisition of STJ and to walk away from its pending acquisition of ALR with minimal adverse effects to itself. Although we cannot determine the outcome of the litigation between the parties, our belief is that ABT, the larger and more high-powered party to the acquisition, will likely be able to: 1) walk away from the acquisition with a payout to ALR; or 2) acquire ALR for a significantly lower purchase amount due to deceptive negotiating practices by ALR during acquisition talks. Regardless of the outcome of the ABT/ALR litigation, we believe that the multiple insider purchases of ABT shares by the company's executives speaks to their confidence in regard to ABT's: 1) stand alone prospects; 2) successful STJ integration prospects; and 3) ability to mitigate damages resulting from its disputed acquisition of ALR. We note further that the closure of the SJT acquisition will allow ABT to expand its heart device business and allow it compete against larger rivals Medtronic Plc (NYSE:MDT) and Boston Scientific Corp (NYSE:BSX).Not only will the SJT acquisition allow ABT to drive revenue and earnings growth, but ABT's internal research and development will also allow it to drive revenue/profit growth. As ABT moves towards closing its acquisition of STJ and resolving its disputed acquisition of ALR, we should note that the company's third-quarter 2016 results were better than expected due to the strong performance of its established pharmaceuticals (""EPD"") and medical devices divisions. Additional good news to support revenue growth going forward for the company is the U.S. FDA's approval of the company's Absorb product, the only fully dissolving heart stent, and Tecnis Symfony intraocular lenses for the treatment of cataracts. With this in mind, we note further that ABT has been positioning itself for improved revenue/profit growth over the long term through various divestitures and acquisitions. In recent years, ABT sold its slow-growth developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business to focus its higher-growth branded generics pharmaceutical business on emerging markets. The company also sold its medical optics business to Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) to allow it to focus on obtaining leadership positions in cardiovascular devices and its expanding diagnostics business. In addition, ABT's newly approved innovative products are likely to drive revenue/earnings growth. The company currently yields about 2.75 percent, and has an extensive history of yearly dividend increases. Despite near-term STJ and ALR acquisition uncertainties, we believe the multiple insider purchases by ABT executives are a significant signal of confidence in the company's long-term prospects despite near-term adversities. We also believe that investors should consider the company's shares now as tax-loss selling will abate in 2017.Multiple insiders continue to buy as acquisition uncertainties are likely to clear.When we write about insider buying activity we typically note ""one of the most positive signs to a potential investor in a company's stock is an insider purchase of its shares on the open market."" We can expand on this notion further by stating that multiple insider purchases, especially close to 52-week lows, are an even more powerful signal to outsiders of such insiders' belief in actions being taken by a company to drive revenue/earnings growth over the intermediate and long term. In an earlier article on ABT we discussed insider CEO Miles White's multiple purchases of 369,950 shares at $40.35 to $40.45 in November 2016 for a total cost of about $15,000,000. In such article, we noted our belief in the significance of such multi-million dollar purchase closer to ABT's 52-week low given that Mr. White's position allows him to have the most knowledge about the direction ABT is taking with respect to current and future product offerings, the company's financials, restructuring activities and the outcomes of any acquisition uncertainties. Although we find Mr. White's insider purchases significant on their own, other insiders continued to purchase the company's shares into late December 2016.Robert Ford, Executive Vice President of Medical Devices at ABT, purchased 12,775 shares at $39.07 on December 14, 2016 for a total cost of about $499,120. In addition, Brian Blaser, Executive Vice President of Diagnostic Products at ABT, purchased 15,580 shares at $38.43 on December 20, 2016 for a total cost of about $598,739. We find such continued insider purchases in addition to Mr. White's significant purchases continue to add to our confidence in continuing to invest in ABT's shares. While ABT faces multiple acquisition-related uncertainties, as noted above, such insider purchase activity indicates a positive resolution of any outstanding acquisition uncertainty in ABT's favor. In particular, we believe that such insiders likely believe that the U.S FTC allows ABT to acquire STJ soon. We also believe that such insiders also appreciate ABT's ability to integrate STJ successfully and drive revenue/earnings growth from such acquisition.Each insider also has intimate knowledge as to whether ABT will complete the troubled ALR acquisition or not. Such insiders likely understand the worst-case outcome of the litigation involving the pending ALR acquisition and likely also have a clear idea whether ABT can walk about from the ALR acquisition and the ability of ABT to mitigate the cost to walk away from such acquisition. We see such multiple insider purchases as a sign of their confidence in the company despite its shares trading near a 52-week low. Each insider is signaling with their purchase that ABT shares are beginning to represent value at his purchase price while also offering an about 2.75 percent dividend yield. With ABT shares trading at about the insider's purchase price, potential investors with a long-term holding period currently have the opportunity to purchase this company's shares at a price similar to such insider purchases or lower on a continued market sell off.Our viewWe continue to believe that ABT is optimally positioned within the global healthcare markets, particularly in emerging markets. As noted above, the company sold its developed markets established pharmaceuticals unit, which was expected to experience slow growth. Much of ABT's effort to drive improved revenue and profit growth involves divestitures and acquisitions. ABT, by selling its slow-growth developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business, will allow it to focus on its higher-growth branded generics pharmaceutical business in emerging markets. As also noted above, the company aims to obtain leadership positions in cardiovascular devices and its expanding diagnostics business. Further, ABT's newly approved innovative products noted above in recent developments are also likely to drive revenue/earnings growth. Finally, ABT is in the midst of efforts to improve productivity and efficiency to enhance growth. With ABT's STJ closure about to be approved, the company is also likely to be able to walk away from its ALR acquisition given its strong litigation position that ALR committed certain actions that damaged its value to ABT.ABT's forward price-to-earnings ratio is about 17.40 based on 2016 earnings estimates of $2.21, and about 15.90 based on 2017 earnings estimates of $2.42. We believe that, with overall markets at or near record highs, an investor could wait for ABT's share price to pull back to a range of about $36.30 to $38.75 to establish a full position. (A forward price-to-earnings ratio in the range of about to 15.00 to 16.00 based on fiscal year 2017 estimates). Given that ABT's share price is quite close to our buy range and is at about the price paid by ABT's multiple insiders, investors can feel secure purchasing the company's shares immediately. Although ABT is in transition, investors will benefit long term with share price appreciation, dividend increases and share buybacks as the uncertainty surrounding company's multiple acquisitions clears up.(Click ""follow"" next to our contributor name at the top of this article to follow our upcoming articles on ABT, insider purchases and more.)"
4033100,50452,2016-12-28T14:34:55-05:00,"With the markets surging, a ""rising tide"" has lifted stock prices - leaving few quality companies such as Abbott Labs trading at reasonable prices.
        Abbott Labs has been beaten down from a mix of headline news regarding its pending acquisitions, and the sluggish healthcare sector as a whole.
        The acquisitions will boost earnings growth moving forward, and Abbott is positioned to grow earnings around 10% moving forward, fueling a continually rising dividend.
        Abbott Labs is a healthcare company of the highest quality, and is trading at attractive levels right now compared to the market as a whole.","If you have taken a look at market headlines in recent weeks, you will notice an abundance of good news. Indices are surging at all time highs, and economic data continues to remain positive. This environment - although fun to ride the wave, makes new capital difficult to deploy for prudent investors. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) is a top quality holding trading at reasonable valuations. This is increasingly uncommon in the current market.The stock market has been on an absolute tear since the election, as all three major indices have been running rampant.source: Google financeIn less than two months the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial, and Nasdaq are all up between 8.83% - 11.53%. Optimism regarding the positive effects of a ""pro-business"" administration has done wonders for investors after a long, and tenuous presidential campaign cycle. Abbott Labs has not followed along, and is actually down 1% since the election. Even more so, it is down about 14% over the past year. Why has Abbott Labs performed so terribly?Abbott Labs has faced some headwinds over the past year. With it being an election year, politics have been front and center on the market floor. Analysts had been pointing out what a potential Democratic government led by Hillary Clinton would mean to regulation sensitive sectors such as healthcare. This speculation reached a climax when EpiPen maker Mylan NV (NASDAQ: MYL) CEO Heather Bresch was brought in front of a congressional committee to testify about high costs, and price increases on the EpiPen. Public outcries regarding the high cost of healthcare goods and services brought a negative stigma to the sector. The Republican Party had a surprisingly strong showing on election day, resulting in Republican control of the Presidency, Senate, and House. It seems that the threat of regulation on healthcare companies is now minimal for the foreseeable future. Although the passing of this headwind is a positive, it is prudent to note that shares still have not responded to the election results. There have been other factors affecting Abbott Labs.Abbott Labs has been simultaneously working through two potential acquisitions. The first being the acquisition of St. Jude Medical (NYSE: STJ). First agreed on back in April of this year, Abbott Labs will acquire the medical device manufacturer for $25B. Abbott will fund the deal by offering stock, and a $15B debt offering. The deal has been approved by share holders, and just received conditional anti-trust approval, giving Abbott Labs the green light to prepare for a close to the deal. In the short term, the company on the buying side of a deal takes a share price hit because A) the company usually pays a premium in order to get the other party to agree to a deal, and B) such deals require capital outlay in the form of debt, and often shares leading to a short term hit on the value of existing shares. Abbott Labs is also working through another (albeit more complicated) transaction in the form of its deal to acquire Alere, Inc. (NYSE: ALR). Alere manufactures medical diagnostic products. The acquisition is a cash deal worth $5.8B. The acquisition is mired in controversey, with the two parties battling in court, and Abbott recently filing a motion to back out of the deal at the beginning of December. It still remains to be seen how the soured relationship between Abbott Labs and Alere will work itself out. The combined size of these two deals, and the volatility of the ongoing Alere acquisition have given a lot of uncertainty to Abbott's stock. This is the primary reason why shares are down 14% from a year ago.These headwinds have created a ""perfect storm"" that has suppressed the price of shares, yet does not imply a damaged business model. In the long run, Abbott should continue to execute and grow earnings. The St. Jude Medical deal gives Abbott a cutting edge medical device pipeline that will position Abbott to prosper as the increasing threat of cardiovascular disease will increase the demand for medical devices over the next 10+ years.source: http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/123/8/933The St. Jude deal will be accretive to earnings immediately, providing an estimated boost of $.21 per share to earnings in 2017, and $.29 boost in 2018. Additionally, Abbott is estimated that it will realize annual synergies of $500 by the year 2020. If the Alere deal goes through, EPS could be impacted by $.12 - $.13 in 2017, and $.20 per share in 2018. Each of these deals will help Abbott continue to grow over the long run.Additionally, Abbott Labs is a well diversified healthcare company that manufactures products through its major divisions Diagnostics, Medical Devices, Nutrition, and Pharmaceuticals generics (the name brand portion of the business was spun off to form AbbVie Inc. (NYSE: ABBV).About 30% of sales are generated in the United States, with the rest in foreign markets. In total, its revenues are evenly split between developed, and emerging markets. Its grew sales by 9.1% last year on a constant currency basis, and analysts are currently forecasting earnings growth near 10% over the next five years.One of the true testaments to a company's earnings quality is an ability to raise dividends for an extended time period. Abbott Labs is no slouch in this department either. Its recent 1.9% dividend increase marks the 43rd consecutive year of Abbot paying out increasing dividends. It will not show up on any ""dividend champion"" filters, because the dividends paid per share were technically reduced when Abbott Labs spun off AbbVie, back in 2013.Investors should applaud management's decision to raise the dividend by only 1.9% this year. This is a sign of awareness regarding its short term fiscal situation as it digests the St. Jude Medical, and Alere acquisitions. Over the long term, Abbott has grown its dividend 7-9%. As the balance sheet recovers, and earnings continue to grow at a 8-10% pace, the dividend raises will once again fall in line with historical norms. The payout ratio is only about 48% of 2016 earnings, which gives Abbott Labs additional flexibility with future raise considerations.At today's close of $38.60, Abbott Labs is trading at just over 17X 2016 earnings. This represents a very solid deal compared to the S&P 500 as a whole, which trades at 19x 2016 earnings (estimated at $118) - while Abbott's forecasted earnings growth of around 10% outpaces the historical growth norms of the S&P 500 by 2-3%. Abbott's dividend yield of 2.76% also exceeds the index's dividend yield of 2.01%. Based on the growth prospects that Abbott's pending acquisitions present, its position around the world in a growing medical industry, its current valuation relative to the market, and its growing dividend- I conclude that Abbott Labs stands to outperform the S&P 500 over the long term (next 5+ years).If you liked this article, please find my profile icon at the top of this page, and hit the ""Follow"" button.

4033370,80836,2016-12-30T00:43:34-05:00,"Over the past several weeks, I was looking at medical devices companies. I analyzed both Medtronic and Becton Dickinson.
        Personally, I found Medtronic to be more suitable for my dividend growth portfolio, and I bought some more shares during December.
        In this article, I am willing to add Abbot Laboratories to the comparison in order to choose the most suitable stock for me among these three.","IntroductionOver the past several weeks I have been looking at the healthcare sector. I was looking at the medical devices segment in particular. At the moment I like this segment more than the pharmaceuticals segment. I have been analyzing both Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX), and Medtronic (NYSE:MDT). In my analysis for Medtronic, I also compared it to BDX, and I found MDT to be more attractive at the moment.In this article, I am going to add another company to the comparison. I will analyze Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), and compare it to Medtronic and Becton Dickinson. I will try to choose between the three, and to find which one is most suitable for me. I hope that my analysis will help you determine which one is most suitable to you, according to your preferences. I will use the same method I used to analyze BDX and MDT, and it is the same method I use to analyze every stock for the past several years.Abbott Laboratories manufactures and sells health care products worldwide. The company has several segments: established pharmaceutical products, diagnostic products, nutritional products, and cardiovascular products. It serves retailers, wholesalers, hospitals, health care facilities, laboratories, physicians' offices, and government agencies.FundamentalsEPS and FCF are both hard to measure here, because Abbott became a much smaller company, after the spin off of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). The spin-off shrunk Abbott significantly. However, you can see growth in both metrics over the past three years. Moreover, the outlook of the company is positive in the medium term. Analysts expect high single digits to low double digits growth in FCF and EPS in the coming years. They take into account the acquisition of St. Jude Medical (NYSE:STJ). This acquisition was approved today by the American regulators, but ABT will have to divest two segments, and I am not sure analysts and the management took this decision into consideration.Revenues also fell after the spin off, as ABBV was the larger part. ABT grew its revenues back using organic growth and acquisitions. The acquisitions help ABT to grow its sales quickly, and the acquisition of STJ will have massive effect on the top line. The growth in the top line combined with the massive cost cutting planned by the company, should have a positive effect on the bottom line.ABT Revenue (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsThe dividend payout seems high at first glance. Dividend payout ratio higher than 100% is clearly not sustainable. However, when using the FCF payout ratio, it seems more reasonable. Nevertheless, there is almost no room for dividend growth, and therefore we saw a very modest dividend raise in 2016. The acquisition of STJ should bring more room to grow the dividend. The dividend yield is most attractive among the three, and as it reaches 3%, it seems very enticing.ABT Dividend data by YChartsThe buyback is a bright spot in the fundamentals. ABT doesn't offer a massive buyback plan, but it doesn't dilute its shareholders like some of its peers. The company will need to maintain this plan as the dividend growth seems very weak at the moment.ABT Shares Outstanding data by YChartsTo be honest, I was not impressed by the fundamentals of Abbott. The whole outlook is based upon the successful merger with STJ. It was approved in the U.S with conditions, still wasn't approved in other countries, and even if it is approved, the company will have to assimilate STJ successfully. I find both MDT and BDX more attractive when looking at the fundamentals.ValuationFirst, I look at the P/E ratio and the forward P/E ratio. When taking into consideration the forecasted results for next year, ABT trades for P/E of 17.41. It might seem fair at first glance, but I don't think it is. This P/E is based on next year earning which is based on the merger with STJ and the uncertainties regarding the Alere (NYSE:ALR) deal, which ABT is trying to cancel. These two events are two uncertainties, that might have an impact on earnings. Therefore, I feel less comfortable using this metric.Even when I look at forward P/S ratio, I have to rely on assumptions regarding two major events- the acquisition of STJ and the outcome of the ALR deal, so again, it is hard to rely on it. The P/B ratio shows me that ABT is not very cheap. It trades at roughly the same ratio it traded for the past several years. With so much uncertainties and weak fundamentals in the short term, I would expect it to trade for a more attractive valuation.ABT PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsWhen looking at the cash flows, ABT suddenly looks much more expensive. Look at the charts from Fastgraphs below. While BDX seems the most attractive, ABT actually trades at far from compelling valuation. ABT is a huge brand, and therefore gets a lot of credit from investors. They might be right, but it is not enough to justify the current valuation in my opinion.While ABT has some fundamentals issues, the valuation is not reflecting it. In my book, if your fundamentals are weak, and the valuation is high, you must have some fantastic growth opportunities, and that is what I am going to look at now. So far, I believe that MDT is the best choice between the three. Strong fundamentals with fair valuation is a sweet combination.OpportunitiesThe largest opportunity is the STJ acquisition. It should have massive impact on both the top line and the bottom line of Abbott. The acquisition should have a great effect on ABT starting in 2017, and the cost cutting and synergies will accelerate the earnings growth. However, the deal still has some hurdles to pass, especially by regulators.Abbott has some fantastic blockbuster products. One of them is their amazing coronary stent. It received great reviews from healthcare professionals. As cardiovascular problems is almost an epidemic, there is more room for growth for ABT. It also gives ABT a stronger pricing power for this product and the whole segment.Abbot is also diversified across many segments as I described above. The nutritional products segment that also offers baby formulas which also serves as a growth catalyst. The diversification towards emerging markets is common in the healthcare sector, and ABT does it as well. The acquisition of STJ will make ABT even more diversified.The largest opportunity is the STJ acquisition, but there are still some uncertainties regarding it. When I compare it to MDT and BDX I don't see many advantages. Both MDT and BDX made a successful acquisition already, so the uncertainty level is lower, and therefore I find them both more attractive and stable.RisksThe largest risk at the moment is Alere (ALR). Abbott agreed to acquire ALR for almost $6 billion. However, Abbott now tries to cancel the deal and it is accusing ALR of withholding information about federal probes and of coaching witnesses to lie about its Indian operations. Alere is already facing investigations by federal prosecutors into its overseas sales practices under anti-bribery laws. Buying a company with major litigation problems is a huge risk. I always remember Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) buying Countrywide, and dealing with its wrongdoing. I am very concerned by it, and it is still full of uncertainties.The strong USD is also affecting ABT. It affects it as it affects BDX and MDT, and as the USD gets stronger, the earnings get hit harder. However, ABT has large exposure to Venezuela. Venezuela is in major economic distress, with hyper inflation, and people dying in the streets from starvation. This exposure is another major risk for the short and medium term.ABT also has to face fierce competition. It enjoys the fact that it owns some blockbusters especially in the cardiovascular and diagnostics segment. However, both segments face major competition, which will make it harder for Abbott to use its pricing power.Alere is a huge unknown, while USD and Venezuela will hurt the results, it is a manageable. The competition was always there, and will always be there. When I compare ABT to MDT and BDX, I believe that while all of them will suffer from strong USD and competition, the ALR acquisition is a huge risk, and therefore at the moment ABT is much more riskier. ConclusionAmong these three companies, ABT is my largest position. However, at the moment I wouldn't add to this position. The fundamentals are not very strong at the moment, and the valuation doesn't fit the current fundamentals. The company does have some growth opportunities, but some of them are still uncertain. The risks, and especially ALR frightens me.The bottom line is that I would expect ABT to trade at a much lower valuation. If the company drops roughly 10%, I will consider buying some more shares. The valuation must fit the fundamentals, growth opportunities and risks, and this is not the case here.When I look at the whole comparison with BDX and MDT, I still find MDT to be the most attractive, and I will gladly add even more to this position. BDX will be my second choice, but without any margin of safety, I am not sure that I will be adding more to this position."
4029275,100666,2016-12-08T14:35:10-05:00,Abbott wants to back out of the Alere acquisition.An overview of the romance and the break-up.Why Abbott had no other option than to back out of the deal.My two cents on the future of this deal.My conclusion stays the same for new investors: Stay away from Abbott and even more from Alere.,"It didn't come as a surprise for those who follow Abbott (NYSE:ABT): The company wants to back out of the Alere (NYSE:ALR) acquisition. It has filed a complaint in a Delaware court for this reason. In this article I will explain why it is logical, and in my opinion good news for Abbott shareholders.Introduction: Kramer vs. KramerDo you know the movie Kramer vs. Kramer with Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman? It won 5 Oscars in 1980. I'm not going to tell you the whole story, but it is about a couple that fights out a bitter battle in court over the custody of their child. The court proves to be an ugly purgatory of a place, in which both characters are crushed by the other party, so both come out seriously damaged.This movie was what I was thinking of following the Abbott - Alere battle, which now will continue in court: Neither party will come out unharmed, no matter what the decision of the court is.An overview of the Abbott vs. Alere romance and fightJust a short recapitulation, for those who might have missed some news or have lost their way in the news:Reasons for Abbott to get outAbbott wanted to integrate Alere in its Diagnostics department, but it has at least two reasons not to want that anymore. Depending on whose side you are on (Abbott's or Alere's), you could rank them differently in order of importance, but they are both important, no matter how you look at it.The first reason is of course the train of trouble that has surfaced in Alere: the investigation by the DOJ, the accounting troubles, EPS of $-0.46 compared to consensus $0.58 in Q2 2016 and $0.19 vs. $0.54 consensus in Q3 2016, the recall of INRatio testing because of inaccurate results etc. Do you think it is strange that Abbott wants to back out? This is the equivalent of finding out about drugs, jail and adultery after an engagement. I don't know about you, but I would want to back out.The second reason is the St. Jude acquisition. This $25B deal ($31B if you include STJ's debt) would leverage Abbott too much if combined with the Alere acquisition. Moody's was very clear about that and about their intention to downgrade Abbott, probably to Baa3.Stock pricesSo what does this mean for the stock prices? Here are the charts for Abbott and Alere in the last year.ABT data by YChartsAs you can see, both stocks are down considerably. Alere has lost about 10% compared to the pre-merger announcement, Abbott 15%. Alere even has lost more than 40% from its top just after the announcement.My two cents on the future of this dealAbbott has got buyer's remorse, and can you blame them? I find it very suspicious that Alere presses so hard to let the acquisition go through. If you have a good company, with nothing to hide, with a great confidence in your future, would you be pressing so hard to get acquired? In my eyes this can only mean that either the board wants to cash out or that Alere has something to hide. Neither are good. And seeing the problems that have come up in the last ten months alone, what else is in the trouble pipeline of Alere?Abbott will use everything in its power to back out, as we have witnessed. And I think they really have a chance in court. In his recent article, Seeking Alpha contributor Pink Sands Value Investors makes the comparison with buying a car. He says that if the contract is signed, you have to take the car, maybe with a little price cut.I disagree respectfully. If a car dealer promises you that it is a good car and that he will provide proof for it (accounting), but he fails to do that and then all sort of troubles, publicly known, come up even before the purchase itself, then I think that a judge might think it was fraud no to give that information. Especially if your car dealer (Alere) is under investigation of bribery and of cooking the books.I do understand Pink Sands' point of view, though, because normally you can not back out of such a deal easily. But the complaint of Abbott was filed in a Delaware court, which is quite important. This had advantages and disadvantages for both parties.60% of the S&P 500 companies are incorporated in Delaware. One of the most important reasons that this little state has so many companies incorporated in their state is their legal system. There is a special court, the Court of Chancery, that speaks out about corporate law disputes without a jury. The advantage for companies is that their case is judged very quickly by judges who are specialists in corporate law.The disadvantage for Abbott, and so the advantage of Alere, is that the decision will be swift. The drop-dead date for the Alere deal is in May 2017, and in any other court, this would be an opportunity to back out of the deal. Abbott has to secure the antitrust approvals, but has not taken any steps in that process yet, which would mean that the deal doesn't go through. This is in fact the ground for the lawsuit of Alere vs. Abbott.On the other hand, a Delaware Court, specialized in corporate law, is the cream of the crop and if there is one court that will not just look at history to judge about this particular deal, but to the case itself, with all its details, in which I think Abbott has got some valid points, it will be a Delaware court.Only losersI think that in this case, just as in Kramer vs. Kramer, there will only be losers and no winners. Both Alere and Abbott will come out of the case damaged. Of course, if Abbott would succeed in its attempt to get rid of Alere, the markets would be relieved and I can see Abbott's price jump up considerably. But still both companies will have failed in this case. For Alere it is very clear, I think: all the problems won't go away if the deal doesn't go through.For Abbott there is serious image damage. Is this Benjamin Graham's Steady Eddie? Were they that desperate to buy anything, without examining the books from beginning to end? Couldn't they foresee at least some of the trouble? This doesn't give much confidence for the average investor of Abbott. That investor wants a quality company, not that of a bunch of amateurs throwing around with borrowed money. Sources from within Alere said that CEO Miles White said that if Alere didn't take the $50M break-up fee, he would make life a 'living hell for everyone at Alere'. Not so smart if you have been in the news recently over an Abbott salesperson who has committed suicide because of the huge pressure of Abbott.ConclusionI think that Abbott has a fair chance of backing out of the deal. Its stock price could go up considerably then, but with the troubles at St. Jude (the hacking thesis of Muddy Waters) and the desperate search for growth after the AbbVie split-off, I stay with the conclusion of my previous article on Abbott: Until management shows some more consistency and thoroughness, I stay away from Abbott.Mind you, though, that is from the perspective of an investor who has not yet an investment in Abbott. If you have been a shareholder for a long time, and you are patient, I wouldn't sell over this. I think that with the St. Jude acquisition, Abbott could go back to growth. But for a new investor this is still too uncertain.As for Alere: Even if I got shares of Alere for free, I would sell them as quickly as I could.If you found this article interesting, and you want to be updated about my analyses about Abbott, please hit the follow button on the top of the page next to my name.In the meantime, keep growing!"
4019489,63883,2016-11-04T05:02:34-04:00,,"This post was written by Bob Ciura on November 3, 2016, for Sure DividendAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a major healthcare company with a long operating history. Abbott started all the way back in 1888, when physician and drug store owner Dr. Wallace C. Abbott started making his own scientifically formulated medications with the goal of improving patient care.In the many decades since, Abbott has grown into a $57 billion company by market cap, with more than $20 billion in annual sales.Abbott is a tried-and-true dividend stock. The company has paid 371 consecutive quarterly dividends without interruption. That is a 92-year streak of consistent dividends.The company also spun off fellow dividend growth healthcare stock AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) in 2013. AbbVie currently has a 4.0% yield - which is especially high for an established healthcare business.And, Abbott has increased its shareholder payout in each of the past 44 years. This makes Abbott one of only 50 Dividend Aristocrats - stocks with 25+ years of rising dividends. You can see the list of all 50 Dividend Aristocrats here.With a 2.7% dividend yield, Abbott stock is a worthwhile consideration for dividend growth investors. Keep reading this article to learn more about the investment prospects of Abbott.Business OverviewAbbott's business model is broken up into four operating segments. These are:The company has a strong foothold in each of its four categories. In the nutrition business, its core brands include Ensure, Glucerna and Similac. Abbott launched 38 new nutrition products last year alone.The medical devices segment includes Abbott's vascular, medical optics and diabetes care businesses. Each of these businesses generates at least $1 billion in annual revenue.Source: 2015 Annual Report, page 23In the diagnostics business, Abbott operates several key brands, with six new systems in development for future growth.Source: 2015 Annual Report, page 27Abbott's pharmaceuticals business has more than 1,500 products in its portfolio. It sells pharmaceutical products in more than 90 countries around the world.Abbott's fundamentals are quite strong. Its organic revenue, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, grew 9.1% last year. Earnings per share, adjusted for one-time costs and divestitures, increased 9% in 2015.The company's performance this year is also strong. Organic revenue increased 5.2% through the first nine months of 2016.Growth ProspectsA very promising growth catalyst for Abbott moving forward is expansion in the international markets. Approximately 69% of Abbott's sales come from outside the U.S.Source: 2015 Annual Report, page 31Within its international business, Abbott has placed particular focus on emerging markets. This is a good strategy, since healthcare spending and economic growth in underdeveloped regions are likely to exceed those in developed markets like the U.S. and Europe.In addition to its geographic focus, the other major growth catalyst for Abbott is its product focus. Abbott has positioned its product portfolio specifically to capitalize on the aging global population. Abbott's nutrition business is its largest operating segment, and for a good reason.According to Abbott, the 65-and-over population will increase 180% by 2050.Abbott has achieved what it believes to be an optimal portfolio mix, largely through acquisitions and divestitures. For example, Abbott acquired St. Jude Medical this year for $25 billion. The acquisition instantly boosts Abbott' medical devices business.Analysts, on average, expect Abbott to grow earnings per share by 2.3% this year. Growth is expected to accelerate to 11% in 2017.Competitive Advantages & Recession PerformanceA key competitive advantage for Abbott is its strong brand portfolio. Abbott enjoys a leadership position across each of its four operating segments, particularly in nutrition. Led by its flagship Ensure product, Abbott controls more than 50% of the adult nutrition category.Abbott's diversification is another competitive advantage. The company offers more than 10,000 products, which encompass all stages of life.Source: 2015 Annual Report, page 12Going forward, it will be critical for Abbott to continue investing in R&D, to keep competition at bay. Last year, Abbott increased R&D expense by 4.5% to $1.41 billion. This is strategically important for the company to ensure innovation.As a global healthcare giant with significant scale, Abbott is highly profitable. It remained highly profitable during the Great Recession. The company actually managed to grow earnings per share during the depths of the recession:From 2007-2010, Abbott increased earnings per share by 47%. Few companies can match that kind of growth during one of the deepest recessions in history. Abbott has a highly recession-resistant business model, which is another competitive advantage.Valuation & Expected Total ReturnAbbott stock has an adjusted price-to-earnings ratio of around 20. The stock is considerably cheaper than the S&P 500 Index, which has an average price-to-earnings ratio of 24.5. Abbott investors buying in at the current price may see significant value creation through multiple expansion.Aside from an expanding price-to-earnings ratio, Abbott's future expected returns will be made up of the following:Earnings per share growth will be achieved through a combination of revenue growth and share repurchases. Revenue could realistically increase 6-8% per year on an organic basis, plus additional bolt-on growth through acquisitions. Abbott will also continue to repurchase shares, likely at a rate of 1-2% per year.As a result, it is reasonable for investors to expect 10.7-12.7% annualized returns, plus or minus any expansion or contraction of the price-to-earnings ratio.Final ThoughtsAbbott has struck a good mix among its product portfolio. It is highly diversified and has a strong presence in stable categories. This should provide the company with consistent growth so that it can continue increasing its dividend each year.Abbott has increased its annual dividend consecutively for more than four decades. It also raises its dividend at high rates from year to year. This year, Abbott hiked its dividend by a healthy 8.3%.It is likely that the company can continue increasing its dividend by high-single digit rates moving forward. It has a modest payout ratio. Going by adjusted earnings per share, Abbott distributes slightly less than half of its annual profits.As a result, Abbott stock looks like a solid buy for dividend growth investors. The company garners a high rank using The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing, thanks to its reasonable payout ratio, above average dividend yield, solid total returns and stability."
4013140,21877,2016-10-19T11:29:06-04:00,,"A big deal often necessitates big divestments. To satisfy antitrust rules on their $25bn merger, Abbott (NYSE:ABT) and St. Jude Medical (NYSE:STJ) are to sell several of their vascular closure and electrophysiology devices to Terumo (OTCPK:TRUMY), Japan’s largest medtech company, for around $1.12bn in cash.Terumo has been pursuing a fairly aggressive growth strategy, strengthening its endovascular and neurovascular portfolios, as well as its overseas footprint, through acquisitions. Most recently it bought Sequent Medical, a specialist in aneurysm embolization technology, for $380m. With today’s much larger deal it appears to be making a determined effort to become a major vascular player.Pass the parcelThe deal will see Terumo pick up St. Jude’s Angio-Seal and Femoseal vascular plugs and Abbott’s Vado sheath, used to facilitate catheter placement through the skin into a vein or artery.St. Jude’s vascular closure devices brought in $283m in 2015, according to data compiled by EvaluateMedTech, but sales are forecast to shrink by 4% annually out to 2022. Abbott is keeping its vascular closure products. Sale of these are not much larger – around $355m in 2015 – but are forecast to grow at an annual rate of 5% to reach $497m in 2022.Perhaps Terumo can make more of St. Jude’s devices. Certainly this was never a major priority for the Saint Paul, Minnesota company, which has always been better known for its pacemakers and implanted defibrillators than its vascular technologies.Terumo, by contrast, has been going big on vascular. The Sequent deal this July brought it the Web, a mesh implant inserted under general anaesthetic via a microcatheter through the femoral artery and into the brain. Its prior outright acquisition, of Onset Medical in 2012, allowed it to enter the global structural heart and aneurysmal repair markets, with technologies that could be used in complex, large-bore procedures including transcatheter aortic valve implantation and endovascular aneurysm repair.Terumo will have to do a good few more acquisitions like this before it gets anywhere close to the size of the company that will be created when the Abbott-St. Jude deal closes in the next couple of months.The combined group could end up being the third-largest company by medical technology sales – Abbott currently holds seventh place in this ranking – and will compete in nearly every area of the cardiovascular market, from atrial fibrillation to cardiac rhythm management.It is hard to gauge the effect this deal will have on Terumo’s standing in the overall rankings or in the area of vascular technologies, since the exact details of which technologies will be transferred, and how much exactly these sell, are not clear. But it could jump significantly; Terumo had sales of $3.9bn in 2015, and if it can sell these products more effectively than the less focused St. Jude and Abbott it could enter the top 20.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4007332,21877,2016-09-20T11:52:17-04:00,,"Abbott has been on a spending spree this year, but now it is selling, offloading its medical optics division to Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) for $4.33bn in cash. The reasons for Abbott’s (NYSE:ABT) move are clear: recent acquisitions have honed its focus on cardiovascular devices and diagnostics, and ophthalmology was surplus to requirements.J&J’s reasons for buying seem less compelling. The company calls eye care “one of the largest, fastest-growing and most underserved segments in healthcare today”, but this is belied by recent financial results from its own vision care unit, plus Abbott Medical Optics and the ophthalmology rival Alcon (see table below). J&J obviously believes that it can use its number-one position in contact lenses to do better than Abbott.The buy will give J&J a bigger consumer offering, with the addition of eye drops and cleaning systems, but also a foothold in cataract surgery and laser eye correction.J&J cited the cataract offering as a particularly important driver of the deal, describing the issue as the number one cause of preventable blindness, and estimating that around 20 million people are blind from age-related cataracts and that at least 100 million eyes are affected.And the number of cases will only grow with the aging population, something J&J will likely be banking on for sales growth.But Abbott’s medical optics unit has had mixed fortunes of late. Sales shrank in 2015, mainly owing to unfavorable exchange rates, but have picked up in the first half of this year. J&J vision care has seen a similar trend, and also blamed currency effects for its poor showing in 2015.The same cannot be said for Novartis’ Alcon division which, although much bigger than J&J and Abbott’s offerings combined, continues to shrink. The pressure has been on Alcon to turn its fortunes around: Novartis’s restructuring in March, which saw its ophthalmic pharmaceuticals franchise move from Alcon to the pharmaceuticals division, fueled the idea that the unit might be on the auction block.But, with J&J now out of the picture, Novartis could find it even more difficult to find a buyer. Like Abbott, Alcon markets contact lenses, cataract surgery devices and systems for laser eye surgery, but has something extra in the form of a minimally invasive glaucoma surgery (MIGS) device through the acquisition of Transcend Medical (Novartis hopes Transcend buy will relieve the pressure on Alcon, February 18, 2016).MIGS looks promising, but whether this will be enough to save Alcon is another matter.Abbott, meanwhile, seems to have got the best of the latest deal – the group’s shares closed up 2% on Friday when it was announced. This is the fourth-biggest medtech acquisition of 2016 so far, and is slated to close in the first quarter.J&J is such a big beast, and vision care such a small part of its portfolio, that the purchase did not move the needle on its stock. But it is interesting that it is expanding in ophthalmology while others are getting out. It will have to hope that demographic trends translate into more cataract surgery revenue – something that is not certain with increasing payer pushback."
4007181,101988,2016-09-19T23:19:04-04:00,"Johnson & Johnson has just acquired Abbott's medical optics unit for $4.3 billion in cash.The move positions JNJ as a player in the vision business, complementing its current portfolio.Overall, JNJ will have some work to do with Abbott's medical optics unit, but the acquisition is ambitious. The author recommends to buy JNJ on its growth prospects.","Company IntroductionJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the largest company in healthcare, operating in three business segments - consumer, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The company owns some of the most well known brands in healthcare, including Band-Aid and Tylenol. Its medical device offers a range of products used in orthopedic, surgery, cardiovascular, diabetes care and vision care fields. In this article, the author will try to dissect the company's acquisition of Abbott Laboratories' vision business, and its impact on the company's short term and long term share prices.Company Key FactsShare price: $118.25 per shareMarket cap: $319.31 billionDividend: 80 cents per shareYTD Performance: 15.12% capital gainsCredit Rating: AAA (only other company with such prestigious rating is Microsoft)Acquisition and FutureOn Friday, Johnson & Johnson announced the acquisition of Abbott's (NYSE:ABT) medical optics unit for $4.3 billion in cash. The acquisition can be summed as a win for both sides as Abbott wishes to part ways with its weakest business segment, and Johnson & Johnson wishes to enter into the underserved eye care market.The deal was announced on Friday, September 16, 2016, and is expected to fully close by the first quarter of 2017. For Johnson & Johnson, Abbott's vision business is an entry to the eye care market, but not immediately. In fact, sells have been stalling for the business' current devices, with margin shrinking to a very mediocre 11% and a Compound Annual Growth Rate (OTC:CAGR) of 4%, which is very low for the healthcare business. (In comparison, JNJ's margin is nearly 70% and Abbott around 55%)Abbott's Vision Business and The Eye Care MarketAbbott's former vision division provides surgeons with eye diagnostics and surgical tools. Of these tools, the main function of the medical device is to surgically treat myopia (Nearsightedness) or hyperopia(Farsightedness). In addition, the device is capable of replacing the cornea (curing vision bluriness) for older patients.Currently, the vision market is one of the most underserved markets in health care, and Johnson & Johnson is purchasing the business unit in order to seek growth in the area. However, the stalling sales and low growth rate in Abbott's former division indicates that the devices may be on the decline or technologically out of date. In order to truly dominate the area, Johnson & Johnson would need to restructure the division in order to create more favorable and newer devices through significant R&D efforts. Whether the company could achieve this is anyone's guess.What It Means For Investors in JNJOverall, this is a bold and ambitious move for JNJ, which would likely come to fruition in four to eight years if everything moves well. For investors, this business segment may be a small drag on the company for the short term, since both its division margin (11%) and annual growth rate (4%) is on the low end for medical devices. However, given the division's size (4.3B) relative to the entire company (300B+), the drag on share prices should be negligible, and any move beyond 1% may indicate an over reaction by the market.For long term investors, the purchase is a signal for JNJ's ambitions in the eye care market, and may signal more acquisitions of similar companies yet to come. The news is generally positive for long term investors.ConclusionPurchasing Abbott's vision division is good news for Johnson & Johnson and its growth plans. The division purchased is not doing well financially, but that may change as JNJ uses his financial strength to put forth more R&D efforts. All in all, look to purchase JNJ on weakness, especially if it comes from news in connection with the acquisition."
4010353,101475,2016-10-05T13:21:39-04:00,Abbott is a well diversified healthcare company offering business stability.The company is less exposed to political noises than peers.The company will benefit from cost synergies and cross selling opportunities following its recent acquisitions.Valuations are compelling and EPS estimates are still below what the company could deliver.,"Company overviewAbbott (NYSE:ABT) is a globally diversified healthcare company, headquartered in the US. The company develops, manufactures and sells a broad range of pharmaceuticals and nutrition products, medical devices and diagnostic instruments. The group employs over 74,000 employees and runs operations in more than 150 countries. Abbott operates four business segments: Nutritionals; Medical devices; Diagnostics and Established Pharmaceuticals Products (EPD).Nutritionals (34% of sales): This business segment includes a broad range of pediatric and adult nutritional products. The large range of products covers a large scope of users and needs. It includes healthy infants, children and adults but also chronically-ill patients. Abbott owns several brands; among the most famous we find Similac, PediaSure, Elecare, Glucerna, Ensure…Medical devices (25% of sales): This division encompasses a large range of cardiovascular instruments that cover a broad line of coronary, endovascular, vessel closure and structural heart devices. Outside of vascular products, Abbott is also present in diabetes care with a large range of blood glucose monitor. The sub-segment Vision (cataract surgery, Laser vision correction, dry eye products) has been recently sold to JNJ (more about the transaction later).Diagnostics (23% of sales): This business segment incorporates instrument systems and reagents used in diagnostics of different indications such as cancers, fertility, drug abuse, infectious diseases. The principal brands are PRISM, ARCHITECT and CELL DYN.EPD (18% of sales): This segment is comprised of branded generics sold in emerging markets. The developed markets branded generics have been sold to Mylan (MYL).Diversification is a key to business stabilityHealthcare actors are under more and more scrutiny from regulators and payers about their pricing policy. Companies implementing unjustified price increase or selling high-priced drugs with no added-value clearly become an ""enemy"" of the healthcare system that payers want to eliminate.Several actions have already been implemented to face this problem. From the private payer side, we could mention the increasing use of restrictions lists, the increase in required discounts… On the other end, the public is shifting from a ""fee for service"" business model to a ""value-oriented"" one, not based anymore on volume alone, but on final outcomes. For example, hospitals were paid a fee for each act that they dispensed to a patient. With the new business model, hospitals are paid a lump sum that covers all the acts that the patient needs. If hospitals are successful to treat the patient more efficiently and with lower costs than the bundle payment, they keep the difference and realize a profit; otherwise they make a loss. Moreover, hospitals are penalized if the readmission rate is too high in order to prevent hospitals from making profits to the detriment of patients.The current US election acts as an additional headwind, especially for companies exposed to raising price drugs and / or with a large exposure to Medicare because of potential new restrictive regulation.Abbott's well-balanced business profile and its large global presence are a key element to assure the business stability. Indeed, Abbott is not reliant on any single therapy, technology, country or payer. The group generates 70% of its sales outside the US, with fast-growing markets representing 50% of revenues. Moreover, 50% of sales are directly generated from customers.Miles White, CEO with a very good track recordMiles White joined the company in 1984 and spent 15 years running the diagnostic division before becoming CEO. During his mandate, he undertook several M&A operations and spin-offs in order to maximize shareholders' value.The following operations are those which stand out the most:- The sale of developed market generics: This business was sold to Mylan in 2014 in order to strengthen its emerging markets branded generics business via the acquisition of VeroPharm (2014) and CFR Pharmaceuticals (2015).- The spin-off of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) and Hospira (NYSE:HSP) in order to maximize the value of these assets.- The sale of the Advanced Medical Optics (AMO) assets to Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) for $4.325B. This transaction happened recently and will be the focus of a further section.The only criticism that I may think is about the Teva (NYSE:TEVA) / Mylan operations. Abbott did not support the Teva deal and refused to sell its participation in Mylan, valued at $2.93B. The participation is not strategic, thus it would have been a great opportunity to sell the stock at around $80 in the open market (the stock trades currently at around $42).The nutritional businessInvestors are worried about the future perspectives of the nutritional business following the recent slowdown, especially in China. Indeed, China was growing double-digit for a while but has slowed down to a mid-single digit growth rate. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) estimates that over the last 5 years, nutrition accounted for 50% of the 4% company organic growth and 300 bps over the 450 bps of margin expansion.What is going on?The Chinese regulator has issued new directives (implementation postponed in 2018) requiring every infant formula producer to comply with new procedures and requirements such as the registration of recipes, labeling restrictions and product descriptions. Moreover, the new regulation has tighter quality standards that limit the maximum production per factory which clearly benefits large players. As a result, smaller producers have boosted their production to consume their remaining stocks and are aggressively pushing to liquidate their stocks that they won't be able to sell after 2018.In the short term, this situation is negative because Abbott will probably offer discounts to maintain its existing market share. Over the medium term (post 2018), Abbott will be able to leverage its leading position to gain market share when smaller players exit the market.Moreover, over the long term, the relaxation of the one-child policy is a positive long-term catalyst for the sector. Finally, the company thinks that it can still improve its margins in this segment as it has successfully done in the past.(Source: Abbott presentation during the 34th JP Morgan healthcare conference)In conclusion, I think that the company will be able to grow revenues and earnings from this division, maybe at a slower pace than in the past, but it still remains a very good business.Medical devices: St. Jude Medical is a right step.Abbott has acquired St. Jude Medical (NYSE:STJ) on 28th April 2016 (the transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016). St. Jude Medical is a medical devices company active in four clinical areas that include cardiac rhythm management, atrial fibrillation, cardiovascular and neuromodulation. The group employs roughly 18000 people all over the world. The company generates $ 5.5B revenues, which are equally split between the US and the rest of the world.The deal has valued the company at almost $25B, as of the announcement date. The deal is structured as a cash and stock transaction, in which St. Jude shareholders will receive $46.75 in cash and 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock. According to the management, the deal is EPS accretive, with approximately $0.21 of accretion in 2017 and $0.29 in 2018.A quick look at numbers shows that this target seems realistic. Indeed, $125M cost synergies represent only 4.5% of St. Jude 2015 operating expenses. However, St. Jude's 2017 revenue expectations could be a bit high because it assumes a 7% CAGR over the 2015/2017 period. Overall, I think these two elements offset and justify a $0.21 accretion in 2017.(Source: Bloomberg consensus & own estimates)From a strategic point of view, this deal really makes sense because it will strengthen the Medical devices division. Indeed, both companies have highly complementary portfolios with almost no overlaps. The combined portfolio will provide the required scale to compete in the new challenging healthcare environment as showed by the following slides.(Source: Company presentation)On the negative side, Muddy Waters published a report claiming that St. Jude's implantable cardiac devices are not adequately protected against hacking threats. This report is supported by an ""Independent firm"" called MedSec, whose remuneration is closely related to the profits earned on the transaction initiated by the hedge fund.From the Muddy Waters Research report:Muddy Waters uses only one external advisor (MedSec) to support the accuracy of its allegations and I think if it was right about the hacking problem (and its consequences), it would have presented its data to other professionals to better support its allegations. However, this announcement should remain an overhang on the stock until we have a confirmation that there is no major issue or that the problems are benign.Medical devices: Ophthalmology business saleThe company has announced the sale of its AMO ophthalmology business to JNJ for $4.3B. The business was acquired in 2009 for $2.7B. This business was a mid/high single-digit revenue grower and had below the average operating margin (around 15%). According to the management, this divestiture should result in an EPS dilution of $ 0.11 in 2017. However, the deal allowed the company to avoid raising $3B equity to fund the Alere and St. Jude acquisitions, which could result in a $0.11 EPS dilution.The company's strategy is clearly focused on developing cardiovascular devices and expanding diagnostics, thus others business is potentially for sale if it does not have the critical size or does not improve the growth & financial profile (diabetes?).Diagnostics division: Alere deal or not?Alere is a global diagnostics company acquired by Abbott for $5.8B on February 2016. The purpose of this transaction is to create a leading diagnostic provider of point-of-care testing.Half of Alere's $2.5B sales are realized outside of the US. The business is split into 4 segments: cardiology (34% of sales), infectious diseases (29% of sales), toxicology (25% of sales) and consumer diagnostics & other (12% of sales).The company is a complementary asset for Abbott, not only providing complementary products but also offering direct access to new distribution channels and clients. Indeed, Alere will complement the leading position of Abbott in the immunoassay infectious diseases with its leading portfolio of point of care infectious disease. Then, it will provide Abbott new exposure such as the chronic care monitoring market or international point of care market. Moreover, Abbott will be able to sell Alere's products in new locations (Abbott is present in 150 countries vs. 100+ for Alere) and to realize costs synergies (supply chain optimization, general & administrative costs, marketing costs…).This deal is highly controversial since Alere failed to fill its annual report on time. This delay was the result of necessary restatement following aggressive revenue recognition over the past few years. More explanations are provided in the 10-K statement that you can find just below.(Source: Alere annual report 10K)As a result, Abbott has proposed to pay a termination fee up to $50M for canceling the deal. Alere has refused this offer which gives two possible scenarios: litigation or renegotiation (initial price or termination fee). Unfortunately, it is impossible to forecast the outcome of such events, but we can at least evaluate the different scenarios:1) The deal does not close and Abbott pays no termination fee: It is clearly one of the best scenarios because Abbott will be able to walk away and focus on St. Jude's integration. Moreover, it will able to deleverage even faster.2) The deal does not close and Abbott pays a termination fee. Considering the 1.47B shares outstanding, the initial termination fee of $50M would impact the share price by $0.03. Even a $500M termination fee will impact the share price by only $0.34 (even less when considering the tax gain). As before, in this scenario Abbott can focus on its core business and the deleveraging process.3) The deal closes and the initial term agreement is respected ($56 per Alere's share for a total of $5.8B). It is the most debatable result because the success depends on the management's ability to integrate Alere. If the integration is as planned, the deal should be EPS accretive. The management guides for approximately $0.12/$0.13 accretion in 2017 and more than $0.20 in 2018, assuming pre-tax synergies of $500M by 2019. The following table, based on Bloomberg consensus, shows that accretion levels are reasonable if Alere's problems are not as big as feared and Abbott's management is able to fix them quickly.(Source: Bloomberg consensus & own estimates)4) The deal closes and the initial agreement is renegotiated. This scenario will be more favorable than the previous one, assuming the same business development. The following table shows the different level of accretion for potential renegotiation price, always assuming a 100% cash offer financed 100% by debt at a 3.5% rate (All the other assumptions are the same as in the previous table).(Source: own estimates)The level of accretion is not much affected by the price paid because interest costs do not change a lot in absolute terms (roughly $60M for a combined entity generating $25.4B revenue and 4.7B profit before tax).NB: Revenue and operating income forecasts come from consensus and I am somehow skeptical about the $470M EBIT in 2017 for Alere which is far higher than the level of previous years (in a $150M/200M range). However, even a 2017 EBIT of only $200M for Alere will still be $0.01 EPS accretive (with the same assumptions and no incremental synergies). Therefore, I think digesting this deal will not be a problem for Abbott.Margin expansionThe following table shows that Abbott has lower operating margin than medical devices companies, which could be justified by its business mix. However, the implicit EBIT margin (based on Abbott's business mix) is around 18%. Abbott is still below it and I see no reason why its operating margin will remain below peers' margin.(Source: Bloomberg)The company has been able to increase its operating margin since 2012, from 10.8% to 16.5%, despite the challenging environment (strengthening of the USD versus international currencies, economic slowdown in emerging markets due to falling commodities price…). This improvement has been possible because of several costs reduction initiatives. Indeed, the management has chosen to install local manufacturing facilities in India, China and Russia for its nutritional division. Portfolio management has also been a driver of this improvement with the divestiture of the developed markets branded generics division to Mylan.Margins should keep increasing in the near future thanks to additional proactive measures taken by the management. Indeed, Abbott has recently sold its ophthalmologic division which was below company operating margin. Moreover, the group wants to strengthen its existing positions, as we have seen with the St. Jude and Alere acquisitions, in order to reach the critical size and improve the profitability with synergies (not just cost-related, but also from cross selling opportunities).ValuationIt would be unwise to embark on a DCF model due to the countless assumptions required to value Abbott, especially concerning the pending acquisitions. However, a quick look at different valuation metrics shows that Abbott is undervalued.(Source: Bloomberg)Abbott is one of the cheapest medical devices companies. However, its business profile is not 100% medtech. The right hand table shows what would be the implicit valuation (based on peers' valuation) for a business profile similar to Abbott.Please note that the Medical devices and diagnostics segments are trading at higher multiples than the nutrition and EPD business units. Therefore, if the pending acquisitions close, the higher exposure to the Medical devices and diagnostics segment will justify some expansion in multiples.Now, we just need to understand whether this relative undervaluation is justified by a lower growth profile or by more business volatility.(Source: Bloomberg)Despite a slightly higher EPS volatility over the last 5 years, we can't conclude that its business is materially more volatile than peers (keep also in mind that EPS volatility results also from its exposure to emerging currencies fluctuations). The 360-day stock price volatility supports this conclusion. Concerning the EPS growth, consensus expects 7% CAGR over the period 2015/2017, which is in line with peers but there are two important points to highlight:Remember that Abbott management guides for a double-digit 2017 EPS growth. Moreover, management expects $0.21 EPS accretion from St. Jude deal. Then, even if it is more controversial, Abbott has guided initially for a $0.12/0.13 2017 EPS accretion coming from Alere. Finally, Abbott expects a $ 0.11 dilution from the AMO sale and argues that it does not need to raise equity following this transaction, which would have been $ 0.07 dilutive. If the Alere deal does not close, Abbott will initiate a share buyback to eliminate the dilution coming from the AMO sale.The following table shows what could be 2017 EPS if the St. Jude and Alere deal close and the AMO sale proceeds are used to reduce the debt required for both deal.(Source: Bloomberg consensus & own estimates)First point, current 2017 EPS estimate is at $2.45. I think that the St. Jude deal has high probability to close, thus we may conclude that minimum 2017 EPS should be around $2.60 (2016 EPS of $2.20 growing at 10% in 2017 + $0.21 accretion from St. Jude - AMO $ 0.11 dilution offset by the cash proceed from AMO). In this scenario, consensus should increase its forecast by at least 6% (from $2.45 to $2.60).Second point, Abbott has a good and long track record in terms of company integration. Moreover, synergies targets do not look very aggressive, thus we could see even larger earnings revisions.Conclusion:Abbott has a diversified business profile offering business stability even during difficult times. This kind of profile is more or less immune to political noise concerning drug pricing or Medicare exposure. The company is reshaping its portfolio with two pending acquisitions, which bring uncertainty and create a buying opportunity. We believe that management will be able to smoothly integrate those targets given the complementary fit of these assets with the current portfolio. Moreover, Abbott has so far a strong track record in terms of acquisitions. These acquisitions will also provide many levers (cross selling & cost synergies) to improve the group margins and earnings potential. Investors have not adjusted their earnings estimates yet, making it a good time to buy, ahead of earnings revisions. Finally, you invest in one of the cheapest stocks of its category that offers an interesting growth profile."
4006919,25120,2016-09-18T21:42:21-04:00,"Abbott Laboratories is selling its vision care business in order to increase focus and reduce leverage.2016 has been a busy year so far, driven by the troubled ""purchase"" of Alere and the huge acquisition of St. Jude Medical.I see GAAP earnings potential of $2 per share going forward, implying that shares trade at a modest premium to the market.This premium is warranted given the dividend aristocracy and excellent organic growth resulting from large overseas operations.","Abbott Laboratories (ABT) has been very active with regard to M&A this year. The company made a major move when it announced the purchase of St. Jude Medical earlier this year, as it seems that it is trying to get out under its previous agreement to acquire Alere. In order to bring more focus to its business, and reduce leverage going forward, it has now decided to shed some sizable non-core assets.I can appreciate this move as increased focus and a reduction of leverage is welcomed, while the divestiture is not expected to have a real impact on earnings per share. Shares now trade an earnings multiple in the low-twenties and leverage is very reasonable. The main attraction of Abbott remains the presence in overseas markets. While these businesses are really showing solid growth, much has been masked by the strong dollar.Keeping An Eye On LeverageFollowing recent acquisitions, Abbott decided that now came the time to sell some assets, in part to deleverage the balance sheet. It has agreed to sell its Medical Optics business to Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) for $4.325 billion in cash.The company itself rationalizes the sale through its new strategy. As Abbott is too small to operate in all the markets in which it is currently active, it has decided to built out its leading positions in cardiovascular devices and diagnostics. The company simply does not have the resources to built out a vision care business as well.According to CEO Miles White, the sale will not have an impact on the targeted earnings per share for 2017, as the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. While Abbott´s press release did not contain any financial numbers regarding the Medical Optics operations, the press release of Johnson & Johnson indicated that the business generates $1.1 billion in revenues per year. This implies that Abbott received a near 4 times sales multiple for the business.Busy & Challenged M&A StrategyThere are a lot of moving parts for Abbott Laboratories at the moment resulting from (potentially) three deals. It all started with the $5.8 billion acquisition of Alere which has been troubled from the start.Abbott originally planned to acquire Alere in order to boost its diagnostics business, one of the focal areas for the business going forward. While the strategic nature of that deal makes sense, I was never a big fan of the business. Including the fairly elevated debt load of Alere, the enterprise valuation came in closer to $7 billion. While this can be justified by a revenue base of $2.5 billion, revenues were not growing while operating margins came in at just mid-single digits. The deal was justified by projected synergies of $500 million per year, but that seems quite optimistic, equivalent to 20% of sales.Abbott tried to get out of the deal following probes into overseas activities of Alere as well as unlawful billing practices. Doubt about the deal increased even more when Abbott announced the $30 billion purchase of St. Jude Medical (STJ), the maker of cardiovascular medical devices. Abbott was looking to finance this deal with $19.5 billion in cash and by assuming debt, as the remainder of the sum would be financed with 256 million new shares. For the $30 billion price tag, Abbott would boost its overall business with a business which generates revenues of $6 billion and reports margins of around 20%. Abbott anticipated $500 million in potential synergies down the road from the St. Jude deal as well.While this deal looks to be completed, Abbott still has some challenges with regards to this deal as well. Short sellers claimed that St. Jude´s devices have big security flaws. For now, this situation appears to be a storm in glass of water.Pro-Forma ImpactIf we assume that the Alere deal does not close, all signs regarding this deal are on red. This leaves the purchase of St. Jude´s which carries a $19.5 billion cash & debt component and the issuance of 256 million shares. If we subtract the $4.3 billion cash proceeds for the Medical Optics business, net cash investments from 2016´s M&A come in at $15.2 billion. The company announced alongside the St. Jude deal that it would raise another $3 billion in capital by issuing roughly 75 million shares. This means that compared to the second quarter balance sheet, St. Jude will take on additional net debt of $12.2 billion, as some 331 million shares will be issued as well.For this kind of money, Abbott may add the $6 billion in revenues generated by St. Jude, offset by a lost $1.1 billion sales contribution from the vision care business.Abbott is pretty much a $21 billion business split across nutrition, diagnostics, pharmaceutical and medical services. Following dealmaking, revenues will grow towards $26 billion on a pro-forma basis, as it is expanding in the areas which are designated as growth areas by the company. The company itself reported operating profits of $3 billion on its $21 billion revenue base. Adjusted operating profits come in closer to $4 billion a year. While part of the adjustments seem fair, as it related to one-time costs such as bridge facility fees, other costs like amortization charges are structural.For that reason I will use a $3.5 billion operating profit number for the core of the business. If I add the $1.2 billion operating profit contribution from St. Jude, up to $500 million in potential synergies from the deal, while subtracting a modest $100-$200 million profit contribution from Medical Optics, I arrive at GAAP operating profits of $5 billion on a pro-forma basis.The company ended the second quarter with $4.5 billion in cash and equivalents, although that number excludes equity investments. Note that the company still held a $3.3 billion investment in Mylan, although the value of that has come under some pressure in recent weeks. The company holds $8.9 billion in regular debt, and another $2-3 billion in pension related liabilities.If we add all this together, I see net debt at roughly $3-4 billion ahead of dealmaking. Given the $15 billion net cash component from the St. Jude deal and Medical Optics, net debt comes in around $20 billion. Of course we have to subtract the $3 billion equity issue from this, for a net debt load of $17 billion.Assuming a blended 4% cost of debt, I see interest costs at $700 million a year, leaving profits before taxes of roughly $4.3 billion. Assuming an effective tax rate of 20%, given R&D tax credits and overseas earnings, net earnings might come in at roughly $3.5 billion.Including the dilution, the outstanding share base will increase to some 1.82 billion shares, for potential earnings of up to $2 per share. At current levels of $42 per share, equity hereby trades at a 21-22 times earnings multiple.Using the $5 billion operating earnings number, and adding in roughly $3 billion in depreciation and amortization charges or perhaps a bit higher, leverage is very manageable. An $8-9 billion EIBTDA number results in a leverage factor of little of 2 times adjusted EBITDA, a very manageable debt load given the diversity and stable businesses.Note that the calculation above is focused on GAAP earnings, as I would not blindly trust Abbott´s non-GAAP numbers. The company guides for GAAP earnings of $1.26-$1.36 per share this year, while non-GAAP earnings are seen at $2.14-$2.24 per share. This suggests that GAAP earnings currently run at just 60% of adjusted earnings. While some fees are transient, related to bridge fees and M&A expenses, some expenses are very real including stock-based compensation and amortization charges.No Imminent AppealAbbott´s appeal mostly results from diversity, presence in long term growth market and a generally stable business performance, at least in my eyes. This growth, diversification and a 2.5% dividend yield are key reasons why investors like the shares, having traded in a $36-$46 range over the past year, now trading in the middle of that range.In case the St. Jude deal works out fine, and synergies are realized, I think that the business has real earnings power of around $2 per share, based on GAAP accounting. I like the latest divestment, and assuming that the Alere deal does not go through, leverage is very manageable at around 2 times EBITDA.The issue is what kind of multiple one would like to attach to such a business. I am well aware that medical device makers and niche players trade at +20 and sometimes 30 times earnings multiples, that simply seems a bit rich. While topline sales were up just 2.8% in the second quarter, it should be said that two-thirds of Abbott´s revenues are generated abroad, although the St. Jude Medical deal will reduce this percentage. Growth continues to be hampered by the strong dollar; in constant currency terms growth comes in around 7% per year.Adding it all together, the current valuation seems fair as the deleveraging move makes sense, with Abbott continuing to focus on the core. While the current earnings yield only approaches 5%, solid rates of organic growth and long term tailwinds in end markets should support the valuation and investment thesis. While shares are fairly valued at these levels and long term investors should come out ahead, there is no rush to blindly buy into the stock at these levels."
4003688,101378,2016-09-01T16:54:04-04:00,"Abbott Labs' star crossed Alere acquisition is now mired in litigation.
        Alere says Abbott is suffering from ""buyer's remorse"".
        Abbott says it's a ""publicity stunt"".
        It may be an effort to frame the facts to minimize class action liability.","IntroductionOn February 1, 2016, Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) and Alere (NYSE:ALR) signed onto a controversial deal whereby Abbott Labs agreed to acquire Alere for $5.8 billion. in late April 2016, scant months after signing the deal, Alere announced that Abbott had offered it up to $50 million to allow it to void the deal. Alere refused the offer. Alere has managed to find itself a peck of trouble since the deal was first announced. It has had to refile multiple financial reports and the feds are investigating it over billing practices. As Abbott and Alere duke it out class action lawyers circle.Alere's LawsuitThe initial denouement of this troublesome drama promises to take place in the Globe Theatre of corporate rifts, the Delaware Chancery Court.Alere filed the opening act on August 25, 2016 in the form of a suit to compel Abbott to go ahead with the deal.The lawsuit allegations were made public in parts on August 31, 2016. The complaint alleges that Abbott was suffering from ""buyer's remorse"" and had threatened to have its lawyers turn the situation into a ""living hell"" for Alere unless Alere consented to cancellation of their deal in return for a payment of $30-50 million. Abbott maintains that it is complying with its agreement. It characterizes the lawsuit as a ""publicity stunt"". Alere is standing by its allegations and looks to its day in court to resolve the matter.The suit further alleges that Abbott's CEO Miles White threatened to inundate Alere in a ""sea of forensic-level informational demands""Backstory - Assumed FactsI look at these published allegations in the context of the deal as an interested Abbott shareholder. I have no shares in Alere. I surmise that the allegations are likely true to a point. However given the context, they are simultaneously misleading. They sensationalize and demonize conduct which was likely entirely justified.I will extrapolate from the following skeletal facts that I am assuming as a base line from which I make my further suppositions.*The timing of these events and the nature and extent to which they were disclosed as part of Abbott's due diligence is a known unknown by this author.Given those assumed facts, I expect that Abbott was greatly concerned about its prospective outsized investment in Alere. No doubt it had every reason to either void the deal or to undertake a ""sea of forensic-level informational demands"" in order to assure that it had as accurate opinion of the company's condition as possible under the circumstances.Backstory - SuppositionsThe lawsuit between Alere and Abbott may be just the tip of the lawsuit iceberg. Alere's stock price has ricocheted up and down as its transaction with Abbott has waxed and waned. Immediately before the deal Alere's stock traded ~$37. Then it shot up ~$53. In late April 2016 it dropped back to ~$40. It has since regained ~$44 while as I write it trades at ~$39.This type of price action creates multitudes of winners and losers among Alere's shareholders. Presumably the winners go away happy, undismayed by any management failures that may have given rise to the volatility. On the other hand, those who count themselves as losers will likely not be so sanguine. There are numerous class-action lawyers who are always eager to redress any perceived shareholder abuse. Indeed if you search ""alere securities class action"" you will see that this process is already ongoing. Accordingly, Alere has more on its plate than simply its deal with Abbott.ConclusionAlere cannot afford to simply make a deal with Abbott Labs. It has to consider how any such deal will play out in any coincident class action that may be filed already or in the future.Anything which has the potential to complicate Alere's path to settling this lawsuit has an a priori impact on Abbott. Abbott cannot settle with Alere until Alere agrees to do so.Any settlement which involves consummation of the deal raises the question of what happens to the securities class claims. I assume without knowing that the claims would follow the company. If so this would make the deal even less attractive to Abbott Labs. Perhaps a reader will have had experience with such a situation and will comment, without undue sarcasm."
4015109,101453,2016-10-26T10:18:46-04:00,"Abbott and St. Jude Medical are divesting vascular closure assets likely in response to regulatory hurdles regarding the successful completion of their $25 billion merger.
        The company’s acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere will tack on extra debt to Abbott’s capital structure but won’t meaningfully impact its cost of capital or investment-grade credit rating.
        Abbott’s stock is trading at around a 7% cost of equity, which is about in line with the rest of the pharmaceutical industry.","Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is currently in the process of acquiring St. Jude Medical (NYSE:STJ), slated for a possible year-end close, and last week announced a plan to sell certain vascular closure products to Terumo (OTCPK:TRUMF)(OTCPK:TRUMY) for $1.12 billion in cash. The move is likely to benefit Abbott shareholders at the expense of its debtholders. The company seems likely to use the proceeds from this transactions and divestiture of its optics business to cut down on the amount of stock it will need in order to fund the purchases of St. Jude Medical and Alere (NYSE:ALR), a combined $30.8 billion effort ($25 billion for St. Jude Medical and $5.8 billion Alere), or nearly half Abbott's $64 billion enterprise value.Abbott was initially planning up to a $3 billion equity issuance to help fund the acquisitions, but should register some $5.6-$6.0 billion in proceeds related to the optics and vascular divestitures, or about $5 billion when taxes are taken into account. While there is not much in the way of public information regarding the transaction specifics or how the vascular closure products divestitures will affect earnings, these assets likely generate more in the way of EBITDA dollar-for-dollar relative to the optics products. Even after using the proceeds to offset any equity dilution, a surplus will be leftover to also decrease any debt borrowings required and help offset the cash flow that will be forfeited from divesting the assets.Fundamentally, the sales of these vascular assets are very likely not being done for purely strategic, operational or financial reasons, but rather to comply with regulatory requirements. It was likely deemed by regulators that a concentration of these assets in the hands of one particular entity could lead to anti-competitive behavior. A sale of a portion of their collective assets is necessary to satisfy these requests and move along with the approval process.One would expect that the market will, for the time being, hit Abbott's stock due to the extra debt load taken on by the company, which is expected to lead to slight credit downgrades and a higher cost of debt. And naturally there is a normal degree of skepticism over whether merger synergies will be realized.Pre-Existing Capital StructureAbbott's pre-existing capital structure is fairly conservative with 13.1% debt and 86.9% equity. We can estimate Abbott's synthetic debt rating (and therefore cost of debt) using interest coverage ratios (EBIT/interest expense) and cash flow metrics. Then using the company's current cost of debt integrated with its cost of equity, we can plot out a representative curve to determine the optimal point at which the company could lever. This can be done with respect to either stock price or enterprise value. Naturally these curves have an inverted U shape denoting that debt financing is cheaper than equity financing up to a point - and therefore increase the value of the stock and/or company - before the debt creates a financial burden and becomes increasingly expensive due to lowered creditworthiness as debt is piled on.According to this model, Abbott would be optimally leveraged at approximately 25%-30% debt.(Source: author)Based on this exercise, Abbott's investment-grade rating -- A2 by Moody's, A+ by S&P, A by Fitch (source: Morningstar) -- is safe and wouldn't take a hit unless it assumed more than 3x the amount of its pre-existing debt to make these acquisitions, which it will not.ValuationAbbott is trading at a discount rate that is roughly on par with the rest of the market. If we take Abbott as a company growing revenue at 4% year-over-year, fairly stable 21% EBITDA margins year-to-year, 7%-7.5% depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of sales (and set equal to capital expenditures), a 17% effective tax rate, and nothing in the way of working capital growth, a 7% cost of equity and 1.8% perpetual growth rate (roughly equal to the long-term growth expectations of the US economy) would price the company at around $41 per share. Abbott is currently trading at just above $40 per share. I find that most of the large-cap pharmaceuticals industry is trading at around this 7% rate when using fairly standard market assumptions. In this sense, you could consider the stock fairly efficiently priced.A graph of presumptive per share prices based on a sensitivity range of various discount rates is provided below. For those seeking expected double-digit annualized returns, the stock wouldn't become cheap until around $25 per share.(Source: author)If we were to instead sensitize to certain revenue growth parameters (0%-8% growth year-over-year) and EBITDA margin targets (from 19%-23% year-to-year), while assuming a standard market discount rate (7% cost of equity), a sensitivity table would appear as follows:(Source: author)Summary/ConclusionAbbott's vascular products sale is likely being orchestrated to pass regulatory hurdles associated with its St. Jude Medical and Alere acquisitions. Even as the company will increase its debt load by some amount of debt to finance the transactions, Abbott's capital structure is well-managed and has the flexibility to accommodate an uptick in debt for accretive M&A deals. In terms of the stock's current valuation, if we are to go by the current market's pricing and the pharmaceutical industry in general, Abbott appears neither cheap nor expensive.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Over the weekend, the Financial Times' Lex column suggested otherwise (free to read with FT registration) -- Muddy Waters-St Jude: heart attack.After noting that only one stock Muddy Waters has shorted over the last three years is up in value since, Proofpoint, Inc (NASDAQ:PFPT), Lex argues that the deal for Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) to buy St. Jude makes it a tough short:Lex suggests that the dip in St. Jude's price could provide an arbitrage opportunity for long hedge funds.Insights From The Option MarketIn an article last month (Might Relypsa Get A Higher Bid?), we used Portfolio Armor to gauge option market sentiment about another health care company that had agreed to be acquired, Relypsa (NASDAQ:RLYP). We looked at both downside risk as well as potential upside. We'll do the same here for St. Jude.1. Downside Risk For St. JudeIn our Relypsa article, we showed that it was possible then to hedge Relypsa against a >2% decline over the next several months, and wrote that:Compare that to St. Jude Medical. As of Friday, it was too expensive to hedge with optimal puts against a single-digit decline over the next several months. The smallest decline you could hedge it against that way was 11%, and it was expensive to do so, as the screen capture below (via the Portfolio Armor iOS app) shows:As you can see above, the cost of hedging STJ against a >11% decline by late January was 10.38%. Some option market participants aren't as sanguine about St. Jude's prospects as Lex is.2. Upside Potential For St. JudeIn our Relypsa article, we described how the Portfolio Armor website gauges option market sentiment when it estimates potential returns. For a detailed take on that process, see the section titled ""Tesla, Amazon, And Potential Returns"" in this article, but here's the basic idea: the site starts by taking the mean of the security's most recent 6-month return and its average 6-month return over the last 10 years. Then the site attempts to hedge the security against a >9% decline over the next several months with an optimal collar, using that mean return as the upside cap. If it can't find an optimal collar using those parameters, the site lowers the cap and tries again.Here's a screen capture from Portfolio Armor's admin panel showing the numbers for this process with St. Jude:As you can see above, the mean of STJ's average 6-month return over the last 10 years and its most recent return was about 25.6%, but the ""Adj. Exp Return"" (what potential return is called on the admin panel) is only 8%.Now, recall Lex wrote that the acquisition price of the Abbott Labs deal for St. Jude was ""about $84"" per share. The terms of the deal are $46.75 in cash plus 0.8708 shares of Abbott Labs. On Friday, Abbott Labs closed at $42.98, so the buyout price for St. Jude as of then was (0.8708 x $42.98) + $46.75 = $84.18. St. Jude closed at $78.01 on Friday, 7.9% away from that buyout price.So, to sum up: option market sentiment as gauged by Portfolio Armor shows a potential return for St. Jude almost exactly at the buyout price (unlike in the case of Relypsa, where sentiment suggested the possibility of a higher bid), but it also showed higher downside risk than typical of companies set to be acquired."
3992645,74295,2016-07-28T11:04:09-04:00,"ALR dropped 30% in the last 15 minutes of trading Wednesday.
        ALR rose 20% in the after-hours trading session Wednesday.
        What the heck is going on?","If you're invested in Alere (NYSE:ALR), Wednesday was quite the rollercoaster. I was unfortunate enough to have been looking at my portfolio when ALR first dropped 10% in less than a minute. Then 20%. Then 30%. I scrambled to find any news to explain what I was witnessing, but Google searches yielded nothing for a solid 20 minutes after shares first started drop. And oh boy did they drop!ALR Price data by YChartsI have never seen anything like this. Granted, I haven't really had that much experience with the stock market, but this is definitely an anomaly. I was in awestruck surprise, left nursing my wounds while the news slowly rolled out of a variety of financial news websites: Alere was served a DOJ subpoena. But before long, ALR was up 21% in the after-hours trading session. Just like that, most of my loss was erased and I was left sitting on my couch wondering what the hell just happened. Well I've had some time to sift through the news and do a bit of thinking and I am ready to explain (I think).Let's start from the beginning. At about 3:45 PM EST Dow Jones breaks a report that Alere has been served a U.S. Department of Justice subpoena in relation to patient-billing records, specifically within the company's toxicology unit. More specifically, the subpoena is meant to investigate whether Alere 1) covered patient co-pays, which would be considered an illegal kickback, or 2) offered or gave primary care physicians gifts or payment to direct patients towards their diagnostic tests.For the sake of clarification, covering a patients co-pay is considered an illegal kickback because it is seen as a monetary incentive used to either maintain existing patients or garner new patients.Alere was already in hot water over its failure to file its 10-K (annual report) due to accounting issues related to revenue recognition. While both the subpoena and the 10-K filing delay are bad, the worst part is that Alere was on the cusp of being acquired for $5.8 billion by Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), which would have translated to a premium of 27% from the pre-Wednesday drop price. These regulatory and legal problems have put the merger in jeopardy.Abbott had already offered Alere $50 million to back out of the deal at the end of April, but considering the latter would incur a termination fee of $177 million if the deal was called off, the incentive from Abbott was not exactly strong. However, after this DOJ probe, Abbott may redouble efforts to get out of the acquisition. This bit of deduction was not lost on the market as this cause-and-effect relationship likely caused the selloff in large part.Usually in situations of M&A, many investors are hunting for the merger arbitrage, or the difference between what the stock trades for after a buyout announcement and the actual buyout price. In the case of Abbott's acquisition of Alere, if we use the pre-drop price of $44 per share and the acquisition price of $56 per share, the merger arbitrage comes out to about 27%. That is a fairly substantial valuation gap, which reflected the market's uncertainty about the deal going through. The risk-reward tradeoff looked ripe for the picking to me so I opened a long position in ALR a few weeks ago.Because of the perceived risk, it would not surprise if many of the investors playing the merger arbitrage by owning shares in ALR implemented stop-loss orders to limit downside if the merger did not go through. The thought process on those stop-loss orders would be that pretty much the only way ALR would drop significantly is if Abbott backed out of the acquisition, and at that point these investors would want to get their shares out as quickly as possible. But then came along a subpoena from the DOJ and all hell broke loose.The initial price drop was substantial but quickly deepened as stop-loss trades get activated en masse. This likely explains why the stock chart becomes nearly vertical. Trading in ALR was halted twice in the last 15 minutes, but the carnage continued as stop-losses pounded kept getting triggered.Remember, at this point neither I nor anyone else it seemed, had any clue what was going on. After seeing the price drop before my very eyes to end down nearly 30%, I was expecting the worst. Surely, the deal with Abbott had fallen through, or worse.Imagine my surprise when I see that all this fuss was thrown up over a DOJ subpoena for patient-billing records in the toxicology unit, which generates a quarter of Alere's revenue. Bad news surely, but 30%-drop bad news? Hardly. I didn't quite have the stomach to pick up more shares after-hours after reading about the source of ALR's woes, and boy do I regret that.Alere released a statement Wednesday evening saying that the divisions of the company related to the subpoena contributed less than 1% of total revenues through the first nine months of 2015. That statement then immediately led into this one: ""Alere believes the matters to which the subpoena relates are not material.""There you have it folks. All of this hoopla over ""not material"". If one ever needed evidence of how emotional and reactionary the stock market is, look no further than the saga that unfolded Wednesday afternoon. The stock dropped 30% because of a probe into a pain management laboratory that contributed less than 1% of revenues, an impending merger, and stop-loss orders related to that merger. Absolute insanity.Quickly after Alere issued the previous statement, ALR jumped 21% after-hours to $38 per share. That implies 52% upside when and if the Abbott merger goes through. Now that we've come back to the merger, let's discuss how this entire development has affected the likelihood of the acquisition closing.Many Abbott investors are likely hoping this will push the deal off the table while many Alere investors will be hoping the opposite. Which is more likely? Does this DOJ subpoena affect the odds at all now that we know it is not material? But before I say anything on this matter, let the record show I own shares of both ABT and ALR so I consider myself unbiased.It is a bit early to make any confident predictions, but I think this new bit of drama will have little impact on the closing of the acquisition. The DOJ's probe will likely have no widespread effects, and as long as Alere gets its 10-K files in time I think the merger will proceed as planned. In that case, investors that decide they have the risk tolerance to buy in at tomorrow's opening price, which I assume for convenience will be the after-hours close of $38 per share, can look forward to a 52% gain if the deal closes.However on the flip side, it is impossible to know what Abbott's management is thinking right now. Considering the probe is not material to Alere's business, the odds are in favor of Abbott staying the course. But there is always the possibility that Abbott management will just throw up its collective hands and just say it's not worth the trouble. Uncertainty still has a tight grip on ALR.What's the verdict? In my opinion, this whole situation was blown way out of proportion by a chain reaction of events and a perfect storm of stop-loss orders. The market realized the mistake and quickly (mostly) corrected the stock's value. The DOJ subpoena will not have any long-term, or even short-term, financial impacts on Alere's business, which leads me to assume that nothing has changed regarding Abbott's acquisition of the company. However, there is still significant risk present in ALR and only those with the risk tolerance and those who have done sufficient due diligence of their own should consider playing the stock going forward.

Today, Donald Trump is still winning. Is he going to win the 2016 U.S. presidential election? Predict It prediction market odds currently have that at about a 29% chance. FiveThirthyEight 2016 Election Forecast gives him a 19.2% chance. The RealClear Politics poll average has Trump behind by an average of 6% in a head to head matchup with Hillary Clinton. How is this winning?With the help of Roger Ailes and Steven Bannon, Trump is running America's first for-profit presidential campaign, fully merging entertainment with politics. Earlier this year, we got a glimpse of Trump's accomplishment when looking at the earned media figures.As of today, he has generated over $4 billion of twelve month media value according to mediaQuant:He received $31 million of free media attention from Sean Hannity alone. Is Trump collecting this free media because he mistrusts or misconstrues data indicating his likely failure in November? Possibly. But a more convincing explanation is that he is preparing for a bigger media role that can monetize the attention that he has received from this campaign. His next statement following the election returns is likely to prominently feature the word ""rigged"" followed by an announcement featuring 1) television 2) Roger Ailes and 3) Stephen Bannon. The monetization has already begun: he is repaying himself out of campaign donations and he quintupled the rent that he charged the campaign after it received donations. He may not be a billionaire yet, but he will be one once this is over.But what if Trump wins the election as well as he has won the battle for earned media? Here are two ways to place that bet (if you so choose; I am betting the other way. First, you can bet on Predict It. You can get odds on Trump winning as well as Trump winning in a landslide (currently an 8% chance). An $850 bet would pay almost $10,000. A for-profit president could benefit for-profit schools and prisons. Currently, for-profit schools such as ITT (NYSE:ESI-OLD) and for-profit prisons such as Corrections Corp (NYSE:CXW) are suffering and they are likely to continue suffering under a Clinton administration. If one wanted to bet on the long odds of a Trump administration, these would be some of the possible beneficiaries. I can think of few others.St. JudeSt. Jude (NYSE:STJ) responded to the Muddy Waters concerns regarding the electronic security of their medical devices, indicating that hackers would have to be very close for a very long time in order to cause trouble. Matt Levine commented that,Abbott (NYSE:ABT) continues to work with St. Jude on their deal.

3990626,83156,2016-07-22T10:31:16-04:00,"ABT had another strong quarter.ABT is expensive, but still a solid choice for long-term investment.External catalysts could boost ABT higher in the short-term.","Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) just keeps chugging along. In the second quarter, ABT beat on the top and bottom line. Reported revenues increased 3.1% (ahead of estimates by $90 million), and non-GAAP EPS came in at $0.55, beating estimates by $0.02. On a currency neutral basis, sales increased 6.4%, and ABT reported growth in each business segment. Shares have risen 9% in the past week following a report from Barclays that declared the stock was ""a premium asset selling at a discount"". The stock now trades at a trailing P/E of 30 compared to its historical average of 21. I have been bullish on ABT for a while, and while the stock is no longer an obvious buy, we think it can still go higher.There are many reasons to be optimistic about ABT. The firm is a market leader in each business segment, with a strong pipeline of new drugs and devices that should support the firm's economic moat for years to come. ABT shows on signs of slowing down, and currency headwinds are overshadowing solid underlying performance. In the latest quarter, on a constant currency basis, Nutrition increased 4.5%, Diagnostics grew 4.2%, Established Pharmaceuticals increased 9.5%, and Medical Devices grew 6.4%. In the second quarter ABT announced a merger with St. Jude Medical (NYSE:STJ), a move that should bolster the firm's competitive advantages through a bigger and more diversified portfolio. The purchase should also lead to cost synergies through greater scale and bargaining power over suppliers. Finally, ABT benefits from secular demand drivers. Population ageing will fuel health care spending around the world, and the company has significant exposure to emerging markets, where rising incomes will provide another long-term catalyst. We are especially optimistic about the Established Pharmaceuticals segment, which now only operates in emerging markets. The firm's branded generics have a key advantage over unbranded labels in these regions: because distribution infrastructures are less developed, purchase decisions are usually based on brand and reputation.ABT is an attractive investment idea for buy-and-hold investors. And, while the stock is expensive based on historical metrics, the stock could go higher if interest rates don't rise as much as expected. We think the market is overly optimistic in its outlook for Fed rate hikes, and that rates will stay near rock bottom levels through 2017. This would benefit ABT in two ways. First it would make the dividend more attractive. ABT yields 2.4%, nothing stellar, but a solid option given ABT's relatively low risk profile (company's products are largely insulated from economic fluctuations) and portfolio of high margin businesses that help protect the dividend. More importantly, a prolonged stretch of low interest rates would cause the dollar to depreciate because the dollar strength of recent years has been based on the assumption that US interest rates were heading higher. ABT, which generated 70% of its sales outside the US in 2015, would benefit tremendously, as the weaker dollar would increase the value of ABT's profits earned in other currencies. We expect that a significant portion of the capital leaving the US would flow into emerging markets where yields are higher. This is what happened after Brexit when it became clearer that the Fed was not about to raise rates. ABT generates more than 50% of revenues in high yield markets, so there is potential for a sizeable FX windfall if my theory plays out.Conclusion:ABT's second quarter didn't have any surprises: just another three months of solid underlying performance. Abbott Laboratories is a great business with a promising outlook, but, after the stock's recent rise, investors should wait for a better opportunity to buy in. That being said, we do think the stock can go higher in the short term (next year-and-a-half or so) if the Fed keeps rates low. ABT is a relatively stable and predictable business, so any major price movements in the next twelve months will likely come from external factors. If you are thinking about buying ABT, your expectation of Fed policy should be central to your decision."

Note: I am personally long Abbott Labs.Get to Know Abbott LabsAbbott Labs was founded in 1888. Today the company is a leader in several key categories Source: Abbott Labs JP Morgan Conference Presentation, slide 4Abbott is the global leader in adult nutrition. The company's adult nutrition leadership is a result of its Ensure brand.The company grew adult nutrition sales year-over-year by 5.2% in the United States and 3.6% internationally (constant-currency) in its most recent quarter.The company's adult nutrition category will continue to be boosted by favorable demographic trends going forward.Abbott Labs is much more than adult nutrition and baby formula. The company operates in 4 segments.Each segment is shown below along with the percentage of total revenue generated for Abbott Laboratories in fiscal 2015:The Nutrition segment's primary brands are Ensure, Pedialyte, and Similac.The established pharmaceutical segment is noteworthy for its geographical distribution. It sells generic pharmaceuticals only outside the Untied States. A full 75% of the segment's revenue comes from key emerging markets.But it's not just the established pharmaceutical segment that has a large emerging market presence…Abbott Labs Is An Emerging Market BusinessAbbott Labs sales by country type (developed, emerging) are shown below:The company generates half of its revenue in emerging markets.It also generates half of its revenue in direct to consumer sales. This means Abbott Labs health care products are popular with consumers, not just health care providers.Demographic changes will be most impactful in emerging markets.They have the fastest population growth. More babies means more formula sales for Abbott.Emerging markets will also make the biggest gains in life expectancy increases. Emerging market population's dwarf developed populations. This means more sales for Abbott's:The company has positioned itself extremely well. It is primed to take advantage of emerging market growth.With Abbott Labs you get expert management and developed world regulation and transparency combined with emerging market exposure and growth.Total Returns & Earnings-Per-Share GrowthWhat type of growth should Abbott Labs investors expect going forward?I believe Abbott Labs investors should expect earnings-per-share growth of around 10% a year going forward. The company's growth will come from a mix of acquisitions, organic revenue growth, small margin improvements, and share repurchases.This growth combined with the company's current dividend yield of 2.7% gives Abbott Labs investors expected returns of 12% to 13% a year.Recent Acquisitions Are A Potential Growth CatalystOne of Abbott Lab's growth strategies is acquisitions.The company has recently engaged in 2 large acquisitions:The Alere acquisition will boost Abbott Lab's diagnostics segment.The St. Jude Medical acquisition will bolster Abbott Lab's medical devices segment.Both acquisitions are expected to be accretive to earnings within the first full fiscal year after closing… Which is good news for shareholders.Abbott Labs will benefit from these acquisitions far into the future. The company can integrate and roll out products from the respective acquired companies throughout the globe - this is the power of Abbott Lab's international approach.The St. Jude Medical acquisition is funded by a mix of cash and new share issuance.I would have preferred Abbott Labs to take on additional debt rather than issue new shares to take advantage of historically low interest rates. Still, both acquisitions will likely be beneficial for long-term shareholders.Abbott Labs Scores High Marks for Safety & StabilityThe health care sector has historically performed better than average during recessions.You simply cannot cut back on baby formula or pharmaceuticals when times get tough. This makes Abbott Labs recession resistant.History has proven Abbott Labs handles recessions very well. Abbott Labs is one of the 10 most recession proof Dividend Aristocrats. It's stock fell 5% in 2008… While the S&P 500 declined 38%.The company grew earnings-per-share (and dividends) each year through the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009.Recession performance is only one aspect of the company's safety.Abbott Lab's excellent dividend history speaks to its strength and safety:It is highly likely the company's dividend streak continues far into the future. The company has a reasonable payout ratio of 50% (using adjusted earnings).Abbott Lab's balance sheet is also in good shape. Through the 1st quarter of 2016, the company had about $4 billion in cash and $8 billion in debt on its books. To put that in perspective, the company generates about $3 billion a year in cash from operations.Abbott's Compelling Price to Value PropositionAbbott Labs has historically traded for around the same price-to-earnings multiple as the S&P 500 since the AbbVie spin-off in 2012.I don't believe Abbott Labs should trade for the same price-to-earnings multiple as the S&P 500…The company is of a higher quality than the average S&P 500 stock. It also has better total return prospects than the average S&P 500 stock.The market disagrees at this time. Abbott Labs's price-to-earnings ratio has not followed suite with the S&P 500's.I believe Abbott Labs should trade at least in line with the S&P 500. Relative to the market, Abbott Labs is significantly undervalued today.Relative to its historical average price-to-earnings ratio, the company is likely trading around fair value. Taken as a whole, I expect an investment in Abbott Labs to beat the S&P 500 Index over the next 5 to 10 year period.Abbott Labs Is a Buy at Current PricesInvestors in Abbott Laboratories should expect total returns of around 12% to 13% a year going forward from dividends and earnings-per-share growth…An investment that grows at 12% a year doubles in value about every 6 years.The company scores high marks for safety and will very likely continue increasing dividend payments far into the future.Additionally, Abbott Labs gives investors lower risk exposure to emerging markets.The company currently ranks as a Top 10 dividend stock using The 8 Rule of Dividend Investing.Abbott Labs ranks highly using The 8 Rules because it has:I believe Abbott Labs is an excellent example of a high quality, shareholder friendly business trading at fair or better prices now.Investors looking for exposure to the health care sector and/or emerging markets should look no further than Abbott Labs.Disclosure: Long ABT."
3972353,21877,2016-05-06T12:04:07-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories has a good track record when it comes to closing acquisitions and integrating the companies and technologies it has bought. But it has never taken on the kind of transformational deal represented by its $25bn cash-and-stock purchase of St. Jude Medical – and certainly not while it already has another multibillion-dollar deal already on the slate.That first deal, the $5.8bn acquisition of the diagnostics group Alere, already looks troubled, with Abbott unsuccessfully attempting to back out. And both deals are wholly or partly debt-funded, which added to Abbott’s planned assumption of its targets’ debt could put it a fair way onto the red. The company already had an uphill battle to secure this one-two, and now things are looking hairier than ever.Caveat emptorAbbott agreed a hefty premium for Alere back in February, despite the company carrying $2.6bn of debt (Abbott pays $5.8bn to climb the diagnostics rankings, February 1, 2016).It began to look as if Abbott could have done a better job on its due diligence when it emerged six weeks later that the US Department of Justice was investigating allegations of corrupt sales practices by Alere in Africa, Asia and South America. Alere is working to respond to the probe, but said the investigation meant it would miss the deadline to file its 2015 annual report with regulators.The real shake came when it became clear that Abbott was no longer overly keen on the merger. On its first-quarter earnings call, Abbott’s chief executive refused to comment about whether the acquisition would still close. A week later, on April 28, Alere stated that Abbott had tried to call the whole thing off, offering up to $50m to the diagnostics group to terminate the deal.Alere said no.That imbroglio occurred the same day Abbott announced that it was to buy St. Jude. Naturally negotiations for the St. Jude deal would have been under way for some months – presumably at least since rumors of the takeover were squashed last summer – but the timing makes it look like Abbott tried to back out of a poor deal in favor of a better one.Debt betAbbott seems to be stuck with Alere (NYSE:ALR) for now, though the likely eventual outcome is litigation over the break fee, with Abbott presumably set to argue that Alere's accounting woes constitute a material change of circumstances. But can Abbott afford both transactions?The group has said it plans to use cash on hand from expected long-term borrowings to acquire Alere. But in February, Abbott obtained a $9bn short-term unsecured bridge loan to provide back-up financing, as well as the refinancing of Alere’s $2.6bn net debt.The cash portion of the St. Jude deal is also to be funded with debt; at $46.75 per share this comes to around $13.8bn, 55% of the total deal cost. St. Jude’s net debt of $5.7bn is to be assumed or refinanced by Abbott. And again, Abbott said it will fund the cash portion with medium and long-term debt, but took out a just-in-case bridge loan, this time for up to $17.2bn.As of the end of March, Abbott had $8.1bn total debt on its balance sheet, not overwhelming for a company with a market cap of $56bn. But analysts from Jefferies wrote that the materially higher debt load that came with the transactions would ""likely suppress dividend growth, share repurchases and M&A for the next couple of years”.The debt levels from the Alere deal prompted both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s to put Abbott’s credit rating on review for downgrade. Both agencies reiterated their concern following the St. Jude announcement, with Standard & Poor’s saying the deals significantly increased Abbott’s debt leverage “well beyond our expectations within the current assessment of a minimal financial risk profile”.DigestionThat said, S&P did point out that Abbott had a solid record of conducting sizable debt-financed acquisitions, adding that it did not expect the company to have much difficulty in integrating St. Jude and Alere.Abbott’s previous largest medtech acquisition was funded through borrowing. When it bought Guidant’s vascular technologies in 2006 – the unit was sold to allow antitrust passage of Boston Scientific’s purchase of Guidant – it used $2.3bn in existing cash, plus $4.1bn in short-term debt.It is worth remembering, however, that the Guidant buy predates the Abbott-AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) split; at the time it occurred Abbott was a much larger company.So the purchase and absorption of Alere alone would be a bigger challenge than Abbott has ever faced. And St. Jude is an order of magnitude larger than any of the other medtech groups Abbott has bought.And then there are the accounting and legal problems with the Alere. It is not so much any legal penalty that might come – any fines that might be imposed are unlikely to trouble Abbott unduly – but the investigation and subsequent resolution of the financial reporting could mean years of uncertainty for the group.The accounting issues with Alere might mean that of the two open deals, St. Jude will be the easier to close."

One of my favorite stock market stories is that of an old lady, Grace Groner, who bought three shares of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) for $60 each. That was in 1935. She repurchased stocks with the dividends and in 2010 her shares were worth $7M. That is the stuff dreams are made of, right? Now the question is: if you are a young investor, should you buy Abbott now and keep it for seven decades?The simple answer is: I really don't know. So, that was it, this was the shortest article ever on SA.Of course not. I couldn't tell where Abbott will be in 70 years, but I think I can tell you if you should buy Abbott now and I can give you my opinion about Abbott's near future.As the story of Miss Groner shows, Abbott has a long and rich history. In The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham, Abbott is categorized as one of the 'Steady Eddies'. The description Graham gives for these stocks is:He considered only 58 stocks buy-and-hold stocks and Abbott was one of them.I think that Warren Buffett's mentor knew a thing or two about investing, but he died this year 40 years ago. Would he still be as full of enthusiasm for Abbott?The company profileFirst a short introduction to the company:Abbott is a very diversified company.Firstly: the four segments are very close to each other when it comes to the percentage of the sales. And those segments that are a bit smaller, grow faster. You could definitely see this on this 2Q 2016 earnings call slide:(source: abbottinvestor.com)What is more: the segment that I would say is the least stable one, generic pharmaceuticals, is the smallest, which is also a good thing.The second proof of diversification is that Abbott has more than 10,000 products in its portfolio. It had 38 new product launches in 2015.Thirdly: about 50% of Abbott's sales are direct to customers, which means the middleman is left out and that is safer.A fourth and very important element of diversification is that Abbott's sales are for 50% in developed markets and 50% in fast-growing markets.A fifth and last source of diversification is that Abbott sells its products in 150 countries and no country (except for the USA) represents a double digit percentage of the sales:Abbott has been present for decades in fast-growing countries that are sometimes seen as difficult:The different segments of AbbottLet's have a look at the different parts in detail.The slogan of this segment says it all, I think: 'Meeting laboratory needs worldwide.' Abbott diagnostics is the world leader in blood transfusion in the world, but has much more than just this. As Abbott puts it in the 2015 annual report:The acquisition of Alere (NYSE:ALR), which was announced in February 2016, is meant for this segment of Abbott. Alere is a company that is mainly focused on professional and consumer diagnostics. But Abbott got second thoughts and doesn't want to spend the $5.8B for the acquisition of Alere. The reason: an investigation by the DOJ of the accounting practice of Alere. You can read a part of the story here, but in the meantime Abbott will even take Alere to court. And of course, as is to be expected in the land of litigation overkill, Alere filed a lawsuit against Abbott to complete the acquisition. What does this all mean to a (possible) Abbott investor? I think that it would be positive if Abbott could back out or maybe get a cheaper price for Alere. We will see how it turns out.Again Abbott strength is its diversification in this segment too. Just look at the different components of Abbott diagnostics:(source: 2015 annual report)The nutrition segment is again diversified on its own. These are the several components of Abbott nutrition:(source: 2015 annual report)In a time where there are more and more allergies and more and more is discovered about the enormous effects of food on our health, the nutrition segment is poised to keep growing in the next decades. The elements that I discussed in my article about WhiteWave are a tailwind for Abbott nutrition too.This segment is split up in three main domains: cardiovascular, medical optics and diabetes monitoring.The cardiovascular department sells products related to heart and coronary artery surgery: stents, vessel closure equipment etc.The recent acquisition of St. Jude Medical (NYSE:STJ) is meant for the medical devices segment of Abbott. It is announced to close before the end of the year. St. Jude Medical is a worldwide leader in heart valves, so you can see why Abbott bought this company. I think that this is an expensive, but good acquisition. There will be a lot of synergies. If one salesman can offer the whole product range for heart and coronary artery surgery, this means more sales for less costs. And although St. Jude already sells in 100 countries, Abbott's network is bigger.Medical optics alone is very diversified again. It goes from precision laser surgery systems to treat cataract over to the eye scanner that you could see at your local ophthalmologist to consumer products to clean your lenses or wet your eyes.Abbott is the global leader in diabetes care and monitoring, both for personal and professional use. This is Abbott's diabetes monitoring range for personal use:There is also a professional diabetes monitor:(Source: abbottdiabetescare.com)Summary: Abbott medical devices has a very diversified product range. This is also visible in this pie chart:I don't have to explain what this is. Here is a representative picture of these products:I don't know about you, but I can't read all that. And the ones that I can read are not Abbott's anymore. Abbott sold its developed markets generic branded pharmaceuticals to Mylan (NASDAQ:MYL) so it could focus completely on developing markets. And with success: the biggest growth of the four segments we have discussed here came from branded generics pharmaceuticals: 9.5%. I think this was a smart move by Abbott: it gave them more focus on where the bigger profits are to be seized over the long haul.ValuationOf course, it is important to have a good understanding of a company if you consider buying a stock. What I have seen, pleases me. I have seen a very diversified company that seeks to grow by focusing on emerging markets and acquisitions. But if you want to buy a stock, the valuation must be right of course. Unless you really plan to hold the stock for 70 years. Then it doesn't matter all that much, I guess.When I analyze companies, my first stop always is FAST graphs. It can give you a quick look at how the stock has done historically, show you the normal P/E, give you the credit rating, etc. That is all you need for a first peek. This is the FAST graph for Abbott.Abbott's credit rating is A+, which is good. But there is a hidden danger here: Standard & Poor's has a negative outlook on Abbott because of its expensive acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere. It threatens to downgrade Abbott to BBB-. This is still investment grade, but it means that Standard & Poor's sees Abbott as vulnerable if there would be a recession or any company specific event which would decline the revenues. Therefore it could be a very good thing if Abbott could cancel the Alere acquisition without any big break-up fee.As you can see, the earnings dropped with more than 60% in 2013, but that is simply because AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), the biotech department of Abbott, was spun-off at the time.Abbott is a dividend champion, with 44 years of ever increasing dividends.ABT data by YChartsThe dividend dived in 2013, again because of the spin-off of AbbVie. In fact, if you held both stocks since the spin-off, your dividends will have grown substantially. I don't have Abbott in my portfolio yet. I did have ABBV, but I sold it. I explained why in an article I wrote in May.Abbott raised its dividend 8.3% last year (from 0.24 to 0.26 quarterly distribution, or 0.96 to 1.04 yearly). With a price of 43.90, this represents a yield of 2.37%. For the attentive reader: this is a mistake in the Y-chart above. It says ABT only pays $1.00.I expect that Abbott will keep raising its dividend, but not dramatically in the coming years, rather the opposite, because of the expensive acquisitions.ABT Payout Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsAbbott's payout ratio is at 65%, a bit higher than I would like to see, but the company has been there before and it will manage. I think the dividend is safe for the moment. For the future it will depend partly on how good the acquisitions will work out.ABT Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Annual) data by YChartsIt is always important to look at the dilution of shares, but for Abbott, this is very positive. It has reduced its shares by 20% over the last decades. Not impressive compared to some other companies, but good enough.At first sight, if you look at the Fast Graph (I have repeated the FAST graphs once more for your convenience), ABT looks quite overvalued: it is about 25% above its average P/E. But that is only if you look at the last decade. If you look at the last two decades, there is a different picture:Here you can see that Abbott is fairly valued. I think this is a more fair picture, because Abbott's P/E had gone up quite steeply after the Great Recession, probably over the excitement of its biotech department that was later spun-off as AbbVie and which succeeded to produce the best selling drug on this planet: Humira.Let's look at the expected growth for the future. Finviz.com expects earnings per share growth of 9.36% for the next five years. With the analyst estimates in FAST graphs, that looks like this:So, as you can see on this chart, we can expect about 8% CAGR from ABT in the next 5 years if you include the dividend. This is a solid stock.Abbott has an advantage over most other stocks in the S&P 500: it is very recession-proof. Look at this chart of the annus horribilis 2008.ABT Year to Date Price Returns (Daily) data by YChartsWhatever the circumstances, hospitals will keep buying devices, people will not stop buying specialized foods for their babies or stop taking medicines. This makes Abbott very recession-proof. But with the much higher debt that Abbott takes on, there shouldn't be a recession soon, I think. In other words: Abbott's strength isn't its strength anymore.ConclusionAbbott is a very solid company, with a long history and a beautiful story to testify. It has a very diversified revenue stream, which is a stabilizing factor to any company.But still, I would not open any position in Abbott right now. The reason is the possible downgrade by S&P. Not just for the downgrade by itself, of course, but because Abbott could be vulnerable if a recession comes right after the acquisition of St Jude Medical. Maybe if they can back out of the Alere deal, it could mean a positive element. At that moment the stock could be ideal for conservative investors since normally it is very recession-proof. I will wait with my own money until there is more clarity concerning Abbott's debt and, consequently, its credit rating.The S&P 500 has grown at about 7% per year in the last decade. Abbott is expected to grow at 8% per year in the next five years. So while I think it is a solid stock, the potential return will probably be mediocre. But it depends on your viewpoint, of course. You could also call that 'stable'. I explained why I wouldn't buy at this moment, but I would not call a buyer foolish or imprudent.If you found this article interesting, please hit the follow button on the top of the page next to my name.Good luck to you all and keep growing!"
3981733,69695,2016-06-13T15:44:36-04:00,"Abbott Labs has a well-defined growth strategy, dictated by smart acquisitions and continued expansion in emerging markets.One of Abbott's key advantages is its balanced business across product segments and geographic markets. This insulates it against continued pressure on drug pricing in the U.S.Abbott is a Dividend Aristocrat and offers an above-average yield. It looks like an attractive pick for value and income.","From a sector-by-sector perspective, I am particularly bullish on health care going forward. The reason is because of demographics. The U.S. is an aging population. The Baby Boomers, those born in the years following World War II, total 75 million in the United States. Baby Boomers are the second largest generational group, only slightly behind the Millenials. With millions of people retiring each year, the aging population presents a tailwind for the health care sector that should result in sustained, long-term growth.Therefore, I've been increasingly adding stocks to my portfolio that I believe will benefit from the demographic trends. Specifically, I wrote in this article that I recently added Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) to my portfolio. I also own health care REITs HCP (HCP) and Welltower (HCN), and I own some shares of GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) as well. These purchases were made based on that same thesis-and I'm still on the hunt for other well-run health care stocks with strong cash flow and above-average dividends.With that in mind, my research has pointed me to a new health care stock I don't yet own: Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT).Why Abbott Crosses my RadarI am bullish on Abbott Labs for a two key reasons: it has a diversified business across multiple health care segments, and it will be one of the major beneficiaries of the aging U.S. population. It has four major businesses-nutrition, diagnostics, medical devices, and pharmaceuticals--each of roughly equal size. After seeing the sell-off in biotech stocks over the past year, due to intensifying scrutiny over drug pricing, I'm focusing my attention on diversified health care companies that aren't completely reliant on pharmaceuticals. Led by Ensure, Abbott controlled more than 50% of global sales of adult nutrition products last year.In addition, Abbott is diversified geographically. Half of its revenue comes from mature markets like the U.S., while the remaining half is derived from under-developed economies such as emerging markets. This will allow Abbott to participate in growth areas such as aging populations, in the United States and also emerging markets where health care spending is projected to rise at a faster pace than GDP. At the same time, Abbott's focus on higher-growth areas of the world helps protect its pharmaceutical portfolio against the likelihood of increased regulatory intervention in drug pricing in the U.S.According to Abbott, emerging markets are projected to see a 9% annual increase in pharmaceutical product sales from 2015-2019. In the same period, developed markets are expected to grow just 3%. This will be an advantage for Abbott because it generates 21% of its emerging market sales from India, 7% from China, and 32% from Latin America.Abbott's strategy doesn't appear to be working, judging by its fundamental performance last year, but its real performance was much better than it seemed. Abbott's sales grew just 0.8% in 2015, but due to the company's significant international business, its results were weighed down by the strong U.S. dollar. Unfavorable currency fluctuations shaved more than eight percentage points off of Abbott's revenue growth last year. Excluding foreign exchange, Abbott's organic revenue growth was a much more satisfactory 9% last year. Organic sales in emerging markets rose 17% last year, which is very promising for the future.In addition to its organic growth, Abbott's future growth will be fueled by acquisitions. It recently acquired St. Jude Medical (NYSE:STJ) in a massive $25 billion deal. The acquisition further boosts Abbott's position to capitalize on the aging U.S. population because St. Jude is a leader in the medical device market, specifically in the areas of cardiovascular, diabetes, and vision related devices. Abbott expects the deal to be accretive to earnings in the first year after closing with earnings growth accelerating thereafter. It also expects to realize $500 million in annual cost synergies by 2020. Separately, Abbott also acquired Alere Inc. (NYSE:ALR) for $5.8 billion in February, further enhancing its diagnostics business. Again, Abbott expects the deal to be immediately accretive to annual earnings.Abbott: Extremely Attractive for Value & DividendsAbbott is a Dividend Aristocrat, a select group of companies that have increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years. In fact, Abbott has declared 370 consecutive quarterly distributions, a streak going all the way back to 1924, and the company has raised its payout for the past 44 years in a row, including an 8% hike last year. Such a long history of uninterrupted dividend payments and annual dividend growth is a testament to the staying power of Abbott's business model. Abbott's $1.04 per share annualized dividend works out to an attractive 2.7% dividend yield based on its current share price. This is significantly higher than the S&P 500 average yield of slightly more than 2%.Last year, Abbott earned $2.15 per share in adjusted profit. The stock trades for 17 times last year's adjusted EPS. Based on its strategic initiatives and acquisitions, future earnings are likely to grow from here, which means Abbott's valuation looks modest. Abbott looks like a very attractive stock for value and income.Disclaimer: This article represents the opinion of the author, who is not a licensed financial advisor.

3983875,83156,2016-06-23T10:35:57-04:00,"Results from recent study show that company's next-gen blood glucose technology is effective.
        The FreeStyle Libre is expected to be approved for use in the US later this year.
        Abbott's ability to constantly innovate makes it a great candidate for long-term investors.","In a previous article I laid out a case as to why I think Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a great long-term investment. One of my reasons for optimism relates to the firm's technological expertise, demonstrated by its ability to constantly bring innovative products to market. The most recent example can be found in ABT's diabetes business, where a recent study showed that patients using ABT's continuous glucose monitor, the FreeStyle Libre, reduced time spent in hypoglycemia 38% compared to self-monitoring blood glucose systems that rely on a finger stick blood sample. The device was approved in Europe in 2014, and approval in the US is expected later in 2016. The product has been well received in Europe and sales across the pond have surpassed management expectations. Thanks to this revolutionary device, diabetes care was Abbott's best performing device business in the first quarter of 2015, driving growth of 2.8% and offsetting reimbursement pressures in the US.The FreeStyle Libre consists of a small glucose sensor worn under the skin that connects to a plastic patch on the upper arm (Figure 1). The sensor remains in place for up to 14 days, and the user scans over the area with a small touchscreen reader to obtain blood glucose information. It appears that ABT has once again unlocked a new avenue for growth. According to ResearchAndMarkets, a provider of market research papers, ""the most significant growth in the global diabetes market will come from the nascent segment of continuous blood glucose monitors"". The FreeStyle Libre has a number of advantages over traditional glucose monitoring kits. Consumers generally agree that the product is easier to use, less painful than routine fingersticks, more discrete, just as accurate, and more informative. Diatribe.org, a diabetes blog, argues that by providing real time glucose values, trend information, and comprehensive reports, the readings are more actionable for users compared to those offered on traditional devices.Figure 1: FreeStyle LibreSource: blogspot.comAbbott is not the only company to test the waters in this exciting new market. Both Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) and Dexcom (NASDAQ:DXCM) offer continuous glucose monitors, but there are aspects to ABT's devices that could potentially separate it from the competition. The FreeStyle Libre does not require start-up calibration or daily adjustments, it simply calibrates itself once inserted into the user. It is also much more affordable, and cost effectiveness is a critical competitive advantage with third party payers looking to cut costs. Finally, the FreeStyle does not require a prescription. Consumers can purchase it directly through online channels, and in bypassing the paperwork associated with getting clearance from doctors, ABT should be able to grow market share at a faster pace than its rivals.The FreeStyle Libre will by no means transform ABT's fortunes, as the firm has a massive scope of products that comprise a much higher portion of revenues compared to the diabetes business. But it does illustrate Abbott's capacity to continually innovate, which is the only way healthcare firms can sustain growth over time. FX headwinds and reimbursement pressures have overshadowed the company's strong performance in recent quarters. But this does not impact our view of the company's favorable long-term economics."
3985168,39141,2016-06-29T08:59:29-04:00,"In April, Abbott Labs announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for a significant premium.
        In my opinion, this acquisition transforms Abbott Labs into more of a growth name, less of an income name.
        Despite being an income investor, I will hold my shares, but am looking to other places for value.","Back in late April, Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT), a large cap medical device and consumer company, announced that it would acquire device maker St. Jude Medical (NYSE:STJ) for a total of $25 billion. That's pretty huge considering that Abbott only has a $52 billion market cap. This acquisition is massively transformative if for anything just the size of it. Once complete, this acquisition will definitely change the composition of the company and the investment dynamic going forward. This article takes a look at the important parts of the St. Jude acquisition, and what it means for Abbott's investors.A Marquee AcquisitionYou might recognize the St. Jude name by its charity. However, St Jude Medical, the company, is a medical device maker. Prior to this acquisition, 27% of Abbott's sales were medical devices, 16% generic pharmaceuticals, 23% diagnostics and 34% nutritional sales. Going forward Abbott will be much more of a diagnostic company.Abbott will pay $46.75 per St. Jude share in cash,plus 0.87 shares of Abbott for each share of St. Jude. Altogether, the total consideration is for $85.00 per St. Jude share. At the eve that this deal was mentioned, that would be a 41% premium. That's quite a lot.Abbott does expect this acquisition to be more accretive, despite the big premium. In the year 2017, this acquisition should add 21 cents per share of earnings. That means a 23% EPS boost based on 2015 earnings, and then a 29 cent boost in 2018. That's an even bigger boost. So, this will add a lot to the bottom line if it works out.The following chart shows why Abbott acquired St. Jude. St. Jude has a wide variety of devices in many areas, but particularly heart-related medical devices.Courtesy of Abbott Labs Investor Relations.But this acquisition is going to change a lot for Abbott. The cash portion of this deal is being paid for in new debt. Currently Abbott's debt sits at 2.2 times EBITDA, but that will change to 4.5 times with this acquisition. To make it back to 3.5 to 4.5 times EBITDA, management estimates it will take until 2018, and in the meantime the company will have to ""cut back"" on buybacks and ""decelerate"" the growth of its dividend, probably until 2018.Management is committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating. Right now Abbott has an A2 rating, well into investment grade. However, Abbott is on watch for a possible downgrade due largely to this big acquisition. The new rating is expected to be Baa3; right at investment grade with no room for another downgrade.For me, that's all a bit of a bummer, particularly regarding slower dividend growth. I got into Abbott Labs back in 2011 for dividend growth, and I'm happy with results so far, but slower dividend growth is disappointing. I have a lot of confidence in Abbott to digest St. Jude, because Abbott has successfully acquired four other targets since 2006.Valuation and ConclusionCourtesy of Google Finance.Abbott Labs isn't down by much, despite the Brexit fallout. Investors probably see this medical conglomerate as a decently safe place to be. According to data from FAST Graphs, the average ten-year price-to-adjusted-earnings is 16.7 times, and right now Abbott trades at 17.4 times, that's about a 5% premium. That's not too bad, but given slower dividend growth and a need to delever for a couple years, as an income investors I am a lot less interested in buying more of this stock. Abbott is really transitioning itself into something of a growth stock. That's interesting, but I'm more of a dividend investor.In this panicked environment, there are many good companies trading at much cheaper valuations than Abbott is. Abbott isn't a sell here, and I certainly won't sell my shares, but I do not recommend buying here, either."
3970741,101378,2016-05-03T15:18:00-04:00,Abbott Laboratories was once a uniquely attractive company with growing dividends and low debt.Over time the company has morphed and is morphing into an investment of a more questionable cast.I'm questioning if I should stick around for the next act of the Abbot Laboratories half of the original company.,"BackgroundWhen I acquired Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) several years back, it was a dividend champion that had paid increasing dividends for well over 25 years. Back in 2011, Chuck Carnevale characterized the company as ""a paragon of consistency regarding earnings growth."" He went on to state that it boasted ""almost perfect operating results.""Of old, it was a no brainer purchase and it performed well-paying solid and increasing dividends as one would hope. Then in 2013, Abbott shook things up a bit. It decided to split itself into two companies, one retained the former name, Abbott Laboratories, the other company assumed the name AbbVie.Shareholders of the old Abbott Laboratories received 1 share of each of the new companies for every share they held of the old. The division made sense to me - I thought it would likely be accretive in value and so it has proved to be.I held on to both pieces. AbbVie has been an interesting ride. It was the one that gave me most pause insofar as it was so heavily reliant on one drug whose patent expires this year. However it is not the one challenging my ""buy and hold"" decision. It has its challenges but is not my current concern.Back at the time of the split, the Abbott Laboratories piece was an easier decision. I had every intention of holding it. I found descriptions of its prospects at the time, such as the following to be quite appealing:Certainly its dividend payout was lower than I would have liked, but the business seemed particularly sound.The split took place on January 1, 2013. Abbott Laboratories traded at $33.88 on that date. It ascended all the way to $50 by July of 2015. It then started a downward path. I was not paying a great deal of attention to this. Short-term gyrations are always present. I was unaware of anything challenging the business fundamental prospects.Abbott's DealsAbbott has made a succession of acquisitions since the split. They have mostly been smaller acquisitions. Last year there was speculation that bigger acquisitions could be in the offing.Abbott was coy about its intentions. Where there is smoke in such matters, fires tend not to be far off. Denials are hardly worth the breath they waste.On February 1, 2016, Abbott Laboratories offered a fat 50% premium for point of care diagnostics company Alere. Its bid was for $5.8 billion. On its face this deal seemed appealing. Abbott's stock dropped a bit when the deal was announced, but it recovered nicely. The Alere deal was well within a comfort zone in terms of size of acquisition by Abbott.The deal is subject to typical closing conditions and to approval of Alere's shareholders.Some of Abbott's shareholders may like the deal. Others may not. A well presented and reasoned SA article in March came down on the ""not"" side, but characterized the deal demerits as more of a nuisance than an existential threat. Certainly, Alere's F.A.S.T. Graph chart presents a company in which I would have no interest in investing. But this has nothing to do with its potential value to Abbott Laboratories.  St. Jude's dealOnly a few months later on April 28, 2016, Abbot announced it was bidding for St. Jude Medical (NYSE:STJ) at a 37% premium. This deal is a large one for Abbott particularly while it is still in the process of working through the Alere deal. St. Jude is a much bigger company as is clear from its F.A.S.T. Graph chart below. Abbott's stock reacted negatively to the St. Jude's announcement dropping from $43.83 to $38.90. An SA article with accompanying comments reminds us that such upsets are common and usually transitory. It also cites a Reuters article which details the debt implications of the transaction whereby Abbott would move from leverage of 2X before the two transactions, all the way to 5X. It is always concerning to me when a company takes on huge amounts of debt in connection with acquisitions. This is particularly the case when its business and the business of the acquired companies are facing rough patches. Certainly in the case of Abbot Laboratories and Alere, FX issues and challenges in export markets are straining their earnings growth. St. Jude is similarly not without its issues.None of these would be sufficient in is own right to cast a pall on a solid company. However, in the aggregate, they can rise to the point where a shareholder decides better opportunities exist elsewhere.Value Investor has recently published a detailed analysis of the St. Jude deal. I have not had an opportunity to fully digest this, but definitely plan to do so.Alere IssuesThe SA article discussing the Alere transaction characterized it as: ""…likely to serve as an ongoing nuisance."" Surely Abbott's management thought otherwise when they made their offer and sealed it with director approval. Yet Abbott's management seems to be changing its view. According to reports from Alere, in late April 2016, Abbott offered between $30 to $50 million as a termination fee if Alere would agree to terminate the deal. Given the deal's rich terms it is hardly surprising that this offer to terminate was rejected by Alere out of hand.With April turning to May this promises to be a rich drama. It has the appearance of more than buyer's remorse. Alere has been struggling to file its 10-K. There has been reported jousting with creditors and fees paid for loan covenant issues relating to the late 10-K filing.Abbott projected rosy synergies when it announced its deal. They were criticized as too rosy when announced. The deal has had a certain ripeness about it from early on. It shows a possibility of moving from there to positively rank. A recent SA article offers a particularly gloomy prognosis on the Alere deal. There are sure to be happy lawyers if order is not restored soon.Abbott impactThere are at least four credible potential resolutions of the Abbott-Alere acquisition.This last possibility is the most problematic for Abbott. Such disputes can occur, but luckily only do so rarely. There is plenty of scope left for one of the first three, or some other resolution to present itself.As I write, I can find no later developments in the Alere/Abbott drama. Commentators are definitely taking notice of the messy situation.Where Abbott is HeadedIf one looks at Abbott's F.A.S.T. Graphs chart below, particularly the FAST FACTS, the extent of the change which is about to take place becomes clear. Most likely the 19% debt/capital is going to skyrocket. With it the S&P Credit Rating of A+ will take a hit. The dividend yield may not go lower, if the stock price goes done, but there will likely not be dividend raises until the debt starts to go down.  On a more positive note, Abbott's management is proven. The bulk of the 18 member leadership team, with only two exceptions, have been with Abbott in various capacities since 2007. In most cases, including the CEO and CFO, far longer than that.Abbott has an 11-person board. CEO White is chairman of the board. It would be preferable from a corporate governance viewpoint if there were a separate board chair. Otherwise the board appears to meet reasonable governance standards. The remaining members are independent directors with a variety of backgrounds and lengths of tenure. All the directors and the management team have tenures predating the 2013 split.ConclusionThe research I have done in connection with this article draws me ever closer to the point of selling all or some portion of my Abbott stake. It is quite far from the Abbott Laboratories I bought back when. The question has to be where is a better place to deploy the proceeds. That is a question for the next few days."

Their fast growing pharmaceutical division was spun off to become AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) in 2013.Gone are the exciting developments about Humira and other breakthrough drugs.Their developed market pharma business was sold to Mylan (MYL) in 2015.Abbott is now totally focused on generics and bringing their remaining developed pharma products to developing markets like India, China and Brazil.Also, Medical Devices is becoming a larger share of the revenue pie with these aforementioned divestitures and the St. Jude (NYSE:STJ) acquisition announced in April of 2016.This acquisition is exciting for me because, as the WSJ article above cited, medical device growth for Abbott has been slower than overall company growth at 1.5% versus 5.0+% and St. Jude had slightly declining sales in 2015. I am hopeful the combination can lead to cost cuts and increased product innovation that can reignite growth in this segment of the business.The Way ForwardNow that we know what kind of company Abbott has become, what kind of stock and investment will it be going forward? Clearly, Abbott can no longer be considered a pharmaceutical play as that segment will likely be reduced to under 15% of sales going forward, once St. Jude is brought into the fold.Investors who are looking to avoid patent cliffs in the biotech and pharmaceutical sector will also find Abbott a safe place to hide out. Patent cliffs can be seen depressing many companies in the space such as Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD), whose shares are among the cheapest using traditional earnings to price valuations on fears of their two blockbuster drugs running out of steam.GILD P/E Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsAcross the pond, GlaxoSmithKline(NYSE:GSK) has also wormed itself into a position where growth has come to a halt and must be reignited, again due in large part to patent expirations on key products.GSK is now in a jam where they are committed to maintaining a dividend that exceeds cash flow.(Source: GSK 2015 Annual Report)The future I see for Abbott is a company that should have none of the problems associated with these and other biotech companies whether they be patent cliff or political rhetoric related.Abbott looks to be a company that can anchor the healthcare sector of your portfolio and provided consistent and growing returns over long periods of time but without any huge peaks and valleys from blockbuster drug approvals and denials. This may be more attractive for investors looking for a more stable dividend type stock in the healthcare field.Recent QuarterAbbott reported results on April 20, 2016. Sales were a mixed bag with underlying sales growth strong but reported sales growth down slightly, mostly due to currency issues. The currency has plagued Abbott and many other multi-nationals over the last two years. Currency hits were 2.4% in 2014 and 8% in 2015.US sales were quite strong though:The company raised their 2016 guidance to $2.14-$2.24 from $2.10-$2.20 and declared a dividend for the 369th consecutive quarter.There is not a lot to dislike about the quarter overall, other than the currency headwinds making international sales look weak. This will remain a challenge for Abbott as international sales are their fastest growing market and the only one they have left when it comes to their pharmaceutical business.ValuationOn an absolute basis, looking at the standalone company that Abbott is, I would need to see a low multiple given the slower growth than in the past. That being said, on a relative basis in this market, the fact that the stock trades where it does despite the company having actual growth makes it seem like a fair value.There are many companies with anemic to no growth trading much higher, for example Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Waste Management (NYSE:WM).The stock trades at 17.2 times next year's earnings using the low end of the company provided range. I have noticed many portals display odd numbers for trailing P/E which might be due to the sale to Mylan or other strategic changes throwing off the numbers.Using very conservative estimates of 4% earnings growth over 10 years and then 0% after that, a DCF model gives us a fair value today of $42.72.In reality, I think earnings and thus the dividend will grow much faster. This makes ABT even more compelling at these prices.Other comparisons include Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) trading at 18.3 this year's earnings, Stryker (NYSE:SYK) at 25.8, and S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) at 18.81.The question you have to ask yourself is if this slight valuation makes ABT cheap enough to justify its reduced growth prospects going forward, now that it shed some of its faster-growing businesses.Dividend & Balance SheetAbbott has paid dividends for 92 consecutive years and raised that dividend annually for the last 44.ABT Dividend data by YChartsThe hiccup was due to the AbbVie spin-off. The dividend payout ratio is around half with $1.04 dividends per year out of earnings of $2.14 to $2.24 as noted above.The stock yields 2.87%.After all the repositioning, Abbott's balance sheet remains in great condition. Cash and cash equivalents are roughly equal to long-term debt. The company clearly has room to lever up even further for acquisitions even after the $25b acquisition of St. Jude closes.ConclusionI like the new look Abbott Laboratories. I think the valuation is fair given its peers and the market, and I think the biotech negativity might have given Abbott a decent price in the market despite the fact that it no longer has much to do with specialty pharma or price gouging.It appears Abbott is now a slow and steady growing stock that pays a healthy and growing dividend. Explosive growth may be gone but I expect the company to continue its long legacy of increasing shareholder wealth over the long haul."
3969933,40561,2016-05-02T07:00:00-04:00,"On Thursday April 28th, Abbott announced it was acquiring St. Jude Medical for $25 billion, making its proposed acquisition of Alere seem less likely.By the end of the day on Thursday, Alere announced Abbott has requested to cancel it's proposed deal.Even if both companies had financing in place, it's hard not to imagine Abbott fighting Alere to cancel the deal.","Over the past few weeks, it's seeming more and more plausible that Abbott (NYSE:ABT) is ready to move away from its proposed acquisition of Alere. This is mainly due to issues that arose at Alere (NYSE:ALR) prior to the announcement of the acquisition. Let's look at a timeline here:Friday, I put out an article on Alere discussing why its proposed acquisition by Abbott seemed much less likely if Abbott's acquisition of St. Jude Medical went through. Not long after that, Alere put out a press release announcing it received an extension from lenders to file its 10-K and that Abbott had requested to cancel it's acquisition of Alere because of it's issues with the DoJ. Put yourself in Abbott's shoes. Why bother with Alere now?Integration IssuesAbbott is going to have it's hands full digesting St. Jude Medical (STJ), which is much bigger than Alere. Integrating St. Jude and extracting the $500 million of synergies from the deal will likely keep them busy for the next 12 - 18 months. How could they possibly squeeze Alere in as well?Alere already has accounting issues and is under investigation by the DoJ. Trying to integrate that with Abbott would be an absolute mess. Better yet, it's impossible to quantify what could happen as a result of the DoJ investigation. You never know with the government. Just ask Millennium Health. The government can turn your lights off, and I'm sure Abbott wants no part of that outcome. Whatever synergies they could extract from a deal with Alere, clearly aren't worth the headache.Potential to Lose Investment Grade RatingJust by combining St. Jude with Abbott, along with the debt required to fund the purchase, puts Abbott's debt to EBITDA leverage over 6.0x. To offset this, Abbott did state there would be a 'deleveraging plan' to achieve a 4.5x debt to EBITDA initially, primarily by issuing equity to pay down debt. According to Moody's, they'd expect Abbott's unsecured credit rating to drop to Baa3, right on the border of investment grade. Abbott has stated that is plans to structure the deal in order to stay investment grade, which as of now, sound like they will.Then there's Alere, a troubled, overlevered company with a debt to EBITDA ratio close to 7.0x. Can Abbott acquire St. Jude and Alere and still remain investment grade? Sure they can. Here's there options:Does acquiring Alere in any way benefit Abbott shareholders at this point? I'd highly doubt it at this point. Abbott shareholders would likely get diluted from some sort of equity issuance, to the benefit of Alere debt and equity holders, as Abbott is unlikely willing to give up it's investment grade credit rating.Summing It UpAbbott would be best to find a way out of the deal with Alere. Right now Abbott is having trouble receiving the material non-public information it need to complete its due diligence on the deal, mainly because of the issues with the DoJ. I'm no expert on merger arbitrage, but with all the issues arising around receiving that information and the potential for something 'material' to arise from the DoJ investigation, I think Abbott will have enough reason to back out of the deal."

3983728,101378,2016-06-22T15:38:51-04:00,Abbott is a Dividend Aristocrat.Abbott has raised its dividend 44 years in a row.Abbott recognized that it needed some well considered acquisitions to continue its path of unparalleled accomplishment.Abbott surveyed the landscape and selected a worthy candidate to acquire.and then another.And then the music stopped.,"Introduction""An' lea'e us nought but grief an' pain, For promis'd joy!"" Robert Burns (1785)This article found its gestation in two prior SA articles. One is an article I wrote earlier. The second is an article by Justin Polce, ""A Deal Worth A Leer"".The SetupI tell Abbott's (NYSE:ABT) recent history in the first section of my earlier article. Abbott ably recounts its own story starting earlier in its history on its web site. There are few American companies among our great pantheon of exceptional blue chip companies who have a prouder heritage.Nonetheless, Abbott's growth projections have disappointed recently. This is not something a premier blue chip company who aspires to maintain that status dares ignore for very long. Abbott is not one of those. It has responded vigorously. As matters unfold it may prove to have done so with excessive vigor.Abbott's Alere Acquisition DealThe very article I cite to show concern over Abbott's growth also announced Abbott's initial and most controversial response to it. It reports an acquisition announced February 1, 2016 for which Abbott issued an enthusiastic press release stating:A local Chicago (Abbott's home town) business publication provides an entertaining, rather disconcerting, take on the deal. This second article's title is framed as a question: ""Why on earth is Abbott's White spending $5.8 billion on Alere?""The first line of the article answers the question as follows: ""He can't help himself.""It goes on to provocatively remind readers of White's recent remarks in a January 2016 earnings release relating to the prevailing prices of potential acquisition targets:Concerns over the Alere deal have persisted. At Abbott's next conference call on 4/20/16 the Alere deal was a thorny issue. One conference call questioner requested help in responding to his investors' concerns about the Alere deal:Chairman White's answer eschewed particularity. Instead he took very much a ""big picture"" approach to the point. He said:This was not the last question for that conference call on the Alere deal.Another Alere question was right on target from a time-line perspective given Abbott's soon to be announced offer to pay a termination fee to void the Alere deal:This one earned a cautious response, as follows:This was an answer to make Abbott's lawyers smile. Such an answer is unlikely to come back to bite the speaker at some subsequent deposition.Of course there is no way to know right now if the Abbott-Alere deal is headed to litigation. On the other hand, it is certainly not beyond the realm of reasonable speculation.Alere-Abbott Deal ChallengesSo exactly what has dampened Abbott's swashbuckling ardor for the Alere deal? No one outside Abbott's inner circle of decision makers will ever know for sure. Likely they are not all of one mind on the point.Some will say that the St. Jude deal has played a part. In his April 20, 2016 earnings call Chairman White was able to pre-announce his demurrer to any possible such claim in response to a question which asked:Knowing that he would shortly be announcing a $25 billion acquisition, Chairman White would be forgiven if he had a smirk on his face when he responded:Of course the question asked about ""another medium size transaction"" while the St. Jude deal is more of an extra jumbo size transaction. Nonetheless the answer expresses no constraints along this line other than debt rating.This sets a low bar. Although the St. Jude deal is posing debt rating challenges, they are likely manageable over time. For now Moody's and S&P both see the combined deals as having negative impacts on Abbott's current stellar credit rating. Nonetheless, both express confidence in Abbott's ongoing stability after defined credit downgrades. I explore these further towards the end of this article.A more acceptable and likely more accurate reason why Abbott would gladly pay several tens of millions to get out of the deal is the one mentioned by Alere in its release announcing rejection of the offer.According to an April 29, 2016 Reuters report:Can Abbott Get Out of the Alere Deal?Fifty million is chump change. If Alere had let Abbott off the hook for this amount its shareholders would be justifiably outraged. The Abbott-Alere deal reportedly involved a 50% premium to Alere compared to its pre-deal price. If Alere released Abbott without an alternative purchaser in place and charged Abbott less than a ten figure fee it would cause itself no end of problems.How about Abbott freeing itself from the contract in accordance with the terms of the contract. First, let me make it clear that this contract is gnarly as only might be imagined by a major Chicago law firm working out a multibillion dollar merger for its client with a major New York law firm on the other side. My interpretation is anything but authoritative. Nonetheless, I have read portions of the contract and will give my take.Can Abbott scoot away from the deal by paying its termination fee of …of…? Check it out. Section 7.03 calls for a plump termination fee of $177 million. This is of no apparent use to Abbott in its current situation. The fee is labeled as a ""Company Termination Fee"". Alere is the ""Company"" and this fee appears to be a charge imposed on it and payable to Abbott if Alere should opt for a better offer.Abbott is defined as the ""Parent"". There is no ""Parent Termination Fee"". The contract does give Abbott the right to terminate in case of a breach by Alere but only in specific situations. These are not clear cut.The contract contains a representation at section 3.08 that since January 1, 2014, Alere has been in compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Alere is being investigated for possible failures in this regard. However, at the current time, there is no public proof that Alere has violated this Act. The only thing that is known is that Alere is being targeted for possible violation. The contract representation is not simple. It would not apply to violations that would not have a material adverse affect on Alere in accordance with that term as defined in the definition section 8.12 of the contract.Abbott's home town business journal has reviewed the situation at length. It sets out a well considered analysis.This article looks to other deals to assess the possible outcomes. It notes:The Bottom LineThe Polce SA article I referenced at the outset estimates a successful Corrupt Practices probe as creating a potential $65 million fine for Alere. The author and I trade comments as to whether or not this would create an out for Abbott. At the time I thought it would. Now, having spent more time reading the actual contract language, I am less sure. In any case it will take a good long time before anyone knows if the current situation rises to that magnitude of risk.By my evaluation time and distraction of this issue create the far greatest dilemmas for Abbott.Bringing successful mergers to their full potential is a significant independent management challenge. It requires ongoing management of personnel to maximize their effectiveness for the newly merged entity.How daunting of a challenge is it for Abbott as it decides how to best deploy its new assets, to realize that there could be one or more key personnel, contractors, or representatives who later turn out to be toxic as the criminal probe crawls forward.Abbott's Upcoming >40 days Wanderings in the DesertAbbott's near term future will challenge the company.Moodys and S&P view the proposed transactions similarly in this respect. Once Abbott closes on its two deals the die is cast. We will look at the Moody's version here. First comes the credit rating downgrade. While acknowledging that Abbott intends to partly fund its acquisition spree with new stock issuance, Moody's still has specific rating downgrades in mind. It has stated:Moody's discussion of the situation is direct and to the point. It seems perceptive and noteworthy to this author. Moody's later commentary states:It goes on to make predictions and note possible alternative courses, pointing out possible risks and opportunities:Similar cautions and commentary are available from S&P (it will lower Abbott's corporate credit rating to ""BBB-"".In SA commentary following SA's news announcement of the acquisition, several commentators note that the deals will serve as a constraint on Abbott's dividends going forward. Of particular note is the following excerpt which Wambaugh takes from Abbott's Investor's Relation site:No mention is made of this but synergies are part of Abbott's inducement to do the deals. One possible source of synergistic savings is layoffs.SummaryMake no mistake if all goes well, ""well"" won't be quite as well as it would have been if Abbott could have managed these deals at more palatable prices. If the Alere deal turns into the stinker which could occur, ""well"" may be quite ""unwell""…at least until Abbott gets back on track.Abbott's chairman White knows better than to ""sweat the small stuff"". He is able to breeze ahead with a deal that appears to be of the very type he recently ridiculed. He sees the growth potential in merger with a company growing more slowly than his own.As the next few years unfold his mettle is destined for repeated testing. He has ratings' agencies to appease, investors spoiled by a stellar string of past regular dividend raises, companies and businesses to integrate."

Not so much.The sharp drop in share price has left me closer on the ""buy"" side of the fence.","Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is on an acquisition spree, but the most recently announced deal to buy St. Jude Medical (NYSE:STJ) didn't seem to be too popular with the market. Shares have shed over 10% of their value since the deal was announced on Thursday. There seems to be some uncertainty over the Alere (NYSE:ALR) deal as well, which I personally think could be a positive if it falls through. The sharp drop in Abbott's share price was sudden, but it may have created a long-term opportunity as well.The Alere deal - I don't like itFellow contributor Paul Nouri wrote a solid article detailing why the Alere deal may be destructive to Abbott shareholders' wealth. I'd like to also opine that I'm no fan of the deal either.Looking at Alere, I can see why Abbott might want it superficially, especially for its point-of-care diagnostic testing. Looking at the numbers, though, I don't like the deal. Alere is loaded with debt, and taking a glance on Morningstar, its return on invested capital hit a high peak of only 2.35% in fiscal 2014. This compares to Abbott's ROIC of around 15% for fiscal 2015. However, Abbott achieved ROIC of only 6.74% in 2013 and 7.64% in 2014, but we can see that the trend has been towards improvement post the AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) split.Abbott also generates better cash flow in my opinion, with free cash flow as a percentage of sales ranging between 9% to a little over 12% post AbbVie. Alere only converts about $0.05 of every $1 into free cash flow.Now, to make the deal even foggier, there appears to be turbulence between the two companies. Abbott apparently has some concerns about the deal, attempting to terminate it, but Alere's board rejected Abbott's request, indicating that there was no basis for it.Alere is also currently being investigated by the U.S. government over its sales practices in some emerging and frontier markets. Abbott also thinks there may be some inaccuracies with some of Alere's representations, warranties and covenants in its merger agreement, according to CNBC. Abbott's offer to terminate the deal was also apparently related to Alere's delay in filing its 2015 Form 10‑K, as well as the other issues mentioned above.St. Jude looks like a much better dealAbbott announced its acquisition of Alere in February, and then just recently announced it will be buying St. Jude as well. I personally like this deal better, and if completed, it should make Abbott a stronger competitor in the medical devices market.St. Jude also looks like a solid business on its own, boasting ROIC ranging between 10% to north of 16% consistently over the last decade. It's also a cash cow, with free cash flow to sales ratios usually falling in the 15-20% range over the last ten years.I'm not sure I like the dilution that will occur to existing Abbott shareholders because of the new equity (roughly $3 billion in new shares) that will be issued to rebalance the company's capital structure, but at least it's relatively clear that Abbott is getting an excellent business at a decent price, unlike the Alere acquisition.Less dividend growth? One thing is for certain, Abbott will have much more leverageAbbott is a dividend aristocrat. It has raised its dividend every year for over four decades, and has been increasing it at a rapid clip. This may change after the recent spending spree, however. The company will be taking on a lot more leverage (assuming both deals are approved and/or don't fall through).It will likely have to be a lot more financially disciplined going forward as a result, especially to maintain its investment grade credit rating. Abbott's leverage sat at about 2 times before its recent purchases. After the closing of both deals, however, that number will be more around 5 times. The Alere purchase was financed in part with a $9 billion bridge loan, and another $17.2 billion loan has been introduced to help with the St. Jude purchase.Issuing additional equity and raising cash is likely in part needed to preserve the company's credit rating. S&P Ratings Services recently kept Abbott's credit rating at A+, but with negative implications.Going forward, I think the company will be more focused on deleveraging than dividend growth, assuming both pending transactions are completed. The St. Jude acquisition will bring Abbott another $5.7 billion in net debt.ConclusionIn a perfect world, I would personally like to see the Alere deal go away and see Abbott only acquire St. Jude. I personally like the latter deal much more and think it's a solid long-term move. I can live without high single-digit dividend growth if the business will be stronger in the long term. A starting yield of around 2.7% isn't too shabby, either.I think shares will become especially compelling if they drop just a little more, placing Abbott's dividend yield closer to the 3% mark. That would also mean new 52-week lows, however.Will Abbott get there? No one has a crystal ball, but I could see this scenario playing out if arbitrageurs short the company and go long St. Jude to make money off the spread.After the sizeable haircut that's left shares at around 17.6 times projected 2016 earnings, I'm seriously contemplating jumping back into Abbott Labs. I would probably jump right in if the Alere deal fell through."
3957149,25024,2016-03-10T07:30:08-05:00,"The Alere acquisition will dilute Abbott's operating earnings 12%.Even on a non-GAAP basis, the combined company will need to reach over $100 million in synergies before becoming accretive for Abbott shareholders.Alere's largest markets face increased competition in the near-mid term.At Alere's size, its under performance won't be enough to put Abbott into existential harm, however, it is likely to serve as an ongoing nuisance.","Alere (NYSE:ALR) is the #1 global provider of point of care testing. Abbott (NYSE:ABT) more broadly earns revenue from sales of nutritional supplements, medical devices, diagnostics and established pharmaceuticals. On February 1, it was announced that Abbott would acquire Alere for $56 per share in an all-cash transaction, resulting in a total enterprise value of $8.4 billion.This is not a straightforward deal to analyze due to the fact that it is markedly dilutive on a GAAP basis and still dilutive on a non-GAAP basis (though management asserts it will be $0.12-$0.13/share accretive in 2017 and more than $0.20 accretive in 2018). Management's guidance implies that it will be able to realize nearly $300 million in synergies in 2017 and an additional $150 million of synergies in 2018. The anticipated synergies appear aggressive in light of the fact that Alere's current operating income is reflective of a major restructuring program the company undertook, whereby, for the first nine months of 2016, while sales were down 4% from the prior year period, operating costs declined 16%. To be sure, Abbott will shift Alere's sales from global distributors to Abbott's direct sales presence; this will provide cost savings. Additionally, where research and development and existing product lines are redundant, the company will likely look to streamline efforts into one product line. However, Abbott's point of care business stands at merely $473 million, implying somewhat limited overlap in operations. The $500 million in synergies that Abbott claims it will produce entering 2019 represents almost 2/3 of Alere's operating expenses, a seemingly lofty goal to hit. In areas where the two companies indeed overlap, there is increased risk for revenue dyssynergy in the pursuit of such substantial cost savings.Looking at metrics for the two companies in the table below, while some of the valuation metrics are similar, what stands out the most is the difference in constant currency growth. While Abbott grew substantially in 2015, Alere did not grow at all, yet, Abbott is purchasing Alere at the same price/sales its own shares fetch. For 2016, analysts do not expect either company to grow sales. While the takeout multiple of 23x free cash flow is reasonable for a medical device/diagnostic products company, the premium on GAAP income stands out as extraordinary, given the size of the transaction. As a result, Abbott will need to take out nearly half of Alere's cash expense cost structure before seeing any GAAP income accretion. Also, Alere's tangible book value is -$1.8 billion, but given that Abbott is purchasing Alere for nearly $6 billion, the acquisition is likely to wipe out any remaining tangible book value for Abbott. The announced deal will take the difference between Abbott's GAAP & non-GAAP EPS from 8% to nearly 20%, creating greater discrepancies in the company's quarterly earnings releases.*Net Income + Depreciation & Amortization - Capital Expenditures** Operating income does not include extraordinary itemsIn addition to the deal appearing pricey financially, Alere is likely to soon face increased competition in its infectious disease, cardiac and fever portfolios. Chembio (NASDAQ:CEMI) and Trinity Biotech (NASDAQ:TRIB) are looking to gain approval for new products in these markets over the next twelve months and both cite superior test performance.I do not suggest that investors short shares of Abbott, but I do caution them on what might be a bumpy integration in its purchase of Alere. Alere has produced an operating loss of nearly a billion dollars over the past ten years. When backing out charges, the company's operating income averaged $85 million per year in the same period, paling in comparison to the $8.4 billion enterprise value at which it is being purchased. With Abbott paying such a high multiple for an inconsistent company, any mistakes along the way (missed synergy targets, revenue under-performance at Alere, etc.) will likely put multiple pressure on Abbott's stock."
3770176,23479,2015-12-22T03:45:19-05:00,"Abbot's heart stent, Absorb, is expected to attract significant adoption in the U.S. market if it gets FDA approval. Also, Abbott is in the process of getting approval in other bigger coronary stent markets, such as China, Japan, etc., which leaves significant room for the company to expand its sales in the bioresorbable stent market.If Abbott is successful in getting FDA approval in the U.S and other key markets by 2016, the company can reverse the declining trend in its market share in the vascular segment, which constitutes 15% of its value, as per our estimates.The company can be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the trend of increased discretionary spending on nutritional products and point-of-care diagnostics in the near future, due to its focus on new products and the fact that the Nutritionals and Diagnostics businesses contribute more than 50% to its value.Our price estimate of $45 for Abbott Laboratories is closer to the current market price.","We expect a significant upside to our price estimate for healthcare major Abbott (NYSE:ABT) if it succeeds in getting FDA approval for commercialization of its fully dissolving heart stent, Absorb, in the U.S. by the end of 2016. Additionally, there could be additional upside if the company is able to expand its foothold in emerging markets. Two specific drivers include the increasing adoption of its I-Stat point-of-care diagnostics system, and continuing growth of the Nutritionals segment. Below, we detail these scenarios and discuss their impact on Abbott's value estimate.Our price estimate of $45 for Abbott Laboratories is closer to the current market price.If Abbott Gets The FDA Approval For Absorb: 10% UpsideA couple of months back, Abbott reported positive results for its fully dissolving heart stent, Absorb, which it will now leverage to get FDA approval in the U.S. Unlike a metallic stent that remains permanently in the coronary artery after opening a blockage, the company's Absorb stent dissolves completely, leaving the vessel in the natural state after it is fully restored. A fully restored vessel has the potential to flex and dilate in response to the person's lifestyle. Absorb, being the first of its kind in the U.S., is expected to attract significant adoption in the U.S. market after the FDA approval. Also, Abbott is in the process of getting approval in other bigger coronary stent markets, such as China, Japan, etc., which leaves significant room for the company to expand its sales in the bioresorbable stent market, which is projected to account for 17% of stent sales by 2021, up from less than 2% in 2014.If Abbott is successful in getting FDA approval in the U.S and other key markets by 2016, the company can reverse the declining trend in its market share in the vascular segment, which constitutes 15% of its value, as per our estimates. We currently forecast the company's market share in vascular segment to decline from 22% in 2015 to 18% over the next six-seven years. However, successful commercialization of Absorb can push the market share to around 24% instead.Given that bioresorbable stents come at twice the price of a conventional drug eluting stent, owing to the product's benefits, Abbott stands a strong chance of improving its gross margins as well. (""Leaders emerge in the race for the first U.S. bioresorbable stent"", FierceMedicalDevices, July 31, 2014) By commanding a pricing premium for Absorb, Abbott can increase its gross margins by 1.5-2.0 percentage points over our current projections in the long run. The combined effect of the aforementioned factors translates into a 10% upside to our price estimate for Abbott.Targeting Emerging Markets To Improve Nutritionals And Diagnostics Market Share: 10% UpsideEmerging markets have delivered strong sales growth for Abbott's Nutritionals and Diagnostics segment in the past. Developing markets, such as China, India, Russia and Brazil, continue to grow at a faster rate than most developed economies and have a rapidly growing middle class population. The median income per household is expected to grow by 90% in real terms in India and China by 2030. As the middle class continues to expand, people are likely to increase their discretionary spending on nutritional products (such as food supplements) and point-of-care diagnostics. We can expect Abbott to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of this trend in the near future, due to its focus on new products and the fact that the Nutritionals and Diagnostics businesses contribute more than 50% to its value.We currently forecast Abbott's market share in diagnostics to stabilize at 8% by the end of our forecast period. (We have calculated market share based on the company's reported revenues and estimated market size.) However, if the company expands its presence in key emerging markets in the point-of-care business by aggressively commercializing its I-Stat system in the region, it can expand its market share in diagnostics by up to 2 percentage points in the long run.In the Nutritionals segment, we currently forecast Abbott's market share to decline from 2% in 2014 to 1.75% over the next six-seven years, due to increasing competition. However, if the company expands its reach in the emerging markets by targeting the growing need for nutrition in the middle class and does not fall behind its competitors, it can increase its market share by at least 75 basis points (long run) in the Nutritionals segment. With an improvement in market share in both the Nutritionals and Diagnostics segments, there can be about 5% upside to the company's value.Disclosure: No positions."
3933966,21877,2016-02-26T07:28:53-05:00,,"Abbott (NYSE:ABT) has invested a lot in Absorb, its dissolving version of a drug-eluting stent, in terms of money, time and effort. The device is intended to follow Xience, Abbott's market-leading DES, and with no similar device nearly as advanced, the company hopes that US approval of Absorb will allow it to retain its top-dog position.Absorb succeeded in its US pivotal trial, which had the gold standard Xience as the comparator, so everything is set for a positive verdict when an FDA panel meets mid-March to decide whether to recommend approval. Or is it?Certainly, the bioresorbable polymer-based scaffold showed non-inferiority to Xience on target lesion failure at one year. But the non-inferiority margin was pretty wide at 4.5 percentage points. Absorb was well within this, being 1.7 points behind the older stent, but Xience was undeniably the more effective device.Moreover, all principal analyses in Absorb III were performed in the intent-to-treat population, rather than the generally preferable (for non-inferiority studies) as-treated cohort. In a post hoc as-treated analysis, the difference in target lesion failure at one year widened, favouring Xience by 1.9 percentage points.The story with safety data was similar, with almost no significant differences, but Absorb was numerically worse on all measures, including death, heart attack and the need for revascularisation.Long time comingNone of this is disastrous for Absorb's chances of approval. But the polymer-based device is acknowledged as harder to deliver than its metallic counterparts, adding another risk when it is rolled out to a wider group of cardiologists, less experienced than those who took part in the trial.Until deliverability improves - Abbott has developed a special catheter called GlideTrack to address this, but as with all first-generation tech, there is still room for improvement - it is likely the stent will only be suitable for the least complex lesions.When EP Vantage spoke to the president of Abbott Vascular, Deepak Nath, at last year's ESC meeting, he was adamant that a primary endpoint hit in Absorb III was ""what's needed"" to gain US approval.Absorb is important to the company. It began working towards the device in 2003; that it has taken this long to get close to US approval shows the complexity of the technology. It also clearly illustrates the risk of developing something so unlike what has come before.Absorb was once the subject of feverish excitement, but the sell side is now cooling its expectations of what it will mean for Abbott. In January 2013, analysts at RBC Capital Markets described it as ""a major pipeline game changer"", but those at Leerink, writing three years later, stated that its initial market opportunity ""seems less meaningful than we had expected when the programme began several years ago"".Abbott expects uptake of Absorb to be higher in the US than it has been in Europe. Though as it has never released specific sales figures for the device, its US revenues are hard to forecast.The chances of getting any US revenues at all will be markedly increased by a positive panel decision in a couple of weeks. Even armed with a pivotal primary endpoint success, the company cannot be completely certain of getting one."
3751706,89805,2015-12-12T12:38:31-05:00,"ABT has paid dividends since 1924 and increased its dividend for 43 straight years.The company's diversified healthcare portfolio, conservative balance sheet, and strength in emerging markets supports long-term earnings growth.Is now the right time for dividend growth investors to buy?","Abbott (NYSE:ABT) is a dividend aristocrat with excellent long-term growth potential. The company maintains a diversified mix of healthcare products that are sold around the world. Many of these products are recession-resistant and will enjoy more demand as consumer wealth increases in emerging markets, where ABT generates about half of its total sales.The company's dividend is extremely safe and appears to offer upper single-digit growth potential going forward. These are the types of companies we love to own in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio when they trade at a fair price. Let's take a closer look at the business.Business OverviewABT has been in business for more than 125 years. The company spun off its research-based pharmaceuticals business (AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV)) in the beginning of 2013, leaving it with four diversified healthcare segments - nutrition products (34% of sales through Q3), branded generic drugs (19%), medical devices (25%), and diagnostic products (23%). About half of the company's sales are made directly to consumers and patients, and the company sells over 10,000 different products.By geography, over 70% of ABT's revenue is derived outside of the U.S., and about 50% of total sales come from emerging markets.Business AnalysisEach of ABT's businesses has some unique competitive advantages. Around half of the company's sales are made directly to consumers and patients. These products primarily reside in the company's adult and pediatric nutrition segment and its branded generic drugs.In some ways, these businesses are more like consumer packaged goods companies than traditional healthcare businesses. Their market positions benefit from decades of marketing campaigns to build up brand equity, research expenses to meet consumer tastes, and distribution relationships to maintain valuable shelf space.With over 125 years of business history, ABT has built up leadership positions in many of these markets. The company is the global leader in adult nutrition and has the number one spot in U.S. pediatric nutrition. In total, the nutrition segment has 50 consumer brands and is #1 or #2 in 25 countries. Within branded generics, ABT holds top market positions in India, Russia, and several Latin American countries.ABT's medical devices and diagnostics businesses are a bit faster-moving, requiring constant R&D investments to generate profitable sales growth. Once again, however, ABT holds leading market share positions in several key categories - LASIK, cataract surgery, amino-acid diagnostics, blood screening, and more.Breaking into these markets is a challenge for new entrants for several reasons. Some markets are heavily regulated by the government (e.g. medical devices, pharmaceuticals, nutritional products), require high investment costs (ABT invests 6-7% of sales in R&D, or about $1.3 billion last year), need global distribution, and face patent or trademark protection.In addition to relatively high barriers to entry, ABT plays in markets where growth in healthcare has high demand. Consumers in emerging markets (50% of ABT's sales) often pay out-of-pocket for medicine and can't afford expensive brands, creating significant opportunity for ABT's branded generics. As spending on healthcare in emerging markets continues to rise with economic growth, almost all of ABT's product lines should benefit.Many of ABT's product categories are also recession-resistant. The company's 2015 third-quarter results were reported during a time where many other businesses were being adversely impacted by the slowdown in China. ABT, however, reported double-digit growth in each of its segment's China operations. The company appears to be playing within healthcare areas with high demand.Should ABT identify an emerging healthcare trend that it would like to participate more fully in, the company has the balance sheet to acquire its way into the market. We think the company's balance sheet could enable it to easily pull off $10-20 billion in deals if it saw the right opportunities.ABT has historically been acquisitive. The company purchased CFR Pharmaceuticals for $3.4 billion in September 2014 to double its branded generics presence in Latin America; bought Topera for $250 million in December 2014 to enter the electrophysiology market; and purchased Veropharm in December 2014 for $315 million to establish a pharmaceuticals manufacturing base in Russia.Deals like these strengthen the company's future growth prospects and help it further widen the moats of its existing businesses. Once ABT has developed or acquired new product offerings, it can take advantage of its strong brands and global distribution network to grow them quickly.As long as ABT's management team can continue generating results from the company's R&D and acquire the right complementary businesses to remain in the right profitable niches abroad, the company's future looks bright.Key RisksOne of the things we like about ABT is its cash flow diversification. The company's operations are balanced between four unique segments, which each have different risks and growth opportunities.This is similar to owning a diversified portfolio of stocks rather than relying on just one for dividend income, reducing your risk. For example, when ABT's pediatric nutrition business was dealing with product recalls in China two years ago, its other segments continued performing well and helped insulate the company's overall earnings. The company sells over 10,000 different products and doesn't depend on any single one for growth.The same is true of ABT's geographical mix. The company generates about 70% of its revenue from outside of the U.S. and sells its products in over 150 countries. This is important within healthcare because each country has a unique set of government regulations that can alter the profitability of different business lines.In the U.S., for example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has meaningfully weighed on the medical device industry by subjecting them to a new 2.3% sales tax. Since ABT is in many different countries with diverse lines of products, it is better protected from unexpected regulatory or economic growth changes.With that said, ABT's concentration in emerging markets (50% of sales) is hurting the business today. The strong U.S. dollar is hurting reported sales and earnings growth and also slowing growth in some emerging markets. The recession-resistant nature of many of its healthcare products is helping, but the company is not out of the clear yet.Another risk that could hurt near-term profits for several quarters is raw material cost inflation within ABT's nutritional segment. The company has benefited from several years of lower priced commodities. However, even management notes that this tailwind could reverse course:We bring this up because ABT's nutritional products business has improved its margins from 15.7% in 2012 to 21.0% in 2014, a large jump driven mostly by manufacturing and distribution process changes, but also by some luck (raw material tailwinds). Regardless, we think this would provide a nice long-term buying opportunity.Overall, we think the diversity of ABT's business, numerous sources for potential future growth, and the company's healthy balance sheet reduce a lot of its fundamental risk. We will continue to watch pricing and profitability trends in emerging markets, which are the company's biggest long-term profit drivers, but the business looks to be headed in the right direction today.Dividend AnalysisWe analyze 25+ years of dividend data and 10+ years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend. Note that historical data prior to 2013 includes AbbVie and, therefore, is not necessarily representative of ABT.Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question, ""Is the current dividend payment safe?"" We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios, debt levels, free cash flow generation, industry cyclicality, ROIC trends, and more. Scores of 50 are average, 75 or higher is very good, and 25 or lower is considered weak.ABT's dividend appears to be extremely safe. The company achieved an excellent dividend Safety Score of 68, suggesting that its current dividend payment is safer than 68% of all other dividend-paying stocks. Factors contributing to ABT's strong rating are its relatively low payout ratios, healthy balance sheet, and recession-resistant products.Using 2016 consensus earnings estimates, ABT's payout ratio is 40%. For a business with stable cash flows like ABT, this is a really healthy level that provides the company with plenty of dividend protection and room for growth.Unfortunately, we don't have a meaningful amount of historical fundamental data to further analyze ABT because its spinoff of AbbVie happened just three years ago. However, we previously highlighted the recession-resistant nature of the company's products, and ABT's business model generates predictable free cash flow to fund sustainable growth and the dividend.We can also look at the company's balance sheet. Companies with high amounts of debt, cyclical business operations, and inconsistent cash flow generation could find themselves in a cash crunch if demand unexpectedly weakens and they have overextended themselves. They will always cut the dividend before missing a debt payment, so monitoring cash and debt levels is important.ABT's balance sheet is in great shape, and the company's long-term debt rating was A+ by Standard and Poor's as of December 2014. As seen below, the company has about $5 in cash on hand for every $1 it paid out in dividends last year. ABT's net debt/EBIT ratio is also very conservative at 0.8x. This means that ABT's net debt could be covered with less than 1.5 years of EBIT. Investors shouldn't lose any sleep worrying about the company's financial health.Source: Simply Safe DividendsDividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question, ""How fast is the dividend likely to grow?"" It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth-centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios. Scores of 50 are average, 75 or higher is very good, and 25 or lower is considered weak.ABT's Growth Score is 76, suggesting that its dividend's growth potential is higher than 76% of all other dividend-paying stocks in our database. ABT has paid dividends since 1924 and increased its dividend for 43 consecutive years. The stock is one of the more notable companies on the dividend aristocrats list.After spinning off AbbVie in early 2013, ABT paid a quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share. The company increased its dividend by 57% in 2014, raising the payment to $0.22 per share. In 2015, ABT raised the dividend again to $0.24 per share, a 9% hike.Looking ahead, we think ABT could easily continue raising its dividend by 7-10% per year as its earnings compound at a similar rate. Using 2016 earnings estimates, the company's payout ratio is a modest 40%. This also provides plenty of room for continued dividend growth even in a challenging environment that weighs on earnings growth.The company also has over $6 billion in cash on hand, nearly five times greater than the total amount of dividends it paid out last year. With only $8 billion in debt, ABT has plenty of flexibility to reinvest in the business, acquire other companies, and raise the dividend.ValuationABT trades at about 19x forward earnings and has a dividend yield of 2.1%. The stock's current valuation doesn't seem unreasonable, but it also doesn't appear to be a bargain. We believe ABT can continue growing its earnings at a high single-digit rate, which implies that the stock's future total returns could range from 9% to 11% per year.Given the softness in emerging markets and currency headwinds working against ABT's business today, we might get a better chance to buy the company. Today doesn't look like the time to go ""all in"" on the stock, but a starter position seems reasonable.ConclusionABT's dividend is extremely safe with above average growth potential. The company's diverse product lines reduce some of the company's fundamental risk while providing numerous opportunities for long-term growth. ABT also maintains a conservative balance sheet that it can use to acquire complementary product lines and return more cash to shareholders.The stock's dividend yield is relatively low today at 2.1%, but dividend growth prospects are solid considering the company's strong earnings growth and 40% payout ratio. Should near-term macro headwinds (stronger dollar, softening emerging markets) impact the stock price, we would strongly consider accumulating a position. For now, we will continue watching some of our other favorite blue chip dividend stocks."
3847216,80836,2016-01-29T09:52:56-05:00,"Abbott Laboratories is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Managed to grow dividends for the past 44 years.A weaker short term outlook sent the stock price down by almost 10%, I find it to be irrational by the market.I will now review the basic fundamentals and valuation and give you 10 reasons to buy after 10% drop.","IntroductionA month ago I explained why I like the sub sector of medical devices companies. I wrote about three main companies: Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX), Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) and Abbott (NYSE:ABT). I tried to compare the three and my results were inconclusive. Nevertheless, I believed that for the long run Abbott is my favorite pick, with Medtronic later, and then Becton Dickson.Yesterday, January 28th 2016, Abbott published its Q4 results to complete 2015. In addition, it also published its outlook for 2016. The earnings were as forecasted by analysts, but the outlook for was weaker than expected.Therefore, the stock fell almost 10%, and now traded for $36.71. I believe that this is truly and overshooting, that was caused by panic, market volatility and probably some stop-losses. In this article I will briefly go over the fundamentals, and valuation, and then give you 10 reasons to buy Abbott.Abbott Laboratories develops, manufactures and sells healthcare products. It has four segments: Pharmaceutical Products, which sells adult and pediatric pharmaceutical products; Nutritional Products, which sells pediatric and adult nutritional products; Diagnostic Products, which sells diagnostic systems and tests for blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories and alternate-care testing sites; and Vascular Products, which sells coronary, endovascular, and vessel closure devices. The principal products in its other businesses include blood glucose monitoring meters, test strips, data management software and accessories for people with diabetes, and medical devices for the eye.FundamentalsAbbott managed to grow both top line and bottom line over the past decades. The company operates in a highly competitive environment, and still manages to show consistency. The company spun off its R&D business, into a separate company Abbvie (NYSE:ABBV). Abbott kept growing since the spin-off as well.In 2015, all business segments grew: diagnostics up 7.3%, medical devices up 1.5%, generic pharmaceutical up 34% due to several acquisitions and nutrition up 5.5%. True fundamentals suffer from forex, and the fact the USD bull cycle is already five years old, but long term investors should just ignore the noise, and look at the core. Not only that the company grew, it will keep operational growth at around 10%.The dividends are also growing consistently. The spin-off made it look like Abbott cut its dividends, but when taking the Abbvie dividends into consideration, you can see that the company managed to consistently grow its dividends for the past 44 years. The yield is now 2.83%, and the payout ratio is sustainable at less than 50%.ValuationThe 10% drop decreased the valuation significantly. Now that the 2015 results and 2016 outlook are both around $2.15 non GAAP. At the current price the P/E ratio and forward P/E are practically the same. The forward P/E is in the range of 15-17, this range in my opinion is attractive for a company that grows its sales and profits so quickly.The P/S ratio and P/B ratio also contracted. The book value and sales didn't contract, and therefore our valuation now is more compelling when using almost every metric. It is time to take advantage of short term decline to achieve long term returns to our portfolio.Ten reasons to buy Abbott Laboratories right now1. In October I published an article similar to this one. It was a day after Abbvie, the company that was spun off Abbott dropped 10% after the FDA published a warning on its HCV drug. The share price declined to $48, and I wrote that the company is very well positioned to cope with the short term headwinds. I believed that the market was overshooting and today, 4 months later, the company trades 16% higher.ABBV data by YCharts2. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is another example of the market being irrational. On a single day in 2015, the stock dropped to $81. Even 3 months ago it traded for $90, and investors who ignored the short term noise and focus on the fundamentals were able to achieve significant returns. Sure, none of us can predict the future, but buying this huge blue chip for a P/E of less than 14 is a bargain. Ignore the background noise.JNJ data by YCharts3. The reason for the decline is the outlook for 2016, the outlook for 2016 is weak due to short term headwinds. Forex which is lowering the EPS and revenues over the past five years, and the situation in Venezuela, a country in Latin America which suffers tremendously form the cheap price of oil. I ignore the short term headwinds and stick to the strong fundamentals of the company, as both factors have nothing to do with the fundamentals.4. Let's look at the bottom line. here is what Miles White, the CEO of Abbott said yesterday.2016 core growth will stay high at double digits. Sure, the numbers are affected by the business environment, but this can go both ways. Business environment can and will enhance earnings in the future when the USD weakens or emerging markets have their economies stabilized.5. Abbott took part in the M&A festival in of the past several years. It acquired companies in the generic drugs industry that are now being assimilated to the company. CFR in Latin American and Veropharm in Russia will both strengthen the position that Abbott holds in the emerging markets and fuel its growth there.6. Emerging markets are growing. The economies are growing and so is the population of the countries. The life expectancy is growing as well, and medical treatment isn't a luxury anymore. It is a service that is consumed by the population, and the demand for it is growing. Without Venezuela Abbott managed to grow sales in the emerging markets by solid 10%, and the need for improved medical equipment isn't going to fade.7. Abbott is also expanding to new areas, the firm doesn't only try to increase its market share where it leads, but it also tries to penetrated to new areas. The ability to lead several sectors while trying to penetrate new ones, will help Abbot bring higher returns. Abbott will try to expand into the vascular intervention sector.8. The number one cause of death in the U.S is heart diseases. Heart attacks caused sometimes by a clogged artery. Xcience stent manufactured by Abbott is a true leader in this industry. The demand is high in the US and the Affordable Care Act will make it more affordable and increase the demands.9. Price is at its lowest point over the past 2 years. If you believe in the company, you now have an opportunity to buy it for a legacy price.ABT data by YCharts10. Yield is very high compared to peers and the company's history. Dividend is an important part of the total return, especially if it is reinvested. The current yield is close to 3%, and grows systematically for decades. It is much higher yield than what BDX or MDT can offer you. The dividend alone isn't enough, but it is backed by superb fundamentals.ConclusionThe market chose to look at the short term weakness and value the share accordingly. This is the time when I as a long term investor, can take advantage of it. I have an opportunity to buy Abbott at the same price it traded for over two years ago. Most analysts rated it as a ""BUY"" back then, if EPS is higher and price is the same, I believe that now is a great time to buy it as well."
3625406,94676,2015-10-30T08:54:21-04:00,"Abbott Laboratories is poised for a higher stock price.
        Growth fueled by emerging markets remains strong.
        ABT is doing a great job overcoming industry challenges.
        Abbott will benefit from trends in demographics.","Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is poised for another stock price appreciation in the coming months. The price performance has been relatively lackluster for 2015 and is currently up 0.01% for the year. This is out of the ordinary for Abbott. ABT has been a good performer returning 85% since 2011. I expect ABT stock to get back on track and push toward a fresh 52 week high by the end of the year. Abbott focuses on emerging healthcare markets such as China, Vietnam, and India to fuel growth.The company most recently reported Q3 earnings on October 21, 2015. Abbott Laboratories reported EPS of $0.54, beating the consensus estimate of $0.53 by 1.12%. The EPS showed a year-over-year (YoY) decline of 12.9%, compared to the EPS of $0.62 in the same quarter last year. The company posted revenue of $5.2 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $5.13 billion. This was an increase of 10.9% on an operational basis over the previous year time frame.Abbott operates four business segments:1. Nutrition segment offers a diverse product portfolio that is balanced between adult and pediatric nutrition. Abbott concentrates on launching new products into developed and fast-growing emerging markets, where healthcare trends, such as aging populations and high birth rates, are increasing the need for quality medical nutrition. Brands such as Pediasure, Ensure, and Similac are well known brands that are owned by Abbott. Sales in Q3 increased 6.5%, led by growth in the international pediatric business.2. Diagnostic segment offers a broad range of innovative diagnostic instrument systems and solutions for hospitals, reference labs, molecular labs, blood banks, physician offices, and clinics. Diagnostics achieved sales growth of 8% in the quarter, driven by continued above-market performance in Core Laboratory and Point of Care Diagnostics.3. Established Pharmaceuticals focuses on six core therapeutic areas in which Abbott has strong brands and the ability to address significant customer needs. These areas are:Abbott has sold their Developed Markets pharmaceuticals business to Mylan (MYL). Abbott now focuses on emerging markets. The acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals makes Abbott a top-ten company in Latin America. Sales in Q3 increased double-digits, excluding the impact from recent acquisitions and foreign exchange.4. Medical Devices segment develops solutions to treat the world's aging population. Abbott's devices seek to improve outcomes and lower cost for people with diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cataracts.The health care industry tends to remain relatively strong during bear markets and slow growth economies. There are several growth factors that have driven this industry to perform well. The first and most important demographic factor for this industry is the increasing age of the population. The ""baby boomers"" have shifted into their 50s and 60s and will continue to drive growth for medical care for the next couple of decades.Not only is the average life span increasing, but people are also remaining much more active later in life than in the past. This has expanded demand for many products supplied by this industry ranging from medical devices for serious conditions that affect the older population such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes to devices and surgeries that help improve the quality of life. Another factor is the demand by patients and doctors for improved technology and better health care equipment. This has caused health care equipment suppliers to increase their research and development expenditures to meet the demand for more efficient and effective products.The future of the industry looks positive due to the continually aging population. The health care industry is actively working toward helping health care facilities improve their ability to treat patients more accurately and efficiently. Abbott is strategically positioned to benefit from the demographic shifts in population and the growth in demand from emerging market populations for quality medical care.In the third quarter, adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.5% of sales, up 200 basis points over 2014. The main driver for the margin expansion was in Diagnostics and Nutrition. The company expects to expand full-year adjusted operating margin by more than 100 basis points for 2015. The overall organic growth rate, if you exclude exchange impact and acquisitions, is about 7.5%The operational performance of Abbott has outpaced the appreciation of the stock. Despite a challenging currency environment, Abbott remained on track to achieve their financial objectives in 2015. The company has guided for a strong outlook and forecasted for EPS growth at the beginning of the year and have been able to execute on their objectives despite several headwinds. The unfavorable impact of foreign exchange was 9.5%. The negative impact from exchange was higher than previous expectations due to strengthening of the US dollar relative to several currencies this year. The company implements hedging strategies to smooth the effects of exchange rate risk. I expect the foreign exchange environment to improve as we move into 2016.ABT stock is poised for a significant move up. The company has a very proud history of growing dividends and is a member of the elite list of companies that make up the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. This history of returning capital to shareholders will continue for the foreseeable future. The dividend payout ratio is currently 58% and has historically remained around 50%. The price of the stock will continue to benefit from increasing margins, growing dividends, and growth in earnings fueled by emerging markets. I expect to see a fresh 52 week high in the near future."
3602986,25228,2015-10-27T09:59:53-04:00,"This article continues the “learning from the dividend aristocrats series” focusing on Abbot Labs and its spin-off company AbbVie.
        In reviewing this type of investment, it’s paramount to work through the components, as a stock chart is not apt to be especially telling.
        Overall the combined companies provided quite solid returns during the period.","This article continues the ""learning from the dividend aristocrats"" series, which details the history of companies with long dividend increase streaks. The idea is to see which components were most instrumental in driving investor returns. For instance Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) had quite similar business results as both Becton, Dickinson (NYSE:BDX) and CR Bard (NYSE:BCR), yet trailed each greatly in the shareholder return category. This was largely attributable to varying changes in underlying valuation.If you're looking for companies that not only pay but also increase their dividends on a regular basis, David Fish's list of Champions, Contenders and Challengers is the place to go. It lists hundreds of companies that have made greater annual payouts for at least 5, 10 and 25 years.Yet with hundreds of names to sort, it can be difficult to wade through the entire inventory. As such, there is a bit of short cut to whittle down the list. S&P Dow Jones Indices produces its own list of ""dividend aristocrats."" While not as comprehensive it does give you a place to begin.So far I have covered the consumer discretionary, consumer staple, energy and financial sectors. This article continues the look at healthcare companies, focusing specifically on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) and its 2013 spin-off AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV).AbbVie is a global biopharmaceutical company that focuses on some of the world's most complex diseases. Although the company only became a standalone enterprise in the last two years, it remains in the dividend aristocrat index due to its relationship with long time dividend paying stalwart Abbott Labs. Here's a look at the combined business of both Abbott Labs and AbbVie:This table represents the 2005 through 2014 period, but naturally AbbVie's separate contribution has only been in the last two years. Prior to this the companies were one. Additionally, note that the investment performance is computed from yearend to keep the investment results comparative across all of the firms in the series.At the end of 2005 Abbott Labs was turning out roughly $22 billion in annual revenue. By 2014 this company was still turning out $22 billion in sales, but keep in mind that this doesn't account for the spin-off company. Incidentally, if you viewed a stock chart its likely to be greatly skewed by this notion. AbbVie had sales of nearly $20 billion last year, bringing the combined entity up to $42 billion in sales, or a 7.3% average compound annual growth rate.Abbott Labs began with a net profit margin around 17.5% in 2005. By 2014 this margin had dropped below 16%. Yet it should be underscored that the higher margin AbbVie was a big contributor here. Back in 2012, when the two were one, the combined company had a margin above 20%. Meanwhile, AbbVie has had a net profit margin in the high 20% range. As such, the overall investment would have seen its profit margin grow from 17.5% to 21%, despite the fall at the ""parent"" company. In turn, this allowed earnings to grow faster than overall revenues.For every share of Abbott Labs owned, you would have received one share of AbbVie common stock. So the growth in earnings-per-share is merely a matter of adding the two together. Had you owned one share of Abbott Labs in 2005 your underlying earnings claim would have been about $2.50. Last year the remaining Abbott Labs pumped out $2.28 in earnings, while AbbVie made $3.32. Combined the two companies had earnings of about $5.60 or a growth rate of just over 9%.At the end of 2005 Abbott Labs was trading around 16 times earnings. At the end of 2014 both Abbott and AbbVie were trading around 20 times earnings. This allowed the share price growth to outpace earnings-per-share growth. Notably, shares of AbbVie have returned over 40% per annum in the last two years.Investors would have collected a bit over $12 in Abbott dividends and over $3 in AbbVie payouts. All told investors would have seen returns on the magnitude of about 13.8% per year. As a point of reference, with a $10,000 starting investment, this would mean accumulating roughly $32,000 in less than a decade's time.This is a useful look into the history of Abbott Labs. If you simply looked at a stock chart you would see a large drop in the share price without much context. By working through both companies you can get a better feel for how your original investment might have worked out.In this particular case, you had the main return driving components working in your favor. You start with 7% revenue growth that increased to over 9% earnings growth due to an increase in the net profit margin. This margin improvement was largely attributable to the AbbVie side. Then you had EPS growth in line with overall earnings growth, which was helped by the valuation investors were willing to pay. Due to the uptick in valuation, the share price of the combined companies increased by over 12% annually.Finally, a good portion of dividends was returned, bringing your total returns up to almost 14% per annum. Had you simply looked at a stock chart, you would have seen a $39 share price move to $45. Yet if you look at the whole picture, you would see a total value upwards of $125.Moving forward it could indeed be more difficult to formulate these numbers. You have to start from a higher profit margin and valuation than previously, eliminating some key growth advantages. Yet even reasonable growth could still provide for reasonable returns in the future.This type of review provides an interesting case study that will be repeated with the remaining dividend aristocrat companies. Completing these sorts of exercises can give you a better feel for which components have driven returns in the past along with how you might think about these areas moving forward."
3571906,21877,2015-10-14T13:12:35-04:00,,"The leader of a market has the furthest to fall. Abbott (NYSE:ABT), on top of the drug-eluting stent sector for some years now thanks to its blockbuster Xience device, knows that sales of its workhorse will decline in the coming years and has pioneered bioresorbable technology in a bid to fill the gap.Yesterday’s positive– with caveats– pivotal trial read-out for Absorb puts the drug-coated dissolving scaffold on track for US approval next year and ought to ensure that Abbott remains the top drug-eluting stent (DES) seller in 2020 (see table below). Much depends on doctors’ willingness to use this unfamiliar technology and on pricing and reimbursement, but with none of the big players likely to be able to match this achievement for some years to come, Abbott’s bet on innovation looks to have paid off.ThrombosisThe 2,000-patient Absorb III study met its primary endpoint, with the new scaffold showing non-inferiority to Xience on the measure of target lesion failure (NASDAQ:TLF) at one year, according to data presented at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapies conference in San Francisco.TLF was defined as a composite of cardiac death and heart attack attributable to the target vessel and repeat procedures within the treated lesion caused by ischaemia; the margin for non-inferiority was 4.5 percentage points for risk difference.Though Absorb met the criteria for non-inferiority on the TLF measure with a p value of less than 0.007– the event occurred in 7.8% of Absorb patients compared with 6.1% of patients given Xience– on this endpoint and several others it was numerically weaker.There were no statistically significant differences between Absorb and the control on any of the secondary endpoints– but one red flag did emerge in the one-year rates of in-stent thrombosis.At 1.5% for Absorb and 0.7% for Xience in the intent-to-treat group, this difference was not statistically significant, at p=0.13, but the rate of subacute device thrombosis– that occurring between 24 hours and 30 days after the procedure– was significantly higher in the Absorb group. In the as-treated cohort, though, thrombosis rates did not differ significantly between the devices during any interval.This is a concern because much of the rationale for bioresorbable stents is that their elimination from the body does away with device thrombosis, among other adverse events, at a much later stage. If using Absorb in preference to Xience means that patients are merely swapping very late thrombosis for clots during the subacute period, the appeal of the device wanes.Sole occupierThere are other pros and cons of the Absorb III trial: on one hand, for instance, the patients in the study were probably easier to treat than those likely to be encountered in real-life practice; on the other, Xience is the right comparator, being not only the bestseller but generally acknowledged as the gold standard among DESs.Be that as it may, the primary endpoint was met and the data are almost certainly good enough for approval. One of only two dissolving scaffolds on sale in Europe, Absorb will have the US market for itself for some years yet.The other CE marked product is Elixir Medical’s DESolve, which reached Europe around two years after Absorb (CE mark for dissolving stent pits Elixir against Abbott, June 10, 2013). DESolve is not in any US clinical trials according to clinicaltrials.gov; whether a relatively small private company could afford to run a US approval trial is open to question.Biotronik is also developing an absorbable stent, which unlike Absorb and DESolve, is made of metal. Data from the first human trial of the Dreams 2G device were also presented at TCT, and while these were positive this magnesium alloy scaffold is unlikely to reach market within the year.Absorb’s chances of taking off in the US are heavily dependent on whether interventional cardiologists see the potential advantages of Absorb as worth switching to a new device, and one that is harder to implant than metallic DESs.If it does sell well it is not inconceivable that the other two players here, Medtronic and Boston Scientific, will want a piece of the action. Boston is in early trials with a bioresorbable scaffold and has also formed agreements with other smaller groups with similar technologies.Medtronic, however, is not known to have made any concrete efforts in this space. With its DES sales forecast to drop 2% to the wrong side of the billion-dollar mark in 2020, and having shown itself to have an almost insatiable appetite for tuck-in acquisitions, a match-up between Medtronic and Elixir Medical or Biotronik would turn an interesting technological development into the next interventional cardiology battleground.To contact the writer of this story email Elizabeth Cairns in London at elizabethc@epvantage.com or follow @LizEPVantage on Twitter"

The company's success is not a historical relic. Abbott has positioned itself well to take advantage of growth in the emerging market health care sector.Many corporations talk about being global. Abbott Laboratories really is global. The company generates 69% of its sales internationally - and around 50% of sales come from emerging markets.Over the long run, this will serve the company well - especially its large exposure to emerging markets. The company takes a unique country-centered approach to growth:Source: Abbott 2015 Annual Shareholder Meeting, page 1In part 30 of Sure Dividend's 52-part Dividend Aristocrats series, we will take a closer look at the growth prospects, valuation, and total return potential of Abbott Laboratories.Business OverviewThe company operates in 4 segments. Each segment is shown below along with the percentage of total revenue generated for Abbott Laboratories during the first 9 months of fiscal 2015:The Nutrition segment manufactures and markets Ensure, Pedialyte, Similac, Zone Perfect, Elecare, and other health oriented nutrition products for every stage of human life from being an infant to old age.The Medical Devices segment manufactures and sells optical, vascular, and diabetes care devices and equipment to health care providers.The Diagnostics segment manufactures and sells various instruments, tests, and diagnostic equipment to blood banks, laboratories, and other health care facilities throughout the world.The Established Pharmaceutical segment sells generic pharmaceuticals outside the United States. The segment operates primarily in emerging markets.Abbott Laboratories Dividend HistoryAbbott Laboratories has paid a dividend every year since 1924. The company has increased its dividend payments for 43 consecutive years (excluding the effects of spin-offs). The company's stock currently has a dividend yield of 2.1%.Abbott Laboratories has a payout ratio of 43% (using adjusted earnings). The company's reasonable payout ratio gives management plenty of room to increase dividend payments, even if earnings were to be flat for a year.Going forward, I expect Abbott Laboratories to grow its dividend payments by around 10% a year, in line with expected earnings-per-share growth. Growth prospects are discussed in detail later on in this article.If the company can grow earnings-per-share at 10% a year, it will have the following yields on cost in the future:Based on a 2.1% dividend yield and a 10% growth rate, Abbott Laboratories has a dividend payback period of 19 years.It is very likely that Abbott Laboratories will continue paying increasing dividends in the future based on its conservative payout ratio and commitment to dividend increases.Abbott Laboratories' Competitive AdvantageAbbott Laboratories is a diversified health care business with multiple competitive advantages that support its different segments.The company's strong brand portfolio in its Nutrition segment has given it the leading worldwide market share in adult nutrition and the top market share in US pediatric nutrition.Abbott Laboratories long history and global reach give it a unique competitive advantage that new entrants to the market cannot replicate. Abbott Laboratories has been building contacts, distribution, and expertise in health care for over 125 years. The company's operational know-how is supplemented by its intellectual property portfolio, strong brands, and global reach and scale.The company has had success in emerging markets because it emphasizes manufacturing in the country where goods are sold. This reduces currency fluctuation risks and builds connections with the communities, companies, and governments the company serves.Recession PerformanceAbbott Laboratories managed to grow revenue, earnings, and dividends each year through the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009.The company's excellent performance through such a difficult period makes the company the 3rd most recession proof Dividend Aristocrat.Consumers and governments typically do not cut back on health care expenditures regardless of the economic climate. That's how Abbott Laboratories is able to perform so well during bear markets. Abbott Laboratories stock fell just 4.95% in 2008 while the S&P 500 declined 38%.The company's earnings-per-share from 2007 through 2009 are shown below to give an idea of how well the company performs during recessions:Future Growth PotentialAbbott Laboratories has invested heavily in emerging markets. These investments are paying off by providing strong double-digit growth for the company. Emerging market sales grew 21.2% on a constant-currency basis in Abbott Laboratories' most recent quarter.The company currently generates around 50% of sales in emerging markets. The company's future growth is dependent on rising GDP in emerging markets. As consumers in these markets see increases in their income, the will continue to demand better health care products. Abbott Laboratories is situated to provide these health care products to consumers in emerging markets.Abbott Laboratories' emerging market penetration gives it excellent long-term growth prospects. The combination of emerging market economic growth and aging populations provide a favorable macroeconomic environment for Abbott Laboratories.The combination of lower global birth rates and longer life expectancies is creating an aging global population. This is not good for generational wealth transfer systems like social security, but it is very good for health care companies. It's no secret that the elderly spend more on health care than younger people. The more elderly there are, the better business environment for Abbott Laboratories.The image below from the United Nation's World Aging Report shows the massive growth in the 60+ global population through time.Abbott Laboratories should continue to grow quickly over the next several years. If a global recession were to occur, management has plenty of 'dry powder' in the form of over $6 billion in cash and short-term investments sitting on its balance sheet. The company could use this cash to pursue further acquisitions in international markets if a recession were to occur.Value Line projects earnings-per-share growth of around 10% a year over the next several years for Abbott Laboratories.The company generated constant-currency revenue growth of 10.9% in its most recent quarter versus the same quarter a year ago. Earnings-per-share grew by 13.4% in fiscal 2014 for the company.I believe 10% is a conservative estimate of the company's earnings-per-share growth going forward.Expected Total ReturnsAbbott Laboratories has an expected earnings-per-share growth rate of 10% a year over the next several years.In addition, the company currently has a 2.1% dividend yield.Investors in Abbott Laboratories should expect total returns of around 12% a year going forward from dividends and earnings-per-share growth.An investment that grows at 12% a year doubles in value every about every 6 years. Not bad for a well-established health care business with fairly low risks thanks to its strong competitive advantage.Is Abbott Laboratories Over-Valued?Abbott Laboratories is currently trading for an adjusted price-to-earnings ratio of 20.3.This number uses adjusted earnings, not GAAP earnings. The company's adjusted earnings do not include amortization expense and other items. The adjusted earnings give a more accurate picture of Abbott Laboratories' true earnings power.With a price-to-earnings ratio of 20.3, Abbott Laboratories is not a value play. The company does possess a strong and durable competitive advantage and double-digit expected total returns.Abbott Laboratories' price-to-earnings ratio is around 10% below the S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio of 22.0, despite Abbott having a greater expected growth rate and a comparable dividend yield.I believe Abbott Laboratories to be trading around fair value at current prices. The company's historical price-to-earnings ratio is a poor guide to use as Abbott's spin-off of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) at the end of fiscal 2012 significantly altered the company.Final ThoughtsAbbott Laboratories' stock has only risen 4.8% in the last year due to a strong United States dollar. The strong dollar hurts the company's reported results as it must translate its earnings back to dollars.Despite this short-term headwind, Abbott Laboratories has favorable long-term growth prospects.Additionally, the company is likely trading around fair value.Abbott Laboratories is among the highest quality dividend growth stocks in the health care industry. The health care industry itself is among the best industries to invest; people will always need health care. Long-term thinking dividend growth investors would do well to make Abbott a core holding of their portfolio.Abbott Laboratories currently ranks in the Top 20 based on The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing. The company's solid expected growth rate, decent dividend yield, fairly low payout ratio, and low price standard deviation of just 19.8% should appeal to investors seeking above average total return with lower than average risk .Supporting Documents"
3551706,39141,2015-10-06T14:42:48-04:00,"Abbott Laboratories down 18% since August.Sales revenue up double digits, but currency fluctuations have blunted much of that gain this year.Shares have come down, but are still highly valued by historical P/E.","Starting late last month I began taking an interest in and writing about healthcare stocks. That was not an arbitrary decision: Healthcare as a sector has come down quite a bit. Courtesy of Google FinanceThe Healthcare ETF (NYSEARCA:IYH), for example, is down over 11% since August 1. As I've mentioned in previous articles, the healthcare sector has many durable businesses worthy of a place in the dividend investor's portfolio. In my last article I covered AbbVie Inc.(NYSE:ABBV), a fast-growing branded pharmaceutical pure play. This week I'd like to cover AbbVie's former partner, Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT).Abbott Labs is a healthcare conglomerate with businesses in diagnostics, nutrition, medical devices and pharmaceuticals. Abbott has a lot going for it: Currently, its branded pharmaceutical business is driving growth through a strong, emerging pipeline. Abbott's nutrition business is an excellent brand that is trusted in some of the biggest emerging markets, including China and India. Abbott is a solid dividend payer that has been steadily raising its dividend each year since back in the 90s.A solid growth machineAbbott Labs is a growth company. For example, last quarter, constant-currency worldwide sales grew 10.8% year-on-year, with 20.6% sales growth from emerging markets. That excellent growth rate has been blunted by a higher US dollar, which effected sales revenue by 7 percentage points. So right now Abbott is doing pretty well.Currency impact included, Abbott is growing sales by low-to-mid single digits, and that growth rate is something management expects for the full year, with expected earnings per share growth in the mid-to-high single digits. I suspect that Abbott will be able to grow earnings at that rate for quite some time, as healthcare spending is expected to rise above both inflation and GDP growth in just about every major country. I also suspect that if the dollar drops to more normal levels, Abbott's revenue and earnings will accelerate accordingly.Courtesy of Ventas Inc Investor Relations. National healthcare expenditure is slated to grow steadily over the next few years. Abbott Labs will be a benefactor in this spending growth.Looking at the business by segment, Abbott grew diagnostics revenue by 1.3% in constant currency terms, although there was a bright spot with international sales growth in the double-digits. Nutrition and branded pharmaceuticals are the ones expanding most in the emerging markets. Last quarter nutrition grew revenue by 3.8% and pharmaceuticals has grown revenue by a whopping 46% on several drugs entering China, Colombia and India.Dividends & ValuationCurrently Abbott Labs pays only 58% of its cash flow to dividends. So, even if Abbott grows earnings by mid single-digits, the company will be able to grow dividends in excess of that for quite some time. Currently Abbott yields 2.3%. Over the last 10 years, Abbott Labs has managed dividend growth of 10% per annum. We have every reason to believe that this trend will continue for awhile.Courtesy of Google FinanceThis year Abbott expects $2.15 per share in earnings. That comes out to 19.2 times 2015 earnings. Over the last 10 years, Abbott has averaged 16.7 time earnings, so it is still well above its average valuation. At the same time, Abbott is down 18% since August, which is quite a drop already.Could Abbott drop some more? Yes, it could. Is Abbott cheap? Not really. Even when looking at Abbott as a growth company, the price-to-earnings over growth ratio is around 2 times, which is just about the upper limit for any value investor looking at a growth company.ConclusionAbbott Labs is down a lot, but it is not yet a great deal. I've covered other medical sector companies in a better valuation. That includes AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). I continue to recommend these two companies instead, but Abbott Laboratories should be kept on your watchlist."
3383115,21877,2015-07-31T13:37:49-04:00,,"Abbott (NYSE:ABT) has become the latest company to make a big bet on the transcatheter mitral valve replacement market, buying one company and gaining the option to acquire another. Abbott is spending up to $250m on Tendyne and has also invested in Cephea Valve Technologies.The deals come just a couple of weeks after rival Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE:EW) agreed to purchase another transcatheter mitral valve implantation (TMVI) specialist, CardiAQ Valve Technologies – and raise the question of whether remaining player Neovasc might be next (Edwards’ $350m CardiAQ buy ups mitral valve stakes, July 13, 2015).Abbott is already in the mitral valve space with its FDA-approved MitraClip device, but this is used for repair, rather than complete replacement, and can only treat certain types of mitral valve disease. Nonetheless, MitraClip has been a growth driver, with the product seeing a double-digit sales increase amid a fairly lacklustre performance by its devices division in the company’s recent second quarter.Abbott is obviously looking for more of the same with Tendyne, but will have to wait a while until the firm’s bioprosthetic mitral valve system is on the market. In April it implanted the first patient in a US feasibility study, and next year it plans to start enrolment in a trial to support European CE marking.Meanwhile, Abbott has put an undisclosed amount of cash into Cephea. Details on the private company are scant and it is unclear how its device differs from other TMVI products in development.Neovasc deal?With two of the leading TMVI companies acquired, the spotlight now falls on Neovasc, whose Tiara valve is one of the most advanced TMVI devices in development. Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) seems like the obvious buyer– it is developing a mitral valve itself but it is still in animal studies, so the medtech giant might resort to M&A to keep up with its rivals. Cardiology specialists Boston Scientific and St Jude Medical could also be interested.Significant mitral regurgitation affects around 2% of the population, equating to about six million people in the US– making the TMVI sector bigger than the TAVI market, which has been a nice little earner for companies in the space, particularly Edwards and Medtronic.So it seems a fairly sure bet that Medtronic will want to make a play in TMVI, and Abbott’s latest deals could put it under pressure to make its own acquisition sooner rather than later.To contact the writer of this story email Madeleine Armstrong in London at  madeleinea@epvantage.com   or follow  @medtech_ma   on Twitter"

The company's most recent quarter indicates strong performance, evidenced by a double digit increase in sales, compared to the prior year's period, as well as strong cash flow generation. Abbott's nutrition segment is its strongest division, accounting for ~33% of revenue. The company owns the brands Pedialyte, Ensure, and Similac making Abbott #1 in adult nutrition globally and #1 in pediatric nutrition in the US. About 70% of Abbott's revenue comes from international markets and about half of that from emerging markets.In 2013, Abbott separated its US drug business into a new company called AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). Abbott's motive was essentially to de-risk itself from changing markets and to let each segment evolve separately. After the separation, it appears that Abbott is a more stable company. The company is now focusing more on balancing its segments and less on developing new drugs to fuel growth.One of the most attractive things about Abbott is its reliable dividend. The company has raised its dividend for 43 consecutive years, earning itself on the elite list of Dividend Aristocrats. Abbott has a strong cash flow generation and we see no material risk of the firm lowering its dividend in the future. We rate Abbott's dividend safety as EXCELLENT, based on its Dividend Cushion ratio of 2.8. Let's take a look at Abbott's other investment considerations and derive a fair value estimate for shares.Abbott's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• The new Abbott isn't much different from the old Abbott, minus the blockbuster drug Humira and other members of its drug lineup like AndroGel and TriCor. It remains aligned with favorable long-term healthcare trends in both developed and developing markets. The company is more than 125 years' old. Roughly 70% of its sales are now outside the US.• Abbott's business quality ranks among the best of the firms in our coverage universe. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders with relatively stable operating results for the past few years, a combination we view very positively. Very few firms have stood the test of time like Abbott.• The new Abbott's nutritionals segment is one of the more attractive businesses in the healthcare space. It is home to some well-known brand names such as EAS, Myoplex and ZonePerfect. The division is #1 in adult nutrition and #1 in pediatric nutrition. It's hard not to like its branded generics (#1 in India) and its medical devices (#1 in drug-eluting stents) segments either.• Abbott's diagnostics segment has some solid products in the pipeline that could kick-start growth, and it remains #1 in immunoassay diagnostics and #1 in blood screening. More than 40% of the world's population will be 50 or older by 2050, offering tremendous opportunities across Abbott's portfolio.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisFrom our point of view, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Abbott's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 19.3%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.4%.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate. Abbott's economic profit creation is set to continue its trajectory of improvement in coming years.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Abbott's free cash flow margin has averaged about 12.4% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Abbott, cash flow from operations decreased about 66% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 40% over the same time period.In the first six months of 2015 Abbott Laboratories reported $940 million in cash from operating activities and ~$450 in capital expenditures, resulting in ~$490 million in free cash flow.Valuation AnalysisThis is the most important portion of our analysis. Below we outline our valuation assumptions and derive a fair value estimate for shares.Our discounted cash flow model indicates that Abbott's shares are worth between $36-$54 each. Shares are currently trading at ~$44, just below our fair value estimate. This indicates that we feel there is a similar amount of upside potential and downside potential associated with shares at this time.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $45 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 39.9 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 17.8 times last year's EBITDA.Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 4.6% during the next five years. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 24.4%, which is above Abbott's trailing 3-year average.Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.4% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Abbott, we use a 9.4% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisAlthough we estimate the firm's fair value at about $45 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Abbott. We think the firm is attractive below $36 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $54 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Abbott's fair value at this point in time to be about $45 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Abbott's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $57 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $45 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Wrapping Things UpThere is a lot to like about Abbott.More than 40% of the world's population will be 50 or older by 2050, offering tremendous opportunities across Abbott's portfolio. We think the firm's nutritionals segment is one of the most attractive businesses in the healthcare space thanks to well-known brand names. A similar dynamic can be found in its branded generics and medical devices segments. Though its yield could be better, we think the company has a healthy dividend with room for future growth.Abbott currently registers a 6 on the Valuentum Buying Index."
3323595,36431,2015-07-14T08:31:01-04:00,"Abbott spun-off the now independent Abbvie in 2013.
        This has left a very different company than before.
        Taking a look at the effects on earnings and return on equity.
        My plans going forward.","Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a very different company after shedding its U.S. drug business and associated pipeline, and in the process creating a company now known to the world as AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). The move seemed to shed the problematic issues associated with expiring patents, and essentially de-risked the overall business for steadier returns. The company also became more reliant on international markets, however, which have obviously felt the sting of a rising dollar.The business, post AbbVieAbbott's business mix is arguably more stable without its pharma business, and now it doesn't need to fret over developing more drugs to fuel growth. It's also focusing on keeping a balance:Source: 2014 annual reportThe company is also focusing on growing its business outside of its domestic market. It now gets about 70% of sales from outside the U.S., with about half of sales coming from emerging markets. When currencies eventually normalize, earnings will likely look better, and I think that Abbot is a good way to get broad geographical diversification without directly investing outside of the States.Shares of Abbott look especially lucrative as a low-risk way to get emerging markets exposure, especially as these economies begin to expand along with their rising income. As these countries experience rising middle classes and prosperity, they'll have more resources to devote to health-related spending.Abbott sees emerging markets growing GDP by about 4.6% (versus only 2% in developed economies) from 2014 through 2019. The U.S., as an example, spends about 18% of GDP on healthcare. The up-and-coming markets that Abbott is strategically positioning itself in for ""tremendous long-term potential"" only spend about 6%.Another solid tailwind for the company is related to aging global populations. Abbott estimates that by 2015, 40% of the people in its key markets will be over 50 years old. The future looks very bright for Abbott, at least judging by its demographic tailwinds and strategic positioning for sustainable long-term growth, but I'd also like to look at its current situation, and how it looks after shedding its faster-growing businesses in the short-term.Earnings quality and return on equity, post-AbbVieI decided to first take a look at how the current business looks by analyzing annual earnings from its post-split years:We can immediately see that the firm has significantly improved its earnings quality year-over-year, with free cash flow and operating income surging past net income, which is encouraging.Next, looking at return on equity for the same period, I decided to break it down into five parts with the below Dupont analysis.Higher operating margins and asset utilization drove ROE higher, which is also a good sign for the new business model, despite a tick up in financial leverage (assets/equity).Despite notable improvements in ROE and earnings quality, next I'd like to see where both of these stack up compared to the ""old"" Abbott Labs.Pre-Abbvie earnings and return on equityUsing the same format as in the above section, I've charted net income, operating income, and free cash flow to see how earnings quality looked before the spin-off.Note that despite a tick up in EBIT and net income in 2012, free cash flow was sputtering, stuck in place. It should also be noted, however, that despite this decline in FCF, it still exceeded net income, and as a ratio was still better when compared to the firm in its current form.Moving on to return on equity, we can look at what was actually driving the numbers.We can see that pre-split, the company was generating nearly twice the return on equity as the current company is. Yes, the equity multiplier was higher, but so was asset turnover, as well as operating margins.Wrapping things up, it looks like spinning off the pharma business led to lower return on equity, weaker immediate earnings quality, and lower operating margins. The flip side to this is a more stable and balanced business mix, the promise for longer-term growth in faster-growing markets, and the absence of pesky patent cliffs.Is the trade-off worth it? It's too early to tell, but as a current shareholder, I like the big time jump in earnings quality year-over-year, and will watch closely to see how things look at the end of this year. I will largely be looking for improving quality ratios, and hopefully margins. I'd also like to see a better number related to ROE as well.I'd also like to point out that the market apparently values Abbott's stable, longer-term prospects more than it does AbbVie's quicker, higher margined, short-term growth. Shares of Abbot trade at a pricey multiple of over 23 times 2015 earnings, versus AbbVie's multiple of just 16 times 2015's earnings. Abbot trades at over 20 times forward earnings as well, with AbbVie trading at only about 14 times forward earnings.ConclusionAbbott's expensive price tag in relation to earnings means that it needs to follow through with its promised growth-filled future. Analysts expect growth to pick up in 2016 to about 5% to 6%. I'd like to see it expand margins and bump up its ROE as well. Free cash flow could also improve, but all-in-all, I can see the reason why the riskier parts of the business were spun-off. It's simply too early to judge how successful the new company will be in growing into its lofty multiples, however. Shares currently trade at 25 times FY2014 free cash flow.I view Abbott as a low-risk way of investing in the middle class of emerging economies, and if these economies truly do offer the tremendous growth that is being promised, I think Abbott has quite a growth spurt ahead of it over the next few decades. Especially if it can bump up the margins, but if it can't, it might be able to make up for it in sheer volume. I plan on holding my shares, but wouldn't be adding at these levels. At least until more definitive clarity regarding the company's future growth situation surfaces."
3358965,63883,2015-07-27T07:50:04-04:00,Abbott Laboratories is still growing rapidly.The company is well positioned for international growth.See why I'm long Abbott Laboratories.,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) recently released its 2nd quarter 2015 results.The company saw adjusted earnings-per-share grow 6.1% to $0.52 per share from $0.49 per share in the same quarter a year ago.Abbott Laboratories left its adjusted earnings-per-share guidance for full fiscal 2015 unchanged at $2.10 to $2.20 per share. The company had adjusted earnings-per-share from continuing operations of $1.98 in fiscal 2014. Abbott Laboratories' outlook is for earnings-per-share growth of between 6% and 11% for fiscal 2015.6% to 11% earnings-per-share growth actually significantly understates Abbott's real underlying business growth. On a constant-currency basis, the company is expecting earnings growth of 13% to 18% in fiscal 2015.The company's management expects headwinds from currency effects of around 7% in fiscal 2015. Abbott Laboratories is experiencing strong growth despite negative currency effects.The company's growth would be much higher if the dollar had not appreciated so much in the last year. When this trend reverses, Abbott Laboratories stands to benefit.Business OverviewAbbott Laboratories is a diversified health care company that manufactures and sells nutrition products, medical devices and diagnostic equipment, and pharmaceuticals.Abbott Laboratories owns the Similac, Pedialyte, and Ensure brands - making the company #1in adult nutrition globally and #1 in pediatric nutrition in the U.S.The company operates in 4 segments. Each segment is shown below along with the percentage of total revenue generated for Abbott Laboratories in its most recent quarter:Abbott Laboratories is truly a global business. The company generated just 31% of sales in the United States in its most recent quarter. The remaining 69% of sales were from international markets.Safety AnalysisAbbott Laboratories has invested heavily in emerging markets. These investments are paying off… Emerging market sales grew 20.6% on a constant-currency basis in Abbott Laboratories' most recent quarter.The company has had success in emerging markets because it emphasizes manufacturing in the country where goods are sold. This reduces currency fluctuation risks and builds connections with the communities, companies, and governments the company serves.Abbott Laboratories large international business gives it an advantage over large health care businesses that focus more on the United States. Abbott Laboratories has more exposure to faster growing markets.One would think that too much exposure to international markets would hurt Abbott Laboratories during recessions, but that is not the case.Abbott Laboratories managed to grow revenue, earnings, and dividends each year through the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009. Consumers and governments typically do not cut back on health care expenditures regardless of the economic climate. Abbott Laboratories stock fell just 4.95% in 2008 while the S&P 500 declined 38%.Abbott Laboratories carries around $7 billion in debt and has $3 billion in cash on hand. The company generated about $3.5 billion in net profit in 2014. Abbott Laboratories is conservatively financed.Future Growth & DividendsAbbott Laboratories has paid increasing dividends for 43 consecutive years, excluding the effects of spin-offs. The company's long dividend streak makes Abbott Laboratories a Dividend Aristocrat. Despite over 4 consecutive decades of dividend growth, Abbott Laboratories still has a long growth runway ahead.Abbott Laboratories' emerging market penetration gives it excellent long-term growth prospects. The combination of emerging market economic growth and aging populations provide a favorable macroeconomic environment for Abbott Laboratories.The company further increased its exposure to emerging markets with its recent acquisitions of CFR Pharmaceuticals and Veropharm in the recent past. The company is targeting constant-currency adjusted earnings-per-share growth of around 15% in fiscal 2015.Abbott Laboratories should continue to grow quickly over the next several years. If a global recession were to occur, management has plenty of 'dry powder' to pursue further acquisitions in international markets.Dividends should also continue to grow rapidly for Abbott Laboratories. The company has a payout ratio of just 41%. Abbott Laboratories still has room to grow its dividend payments faster than overall company growth if management chooses to do so. Abbott Laboratories currently has a 1.9% dividend yield.ValuationAbbott Laboratories is currently trading for an adjusted price-to-earnings ratio of 22. This number uses adjusted earnings, not GAAP earnings. The company's adjusted earnings do not include amortization expense and other items. The adjusted earnings give a more accurate picture of Abbott Laboratories' true earnings power.Abbott Laboratories appears to be trading at the high end of fair value. The company's price-to-earnings ratio is fairly high, but reflects the extreme quality of Abbott Laboratories.The company is still growing quickly, has low debt, a shareholder friendly management, and is recession resistant. Investors should expect to pay a slight premium over the S&P 500's price-to-earnings multiple for a premium quality business like Abbott Laboratories.Final ThoughtsThe management teams at many publicly traded corporations talk and talk about taking advantage of emerging market growth. Abbott Laboratories' management has done much more than talk. They have positioned the company for international growth.Over the past year, this strategy has looked somewhat foolish thanks to the rapidly appreciation United States dollar. In the long run, emerging market growth will outpace growth in the United States. Emerging markets simply have an easier path to growth and larger populations.Abbott Laboratories has a long growth runway ahead in emerging markets. The company's shares appear to be trading near the high end of fair value. The company's stock price is up over 20% in the last year despite the strong dollar. When the dollar trend reverses, Abbott Laboratories will likely see rapid earnings-per-share growth.Abbott Laboratories is among the highest quality dividend growth stocks in the health care industry. The health care industry itself is among the best industries to invest; people will always need health care. Long-term thinking dividend growth investors would do well to make Abbott a core holding of their portfolio."
3748556,80836,2015-12-10T16:58:00-05:00,"In my recent article, I described all my current holdings in my dividend growth portfolio.I am willing to allocate more capital into healthcare, and I look at different candidates.ABT, MDT and BDX are three great candidates. They can all fit into my portfolio at the moment, and I will try to choose between them.In the article, I will show the strengths and weaknesses of these three.","IntroductionIn my previous article, I presented my portfolio and goals. In the short term, I am willing to allocate more capital to the healthcare sector as I am willing to allocate 12.5% of my portfolio to it, and I currently have only 6% allocated to it as the only company I own was Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). In order to do that, I found three relevant candidates for my dividend growth portfolio. All three are great companies with growing dividends.The three companies are Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) and Becton, Dickinson and Company (NYSE:BDX). I have already written an article about MDT and BDX, so this one will concentrate more on ABT, and I advise you to read them both as well. In the article, I will concentrate on the strengths and weaknesses of the companies, and I will try to choose a nice allocation between the three.Abbott Laboratories develops, manufactures and sells healthcare products. It has four segments: Pharmaceutical Products, which sells adult and pediatric pharmaceutical products; Nutritional Products, which sells pediatric and adult nutritional products; Diagnostic Products, which sells diagnostic systems and tests for blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories and alternate-care testing sites; and Vascular Products, which sells coronary, endovascular, and vessel closure devices. The principal products in its other businesses include blood glucose monitoring meters, test strips, data management software and accessories for people with diabetes, and medical devices for the eye.FundamentalsUnlike most of my articles, I am not going to address the fundamentals for too long. All three companies have a great history of increasing the revenue, EPS and dividends. The track record goes much longer than 10 years, as they are dividend aristocrats.ABT may seem a little bit different as the dividend per share decreased significantly in 2013. However, the reason for that decline is the spin-off of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). If you take into account the dividends from ABBV, you see that the dividend is actually growing in double digits.All three companies are forecasted to show significant EPS growth in the coming years. All three companies are enjoying the fruits of the smart acquisitions they made last year. I have three candidates that are poised to grow significantly and raise dividends accordingly.ABT Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsMy opinion on the graph is that I am dealing with the three companies which are the best of their kind. ABT was still struggling a little bit after the spin- off, but the current outlook of the company and the analysts covering it talks about double-digit growth rate in EPS for the next coming years. All companies pay sustainable dividends with payout ratio lower than 50%. There is really not much to dislike here. If I had to grade the companies, I will say that ABT has the most attractive fundamentals. I also think that BDX has slightly more attractive fundamentals than MDT. I will try to check the three in terms of valuations.ValuationThese three companies made significant acquisitions that will have major effects on the EPS and sales in 2016 and 2017. Therefore, the metric I will use will be forward P/E as well as forward P/S and P/B. These metrics will help to understand which company trades for the most attractive valuation.ABT PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThis graph is what I call inconclusive. Looking at the PE ratio for the next two years, ABT is changing hands for a slight premium over its peers. When I look at the PS ratio, MDT seems like the more expensive company, and when I look at the PB ratio, BDX is traded for a large premium compared to its peers.The metric that I find most important is the PE ratio. I believe that all three companies are traded at a fair value, especially when taking into account the above-average growth rate. However, if I have to be more specific, I will say that ABT is lightly more expensive than its peers. I will also add that I find BDX a little bit more expensive than BDX.Why I believe in these three companies for the long run?I analyzed both the fundamentals and the valuation, and practically finished the quantitative analysis. I believe that so far ABT is the most attractive company, and MDT and BDX are only a little bit behind. I believe that it is important to show the advantages that each company has over its peers. However, I want to share why I believe in all three companies for the long run.All three companies are corporations that, after reading their latest reports and presentations, can and will deliver adequate returns to shareholders for the years to come. All three companies share some opportunities.They are all diversified in terms of global reach. The three companies sell their products outside the U.S. They all enjoy the growth of the investments in healthcare made in the emerging markets. In addition, the currency headwinds are only temporary for the long-term investors, and when they are over, we will enjoy even more growth from outside the U.S. The Obamacare reform will also increase the number of people who are insured in the U.S., and therefore will increase the healthcare expenses in the country.ABT emphasizes its diversificationMoreover, the companies have many segments. Each company has three main segments where they operate. Each company specializes in a different area. ABT has a large and successful nutrition segment, MDT has Spine and TAVR (transcatheter aortic valve replacement) platform, and BDX is very successful with its BD Medical segments that offer diabetes care products. While each company has its strengths, they all have amazing diversification in their products. They are far from many biotech companies that concentrate on a small number of products.So we have three companies that enjoy expanding into the emerging markets and diversified portfolio of products. Another aspect that in my opinion will push these three forward is the changes in demographics. The graph below came from the United Nations University. As you can see our planet's population is aging. By 2050, elderly population will more than double in size. It is obvious that as more people reach old age, and more people can afford medical care, there will be a growing demand to the products of ABT, MDT and BDX.Each company has its own unique benefitsNow, I want to look at the advantages that each company has. I will start with MDT. MDT relocated its headquarters to Ireland when it acquired Covidien. Ireland has a lower corporate tax, and in addition, the company released some of its cash that was abroad. Therefore, it now has over $9 billion in cash. This capital can be used to increase EPS by buybacks (almost 10% of the shares outstanding), for additional acquisitions, or for R&D.Moreover, MDT has a very developed segment of cardiovascular equipment and products. It has TAVR and very successful pacemakers. Heart diseases are the number one killer in the U.S., and investing in products that can help curing people and prevent deaths can be very lucrative. Even outside the U.S. heart condition is among the top five killers.BDX has a very high successful segment of diabetes care. It is over 10% of its revenues. Diabetes is a chronic disease that becomes more popular in the affluent world, where diet contains a lot of sugar and not enough physical activity. The disease can cause many complications and even death. BDX's large investments in this sector is a great growth prospect.BDX also has some new opportunities going into 2016. It is growing its product portfolio, and it will now include single-cell genomics, thanks to the recent Cellular Research deal, and many product launches planned in 2016. These products can work in synergies with other segments like insulin infusion set that will work with the diabetes care.ABT, according to a report by Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, is looking to expand. In the latest VIVA conference, physicians talked about the latest vascular intervention products and medicines. ABT lacks presence in this area, and it is willing to expand towards it. It can have a great impact on the top and bottom line of the company, as vascular interventions and heart diseases are very common in the western world.Another growth prospect that ABT has is its huge nutrition sector. The American people become more health conscious. It looks for genetically-engineered food, and consumes more vitamins and nutritional supplements. As this trend expands not only in the U.S., but also around the world, ABT will be able to keep growing and expanding both globally and back at home.ConclusionAll three companies have growth prospects. Some are shared by all three, and some are unique. Nevertheless, they also share several risks like currency headwinds and fierce competition in several segments. Yet, I believe in all of three to keep competing as well as they did in the past decades.Considering everything I read and wrote, if I have to choose between the three, I will go with ABT. However, I don't really have to choose between the three. I believe that the best plan for me is to initiate three positions in these three companies. ABT will be the largest, and BDX will be the smallest. This way I can get exposure to all of them, and keep adding to the position when stock prices decline."
3485046,21877,2015-09-02T12:53:44-04:00,,"Positive data from Abbott Laboratories' (NYSE:ABT) Absorb bioresorbable scaffold have at least one researcher predicting that within five years they will be more widely used than permanent metal stents for the treatment of coronary artery disease.But while Absorb is currently the leading bioresorbable scaffold, it could eventually be displaced by next-generation products, said Professor Patrick Serruys of Imperial College London. He pointed to Absorb’s fairly thick strut size, at 150 microns; thicker struts have been linked with recurrence of the vessel blockage.Professor Serruys presented the positive Absorb data at the European Society of Cardiology meeting today, and the company also celebrated a victory in its Japanese trial of the device.First moverBut these companies are some way behind Abbott, which has already filed for US and Japan approval for Absorb and obtained a CE mark. And now the group has replicated data from the Absorb II trial, which reported last year that the device was non-inferior to its best-selling Xience V drug-eluting stent at 12 months (Abbott moves to soak up more stent sales with Asborb data, September 15, 2014). Two studies with Absorb were presented at the ESC today: Absorb Japan, designed to support Japanese approval and comparing the device with Xience Prime/Xpedition in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention; and Absorb Stemi Trofi II, in which the scaffold went up against Xience in patients with the more serious form of heart attack known as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).Both showed non-inferiority versus the older, metal-framed drug-eluting stent.The primary endpoint of the 400-patient Absorb Japan study was target lesion failure at 12 months – a composite of cardiac death, heart attack caused by a re-blockage of the vessel and need for a repeat procedure – which occurred in 4.2% of Absorb-treated patients and 3.8% of the Xience group.Stemi subgroupThe 191-patient Absorb Stemi Trofi II trial, meanwhile, looked at vessel healing at six months, measured by the intravascular imaging technique optical coherence tomography. The healing score was similar between treatment groups, at 1.74 in the Absorb arm and 2.80 in the Xience group.When asked why doctors would choose to use resorbable devices rather than older- and cheaper- DESs with the outcomes being so similar, Professor Serruys said he expected the benefit with the former to be seen in two to three years, once the scaffold dissolved and the blood vessel returned to a more natural state.This assumption will obviously need to be borne out in longer-term studies.Next stop US and ChinaThe next milestones for Absorb will be one-year results from the pivotal US Absorb III and Absorb China studies, which will both be presented at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics conference in October, along with two-year Absorb II data.Absorb III is the big one – if positive it should support FDA premarket approval, expected in early 2016. The 2,000-patient study is comparing Absorb with Xience and aims to show non-inferiority on target lesion failure, the same primary endpoint as Absorb Japan.The FDA green light should give Absorb the boost it needs, as sales in Europe have been sluggish. Credit Suisse analysts estimate that Absorb could bring in $825m in 2020, up from $142m in 2014.Even if Absorb does get the nod in the US, Abbott will need to make its first-mover advantage count, with new and potentially improved devices not too far behind it.To contact the writer of this story email Madeleine Armstrong in London at  madeleinea@epvantage.com   or follow  @medtech_ma  on Twitter"
3207436,44001,2015-05-23T13:46:44-04:00,The profit margins increased 87% from the fourth quarter to the first quarter.The increase in the equity multiplier also helped increase the ROE but not to the extent as the profit margins.Retained earnings have been increasing but I'd like to see the dividend increased a bit more next time around.,"Most investors take a look at return on equity as a measure of how well a company is doing with respect to net income as a ratio to shareholders equity on the balance sheet. Companies such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), Boeing (NYSE:BA) or Altria (NYSE:MO) even have huge returns on equity. Typically a high return on equity value is pretty nice to have, but not all returns on equity are equal.Although it is a straight ratio as suggested, it is a bit more complex than that. Not many investors know this, but return on equity can actually be decomposed into three parts, made popular by DuPont (NYSE:DD) back in the 1920s. The decomposition of return on equity tells us three things:Prepare yourself for some algebra; I promise it will be pretty easy. We already know that profit margins are dictated by the equation of profit/sales. Total asset turnover is dictated by the equation of sales/assets and the equity multiplier is dictated by the equation of assets/equity. So when we multiply them all together we get the following proof:I for one am looking at return on equity in a much different manner now after learning this method. The part of the proof above that got me to investigate ROE more intently is the equity multiplier portion. Depending on how a company chooses to finance its assets (by debt or by equity), the equity multiplier can be really huge, causing the overall return on equity to be high. Personally I don't like a whole lot of debt on the balance sheet. But for capital structuring reasons debt can be used as a tax shield as taxes are calculated after interest payments.I've chosen to evaluate Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) today because since I've been writing about the company the return on equity has sporadic with the following profile.Operating EfficiencyAs mentioned earlier, operating efficiency is the profit divided by the sales. This in essence tells us how efficiently the company is operating from an operations, financial, and tax perspective. From the table below we see that the profit margin increased by 87% for the company from the prior quarter. We see that net income has increased and sales decreased over the period. Nonetheless, profit margins increased which means the increase in ROE was partially due to the increasing profit margin.Total Asset TurnoverFrom the equation I showed above, the total asset turnover ratio is defined by sales divided by assets. Total asset turnover gives us the big picture of how well the company is transforming all of its assets into sales. From the table below we see that the total asset turnover actually decreased from the prior quarter. Total sales decreased while average assets increased. This portion of the equation tells us that the ROE increase wasn't related to the company's ability to make more money on their assets when compared to what they've done in the past.Equity MultiplierThe equity multiplier is the part of the ROE equation that I don't like. It's with this portion of the equation that a company can choose to get risky or play it safe. It completely depends on how the company manages its debt, equity, and on how well the cash flows are coming in to pay those debts. From the previous portions of the equation we pretty much determined that the ROE has increased thanks to the increase in profit margin but we still have to look at the equity multiplier.An equity multiplier number of 1.87 is pretty good for my taste. But it isn't until we break it out like I did in the tables below that we can see if it is a good thing or a bad thing. As we can see assets have increased and equity has decreased, causing the equity multiplier to increase.If we dig a little further we see that the equity value decreased over the past year primarily because of decrease in common stock and accumulated other comprehensive income over the past year.ConclusionAbbott's return on equity is increasing from the prior quarter and it is primarily increasing because of the increasing profit margin number. When you multiply all the numbers together you get an ROE of 18.69%, an increase of 87% from the previous quarter. This ROE makes Abbott the 15th highest in the medical appliances & equipment industry (out of 83 companies). I'd like to see Abbott increase the equity multiplier number a bit by reducing some of its equity either through share buybacks or a dividend.Disclaimer: This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned. This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future.

3047016,80516,2015-04-03T03:41:38-04:00,"Abbott Laboratories has shown great long-term growth, and has created a number of important products.The company has consistently rewarded its shareholders in the form of an increasing dividend.Abbott has huge potential to go upwards as it moves into developing markets.","IntroductionRecently, I have written several articles about value plays in the oil sector. However, as someone who advocates a diverse portfolio - even when certain sectors are undervalued, I want to talk about other great long-term stocks. The goal of this article is to talk about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), a great long-term health play that has consistently rewarded its investors.Abbott Laboratories is an American pharmaceuticals and healthcare products company. The company has created a number of leading and revolutionary pharmaceuticals, such as Humira, Norvir, and Depakote. In 2011, the company announced and subsequently spun-off AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), a company whose share price has since grown from ~$35 a share to almost $60 a share.General(Image from HarvestingDividends.com)In its March Investor Presentation, one thing that Abbott Laboratories stressed was that it offered both top-tier growth and income. Looking at its history of dividends (the 2013 dividend had such a large drop because that was when the AbbVie spin-off occurred), we see that Abbott is a stock that we would call a ""dividend aristocrat""; that is, a stock that has managed to continuously and reliably increase its dividend. In fact, Abbott Laboratories managed to increase its dividend by almost 11% from 2008 to 2009, very impressive for a growth company.Abbott Laboratories also has a broad and balanced portfolio, with Medical Devices representing 27% of sales, Established Pharmaceuticals representing 16% of sales, Diagnostics representing 23% of sales, and Nutrition representing 34% of sales. As a diversified company, this allows Abbott Laboratories to not be as affected by a downturn in one healthcare sector, such as nutrition.(Image from Abbott Laboratories March Investor Presentation)Abbott Laboratories is a market leader. As you can see above, it dominates many different sectors, such as immunoassay diagnostics, blood screening, and LASIK. By being a market leader, Abbott Laboratories will have greater resources and abilities when trying to enter other markets. More so, it gives the company a level of trust that few others can compete with. This means Abbott Laboratories should have an easier time entering new markets.(Image from Abbott Laboratories March Investor Presentation)Like oil, much of the growth in healthcare comes from the ability to capture external markets. Healthcare is interesting in the sense that, especially in third-world countries, many people are plagued by health problems that can be fixed, but the people cannot afford the treatment. By 2030, ExxonMobil sees the middle class growing from 2 billion to 5 billion people - a growth of 3 billion.This growth represents a huge market for Abbott Laboratories, which generates 50% of its sales from emerging markets and 70% of its sales from outside of the United States. More so, by having 50% of its sales directly to consumers, the company shows that it has the necessary expertise to find the growing middle class in these countries and sell to them. This should help provide long-term growth for Abbott Laboratories.The Abbott BrandAbbott Laboratories is focused on a building a well-recognized brand, working in emerging markets and investing locally to have long-term growth.Currently, worldwide hunger stands at 926 million people. Many more people get food but do not have essential nutrients. This represents a wonderful opportunity for Abbott Laboratories. Its Nutrition segment is focused on providing nutrition around the world to both adults and pediatrics. As the #1 leader in adult nutrition globally, Abbott Laboratories has a noticeable advantage compared to other companies in this sector.(Image from Abbott Laboratories March Investor Presentation)More so, Abbott Laboratories has managed to do all of this while consistently increasing its operating margins from 13.2% in 2011 up to 21.0% in 2014. Should the company be able to continue to grow its operating margin while capturing this rapidly growing market, the shareholders will be handsomely rewarded.However, in this world, food is not all that matters. Medical Devices and Diagnostics both represent huge areas of growth. With diseases like malaria having been proven to actually lower the GDP of countries where they are endemic, developing countries will still start to pour resources into eradicating these diseases. And when they do, companies like Abbott Laboratories will be lining up with their products ready to collect money.There is a huge demand for Medical Devices and Diagnostics, even in developed countries. Demand not just for existing equipment, but for new Medical Devices and new forms of Diagnostics - especially diagnostic methods that are less intrusive. Abbott Laboratories' pipeline of drugs designed to treat HIV plus research into a variety of other areas should allow it to create and dominate new markets.That is not all in terms of opportunities for the company. Abbott Laboratories is entering the EP (electrophysiology) market, a $3 billion market growing in double digits. As a relatively new competitor, Abbott Laboratories should be able to readily acquire a decent market share. Dominating a market like this would be huge for a company with a $70 billion market cap, and a double-digit growth in profits here could represent a mid-single digit growth in its bottom line.Bullish ValuationAbove, I have given some general trends and opportunities that will serve Abbott Laboratories well in the future. The goal in this section is to comment on the bullish valuation of the company and the value of these opportunities.With a market cap of $70 billion and a P/E of 41 - Abbott Laboratories is classified as a growth stock. The stock has a forward P/E ratio of 22 and a PEG ratio of 2.18. This compares to a forward P/E of 16 and a PEG ratio of 2.97 for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), a much more established company.As established above, Abbott Laboratories' main sources of income are Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals, Diagnostics, and Nutrition.I would argue that much of the company's potential comes from unrealized opportunities in developing countries.(Image from Biotechgate.com)Looking above, we can see that the Medical Device market is the largest per capita in developed countries like the United States, Switzerland, and Germany, with all of them having a market in the hundreds of dollars per capita. This compares to China, India, and Mexico, which together have 2.5 billion people, but have a Medical Device market of $9, $3, and $18 per capita, respectively.This represents a huge opportunity for Abbot Laboratories. Overall, health standards across the world have been improving. Especially in countries like India and China. If India, China, and Mexico get their Medical Device spending per capital up to $34 per capita, that represents a $85 billion market, up from the current $15 billion. Leaders in these countries see health as essential to economic success (just look at the statistics that show that malaria has a measurable effect on a country's GDP), and I foresee the Medical Device spending per capita reaching $100 in the long term - comparable to modern developed countries.Based on ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) prediction of the middle class growing from 2 billion to 5 billion by 2040, I foresee this growth occurring in the next few decades.Looking at Established Pharmaceuticals, which represent 16% of Abbot Laboratories revenue, we see tremendous growth here as well. Countries like India and China are expected to see huge growth from the 2010 levels. More importantly, most developing countries do not have a established medical care system like the United States. Abbot Laboratories has the ability to sell directly to consumers (this represents 50% of its portfolio). By working to get involved in these developing countries, the company can establish its market share and gain huge opportunities.After this, Diagnostics represents 23% of Abbott Laboratories' revenue:(Image from Grandview Research)Abbott is one of the best competitors in this rapidly growing field, which is expected to grow almost 50% from 2012 to 2020, and will experience more growth by 2050.Lastly, Nutrition represents 34% of Abbot Laboratories' revenue.(Image from Abbot Laboratories 2013 Presentation)Here we see that Abbott expects the Nutrition market to double in many countries (except Japan) from 2010 to 2050. In many developing countries, nutrition represents a fundamental issue (there are almost a billion hungry people in the world - and that does not count people who get food but miss out on essential nutrients). Abbott Laboratories has a dominant position in both the adult and pediatric nutrition markets, which will allow it to dominate growing markets in these areas.(Image from Frost & Sullivan)Lastly, I want to talk about overall healthcare trends. Global healthcare spending is expected to double by 2050. However, even with this doubling, the United States will still have the highest per capita spending rate. I foresee a huge increase in spending from countries like India and China that have huge amounts of people and are starting to develop to the point where people expect, and are willing to pay for, quality healthcare. As the middle class expands from 2 billion to 5 billion people, many of these people will use their newfound wealth to pay for better healthcare. Abbott Laboratories, as one of the dominant healthcare providers in the world, has a huge opportunity to noticeably increase its revenue.Conservatively, I assume the Medical Device market quadruples by 2050 (spending in India, China, and Mexico reaches levels in countries like Spain). Pharmaceutical medicine spending goes up by a factor of (5), mainly from increased demand from developing countries, but also coupled with increased demand from developed countries. Diagnostics spending triples based on the spending trends from 2015 - 2020. Lastly, I assume nutrition spending doubles, based off of statistics published by Abbott Laboratories in 2013.This represents a 3.25x revenue increase for the company, which, along with its dividend, represents a roughly 7-8% return rate for the next 35 years. Assuming the dividend increase matches the dividend, a 20-year old purchasing the stock now who wants to retire at 50 will have an almost 8% yield on the purchase price when they retire.TrendsPersonally, I believe that the trends above do not give full weight to the potential Abbott Laboratories has. These trends have what I believe are two faulty assumptions - a growth rate based on today, and the idea that there will be no major discoveries.Many developing countries, including India, and to a lesser extent China, are struggling to get reliable infrastructure in place. Before these countries can build a huge healthcare industry, they first need to get a reliable source of electricity and transportation - something that China and India (which together have 1/3rd of the world's population) are struggling with. As they solve their transportation and electricity problems (and, to a lesser extent, renewable energy), these countries will begin to focus on healthcare.Secondly, these statistics assume no major revenue from new drugs. Currently, many billions are put into medical research every year, and many diseases like cancer have markets in the 10s of billions of dollars, but no one to supply them. While there are certainly no guarantees, drugs like Abbott Laboratories' hepatitis C drug (which competes with Gilead's (NASDAQ:GILD)) could by themselves provide a huge chunk of new income to Abbot Laboratories.ConclusionThe healthcare industry is one of the most difficult and profitable in the world - I took a class at Berkeley, where the professor said that the common saying among small pharmaceutical laboratories is 10 years and $1 billion to get a drug on the market. However on the flip side, Gilead Sciences' hepatitis C drug, which sells for over $100,000 a prescription in the United States, has a low-cost version in India that sells for $100s per prescription (it is not an official version, however). This just serves to give an idea of the industry's potential profit margins.Abbott Laboratories has managed to grow consistently across a wide range of different medical sectors. With a rapidly growing middle class and almost one billion people suffering from hunger (nutrition is the company's largest revenue source), Abbott Laboratories has huge potential for the future.The company's focus on long-term shareholder return, along with its status as a ""dividend aristocrat"" and its huge potential for future revenue in a rapidly expanding market make it a wonderful investment for the long-term investor."

That was back in early January and the stock survived the change-out but is on the chopping block again in a month. After the article was published the stock has increased 7.62% versus the 2.89% gain the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) posted. Abbott is a healthcare conglomerate of sorts, providing solutions in the nutritional, diagnostics, vascular, vision, diabetes, animal health, and pharmaceutical portion of the healthcare sector.On April 22, 2015, the company reported first-quarter earnings of $0.47 per share, which beat the consensus of analysts' estimates by $0.05. In the past year the company's stock is up 27.06% and is doubling the S&P 500, which has gained 13.65% in the same time frame. With all this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to evaluate the stock on a fundamental, financial and technical basis to see if it's worth buying more shares of the company right now for the healthcare and dividend sector of my dividend portfolio.FundamentalsThe company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 42.76, which is expensively priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 20.14 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. The 1-year PEG ratio (3.58), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is expensively priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 11.95%. The company has great near-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 11.95%. Below is a comparison table of the fundamental metrics for the company for when I wrote all articles pertaining to the company.FinancialsOn a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. The company pays a dividend of 1.99% with a payout ratio of 85% of trailing 12-month earnings while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 6.4%, 11.6% and 6.2%, respectively, which are all respectable values. Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I believe the 1.99% yield of this company is good enough alone for me to take shelter in for the time being. Below is a comparison table of the financial metrics for when I wrote all articles pertaining to the company.TechnicalsLooking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock near overbought territory with a current value of 65.49. I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next. I see that the black line is above the red line with the divergence bars increasing in height which tells me bullish momentum is in the name but may start getting tired soon. As for the stock price itself ($48.32), I'm looking at $50.00 to act as resistance and the $47.18 to act as support for a risk/reward ratio which plays out to be -2.36% to 3.48%.Selling Shares In MylanMylan (MYL) shares have been pretty active of late with Abbott wanting to offload 35 million shares at a price of $58.35 while Teva (NYSE:TEVA) made an offer the Dutch generic drug maker a couple of weeks later. Abbott's sale of the shares accounts for about 32% of the total stake that Abbott owns in the company. But I actually would like Abbott to be buying up the shares in Mylan instead of selling them. Abbott doesn't have great long-term growth prospects at the moment while Mylan does. Mylan can help provide the earnings growth to Abbott that the company really needs right now.Wrap UpFundamentally I believe the company to be fairly valued now on next year's earnings estimates and expensively valued on growth prospects while having great near-term earnings growth expectations. Financially the company pays a 2% dividend with a really high payout ratio but increasing returns on assets and equity. On a technical basis the risk/reward ratio shows me there is more reward than risk right now. I haven't been too enthusiastic about shares lately and only bought a batch earlier this month because it was close to the ex-dividend date and my sentiment remains the same, hence I'm not buying anymore shares right now.Disclaimer: This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

3084086,44001,2015-04-21T00:58:00-04:00,"I'm predicting revenues of $4.83 billion and an EPS number of $0.42.
        The average analyst estimate is calling for $4.85 billion in revenue and $0.42 in earnings.
        I anticipate the company to talk about the currency exchange headwinds it faced in the quarter, but it will probably not have much effect on the stock.","As the first calendar quarter came to an end, we saw the healthcare sector of the market move up a lot (7.07%) as measured by the Healthcare ETF (NYSEARCA:IYH) while the market overall was relatively flat (up 0.44%). Right now, I'd like to throw out an initial earnings analysis on Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) for the first quarter. The stock is beating the broader market for the year but both have gone pretty much nowhere with Abbott sporting a 2.73% gain and the S&P 500 making 1.18%. I selected this stock for my Portfolio of Thirty back in May of 2013 because I felt it was an underappreciated healthcare company at the time. I've been extremely happy with my purchase in the name as I'm up some 27% on my holding inclusive of reinvested dividends and dollar cost averaging. I haven't been buying it religiously of late though as I was early on. With that said, I'd like to make my prediction for Abbott for the first quarter of 2015 that the company will be announcing before the market opens on April 22nd.I have revenue coming in at $4.83 billion while the average analyst estimate for the quarter is $4.85 billion with a low of $4.76 billion. So I appear to be a bit pessimistic for the quarter on revenue than the average analyst. On a GAAP basis I'm predicting earnings to be $0.42 while the average estimate is calling for $0.42 with a low of $0.40. I believe the company is going to have a tough time this first quarter because of the strength of the dollar, seeing as the company sells quite a bit overseas. When a company translates foreign currency into the domestic currency, it looks weaker in this particular situation - that is why we'll have to look for unit growth as the metric for the overseas numbers instead.In Other NewsRight before the quarter ended the company announced that it was going to sell off some of its stake in Mylan (MYL). Mylan is a generics drug company which Abbott plans to unload 35 million shares of in a public offering. Abbott owns 110 million shares in the company which recently made a bid to Perrigo (NYSE:PRGO) for $205 per share while Mylan itself is talk of being takeover target by Teva (NYSE:TEVA). There is lots of movement in the healthcare space and if Abbott wants to partake in some of the action it needs to make a move aside from selling Mylan.ConclusionAbbott is a stodgy dividend stock at this point in time. Although I've been happy in my two year holding period I believe it is almost time to cut the cord. I've always been tinkering with the idea of removing either Abbott or Covidien from the portfolio about a year ago but the decision was made for me when Covidien was bought out by Medtronic (NYSE:MDT). Now I'm back to thinking about removing Abbott. It's going to be a difficult position to make in May but this coming earnings report may have something to do with it.We'll have to wait another couple of days or so and see what happens, but one thing is for sure, I won't be buying a batch in the name this week and probably won't until the price of the stock drops below $42.83 or just before an ex-dividend date. I like to be diversified with my Portfolio of Thirty and Abbott accounts for about 2.82% of the portfolio which makes it the middle of the pack in the portfolio.Disclaimer: This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

3005236,21835,2015-03-16T18:12:55-04:00,"Abbott Laboratories is a diversified health care products company that is now focused on nutritionals, diagnostics, generic drugs, and medical devices, following the spinoff of its R&D-based prescription pharmaceuticals business.Late January, the company reported fourth quarter sales of $5.4 billion, up 5.6% from the prior year in spite of a 4.6% unfavorable variance in foreign exchange.The company possesses strong dividend fundamentals including a low free cash flow payout of 56% and a low debt to total capital of 27%.","Linked here is a detailed quantitative analysis of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). Below are some highlights from the above linked analysis:Company Description: Abbott Laboratories is a diversified health care products company that is now focused on nutritionals, diagnostics, generic drugs, and medical devices, following the spinoff of its R&D-based prescription pharmaceuticals business at the beginning of 2013.Fair Value: In calculating fair value, I consider the NPV MMA Differential Fair Value along with these four calculations of fair value, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. Avg. High Yield Price 2. 20-Year DCF Price 3. Avg. P/E Price 4. Graham NumberABT is trading at a discount to only 1) above. When also considering the NPV MMA Differential, the stock is trading at a slight premium to its calculated fair value of $46.25. ABT did not earn any Stars in this section.Dividend Analytical Data: In this section, there are three possible Stars and three key metrics, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. Free Cash Flow Payout 2. Debt To Total Capital 3. Key Metrics 4. Dividend Growth Rate 5. Years of Div. Growth 6. Rolling 4-yr Div. > 15%ABT earned three Stars in this section for 1), 2) and 3) above. A Star was earned since the Free Cash Flow payout ratio was less than 60% and there were no negative Free Cash Flows over the last 10 years. The stock earned a Star as a result of its most recent Debt to Total Capital being less than 45%. ABT earned a Star for having an acceptable score in at least two of the four Key Metrics measured. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1926 and has increased its dividend payments for 43 consecutive years.Dividend Income vs. MMA: Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account (MMA) or Treasury bond? This section compares the earnings ability of this stock with a high-yield MMA. Two items are considered in this section; see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. NPV MMA Diff. 2. Years to > MMAABT earned a Star in this section for its NPV MMA Diff. of the $793. This amount is in excess of the $500 target I look for in a stock that has increased dividends as long as ABT has. If ABT grows its dividend at 9.1% per year, it will take 3 years to equal a MMA yielding an estimated 20-year average rate of 2.47%. ABT earned a check for the Key Metric ""Years to >MMA"" since its 3 years is less than the 5-year target.Peers: ABT is a member of the S&P 500, a Dividend Aristocrat and a member of the Broad Dividend Achievers™ Index. The company's peer group includes: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) with a 2.4% yield, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) with a 2.7% yield, and Eli Lilly and Co. (NYSE:LLY) with a 2.8% yield.Conclusion: ABT did not earn any Stars in the Fair Value section, earned three Stars in the Dividend Analytical Data section and earned one Star in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a total of four Stars. This quantitatively ranks ABT as a 4-Star Strong stock.Using my D4L-PreScreen.xls model, I determined the share price would need to increase to $55.51 before ABT's NPV MMA Differential decreased to the $500 minimum that I look for in a stock with 43 years of consecutive dividend increases. At that price the stock would yield 1.7%.Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the target $500 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 7.4%. This dividend growth rate is lower than the 9.1% used in this analysis, thus providing a margin of safety. ABT has a risk rating of 1.00 which classifies it as a Low risk stock.ABT discovers, develops, manufactures and sells health care products. Its products include branded generic pharmaceuticals manufactured internationally, marketed and sold outside the United States. The company enjoys strong positions in several health care product categories and global markets, with a focus on expansion in emerging markets.In July 2014, ABT agreed to sell its developed markets generics pharmaceutical business to Mylan. In addition, it has also decided to sell its animal health business. Late January, the company reported fourth quarter sales of $5.4 billion, up 5.6% from the prior year in spite of a 4.6% unfavorable variance in foreign exchange. ABT projects 2015 earnings per share in the range of $2.10 to $2.20. Unfavorable currency exchange rate movements will likely dampen 2015 results along with the sales decline of drug-eluting stents. Medical devices, including acquisitions, should see modest growth in 2015.The company possesses strong dividend fundamentals including a low free cash flow payout of 56% and a low debt to total capital of 27%. Although it is trading at a slight premium to my calculated fair value of $46.25, I would give it consideration for a buy except, for its low current yield.Disclaimer: Material presented here is for informational purposes only. The above quantitative stock analysis, including the Star rating, is mechanically calculated and is based on historical information. The analysis assumes the stock will perform in the future as it has in the past. This is generally never true. Before buying or selling any stock you should do your own research and reach your own conclusion.Additional Disclosure: At the time of this writing, I held no position in ABT (0.0% of my Dividend Growth Portfolio) and was long in JNJ.

3204206,24787,2015-05-21T17:44:05-04:00,Abbott Labs makes 70% of its profits overseas.This means that the valuation of the stock is understated when the U.S. dollar is performing well against global currencies collectively.The growth of the Established Pharmaceuticals division indicates that Abbott is on track to continue its record of 10% growth for shareholders.,"When Benjamin Graham wrote The Intelligent Investor, he pointed to three stocks that would be excellent lifelong holdings. He cited Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), and General Electric (NYSE:GE). A few years ago, the death of Grace Groner gained national attention when the world learned that three shares of Abbott Laboratories stock purchased for $180 grew to become a $7 million estate. Of course, these successes with Abbott Laboratories tell us what a great stock the company was during the 20th century but does not offer us evidence as to whether Abbott Labs will be a strong investment over the coming ten to fifteen years.What I like about the company is that it achieves strong growth in emerging markets and has a valuation that is more attractive than you might initially think because Abbott is significantly affected by currency fluctuations.Like many U.S. multinationals, Abbott generates a significant amount of revenue outside the United States. But what some people forget is that Abbott relies much more on international revenue than many of its peers in the pharmaceutical sector. As of last quarter, Abbott generated only 28% of its revenue in the United States and generated 72% abroad. This means that Abbott is especially susceptible to a strong dollar that can give an artificially low presentation of the company's earnings power because a significant haircut occurs when profits generated in overseas markets are translated into U.S. dollars.Specifically, Abbott expects to make $2.15 per share in profit this year. However, almost $0.20 can be attributed to negative currency fluctuations. In other words, Abbott makes about $2.35 in profits before you translate the money earned abroad into U.S. dollars. This means that the valuation of the stock is only 20x earnings rather than the 23x earnings figure that you will see reported in most auto-generated stock portals. For people focused on the actual earnings power of the companies that they purchase, the current $49 per share price for Abbott likely falls on the high end of fair value rather than the modest overvaluation that a quick peek at a stock screener might indicate.One of the things that is making Abbott Labs stronger over the long run is the increased focus on the Established Pharmaceuticals line over the Vascular line. Over the past three years, the company had been using sizable chunks of retained earnings to grow the Vascular Business, and this brought about negligible changes. The Vascular division has generated between $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion in annual sales over the past three years. It has been a solid division generating reliable returns, but it has not been an area capable of generating rapid growth for shareholders.Recently, Abbott has begun investing heavily in its Established Pharmaceuticals division. This is the division that consists of Influeza Vaccines, Respiratory Anti-Infectives, Pain/Central Nervous System Medication, Cardio-Metabolic Medicine, Women's Health, and Gastroenterology. Cumulatively, this division is growing at 14.9% per year and represents a big change for Abbott. Last year, Abbott sold off its slower growing Developed Pharmaceuticals operations to Mylan (MYL), and has taken the proceeds from the sale to reinvest into Latin American markets predominantly.Specifically, Abbott acquired CFR Pharmaceuticals to double its presence in Latin America. The company has actually been reporting 7% growth from the Latin American segments in the past year due to unfavorable currency translations that understate the company's growth. If you exclude the currency fluctuations, and focus on the raw earnings power gains from the Established Pharmaceuticals division in Brazil, Russia, India, and China, you will see that the company improved its profitability in these regions by 43.1% in the past year after growing by 14.4% in 2013 (the 2013 figure does not include the 99.9% controlling interest that Abbott took in CFR Pharmaceuticals.) Going forward, the Established Pharmaceuticals division ought to be growing revenues by at least 9% over the long run.Of course, the fast-growing Established Pharmaceuticals division only accounts for one-fifth of the company's overall profits. The other divisions (Vascular, Diagnostic, and Nutritional) are growing at a low single-digit rate. Across Abbott in its entirety, I would expect earnings per share growth of 8% over the long haul. About two-thirds of that will come from old-fashioned revenue growth, and the remaining third will come from share buybacks. Since the spin-off of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) to shareholders on January 1, 2013, the company has retired over 75 million shares of its stock. This year, it is expected to retire another 25 million to 30 million shares of stock. Abbott is able to do this because the dividend accounts for less than half of company profits, and the share buybacks are used with profits that are not earmarked for investment in Established Pharmaceuticals division.Considering that Abbott is within the realm of fair value, it seems likely that the total returns from this point forward will equal earnings per share growth plus the dividend. Because Abbott appears likely to grow earnings per share at a rate of 8%, and because the dividend now sits at 2%, it seems likely that shareholders will achieve long-term returns of 10% annually from this point forward. In this respect, it seems that Abbott is likely to continue doing what it has always done: creating wealth for shareholders at a rate that is approximately triple the prevailing inflation rate. Who would have thought the exemplar stocks of Benjamin Graham would hold up almost a century later?"

Below is a comparison table of the financial metrics for when I wrote all articles pertaining to the company.TechnicalsLooking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock in middle-ground territory with a current value of 50. I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next. I see that the black line is below the red line with the divergence bars decreasing in height which tells me bearish momentum is in the name. As for the stock price itself ($44.90), I'm looking at $46.65 to act as resistance and the 50-day simple moving average (currently $44.26) to act as support for a risk/reward ratio which plays out to be -1.43% to 3.9%.Russian Pharma Deal Is CompleteMidway through 2014 Abbott made an advance to acquire Russian pharmaceutical company Veropharm and now that deal has been consummated. The purchase was worth approximately $305 million to Abbott shareholders. The company has been looking to expand its international presence through acquisitions like this one and others in Latin America. Through this particular purchase Abbott gets its hands on a manufacturing facility in Russia and a portfolio of products which caters to women's health, cardiovascular while adding some oncology components to the portfolio.By acquiring these types of pharma companies over the globe I see Abbott working in the direction of providing affordable healthcare to the rest of the world, solidifying the behavior of a conglomerate style company operating in the consumer goods sector. I actually see it operating kind of like a Procter & Gamble or Kimberley Clark, which isn't a bad thing. The dividend payout ratio is a bit high but as long as it is covered by cash flows it shouldn't be a problem and should probably continue to be increased in the future.ConclusionAbbott couldn't make it out of the first round of my Portfolio Super Bowl with an upset loss to Goodyear Tire because it was completely outmatched on a valuation perspective. Fundamentally I believe the company to be fairly valued on next year's earnings estimates while having earnings estimates decrease by 0.4% since the last time I wrote about the company. Financially, the dividend is decent and doesn't have much room to grow. On a technical basis the risk/reward ratio shows me there is more reward than risk right now.

The company had adjusted EPS of $0.58 in the same quarter a year ago for EPS growth of 22.4%.The company saw growth from both increasing revenue and margin improvement. Adjusted net margin grew over 200 basis points versus the same quarter a year ago due to efficiency improvements. Revenue also grew over 10% in the full year for Abbott Laboratories. The company's CEO Miles White had this to say about 2014 results:2015 OutlookAbbott Laboratories has managed double-digit EPS growth by aggressively expanding internationally. The company generates 70% of revenues internationally, and 50% in emerging markets. Over the long run, this strategy will very likely provide superior results versus focusing exclusively on U.S. markets. In 2015, however, the strong U.S. dollar will hurt the company's earnings.Since July of 2014, the U.S. Dollar Index has risen by 17.5%. It has risen 4% in the last month alone. The trend is expected to continue because the Federal Reserve will likely raise interest rates (which supports a stronger dollar) in the second half of 2015. This will provide substantial headwinds for Abbott Laboratories in 2015, though the company's long-term prospects and competitive advantage will not be affected.Management has issued an outlook of $2.10 to $2.20 in adjusted EPS from continuing operations for full fiscal 2015. This compares favorably to adjusted EPS from continuing operations of $1.98 in full fiscal 2014. Management is projecting 6% to 11% EPS growth for 2015 despite headwinds from currency effects. The dollar cannot and will not stay strong forever. When the trend reverses, Abbott Laboratories will likely grow EPS in the 10% to 15% a year range instead of 6% to 11% a year.In addition to long-term EPS growth of around 10%, Abbott Laboratories also offers shareholders a 2.2% dividend yield. The company recently raised its dividend payments from $0.22 a share to $0.24 a share. This marks the 43rd consecutive year of dividend increases for Abbott Laboratories. The company's commitment to rising dividends has made it a member of the exclusive Dividend Aristocrats Index. Shareholders can expect total returns of around 12% a year from EPS growth (10%) and dividend payments (2%) over the next several years.Business OverviewAbbott Laboratories operations are divided into 4 segments. Each segment is shown below along with the percentage of total revenue generated for the company to give an idea of the importance of each segment:The 4th quarter results for each segment are analyzed below.Nutrition SegmentThe nutrition segment posted 4th quarter operational sales growth of 8.9%. The segment is Abbott Laboratories largest. In 2014, it generated about one third of total revenue. The segment is broken-down into 2 divisions: Pediatric and Adult. Additionally, the segment is broken down by U.S. and international results. Fourth quarter operating revenue growth is shown below:The U.S. divisions performed poorly while the International division saw growth surge. The international division makes up about 70% of revenue in the segment. Abbott Laboratories opened up new manufacturing facilities in India and China in the quarter to keep up with demand. The company also launched Ensure in China and several new infant formulas in China as well.Diagnostics SegmentThe Diagnostics segment is further divided into the Core Laboratories, Molecular, and Point of Care divisions. Revenue growth for the 4th quarter in each divisions, both domestically and abroad, is shown in the table below.Established PharmaceuticalsThe established pharmaceuticals segment underwent significant changes in 2014. Abbott Laboratories announced it would sell its developed market operations to Mylan (MYL) for $5.3 billion. Additionally, the company acquired both CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America and Veropharm in Russia this year. As a result, results are not directly comparable to last year. With that said, the segment is well positioned for future growth with large stakes in faster growing emerging markets.Medical DevicesThe Medical Devices segment performed worst for Abbott Laboratories in the 4th quarter of 2014. Segment sales increased just 0.4% on a constant currency basis. The segment was negatively impacted by Center for Medicare and Medicaid services reductions in reimbursements. Unlike Abbott Laboratories other three segments, international growth was weak in the quarter; just 2.2% on a constant currency basis.Final ThoughtsAbbott Laboratories is generating strong EPS growth due to double-digit international growth in its Nutrition, Diagnostics, and Established Pharmaceutical segments. The company is projecting EPS growth between 6% and 11% in 2015, despite significant negative headwinds from a strong U.S. Dollar.Abbott Laboratories is in the Top 10 using The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing thanks to its decent dividend yield of 2.2%, solid growth prospects, long dividend history, and extremely low stock price standard deviation. The stock is a good choice for investors seeking long-term dividend growth and capital gains."
2873116,72215,2015-02-02T02:57:48-05:00,"Abbott Laboratories reported quarterly net sales of $5.36 billion, which was up by 5.6% compared to the sales of $5.07 billion reported in the corresponding period in 2013.Net earnings for the quarter surged by 54% to $905 million. Total earnings per share rose from $0.58 in 2013 to $0.71 in the recently ended quarter.Abbott was able to top analyst estimates for the quarter who expected EPS at 68 cents a share against revenues of $5.42 billion.Abbott Laboratories has announced their guidance for adjusted EPS at $2.10-$2.20 for the full year’s continuing operations.Abbott could witness during the current year is foreign currency headwinds especially since the US dollar is likely to remain strong for most part of the year.","Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended 2014. The company reported growth in its sales on the back of better operational sales from its various segments. Moreover, the international performance of the company remained spectacular especially in the Nutrition's division, which had seen sales dip due to contamination rumors in its formula. Since then, sales have not only spiked, but demand has also registered a rapid increase which has warranted development of more manufacturing facilities. Going forward, the company could see its top and bottom line growth remain strong; however 2015 may see the company's financials be impacted by currency headwinds.Fourth quarter recapFor the fourth quarter ended 31 December, 2014, Abbott Laboratories reported quarterly net sales of $5.36 billion, which was up by 5.6% compared to the sales of $5.07 billion reported in the corresponding period in 2013. The company's net sales performed better on the back of growth in operational sales from all operating divisions. The Nutrition division of the company, which was badly hit by a recall in August of 2013, was able to report an 8.9% increase in its operational sales during the quarter. The Diagnostics division grew consistently by 8.6% in terms of operational sales during the quarter. Established Pharmaceuticals demonstrated impressive growth as operational sales rushed forward by 35.4% during the quarter. Medical Devices reported flat operational sales during the quarter.The company's operating earnings amounted to $829 million, which was a 32% increase compared to a year ago. The operating margin during the quarter expanded from 12.36% last year to 15.48% in the recently concluded quarter. Earnings from continuing operations reported a 32% increase and amounted to $804 million. Net earnings for the quarter surged by 54% to $905 million. This was inclusive of the earnings from discontinued operations which amounted to $271 million. Total earnings per share rose from $0.58 in 2013 to $0.71 in the recently ended quarter. EPS witnessed a 22% increase over last year's reported figure.Abbott was able to top analyst estimates for the quarter who expected EPS at 68 cents a share against revenues of $5.42 billion. Continuing with its consistent dividend payout tradition, the end of the quarter also saw quarterly dividends rise by 2 cents to $0.24 per share, payable on 13 February, 2015.Full year recapAbbott Laboratories full year net sales recorded 3% growth over 2013 and amounted to $20.25 billion for the year ended 31 December, 2014. Abbott recorded increases in operational sales from all of its divisions. Nutrition's operational sales increased by 5% in 214 compared to the year earlier. Diagnostic's sales grew by 6.4% during the year, while Established Pharmaceuticals saw their sales climb by 15% during the year. Medical Devices sales were rather sluggish as they were up by only 0.2% during the year.The companies operating earnings were reported at $2.60 billion for the year, up by 22% from $2.13 billion reported a year earlier. Operating margins also registered an increase as they rose from 10.85% in 2013 to 12.83% in 2014. Net earnings of the company amounted to $2.28 billion in 2014, down by 11.3% compared to the figures reported a year earlier. On a per share basis, earnings amounted to $2.28 per share, up by 13% from the earnings of $2.01 reported a year earlier.Outlook for 2015Abbott Laboratories has announced their guidance for adjusted EPS at $2.10-$2.20 for the full year's continuing operations. The guidance is up from the continuing operations EPS reported in 2014, signifying that the top line growth and margin expansion is likely to be witnessed in the current year as well. For the first quarter of the current year, adjusted EPS guidance is at $0.41-$0.43.Starting from the top, we have seen that Abbott has been able to report top line increases in its sales. With nearly 70% of the company's revenues stemming from foreign countries, there are a number of factors that suggest that top line growth will be seen by all of its segments in the current year as well. To begin with, the international sales of the Nutrition segment, especially pediatric nutrition, were up during the quarter. These sales were the most affected by the recall of baby formula that was rumored to be contaminated. Even though the issue was deemed baseless after the formula was tested, 2013 remained challenging for the segment since sales took a hit. The latest quarter saw international back up growing in double digits. This trend is expected to continue this year as well due to high demand (for which three manufacturing plans were set up in China and India) and because Abbott has released some new products like Ensure into the Chinese market. We could be looking at long term growth from this segment, especially internationally. The acquisition of Veropharm is a strategic move for the company's Established Pharmaceutical division, especially since it allows it to expand its footprint into Russia, a key emerging market for the company. The acquisition has also given Abbott access to machines that serves Abbott's areas of focus very well. The company's Diagnostic's division is also poised for future growth on the back of FDA clearance for its galectin-3 test that can be used on the ARCHITECT platform. Moreover, the company's infectious disease platform called IRIDICA has also received European approval. The platform is known to reduce health care cost by 30%, which is likely to make it the preferred choice of platforms by healthcare providers in the near future.Perhaps the major setback that Abbott could witness during the current year is foreign currency headwinds. The US dollar is likely to remain strong for most part of the year, especially as the date for interest rate hikes continues to be pushed forward. This is an external factor that weighs down sales and is not likely to continue taking its toll on the company for a prolonged period of time. That being said; while it is a challenge for the company, it is not something that puts the company in danger for the current year.ConclusionFrom the recently released financial results, it is evident that Abbott's international sales continue to be doing great. Moreover, the decisions and developments in the company's various divisions suggest that this growth will spearhead international top line growth. This bodes well for the net sales reported by the company and 2015 will likely see top lines and EPS grow as a result of this. The company seems to have accounted for currency headwinds in its guidance for EPS. Moreover, its guidance is in line with those of analysts' despite other pharmaceutical companies warning that the strength in the dollar could damage earnings potential in the industry during the current year. Additionally, investors will continue to see dividends, and possible dividend increases as well, given the company's excellent and consistent track record in this regard. The impressive dividend yield of 2.10% makes it an attractive investment opportunity for investors seeking streams of income. Currency headwinds will limit top line and EPS growth for the year to some extent. However, given that this is a temporary problem that is being faced, we will not see this weighing down the company's long term growth prospects in any way, at this point in time.The share currently trades around the $44 mark, with analysts projecting prices at $47.79 over the next 12 months. Its current PE valuation of 30.06 makes the stock seem overvalued. However, since the company has stable growth prospects, with little to drive it downwards for the year, the current price seems like a good buy. I am bullish on the stock in the long term and recommend a long position in the stock."
2795605,44001,2015-01-04T13:26:15-05:00,The company increased its dividend by 9.1% but I believe it was better suited to retain that money and invest in something a little less commoditized.The return on equity has decreased significantly in large part to the decrease in profit margins.Decreasing profit margins indicates the company's growth profile is very mature at this point in time and is indicative of a company operating in a cutthroat environment.,"Most investors take a look at return on equity as a measure of how well a company is doing with respect to net income as a ratio to shareholders equity on the balance sheet. Typically a high return on equity value is pretty nice to have, but not all returns on equity are equal. Although it is a straight ratio as suggested, it is a bit more complex than that. Not many investors know this, but return on equity can actually be decomposed into three parts, made popular by DuPont back in the 1920s. The decomposition of return on equity tells us three things:Prepare yourself for some algebra; I promise it will be pretty easy. We already know that profit margins are dictated by the equation of profit/sales. Total asset turnover is dictated by the equation of sales/assets and the equity multiplier is dictated by the equation of assets/equity. So when we multiply them all together we get the following proof:I for one am looking at return on equity in a much different manner now after learning this method. The part of the proof above that got me to investigate ROE more intently is the equity multiplier portion. Depending on how a company chooses to finance its assets (by debt or by equity), the equity multiplier can be really huge, causing the overall return on equity to be high. Personally I don't like a whole lot of debt on the balance sheet. But for capital structuring reasons debt can be used as a tax shield as taxes are calculated after interest payments.I've chosen to evaluate Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) today because since I've been writing about the company, the return on equity has been decreasing. Since I've been looking at the stock it has had the return on equity profile depicted in the table below.Operating EfficiencyAs mentioned earlier, operating efficiency is the profit divided by the sales. This in essence tells us how efficiently the company is operating from an operations, financial, and tax perspective. From the table below we see that the profit margin decreased by 16.85% for Abbott from the second quarter to the third quarter. We see that net income has decreased at a high clip and sales decreased over the period. Nonetheless, profit margins decreased which means the decrease in ROE can be attributed almost completely to the decrease in profit margin.Total Asset TurnoverFrom the equation I showed above, the total asset turnover ratio is defined by sales divided by assets. Total asset turnover gives us the big picture of how well the company is transforming all of its assets into sales. From the table below we see that the total asset turnover actually decreased from the second quarter to the third quarter. Total revenues decreased while average assets decreased at a lower clip. This portion of the equation tells us that the decrease in ROE is slightly correlated to the asset turnover but is practically negligible.Equity MultiplierThe equity multiplier is the part of the ROE equation that I don't like. It's with this portion of the equation that a company can choose to get risky or play it safe. It completely depends on how the company manages its debt, equity, and on how well the cash flows are coming in to pay those debts. From the previous portions of the equation we pretty much determined that the ROE has decreased thanks to the profit margin and asset turnover decreases. An equity multiplier number of 1.77 is pretty good for my taste.But it isn't until we break it out like I did in the table below that we can see if it is a good thing or a bad thing. As we can see assets have decreased and equity has decreased, causing the equity multiplier to decrease by 0.56%. We can see that the equity multiplier is also not really correlated to the ROE decrease in this situation as well.If we dig a little further we see that the average equity value decreased by 0.84% primarily because of an increase in other comprehensive income over the past year.In Other NewsThe company recently announced a 9.1% increase to the dividend to $0.24 per share quarterly as compared to the $0.22 per share they were paying previously. The dividend has an ex-dividend date of January 13, 2015 and pay date of February 13, 2015. The stock now carries a forward yield of 2.17% which is pretty small. The increase in the dividend is a bit more than I would like actually. Because of the falling profit margins I believe the company is better suited keeping as much cash as they can to invest in something with better margins. I believe the company is beginning to behave like a company which produces commoditized products. For about the past nine months now I've been pondering closing my position in the name but I just haven't been able to pull the trigger. I feel that when February rolls around for my quarterly portfolio change-out I believe it will be time for Abbott to go.ConclusionNot all returns on equity are created equal and in this case Abbott's return on equity is decreasing. The decreasing ROE can be pulled off by not acting on one of three levers; profit margins, asset turnover, or leverage. Abbott is primarily decreasing because the company is going the wrong way with their profit margins. When you multiply all the numbers together you get an ROE of 8.27% which is a 17.53% decrease from the prior quarter. This ROE makes Abbott the twelfth highest in the Drugs - Generic industry (out of 41 companies). I'd like to see Abbott do better with the profit margin numbers buy purchasing a high growth company but for now I feel that it's on its breath. The company has already been ousted from my Portfolio Super Bowl in the first round by Goodyear Tire after claiming the #6 seed.Disclaimer: This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

2792455,44001,2015-01-02T00:50:00-05:00,"Goodyear pulls off the first upset of the tournament to face Disney in the next round of the playoffs.
        People laughed at me when I replaced Pepsi in the portfolio for Goodyear earlier this year and now Goodyear is up by about 5% on Pepsi.
        The winner of this tournament last year, KLA-Tencor, went on to produce a 38.35% gain including dividends versus the S&P 500 which gained 13.1%.","In the first round of the Portfolio playoffs we have #6 seeded Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) taking on #8 seeded Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (NASDAQ:GT). Abbott is engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a portfolio of science-based healthcare products, which operates in four segments: Diagnostics, Medical Devices, Nutritionals and Generic Pharmaceuticals. Goodyear develops, manufactures, and markets tires.The following table depicts the recent earnings reports for each company:Abbott is up 17.33% excluding dividends in the past year (up 19.53% including dividends) while Goodyear is up 21.37% excluding dividends (up 22.26% including dividends), and the S&P 500 has gained 11.83% in the same time frame. This matchup will be played out in a best of seven game series based on the metrics below. Not all the metrics will be looked at if a team can win and win early. This matchup will determine the winner which will go on to the next round to play against The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).Forward P/EForward P/E is the metric of how many times future earnings you are paying up for a particular stock. The earnings portion of the ratio I utilize is the earnings value for the next twelve months or for the next full fiscal year. I like utilizing the forward P/E ratio as opposed to the trailing twelve month P/E ratio because it is an indication of where the stock is going to go in the future. I like to get a glimpse of the future, but will take note of where it was coming from in the past. Abbott carries a 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 19.94 which is fairly priced for the future right now while Goodyear's 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 9.19 is inexpensively priced. Game 1 goes to Goodyear.1-yr PEGThis metric is the trailing twelve month P/E ratio divided by the anticipated growth rate for a specific amount of time. This ratio is used to determine how much an individual is paying with respect to the growth prospects of the company. Traditionally the PEG ratio used by analysts is the five year estimated growth rate, however I like to use the one year growth rate. This is because as a former capital projects manager that performed strategy planning for the research and development division of a large-cap biotech company I noticed that 100% of people cannot forecast their needs beyond one year. Even within that one year things can change dramatically. I put much more faith in a one year forecast as opposed to a five year forecast. The PEG ratio some say provides a better picture of the value of a company when compared to the P/E ratio alone. The 1-year PEG ratio for Abbott is currently at -229.4% based on a 1-yr earnings growth of -0.18% while Goodyear's 1-yr PEG ratio is 3.04 based on a 1-yr earnings growth rate of 4.89%. Goodyear takes Game Two away from Abbott.EPS Growth Next YearThis metric is really simple, it is essentially taking the difference of next year's projected earnings and comparing it against the current year's earnings. The higher the value the better prospects the company has. I generally like to see earnings growth rates of greater than 11%. Again, in this situation I like to take a look at the one year earnings growth projection opposed to the five year projection based on what I discussed in the PEG section above. Abbott has a projected EPS growth rate of -0.18% while Goodyear sports a growth rate of 4.89%. Goodyear is a game away from clinching the series.Dividend YieldDividend yield is a no brainer; the higher the better. The dividend yield is the amount of annual dividend paid out by a company in any given year divided by the current share price of the stock. In my portfolio I don't discriminate against stocks as long as they provide excellent fundamental metrics in the form of the forward P/E, the 1-yr PEG and the 1-yr EPS growth rate. Dividends are a way to measure how much cash flow you're getting for each dollar invested in the stock. Obviously, the higher the yield, the better, as long as it is covered by the trailing twelve month earnings. Abbott pays a dividend of 1.95% while Goodyear pays a dividend of 0.84%. Abbott manages to wrestle away one game from Goodyear and avoids elimination.Return on AssetsReturn on assets is the metric which shows how profitable a company is relative to its total assets, telling us how efficient a management team is at using its assets to generate earnings. It is best to compare ROA values of companies within the same industry as it is industry dependent, but for the purposes of this tournament I will not be utilizing that rule of thumb. The assets of a company are comprised of both debt and equity. The higher the ROA value, the better, because the company is earning more money on less investment. Abbott is showing a 5.6% efficiency rate on their assets while Goodyear is showing 3.2% efficiency. With this victory Abbott stops Goodyear from advancing to the next round again.Return on EquityReturn on equity is an important financial metric for purposes of comparing the profitability, which is generated with the money shareholders have invested in the company to that of other companies in the same industry. It is best to compare ROE values of companies within the same industry as it is industry dependent, but for the purposes of this tournament I will not be utilizing that rule of thumb. Equity is determined as the net income for the full fiscal year before dividends paid to common stock holders but after dividends to preferred stock, but does not include preferred shares. The higher the ROE value, the better. Abbott proves their efficiency of managing their shareholders equity to be 9.9% while Goodyear sports a value of 37%. By winning this game Goodyear pulls off the upset by beating Abbott.ConclusionAfter watching Goodyear beat Abbott, I've come to the conclusion that I may be dropping Abbott from the portfolio come February. Because I am a value investor, the first three matches carried the most importance because they were fundamental metrics and Abbott isn't looking too hot for 2015. With respect to Goodyear, I was ridiculed pretty heavily when I put the stock into the portfolio in replace of Pepsi. Since that swap out date Goodyear is up 14.5% and Pepsi is up 9.83%. After beating Abbott, Goodyear advances to the next round to face Disney.Disclaimer: This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future.

2784515,24112,2014-12-29T09:06:19-05:00,Abbott Labs is a leading health care company that has been steadily growing since their spinoff of AbbVie at the end of 2012.The company posted strong 3Q results that show the company is likely poised for a strong 2015.The company provides upside over the medium to long-term as management now seems clearly focused on reaccelerating growth through improving execution and investing in new technologies and geographies via M&A.,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Abbott Laboratories is a leading pharmaceutical medical devices and diagnostics company with contribution from four major business segments. These segments include medical devices, drugs, diagnostics and nutritionals. The company's five-year price to volume performance can be seen below. Since splitting with AbbVie, the company has been able to create growth and continue to increase their dividend.Recent Fundamental Highlights (FY end Dec)CEO Miles White took over the company in 1999 and has been consistently reshaping the product portfolio in pursuit of creating a durable business in the long-term. Some of his notable moves include:These strong moves show the ability of management to find creative ways for the company to continue to fund long-term growth and should give investors confidence in the long-term prospects of the stock and dividends.In terms of 3Q14, ABT saw notable growth acceleration in key businesses including EPD and Nutritionals while driving continued positive operating leverage. Based on the healthy performance in the recent quarter, management has raised the mid-point of its full year 2014 EPS guidance from $2.19-$2.29 to $2.25-$2.27. This marks a strong earnings growth of 11%-12% for 2014.OutlookAbbott Laboratories' strategic initiatives have begun paying off as the company delivered an overall robust performance in the third quarter of 2014. In addition to its improving top line, ABT is likely to generate sufficient operating leverage and cash flow to generate a double digit EPS growth.The acquisition of Veropharm, recently announced by ABT, is expected to close by the end of the year, which, will position the company among the top five branded generics companies in Russia by providing it with in-country manufacturing and a broad portfolio well aligned to the company's therapeutic areas of focus. Similar to past strategic moves, this one appears as if it will help the company to continue to growth their top and bottom lines.ABT expects to return to a high-single digit operational sales growth in Nutrition in CY14 and this segment recorded a growth of 10% y/y in the previous 3Q. Hence, its operational sales growth for the 9 months ending CY14 stood at 3.7% y/y, as the impact of the supplier recall continues to fade away. These positive trends are expected to continue into 2015 and will be one of the main catalysts for the company.Furthermore, the company is expecting a large amount of its growth to come from emerging markets. They expect these markets to contribute nearly half of the Nutritional segments total sales by the end of 2014. These main regions include the BRIC countries, which, according to IMS Health are expected to have a compound annual growth rate of 11%-14% in the next five years.Economic Moat TrendFollowing the divesture of the developed business, Abbott's EPD (established pharma division) business will exclusively focus on emerging markets and branded generics, which should help stabilize the company's net profit margin.Nutritionals have always been a core part of the company's business, but will be crucial in the coming year in helping the company maintain its competitive advantage. In 2013, this segment accounted for $6740M in sales with margins of approximately 20%. This fast growing segment, as seen below, will help drive up the company's margins.Major RisksInvestment RationaleAbbott's management team continues to reshape the company for durable growth with a strong balance sheet holding $5.7B of cash and equivalents with only $1.5B in debt.ABT currently trades at $45.85 (closing price as of Dec 26th) and provides upside over the medium to long-term as management now seems clearly focused on reaccelerating growth through improving execution and investing in new technologies and geographies via M&A."
2897966,24491,2015-02-09T08:15:41-05:00,"There are few stronger cash-flow generators than Abbott.The firm generates tremendous economic value for shareholders.Though we like the company more than ever, the market isn't providing much of a buying opportunity.","It's hard not to like Abbott (NYSE:ABT). The company is one of the strongest cash-flow generators, and its spin-off of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) has not impaired the firm's ability to generate value for shareholders. Management is looking for the fundamental momentum to continue into 2015 as it is targeting ""another year of top-tier earnings growth."" Though currency may provide some headwinds, for a company as strong as that of Abbott foreign exchange is less important to the investment picture, in our view. We like the company more than ever, though Mr. Market isn't providing much of a buying opportunity at present levels.Abbot's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• The new Abbott isn't much different from the old Abbott, minus the blockbuster drug Humira and other members of its drug lineup like AndroGel and TriCor. It remains aligned with favorable long-term healthcare trends in both developed and developing markets. The company is more than 125 years' old. Roughly 70% of its sales are now outside the US.• Abbott's business quality ranks among the best of the firms in our coverage universe. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders with relatively stable operating results for the past few years, a combination we view very positively. The firm has an attractive Economic Castle. Find out what that means here.• The new Abbott's nutritionals segment is one of the more attractive businesses in the healthcare space. It is home to some well-known brand names such as EAS, Myoplex and ZonePerfect. The division is #1 in adult nutrition and #1 in pediatric nutrition. It's hard not to like its branded generics (#1 in India) and its medical devices (#1 in drug-eluting stents) segments either.• Abbott's diagnostics segment has some solid products in the pipeline that could kick-start growth, and it remains #1 in immunoassay diagnostics and #1 in blood screening. More than 40% of the world's population will be 50 or older by 2050, offering tremendous opportunities across Abbott's portfolio.• Abbott has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 21.3% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 1.5 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 20.7%.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisHow can we talk about how much we like a company if we don't compare its returns with the cost of attaining the capital to generate such returns? In our view, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread.Abbott's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 23.1%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.2%. We assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT as a result. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisCash flow forms the backbone of any valuation analysis. Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Abbott's free cash flow margin has averaged about 14.9% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is STRONG.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company.Valuation AnalysisThis is where the rubber hits the road. The most important aspect of any financial analysis is converting one's qualitative opinions of a company into a quantitative output. Without quantifying one's views, an investor cannot possibly know whether a company is poised to be a good investment or a bad one. It's not enough to just like the fundamentals of the firm. One must strive to find out whether such fundamentals are already reflected in the share price. We use a discounted cash flow model to quantify our opinions of Abbott.Second, we think a fair value range is the most appropriate approach to assessing a company's intrinsic worth as it allows for the consideration of upside potential and downside risks. It also acknowledges the very real concept that all of what is known is in the past, and all of what has value is in the future. Because the future has yet to be written, a range of probable fair value outcomes should always be applied to any valuation analysis. We think Abbott's shares are worth between $34-$52 each. The midpoint of the range, or $43 per share, is Abbott's fair value estimate. Shares are trading a bit higher than that at the moment.To learn more about how we think about our modeling assumptions within the discounted cash-flow model, please spend 15 minutes with Valuentum's Brian Nelson here.Margin of Safety AnalysisThe chart above helps put into perspective how investors should be thinking about investing, at least as it relates to individual equities. At first glance, it might appear too mathematical, but it's rather straightforward. The most likely fair value estimate of Abbott, in our view, is $43 per share, the highest point on the y-axis, which measures the probability of a certain fair value to be the ""true"" one.You'll see, however, that Abbott has a probability distribution of fair values that considers $52 per share as an upside case and $34 per share as a downside case. In between those two levels (the yellow line) is what we would consider to be a reasonable valuation of the company. Said differently, at this moment in time, we would consider Abbott's ""true"" fair value to be within this range. Should Abbott's shares fall toward the lower end of the fair value range, we'd grow more and more interested in them -- in that case, odds are its ""true"" fair value is higher than the lower price.With Abbott's share price in the mid-to-high $40s, however, Mr. Market isn't providing much of an opportunity for new money. Without a doubt, we very much like the company's business model, but sometimes the best companies trade at a fair price, and there's little investors can do about it. That's what's happening in Abbott's shares right now.PerformanceIn the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of the Valuentum Buying Index, our stock selection methodology, has stacked up per underlying score as it relates to firms in the Best Ideas portfolio.

These non-saturated markets should provide strong growth in the coming years, as the growing middle class in these countries looks for better healthcare products. ABT is already one of the leading pharmaceutical companies in India and among the top ten in Latin America. Furthermore, the company is well diversified which allows it to weather major economic changes more easily. ABT was able to show consistent EPS growth during the financial recession when its EPS increased from $2.31 in 2007 to $3.12 in 2008 and $3.69 in 2009.Main SegmentsThe company has four main divisions; Nutrition, Diagnostics, Medical Devices and Established Pharmaceuticals. It holds a sizable market share in all divisions and is the leading pharmaceutical company in pediatric nutrition in the US. Healthcare spending within the US currently stands at 17% of GDP and is expected to rise as the baby boomer generation retires. This should provide positive momentum for the entire pharmaceutical sector, and specifically, the established firms who have diversified products to meet the requirements of the consumers. Within the pharmaceutical sector, ABT has typically performed better than its peers as can be seen by a comparison of its price movement along with the AMEX Equal Weighted Pharmaceutical index.Figure 1: Comparison of ABT and AMEX pharmaceutical indexIt can be seen that ABT was much more resilient during the financial recession than the pharmaceutical sector as a whole.Levered Returns modelA terminal growth rate of 3.0% is assumed within the model. It is predicted that the firm will bounce back in 2015 with a growth rate of 7.5%, 6.0% in 2016, and 5.0% in 2017. The terminal EBITDA margin is projected to expand to 28%. This results in an enterprise value of $73 Billion and resulting equity value of $72 Billion.Conclusion:ABT is a great firm and would be a great addition for any investor who wants to protect the portfolio against major financial swings. The stock has shown lesser volatility than the overall market and has high growth prospects. The stock also provides reasonable dividend yield which can aide in building stable long-term value. ABT has grown at a healthy rate thus far in 2014 providing investors with a return of 19.41% against the S&P 500 benchmark of 16.05%. I expect a similar theme in 2015."
2731325,44001,2014-12-04T13:42:38-05:00,The stock appears to be fairly valued already based on 2015 earnings estimates.The dividend is decent but doesn't have much room to grow while the financial efficiency ratios have decreased quite a bit since earlier this year.Though a big investor stepped in to buy a huge amount of call options yesterday I'm not convinced of the stock's growth trajectory right now.,"The last time I analyzed Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) on September 11, 2014, I stated, ""I still like the company but won't be buying into the name for another month or so."" Since the article was published the stock has increased 6.53% versus the 3.79% gain the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) posted. The stock dropped as low as 6% and has recovered nicely since then. I was able to take advantage of the situation, but only with a small batch about a month after writing the article. Abbott is engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a portfolio of science-based healthcare products, which operates in four segments: Diagnostics, Medical Devices, Nutritionals and Generic Pharmaceuticals.On October 22, 2014, the company reported third quarter earnings of $0.62 per share, which beat the consensus of analysts' estimates by $0.03. In the past year the company's stock is up 21.54% excluding dividends (up 23.74% including dividends) and is beating the S&P 500, which has gained 15.4% in the same time frame. Since initiating my position back on May 28, 2013, I'm up 26.49% inclusive of reinvested dividends and dollar cost averaging. With all this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to evaluate the stock to see if right now is a good time to purchase more for the healthcare and dividend sector of my portfolio.FundamentalsThe company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 41.49, which is expensively priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 19.94 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. The 1-year PEG ratio (188.59), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is expensively priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 0.22%. Below is a comparison table of the fundamental metrics for the company for when I wrote all articles pertaining to the company.FinancialsOn a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. The company pays a dividend of 1.95% with a payout ratio of 81% of trailing 12-month earnings while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 5.6%, 9.9% and 8%, respectively, which are all respectable values. Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I don't believe the 1.95% yield of this company alone is good enough for me to take shelter in for the time being. Below is a comparison table of the financial metrics for when I wrote all articles pertaining to the company.TechnicalsLooking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock in overbought territory with a current value of 70.88. I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next. I see that the black line is above the red line with the divergence bars increasing in height which tells me bullish momentum is in the name. As for the stock price itself ($45.66), I'm looking at $45.85 to act as resistance and $45.18 to act as support for a risk/reward ratio which plays out to be -1.05% to 0.42%.Investors Getting Bullish On AbbottJust yesterday investors started bidding up the company through call options, buying 7,500 December 46 calls for $0.37! The reason this is newsworthy is because it was twenty times the strike's previous open interest, and because overall option volume was eight times more than normal.As I mentioned earlier, the stock has been kind to me as I'm up 26.49% on my overall position, while the S&P 500 is up 25.6% in the same time frame. I'm extremely happy that someone bid up these call options, taking my shares up with it. But if push comes to shove in February during the quarterly portfolio change-out, this name is definitely atop the list of closing the position as it is one of the more highly valued stocks I own.ConclusionThe company has been extremely kind to me with the dividend increases and price appreciation. Fundamentally I believe the company to be fairly valued on next year's earnings estimates and expensive on earnings growth potential while having earnings estimates slashed by 7.7% since the last time I wrote about the company. Financially, the dividend is decent and doesn't have much room to grow. On a technical basis the risk/reward ratio shows me there is more risk than reward right now. Having done this analysis I don't see anything that is telling me it is a screaming buy right now other than the call buying that took place, hence I'm going to just ride my shares and not buy anymore till at least January or if it hits $40.Disclaimer: This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned. This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future. These are only my personal opinions and you should do your own homework. Only you are responsible for what you trade and happy investing!"
2656345,20411,2014-11-07T10:51:40-05:00,"According to our evaluation, ABT is growing at about 6.97%.But it is PE multiple is over 20x. That's expensive by definition.The stock tested longer term support most recently and it appears to be in the process of increasing towards longer term resistance.","Some confusion could exist when reviewing Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) for fair valuation given its early 2013 spinoff. However, this analysis attempts to reconcile fair valuation analysis and look ahead accordingly.Our observations of earnings and revenue prove that both earnings and revenue declined measurably after the spinoff, but in addition to that we can see that earnings growth has been realized subsequently as well.Our evaluation of earnings growth considers trailing 12 month data and compares that on a quarterly basis, excluding onetime events to best defined earnings from operations, to determine yearly growth rates. According to our observation the yearly growth rate of Abbott labs is 6.97%.Pursuing our interest in fair valuation our attention then turns to the PE multiple, and the PE multiple for Abbott labs skyrocketed after the spinoff. The PE multiple increased from about 9 times earnings to over 20 times earnings, which is where it stands today.That brings fair valuation into question, and considering the recent EPS growth rate the current multiple levied on ABT at this time is not in line with the growth rate from operations of the company. The current valuation placed on Abbott Labs is about three times its growth rate, suggesting to us that the stock is overvalued on a fundamental basis.Technical take:According to our real time trading report for Abbott labs the stock tested longer term support most recently and it appears to be in the process of increasing towards longer term resistance. We would expect, therefore, the stock to continue to move higher and test resistance by rule. Open a chart for ABT and you can see this yourself.Summary:Our observations suggest that Abbott labs looks rich on a fundamental basis, the stock has a PE multiple that is far higher than its associated growth rate, but the stock is progressing towards longer term resistance. Assuming that the stock continues to move higher and officially tests longer-term resistance, we would be Sellers of Abbott labs at longer term resistance given the fundamental observations and what then would be technical supporting evidence to sell the stock."
2595455,31461,2014-10-24T14:22:55-04:00,"Abbott’s earnings excluding special items grew 12.7% to $0.62 per share in the third quarter.Revenue in the quarter increased 5.8% primarily based on growth in nutrition and vision care products.I continue to remain bullish on Abbott, but not as bullish as earlier.","Abbott (NYSE:ABT) recently announced third quarter 2014 financial results. The company's earnings excluding special items grew 12.7% to $0.62 per share in the quarter. Earnings were above the previous guidance range of $0.59 to $0.61 per share. Revenue in the quarter increased 5.8% on a reported basis to $5.1 billion. The pharma-major revised its adjusted EPS forecast from the range between $2.19 and $2.29 to the range between $2.25 and $2.27 for full-year 2014. I continue to remain mildly positive on Abbott. I'm not overly positive as its diagnostics revenue didn't quite pick up yet and medical device revenue grew negatively.Abbott's worldwide sales increased due to strong growth in nutrition and vision care products, and moderate growth in diagnostics. However, its medical device products saw negative growth of 1% year-over-year. On a reported basis, worldwide nutrition product sales increased 9.3% in the third quarter, and worldwide diagnostics sales increased 4.9% in the quarter. In the original analysis I said that in the future Abbott is expected to expand its growth and margin significantly based on fresh capital deployment in sectors such as vision care and diagnostics. I expected Abbott's diagnostics segment to grow in high single-digits, which didn't quite happen. On the contrary, its nutrition products sales grew in high single-digits, which I didn't anticipate. The company's vision care or medical optics business was up 8.3% during the quarter, as I expected. Sales of cataract lenses, which contribute almost 70% to Abbott's total vision care sales, recorded double-digit growth led by new product launches, such as implantable Tecnis lenses, which I analyzed in this article.However, as I said in the original article, since nutrition products are nothing but consumer staples, they're not considered as a catalyst for the company's stock despite growing at an impressive rate in the third quarter. Sales growth in the nutrition products segment during the quarter was led by launch of new infant formula products, such as Eleva and Similac QINTI, which were launched in China earlier this year. Strong growth of the company's Ensure adult nutrition product coupled with continued expansion of the adult nutrition category internationally fueled nutrition products sales. The growth in this segment is expected to taper off sooner rather than later, when the impact of new product launches will begin to fade."

Last month, Abbott entered into an agreement to buy the medical device company for $250 million, plus other potential performance-based payments in the future. The deal is expected to close by the end of the fourth quarter. Apart from Topera, the company also secured the right to buy Advanced Cardiac Therapeutics (ACT), a startup working on developing a novel ablation catheter. Heading Abbott's electrophysiology business will be Michael Pederson, former President and CEO of private medical device company VytronUS. Prior to that, he was also Vice President and General Manager of Boston Scientific's (NYSE:BSX) electrophysiology business.Abbott's interest in the electrophysiology market signals the company's focus on turning around its ailing medical device business, which is significantly impacting its overall top line growth. Operational sales in the medical device division reported negative growth in the first nine months of 2014 year-over-year (y-o-y), compared to a growth of 3.9% in company-wide sales in the same period. Excluding the medical device business, Abbott's operational sales grew 5.3% y-o-y.The global catheter-based electrophysiology market is expected to grow in double digits to about $3 billion by 2020. There is significant scope for growth in this business for Abbott, but it is also likely to face intense competition from existing players, including General Electric (NYSE:GE), Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), Boston Scientific, and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).Topera's System And TechnologyTopera has developed an innovative technology, including a diagnostic catheter and mapping software, to help improve diagnosis and treatment of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) is one of the most common cardiovascular conditions affecting almost 3 million people in the U.S. and 20 million worldwide. Its prevalence increases with age and it is estimated that the number of people diagnosed with atrial fibrillation in the U.S. will double in the next 30-40 years.Topera's newest generation of 3D-mapping system was cleared by the FDA earlier this year and it helps identify rotors (associated with atrial fibrillation) using a color-imaging module. Abbott reported that a study on the use of Topera's system with catheter ablation suggested that patients had a success rate of 87.5% for the first ablation procedure, with a 80.5% success rate after one year. In comparison, catheter ablation alone has a success rate of only 50%-60%.The Global Electrophysiology MarketThe global electrophysiology market, comprising of ablation catheters, diagnostic catheters and lab systems, was valued at $1.56 billion in 2013 and is estimated to grow to about $3 billion by 2020, according to research firm GlobalData. Of this, advanced diagnostic catheters and standard ablation catheters are expected to grow to $1.2 billion and $575 million, respectively. This growth is likely to be fueled by an expanding geriatric population base, growing prevalence of atrial fibrillation in the population, and increased penetration of diagnostic and ablation catheters in developing markets such as Asia and South America.Disclosure: No positions"

2703575,63883,2014-11-21T21:01:51-05:00,Abbott Laboratories could generate a 5% yield on cost in 10 years.The company is experiencing strong growth in emerging markets.See how Abbott Laboratories is leveraging its competitive advantage to fuel shareholder returns.,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a diversified health care corporation. The company is a market cap of $66 billion. The company is truly globally diversified, generating nearly 70% of revenues internationally through the first 3 quarters of its fiscal 2014. The last time I analyzed Abbott Laboratories, I was impressed with the company's strong 12% EPS growth in its most recent quarter. Find out what makes Abbott Laboratories a strong investment in part 41 of the Dividend Aristocrats In Focus series. Abbott Laboratories' business operations are analyzed below.Business OverviewAbbott Laboratories operates in four primary segments: Nutrition, Diagnostics, Established Pharmaceuticals, and Medical Devices. Each segment's percentage of total revenue contributed through the first 3 quarters of fiscal 2014 is shown below to give an idea of the comparative size of each segment:The Nutrition segment manufactures and markets Ensure, Pedialyte, Similac, Zone Perfect, Elecare, and other health oriented nutrition products for every stage of human life from being an infant to old age. The Nutrition segment is Abbott Laboratories' largest, responsible for over one-third of total revenue.The Diagnostics segment manufactures and sells various instruments, tests, and diagnostic equipment to blood banks, laboratories, and other health care facilities throughout the world.Abbott Laboratories' Established Pharmaceutical segment is going through a transition. Abbott Laboratories announced it was selling its developed market pharmaceutical business to Mylan for $5.3 billion. The company recently completed the acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals for about $3.3 billion. CFR Pharmaceuticals is a Latin American pharmaceutical business. These moves restructure Abbott's pharmaceutical division so it has significantly more exposure to quickly growing emerging markets.The Medical Devices segment is Abbott's second-largest, generating 27% of total revenue so far this fiscal year. The segment manufactures and sells optical, vascular, and diabetes care devices and equipment to health care providers.Competitive AdvantageAbbott Laboratories is a diversified health care business. As a result, it has multiple competitive advantages. The company's strong brand portfolio in its Nutrition segment has given it the leading worldwide market share in adult nutrition and the top market share in US pediatric nutrition. Abbott has grown its brands over a long period of time. The company was founded in 1888 and continues to grow throughout the world.In addition to its strong brands, Abbott Laboratories is one of the leaders in global health care. The company's expertise in operating throughout the world has made it the leading pharmaceutical company in India, a Top 10 pharmaceutical company in Latin America, a Top 5 generic pharmaceutical company in Russia.Abbott Laboratories long history and global reach give it a unique competitive advantage that new entrants to the market cannot replicate. Abbott Laboratories has been building contacts, distribution, and expertise in health care for over 125 years. The company's operational know-how is supplemented by its intellectual property portfolio, strong brands, and global reach and scale.Growth ProspectsAbbott Laboratories has managed to grow revenue per share by about 6.5% since the spin-off of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) on January 1, 2013. The company's growth is being driven by an aging population in the developed world as well as rapid growth in emerging markets. Abbott Laboratories has positioned itself well to take advantage of growth in emerging markets.The company grew emerging market sales 15% in the third quarter of fiscal 2014. Better yet, Abbott Laboratories currently generates 50% of sales in emerging markets. The company's future growth is dependent on rising GDP in emerging markets. As consumers in these markets see increases in their income, they will continue to demand better health care products. Abbott Laboratories is situated to provide these health care products to consumers in emerging markets.Going forward, I expect solid growth from Abbott Laboratories, of at least 6.5% a year, but likely higher as the company continues to gain ground in emerging markets though both organic growth and strategic acquisitions. I believe EPS growth of 8% to 12% per year over the next several years is the most likely outcome for Abbott Laboratories.Dividend AnalysisAbbott Laboratories has a current dividend yield of 2%. The company has a conservative payout ratio of 40% as well. Going forward, I expect Abbott Laboratories to grow its dividend payments by 8% to 12% a year, in line with expected EPS growth. If the company can grow EPS at 10% a year, it will have the following yields on cost in the future:· Yield on cost in 3 years of 2.7%· Yield on cost in 5 years of 3.2%· Yield on cost in 10 years of 5.2%Recession PerformanceMost health care companies performed well throughout the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009. It is much more difficult for consumers and health care professionals to cut back on health expenditures than it is to cut back on luxury spending like travel, for example. As a result, Abbott Laboratories grew EPS each year throughout the Great Recession. The company's EPS from 2007 through 2009 are shown below to give an idea of how well the company performs during recessions:Despite strong operating performance in recessions, Abbott's stock price fell about 30% during the Great Recession. The underlying business' growth through that time period hopefully gave shareholders the confidence to hold the stock despite temporary losses.ValuationAbbott Laboratories is trading at a P/E ratio of about 19.5 times expected 2014 EPS. The S&P500 is trading at a P/E ratio of about 19.7. I believe Abbott Laboratories' expected growth rate of 8% to 12% a year will greatly exceed the S&P500's growth rate going forward. In addition, Abbott Laboratories has a current dividend yield of about 2%, which is slightly greater than the S&P500's dividend yield of 1.9%.Due to Abbott's better expected growth rate, the company should trade at a premium to the S&P500. Abbott Laboratories currently trades in line with the S&P500's P/E ratio. I believe that Abbott Laboratories is somewhat undervalued at this time relative to the S&P500 due to the company's strong competitive advantages and solid growth prospects.Final ThoughtsAbbott Laboratories ranks in the Top 20 based on The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing. The company's solid expected growth rate, decent dividend yield, fairly low payout ratio, and low price standard deviation of just 19.8% make it a solid investment going forward.

The plant, which could employ about 500 people, will be operational next year, producing 1 million sets of IOLs a year. The first product from the plant is not expected until the second half of 2016 though. The company developed Tecnis Symfony IOLs for providing cataract patients a continuous range of vision including far, intermediate and near distances.Cataract product sales contribute almost 70% to Abbott's overall medical optics revenues, and the company said that its growth in the cataract segment outpaced global market growth. Abbott registered $605 million in medical optics sales out of a total of $2.7 billion in medical device sales in the first half of 2014. Abbott said that the performance became possible due to growing adoption of its Tecnis lenses.I said in my original article that Abbott received a CE mark for Tecnis Symfony, an extended range of vision IOL. I further said that while standard IOLs are used only to improve distance vision, Abbott's Tecnis range of IOLs can also be used to help aging cataract patients focus on near objects. Medical optics is Abbott's only growing medical device segment with sales up 14% during the first half of 2014, and I believe that the trend will continue for some more time."
2441375,31461,2014-08-21T09:22:35-04:00,"Abbott joined forces with the United States Department of Defense for developing portable blood tests for concussions.
        The tests will help Abbott generate significant revenues not only from the military personnel, but also from civilian people in general.
        Abbott's stock is relatively undervalued compared to its peers and could have significant upside.","Abbott (NYSE:ABT) just announced that it has joined forces with the United States Department of Defense for developing portable blood tests in order to evaluate potential concussions, also known as mild traumatic brain injuries (""TBIs""). The test will be developed for use on Abbott's handheld diagnostic i-Stat System, which is currently used for several other Point of Care testing, including among military service members.TBI is a serious health issue in the United States, with at least four TBIs occurring every minute that costs Americans nearly $77 billion each year. I believe that upon successful development of the blood tests, Abbott will be able to generate significant revenues from TBI diagnosis not only from the military personnel, but also from civilian people in general.TBI Diagnosis: An Opportunity for AbbottA TBI is usually caused by a sudden blow on the head that disrupts the normal functioning of the brain. TBIs are classified from mild to severe based on the seriousness of the injury, although in most of the cases, both civilian as well as military, TBIs are mild that are also known as concussions. TBIs can cause a variety of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms, which may not be identified if subtle. Proper diagnosis of a mild TBI is difficult since brain imaging with CAT scan, MRI, SPECT and PET scan may not show abnormalities. Moreover, symptoms can be similar to other medical conditions. Beth McQuiston, M.D., a board certified neurologist and medical director, Diagnostics, Abbott, said:Through a contract, Abbott has been awarded $19.5 million by the Department of Defense to assess and verify traumatic brain injury biomarkers, which can be used to formulate the diagnostic blood tests for TBI. The blood tests will be performed using Abbott's i-Stat portable device. The contract is the first phase of what Abbott said would be a multi-phased contract, which extends through August 2016. I expect that Abbott will finally launch the blood tests within 2017.Clinical Potential of TBI DiagnosisResearch suggests that certain types of proteins are released in the bloodstream following a TBI, which could be effective in diagnosing TBI. Jeffrey J. Bazarian, M.D., M.P.H., an associate professor of Emergency Medicine, believes that measuring a combination of two proteins released into the bloodstream after a head injury might be the best way to diagnose a mild TBI. The two proteins are known as S100B and Apoa-1. Abbott's diagnostic tests will be based on evaluating the proteins that are released in the bloodstream.Typically chronic TBI is associated with major secondary molecular injuries, including chronic neuro-inflammation. Such neuro-inflammation can lead to the death of neuronal cells in the CNS (central nervous system), which is irreversible. But a recent study has shown encouraging results.In the study researchers have found that a combination of human umbilical cord blood cells (hUBCs) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), a growth factor, could be effective for healing TBI. The study's lead author Cesar V. Borlongan, PhD, said, ""Our results showed that the combined therapy of hUBCs and G-CSF significantly reduced the TBI-induced loss of neuronal cells in the hippocampus.""TBI patients can suffer a range of motor, behavioral, intellectual and cognitive disabilities, while clinical treatments are few and largely ineffective. There is a strong possibility that in future TBI will be treated effectively using hUBCs and G-CSF, as mentioned above. In that case, Abbott's diagnostic tests could come handy to healthcare providers.Abbott's ValuationGlobalData, an industry analysis specialist, estimated the TBI therapeutics market in 2010 to be worth $1.54 billion and forecasts it to grow at 3.8% annually for the next seven years to reach $2 billion by 2017. Since Abbott's blood tests won't require any specialized diagnostic equipment other than its already existing i-Stat System, the tests could generate yearly revenues of approximately $200 million by 2017, roughly 10% of the projected TBI therapeutics market size. If a net margin of 12% is applied on the revenue figure, the TBI diagnostic tests could add nearly $24 million to the company's net income, which is nearly 1% of Abbott's trailing 12-month net income of $2.396 billion.ABT Net Income (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsAbbott is trading at a significant discount in terms of EV/Revenue compared to peers, such as Teva Pharmaceutical (NYSE:TEVA), Roche Holding (OTCQX:RHHBY), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Nestle (OTCPK:NSRGY) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). The reason for such discount could be Abbott's predominant reliance on nutritionals, its largest segment. Since nutritionals are nothing but consumer staples, they've limited growth prospects and hence could have a negative impact on the company's valuation.ABT EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsHowever, I expect that going ahead Abbott will be able to expand its growth and margin significantly based on fresh capital deployment in sectors such as vision care and diagnostics. Diagnostics has been delivering high single-digit operational revenue growth for Abbott since the past three years and I believe that TBI diagnostic has the potential to further strengthen the company's diagnostics segment. Abbott is relatively undervalued in terms of EV/EBITDA also, and the stock is expected to rise slowly but steadily over the medium-term.ABT EV to EBITDA (TTM) data by YChartsConclusionSince 15% of people with mild TBI have symptoms that last one year or more, which may not be present or noticed at the time of injury and delayed days or weeks before appearing, I believe that Abbott's blood tests for detecting TBI will have a steady market. The tests could significantly boost Abbott's Point of Care sales."
2464675,67985,2014-09-03T06:00:00-04:00,Management is focused on transforming the company through divestitures and acquisitions to increase revenue growth and profitability in the intermediate and long term.The company is selling its developed markets generic drugs business to focus its generic drugs business on emerging markets.Substantial growth in the company's nutritional products and diagnostics businesses is expected to offset softness in its other businesses.The company will continue to reward shareholders with yearly dividend increases and share buybacks while company initiatives take effect.,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a diversified healthcare products company that is now focused on nutritional products, diagnostics, generic drugs, and medical devices. The company is positioning itself for greater revenue and profit growth in the intermediate and long term through various divestitures and acquisitions. ABT is selling its slow-growth developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business to focus its higher-growth branded generics pharmaceutical business on emerging markets. Substantial growth in the company's nutritional products and diagnostics businesses is expected to offset softness in its other businesses. As ABT's initiatives take hold, the company expects that emerging markets will reach 50 percent of its total sales by 2015. The company currently yields about 2.1 percent, and has a long history of yearly dividend increases. While no stock should be considered a ""safe stock"" without any risk, ABT shares are relatively safe in comparison to many high-profile stocks, and should be strongly considered as a building block of any long-term investor's portfolio.BackgroundAfter the 2013 spin-off of its research-based pharmaceuticals operations (in a new company named AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), ABT's businesses are now: 1) nutritional products (30.8 percent of 2013 sales); 2) diagnostics (20.8 percent), established pharmaceuticals (branded generics) (22.8 percent); medical devices (13.8 percent); and other (11.8 percent). ABT is a market leader in immunoassay and blood screening products, coronary metallic drug-eluting stents, LASIK devices, and pediatric nutritionals (in the U.S.). The company is also the worldwide leader in adult nutritionals. The U.S. accounted for about 28.7 percent of sales in 2013, developed markets outside of the U.S. for 31.3 percent of 2013 sales, and emerging markets for 40 percent. Abbott expects emerging markets to represent 45 to 50 percent of its total sales by 2015.ABT's product divisions are: 1) nutritional products division, including infant formulas sold under the Similac and Isomil names, as well as adult nutritionals, such as Ensure and ProSure for patients with special dietary needs, including cancer and diabetes patients. Emerging markets account for about 45 percent of ABT's nutritional sales.; 2) established pharmaceuticals division, including branded generics that are sold in emerging markets and developed markets. (Branded generics usually have higher margins than conventional generics, especially in emerging markets, as their branded labels have a reputation for quality and reliability over unbranded drugs.); 3) tests and diagnostic systems for blood banks, hospitals, and labs. Products include screening tests for hepatitis, HIV, and other infectious diseases, and for cancer; clinical chemistry systems; diagnostic instruments and chemical reagents; immunoassay test kits; hematology systems and reagents; and pregnancy tests.; 4) coronary and carotid stents, catheters and guide wires, and products used for surgical closure. ABT's Xience drug-eluting stent is the leading product in the domestic drug-eluting stent market.; and 5) other products division, including diabetes care items, such as hand-held glucose monitors for diabetes patients, as well as data management and point-of-care systems, insulin pumps and syringes for diabetics. ABT also sells Glucerna shakes and nutrition bars tailored for diabetics.Second-quarter earningsABT announced diluted earnings per share of $0.54, representing growth of 17.4 percent, and above the company's previous guidance range of $0.50 to $0.52; reported diluted GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.30. Worldwide sales increased 3.0 percent on an operational basis and 1.9 percent on a reported basis, including an unfavorable 1.1 percent effect of foreign exchange. Worldwide sales of $5.6 billion increased 3.0 percent on an operational basis, and the company is on track for sales growth acceleration in the second half of 2014. Sales increased 1.9 percent on a reported basis, including an unfavorable 1.1 percent effect of foreign exchange. International sales, which comprise more than 70 percent of total ABT sales, increased 4.2 percent on an operational basis and 2.7 percent on a reported basis in the second quarter. Sales in emerging markets, which comprise more than 40 percent of total Abbott sales, increased 7.7 percent on an operational basis and 4.1 percent on a reported basis in the second quarter. The CEO of ABT recognized second-quarter earnings as a sequential improvement, with accelerated sales growth expected in the second half of the year, and characterized the company's recent divestitures and acquisitions as follows:ABT raised its full-year 2014 ongoing earnings per share guidance range to $2.19 to $2.29 from $2.16 to $2.26, representing double-digit growth at the mid-point of the range. Projected full-year 2014 EPS from continuing operations under GAAP is $1.16 to $1.26. Guidance for both ongoing and GAAP EPS from continuing operations includes the developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business, which is expected to be reported as discontinued operations starting in the third quarter of 2014.Recent DevelopmentsABT launched several new products in the second quarter. Products launched include an extended range of vision intraocular lens in Europe and a new diabetes test in the U.S. In addition, in its nutritional business, ABT opened two new manufacturing facilities and launched several new products to meet increasing global demand for pediatric and adult nutrition.ABT announced two acquisitions in the quarter in its established pharmaceuticals business. In May 2014, ABT announced an agreement to acquire Latin American pharmaceutical company CFR Pharmaceuticals. This acquisition more than doubles ABT's branded generics presence in Latin America, and establishes ABT among the top 10 pharmaceutical companies in the region. Additionally, in June 2014, Abbott announced an agreement to acquire Veropharm, a leading Russian pharmaceutical company, which would allow ABT to establish a larger footprint and manufacturing presence in Russia.On July 10, 2014, ABT and Fonterra announced a strategic alliance to develop a proposed dairy farm hub in China. The strategic alliance will establish direct ownership and operation of dairies and production of milk in China. This alliance will leverage Fonterra's expertise in dairy nutrition and farming in China and Abbott's continued commitment to business development in China.In July 2014, ABT agreed to sell its developed markets generic drug business to Mylan Labs (MYL) for $5.3 billion, where ABT will receive 21 percent ownership in a new public company. ABT will retain its emerging markets generic drug unit. The unit ABT agreed to sell has sales of $2 billion, with operations in Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Analysts view this transaction positively, as the developed markets unit was growing slower than the emerging markets unit. This transaction is expected to positively impact ABT's 2015 sales and earnings per share growth rates as the company focuses its branded generics pharmaceuticals business on emerging markets. ABT indicated its plans to divest its ownership interest in MYL when appropriate.Competitors and risksMajor competitors of ABT include Medtronic, Inc. (NYSE:MDT), Baxter International, Inc. (NYSE:BAX), Covidien PLC, Stryker Corp. (NYSE:SYK) Becton, Dickinson (NYSE:BDX), St. Jude Medical, Inc. (NYSE:STJ), Zimmer Holdings, Inc. (ZMH), Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG), and Boston Scientific Corp. (NYSE:BSX). The healthcare equipment and supplies industry consists of two principle segments: 1) the first segment supplies healthcare equipment to hospitals and patients in outpatient care; and 2) the second segment focuses on the development of new and more technologically advanced medical equipment to improve the efficiency and accuracy of patient care.There are two reasons why this industry has and will continue to perform well. First, the demographic factor of the increasing age of the population drives growth. The average life span is increasing, and people are also remaining much more active later in life than in the past. This has expanded demand for the industry's products, ranging from medical devices for serious conditions that typically affect the older population (such as pacemakers and stents) to devices and surgeries that help improve the quality of life (such as joint replacements and laser eye surgery). Second, the growing demand from patients and doctors for improved technology and better healthcare equipment also drives growth. A concern for this industry, however, is the potential for federal budget cutbacks that would negatively affect companies receiving federal funding. The Affordable Care Act adding more patients covered by health insurance could increase the customer base for this industry.Analysts' views and our viewsAnalysts believe ABT is well-positioned within the global healthcare markets, particularly in emerging markets. Analysts also expect substantial growth in the company's nutritional products and diagnostics businesses to offset softness in its established pharmaceuticals and medical devices businesses. Analysts are positive on ABT's decision to sell its developed markets established pharmaceuticals unit, which is expected to experience slow growth. ABT's strategic acquisition of CFR and Veropharm also give the company a strong position to benefit from growing demand in emerging markets. In addition, ABT initiated efforts to improve productivity and efficiency to enhance growth. The medical devices group, helped by acquisitions, is expected to return to growth later in 2014. In January 2014, ABT announced a $2 billion stock repurchase program. Analysts' ratings are mixed between ""buy"" and ""hold"" with price targets ranging from $35 to $52, with a consensus price target of $45.50.We generally agree with analysts' conclusions regarding ABT's shares. The current price-to-earnings ratio for ABT shares is about 27.9, and the shares yield about 2.1 percent. In addition, the company has a long history of raising its dividends, in addition to its share buyback activity. ABT's forward price-to-earnings ratio is about 19.10 based on 2014 earnings estimates of $2.23, and about 17.25 based on 2015 earnings estimates of $2.47. That said, with overall markets at or near record highs, an investor should wait for ABT's share price to pull back to a range of about $37.00 to $40.00 to establish a full position. (A forward price-to-earnings ratio in the range of about to 15.00 to 16.20 based on fiscal year 2015 estimates). Even though ABT is currently in transition, the company is a profitable research, development and marketing company that will reward investors even if they purchase the shares at the current price for a long-term position. Finally, we should note that ABT's shares have seen extensive insider selling in recent years, with one purchase at about $34 a share in 2013."
2583795,63883,2014-10-22T11:50:49-04:00,"Abbott Laboratories now generates more than 50% of revenue in emerging markets.The company has positioned its pharmaceutical segment exclusively in the developing world with recent divestitures and acquisitions.Abbott Laboratories has a 2% yield, fairly low payout ratio, and strong growth prospects ahead.","Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a large cap ($64 billion market cap) diversified health care provider. The company has paid increasing dividend payments for 42 consecutive years. As a result, the company is a member of the exclusive Dividend Aristocrats Index, which includes 54 businesses that have 25+ years of increasing dividend payments and meet certain size and liquidity requirements. The company operates in 4 segments and has generated 69% of revenue in international markets through the first 3 quarters of 2014. The four segments are broken down below by percentage of total revenue each contributes to the overall business:Q3 EarningsAbbott Laboratories realized EPS of $0.62 in the 3rd quarter of 2014, a 12.7% increase over the 3rd quarter of 2013. The company also beat its 3rd quarter EPS guidance of between $0.59 and $0.61 EPS. In addition to strong double digit EPS growth, the company raised its full year EPS outlook from between $2.19 and $2.29 to between $2.25 and $2.27, an increase of about 1% at the median.Total sales increased 6.7% for the company, with emerging market sales up 15%. Abbott Laboratories now generates over 50% of sales in emerging markets. Emerging market sales are growing significantly more rapidly than developed market sales; emerging markets are propelling the company's growth. Each of Abbott Laboratories' four business segments' results for the 3rd quarter will be examined below.NutritionThe nutrition segment sells nutrition products under the Ensure, Pedialyte, Similac, Zone Perfect, and Elecare brands, among others. Nutrition revenue grew 10.1% on a constant currency basis for Abbott Laboratories in the 3rd quarter of 2014 compared to the 3rd quarter of 2013.The company's nutrition segment growth benefited from the launch of infant formula brands Eleva and Similac QINITI in China. The company opened a new nutrition manufacturing plant in India this quarter to meet growing demand for its products in Asian developing economies.DiagnosticsAbbott Laboratories diagnostics segment sells in vitro diagnostic equipment, as well as other instruments and tests, to blood banks and laboratories throughout the world. The segment increased revenue 6.2% on an operational basis for the 3rd quarter of 2014 as compared to the 3rd quarter of 2013.The company saw US revenue grow just 1.8% in the segment, while international revenue grew 8% on an operational basis. Like the nutrition segment, diagnostic revenue growth is being driven by growing sales in emerging markets.Established PharmaceuticalsOn July 14th, Abbott Laboratories announced it would sell its pharmaceutical business in developed markets to Mylan (MYL) for $5.3 billion. The business generated about $2 billion in sales, for a price to sales multiple of 2.65. The move better gives Abbott Laboratories additional cash to invest in emerging market growth. In addition, it positions the company to focus exclusively on quickly growing emerging markets rather than on slower growing developed markets in its pharmaceutical segment. The company is targeting a high single digit or low double digit growth rate for emerging market pharmaceuticals.Third quarter 2014 results were very strong for the established pharmaceuticals division. Abbott Laboratories exceeded its goals and grew operational revenue 12.9% for the quarter over quarter period in the quickly growing developing market pharmaceutical industry.On September 26th, 2014 Abbott Laboratories completed the acquisition of Latin American based CFR Pharmaceuticals. The acquisition more than doubled the company's presence in Latin America. Abbott Laboratories paid an estimated $3.3 billion for CFR Pharmaceuticals, including assumption of the company's debt. In essence, Abbott Laboratories has shed its slower growing developed market pharmaceuticals business for an increased presence in Latin America and about $2 billion in cash. The moves better position the company for future growth.Medical DevicesThe company's medical devices segment sells vascular, diabetes care, and medical optics products to health care providers. The medical devices segment performed poorly in the 3rd quarter of 2014 for Abbott Laboratories. Medical device segment operational revenue decreased 0.6%, a stark contrast to the company's other divisions.The company's medical devices division saw sales decline due to negative growth in the US. The company's US sales for vascular products declined 6.7%, while diabetes care sales declined 16.7% in the US. Diabetes care sales declined precipitously due to changes in the centers for Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement policy.Future Growth & Shareholder ReturnAbbott Laboratories' future growth prospects look very bright. The company is benefiting from rising health care spending around the world, as well as growing GDP in emerging markets. Abbott Laboratories is positioned well to take advantage of emerging market growth; 50% of sales now come from emerging markets. The company's sale of its developed market pharmaceutical division and the acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals in Latin America shows the company is committed to further international growth while reducing exposure to slower growing developed markets.The company experienced double digit growth this quarter, and will likely continue to grow EPS in the high single digits or low double digits for several years due to emerging market growth and rising health care spending. Shareholders should expect a double digit CAGR growth of 10% to 14% from EPS growth (8% to 12%) and dividends (2%).Abbott Laboratories is a Top 10 stock based on the 8 Rules of Dividend Investing due to its 2% dividend yield, fairly low 40% payout ratio, strong growth prospects, and low price standard deviation of just 20%. The company makes a solid investment for investors seeking future income growth and capital gains and exposure to the emerging market health care sector."
2325215,24491,2014-07-21T02:56:37-04:00,The economics of every transaction should be evaluated to see if creates economic value.We think Abbott's deal with Mylan is one such transaction that will be value-creative for shareholders.Let's take a look at how we're thinking about the deal in this article.,"Abbott (NYSE:ABT) has a track record that is unrivaled. The firm is more than 125 years old and remains aligned with favorable long-term healthcare trends in both developed and developing markets. We believe Abbott's nutritionals segment is one of the most attractive businesses in all of the healthcare space, boasting such brand names as EAS, Myoplex, and ZonePerfect. Let's take a look at the firm's second-quarter results, which it reported Wednesday.Abbott's sales in the quarter advanced 3% on an operational basis, while ongoing diluted earnings per share came in at $0.54, representing expansion of more than 17%. The bottom-line figure also came in above its previous guidance range of $0.50-$0.52 per share. The strong results prompted Abbott to raise its full-year 2014 ongoing earnings per share guidance to $2.19-$2.29 (was $2.16-$2.26). We note that this represents a double-digit pace of expansion at the mid-point of the range. Fundamentals continue to move in the right direction at the healthcare giant.The biggest news recently is that Abbott will sell its non-US developed markets branded generics pharma business to Mylan (MYL). In return, Abbott will receive ~21% equity ownership in a newly-created, publicly-traded entity that combines Mylan with its divested operations ('new Mylan'). The ~$5.3 billion transaction (based on Mylan's closing price on July 11) is expected to close in the first quarter of 2015. The deal will provide diversity to Mylan's operations, add $600 million of annual post-close EBITDA, and offer an optimized global tax structure. Adjusted diluted earnings-per-share accretion of ~$0.25 is anticipated in year one at Mylan, and the firm expects to deliver in excess of $200 million in pre-tax operational efficiencies by the end of year three post-close.Though Abbott's ongoing earnings-per-share will be $0.22 lower in 2015 as a result of the divestiture, the firm expects the move to positively impact its annual pace of sales and net income expansion by 100 basis points and 200 basis points, respectively, on a go-forward basis. The deal will also free up the executive suite to focus more on its branded generics pharmaceutical business in emerging markets. In the second quarter, for example, Abbott purchased CFR Pharmaceuticals, which will more than double its branded generics presence in Latin America.We expect the transaction to eventually be value-creative for Abbott shareholders. This, of course, is contingent on Abbott's ~21% stake in the 'new Mylan' eventually being liquidated at a price greater than $5.5 billion--or the market value of the $0.22 earnings stream Abbott will lose beginning in 2015 (1.5 billion shares outstanding x $0.22 per share in 2015 x 16.8 forward price-to-earnings multiple). The incremental value of Abbott's share of pre-tax deal synergies, ~$420 million [(~$200 million / ~10%) x ~21% stake], coupled with its ~21% stake in Mylan (~$5.3 billion) should make this deal a good one for Abbott, however.Valuentum's TakeJune 2014 marked Abbott's 362nd consecutive dividend, dating back to 1924. For investors looking for income stability and strong potential for dividend growth, Abbott is certainly a worthy candidate. The eventual proceeds from liquidating its Mylan position will only serve to bolster the cash that can be delivered to shareholders over time. Abbott does not intend to be a long-term shareholder in Mylan. We don't hold Abbott in the Dividend Growth portfolio (we can't hold every great dividend growth stock), but we certainly like the company. The firm remains on our watch list of dividend growth candidates.

2383485,67815,2014-08-05T14:49:36-04:00,"We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of Abbott Labs in this article.Financial gearing, yield, valuation and growth potential are in focus.We also compare Abbott Labs to a sub industry peer to get a picture of its relative valuation.","In this article, we are focusing on the strengths and weaknesses of Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) and comparing it to Becton Dickinson (NYSE:BDX). We're comparing it to Becton Dickinson because the two companies not only sit within the same GICS sector of health care, but also within the same GICS sub industry of health care equipment and services.Sure, the two companies are of totally different sizes, with Abbott Labs having a market cap of $63 billion and Becton Dickinson's market cap being a comparably small $22 billion. However, we realize that many investors apportion capital based on sectors and sub industries, so we feel a comparison of the two could be useful and interesting, as we aim to find out whether Abbott Labs offers good value based on its recent performance and future potential.FinancingA key starting point for us is how a company is financed. Indeed, we think this is more important than ever in the health care space right now due to the vast number of acquisitions that are taking place. We feel that there are a relatively large number of opportunities for M&A activity on offer within the sector, so we're pleased to see that Abbott Labs runs a very disciplined capital structure. It has low levels of debt, as evidenced by its debt to equity ratio of just 26.1%, which means that it has considerable scope with which to make future acquisitions.Becton Dickinson, although having the capacity to do likewise, has a debt to equity ratio of 78.7%. This means that it perhaps does not have the financial flexibility to make acquisitions to the same extent as Abbott Labs does. However, the flip side is that it makes Becton Dickinson more profitable based on the return on equity measure. Indeed, while Abbott Labs' low financial gearing works against it, with it having a return on equity figure of 10.2%, Becton Dickinson's use of debt means it delivers more bang for equity holders' bucks due to its return on equity being much higher at 25.6%. Although far lower than Becton Dickinson's figure, we feel that Abbott Labs is highly profitable given its relatively conservative stance on financing.Yields and growth prospectsIt's tough to find high yielding stocks right now, so while Abbott Labs' yield of 2.2% may not sound much, it's higher than the S&P 500's yield of 1.9%. Becton Dickinson's yield of 1.8% is slightly disappointing, although both it and Abbott Labs have considerable potential to increase dividends per share, since their payout ratios are only 42% (Abbott Labs) and 43% (Becton Dickinson). Moving forward, we feel that both companies could be solid income plays, but Abbott Labs is clearly the preferred choice for income seeking investors, given its higher current yield.Meanwhile, the same is true of growth prospects for the two stocks. Abbott Labs pips Becton Dickinson, with its EPS forecast to grow by a highly impressive 10.8% next year, while Becton Dickinson is slightly behind at 9.3%. Both numbers, though, are strong and show there is considerable potential within the health care equipment and services sub industry.ValuationAlthough the two companies trade on forward P/Es that are identical (17.1), Abbott Labs' higher EPS growth rate over the medium term means that it appears to be more attractive based on the PEG ratio. Indeed, it has a PEG of 1.8, versus a PEG of 2.1 for Becton Dickinson, which is a 14.3% discount to its sub industry peer. We also feel that evidence of Abbott Labs' better value can be seen in its yield, with both companies having near-identical payout ratios, Abbott Labs has the higher yield. This indicates better value and, as such, we believe that Abbott Labs could outperform Becton Dickinson going forward.ConclusionWe're impressed with the low-risk balance sheet of Abbott Labs and, although its profitability numbers aren't as impressive as those of Becton Dickinson, we think it has more potential to pursue M&A activity and that this could be an important future play when it comes to future profitability. In addition, the deal to offload the generics drug business to Mylan for $5.3 billion provides even more scope for acquisitions in future.Furthermore, Abbott Labs has a higher yield and higher growth rate than Becton Dickinson. It also has a lower PEG ratio, which we feel indicates that it offers better value for money than its sub industry peer. As a result, we think that Abbott Labs could outperform Becton Dickinson going forward, as the market reacts to what appears to be a potential mispricing through bidding up the price of Abbott Labs' shares.Please follow Team Money Research for all our latest updates - it would be great to hear your views!Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Our analysis focuses on the company’s performance for the same quarterly period on a year-on-year basis (unless stated otherwise).HighlightsThe table below shows the preliminary results and recent trends for key metrics such as revenues and net income (See complete table at the end of this report):Revenue Growth Versus Earnings GrowthCompanies sometimes focus on growing their top-line (Sales or Revenues) more than their bottom-line i.e. Earnings or Net Income. Investors should look at revenue growth to understand a company’s ability to grow its market share, and earnings growth to look at the company’s ability to generate returns. Comparing revenue growth to earnings growth helps understand a couple of items: (1) A company’s focus on gaining market share vs. generating profits and (2) How additive or dilutive the revenue performance has been to earnings.ABT-US’s year-on-year change in top line compared to the same period last year of -4.94% is better than its change in earnings which was -43.07% – suggesting perhaps that the company’s focus is on the top-line at the expense of bottom-line earnings. But more critically, this top-line performance is among the lowest thus far in its sector – inviting the potential of loss in market share as well this period. Also, for comparison purposes, revenues changed by -8.05% and earnings by -4.35% compared to the immediate last quarter.Earnings Growth AnalysisThe company’s year-on-year decline in earnings has been influenced by the following factors: (1) Decline in gross margins from 58.98% to 54.33% and (2) issues with cost controls. As a result, operating margins (EBITDA margins) went from 20.02% to 14.32% in this period. For comparison, gross margins were 59.11% and EBITDA margins 21.78% in the immediate last quarter.Gross Margin TrendCompanies sometimes tradeoff for improvements in revenues and margins by extending friendlier terms to customers and vendors. One quick way to check against such activity is to compare the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital. If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital, it is quite possible that the company’s performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply a prop up using the balance sheet.The company’s decline in gross margins is compounded by issues on the balance sheet side – there has been deterioration in working capital levels. The company’s working capital days have gone up to 149.85 from 146.85 for the same period last year.Unusual ItemsThe company’s earnings decline is largely a result of non-operational activity. Matter of fact the company showed increases in EBIT and pretax margins – EBIT margins went from 11.89% to 14.32% and pretax margins improved from 11.70% to 14.07%.EPS Growth Versus Earnings GrowthABT-US’s year-on-year change in Earnings per Share (NYSEARCA:EPS) of -40.98% is better than its change in earnings of -43.07%. In addition, this change in earnings is less than the peer average among the declared results thus far in its peer group suggesting that the company is losing ground in generating profits in this group.Supporting DataThe table below shows the preliminary results along with the recent trend for revenues, net income and other relevant metrics:Company ProfileAbbott Laboratories engages in the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad and diversified line of health care products. The company operates through four reportable segments: Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products and Vascular Products.

The whisper number is $0.52, one cent ahead of the analysts' estimate and showing limited confidence from investors. Abbott has a 49% positive surprise history (having topped the whisper in 19 of the 39 earnings reports for which we have data).Earnings history:- Beat whisper: 19 qtrs- Met whisper: 4 qtrs- Missed whisper: 16 qtrsOur primary focus is on post earnings price movement. Knowing how likely a stock's price will move following an earnings report can help you determine the best action to take (long or short). In other words, we analyze what happens when the company beats or misses the whisper number expectation.The table below indicates the average post earnings price movement within a one and thirty trading day timeframe:The strongest price movement of -1.2% comes within ten trading days when the company reports earnings that beat the whisper number, and -0.5% within five trading days when the company reports earnings that miss the whisper number. The overall average price move is 'negative' (beat the whisper number and see weakness, miss and see weakness) when the company reports earnings.The table below indicates the most recent earnings reports and short-term price reaction:The company has reported earnings ahead of the whisper number in three of the past four quarters with a whisper number. In the comparable quarter last year the company reported earnings one cent ahead of the whisper number. Following that report the stock realized a 0.2% loss in five trading days. Last quarter the company reported earnings four cents ahead of the whisper number. Following that report the stock realized a 2.0% loss in ten trading days, before turning and seeing a 2.0% gain in thirty trading days.

2319135,44001,2014-07-17T00:06:00-04:00,"Revenues increased, but net earnings decreased before consideration of one-offs.The current dividend is $0.22/share for a yield of 2.2%; payable August 15th to shareholders of record at the close of business on the 15th of July.All revenue segments helped contribute on a yearly and quarterly basis.","The last time I wrote about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) I stated:""Like I said, I will only be buying a small batch this time around, only for the dividend. I think the entire market has shot up far too fast in too short of a time."" Since that article was published the stock is down 2.01% while the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) is down 0.19% in the same timeframe. It's safe to say that I saved some heartache by not putting on a full position back then. Abbott is engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a portfolio of science-based healthcare products, which operates in four segments: Diagnostics, Medical Devices, Nutritionals and Generic Pharmaceuticals.The company reported earnings before the market opened on 16Jul14 and on the surface the results were excellent with the company reporting earnings of $0.54 per share (beating estimates by $0.03) on revenue of $5.55 billion (beating estimates by $30 million). The stock decreased 0.29% the day it reported earnings and what I'd like to do at this time is delve into the weeds and pick out some highlights from different portions of the report to see if the stock is worth buying at the present time.Segment RevenueBecause the company beat on revenues, I want to see which segments were the main contributors. Fortunately, Abbott is so diversified that all of its segments contribute about the same to the company. On a year-over-year basis, I only really see noise and no real dramatic impact on revenues, and the same goes with the quarterly basis.Income StatementThe first line item I noticed on the income statement is that amortization of intangible assets have decreased 18% from the prior year. The next line item I noticed was that total operating earnings increased 21% from last year thanks in large part to increased revenues.Net interest expenses decreased 13%, or $3 million, while net foreign exchange decreased by 91%, or $10 million. After factoring in a 138% drop in other income, or $11 million, the company earned 23% more from last year on earnings from continuing operations before taxes. Taxes however increased 122% to $277 million which made earnings from continued operations after taxes drop 3% from the prior year. The increase in taxes from last year was due to a tax expense in relation to a one-time repatriation of 2014 ex-US earnings, which was classified as a specified item.Net earnings decreased 2% from last year after all of this, but when we add net earnings excluding specified items we get a 15% increase and the 4% share reduction helped increase earnings per share by 19% from last year. The net earnings excluded an after-tax charge of $369 million for intangible amortization expenses, expenses related to cost reduction initiatives, and current quarter tax expenses associated with the repatriation of earnings.ConclusionThe company reported earnings, which were 19% higher than a year before on slightly higher revenue, while the share price was up 6.96% since the first quarter earnings announcement. I don't believe the company needed to reduce the outstanding shares during the quarter because I always felt it was close to fairly valued, but it is what it is. I definitely like that revenue increased from last year, but I don't like that earnings were down before considering the excluded items. Something which concerns me is that R&D spending has decreased from last year and last quarter. When a company is cutting costs, like what Abbott is doing, I don't like to see it being taken from R&D.Other bright spots of the report include gross profit increasing to $3,045 (or 5% from last year) thanks in large part to a decrease in cost of goods sold, which in turn helped gross margins increase by 3%. The company also did announce that it was going to increase 2014 earnings guidance to a range of $2.19 to $2.29 from a previous range of $2.16 to $2.26. You would think that since the company beat on the top and bottom lines, and increased earnings guidance that the stock would be flying high on a day that the S&P 500 jump 0.42%, right? Wrong, it dropped 0.29% and makes me continue to only buy the stock on a cautious basis.Disclaimer: This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future.

2284513,25120,2014-06-24T15:49:25-04:00,"Abbott Laboratories announces the second deal in as many months.This should boost growth and improve its growth profile as it expands even more into emerging markets.Despite the improved growth appeal, diversification and strong financial position, I am cautious given the quality of adjusted earnings.","Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) managed to close a modest deal on Monday by acquiring Veropharm, a Russian pharmaceutical producer. The deal marks the second acquisition of the company in as many months, as the company aims to boost growth and its growth profile, thereby further expanding its presence in emerging markets.The strong balance sheet, improved growth profile and diversification are key attractions. The valuation, driven by the huge gap between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings, is holding me off making an investment at current level. I am a buyer on more pronounced drops.The Deal HighlightsAbbott Laboratories has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Company Garden Hills, a holding company which owns a controlling interest in Veropharm.The company will pay anything between $395 and $495 million, depending on the ownership stake of Company Garden Hills in Veropharm at the time of closing of the deal. Currently, Garden Hills holds an 80% stake in the company, which is anticipated to increase towards 95% at the time of the expected closure of the deal.Abbott will furthermore assume net debt of $136 million, putting the total deal tag at $530 to $630 million. Closure of the deal is anticipated to occur in the fourth quarter of this year.Strategic And Financial RationaleAbbott will increase its presence in Russia after operating in the country for nearly 40 years. With the deal, Abbott will obtain a portfolio of medicines which focus on women's health, the central nervous systems, cardiovascular diseases and gastroenterology.Currently, Veropharm is in the process of building a new manufacturing facility, which can be used by Abbott's Russian activities as well. The company produces over a 100 pharmaceutical products at three plants, while employing a total of 2,000 workers.The deal will add about $150 million in annual revenues, valuing the deal at roughly 4 times annual sales at the midpoint of the reported deal tag.Russia's pharmaceutical sector is expected to see growth given the growing middle class, in combination with the aging population. The deal fits within the company's strategy to focus on generic business in about 15 emerging markets.ValuationBack in April, Abbott released its first-quarter results. The company holds $7.05 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments, while operating with $7.25 billion in debt. This results in quite some liquidity, of course, and a negligible net debt position.The company posted a 2.5% drop in first-quarter sales to $5.24 billion. Lower sales and increased costs triggered a 31% drop in earnings, which fell to $375 million. Note that earnings in the year before have been ""inflated"" on the back of very low effective tax rates. The company has posted trailing revenues of $21.7 billion and earnings of $2.4 billion.For the current year, Abbott guides for adjusted earnings of $2.16 to $2.26 per share. The company has, however, already identified amortization and cost reduction initiatives, which result in total expenditures of $1.03 per share.Trading around $41 per share, equity in Abbott is valued at roughly $61 billion. This values equity in the business at 2.8 times annual sales and 25 times trailing earnings. The company trades at roughly 18-19 times adjusted earnings for this year, which, on a GAAP basis, will be roughly cut in half.The quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share provides investors with a 2.2% dividend yield.Some BackgroundThe deal seems remarkable given the increased tensions, to put it mildly, between Russia and the US. That being said, Abbott is definitely not putting all of its eggs in one basket, with Veropharm adding just 0.7% in annual revenues.Yet, Abbott is on an acquisition path, after it already announced a sizable deal last month.For $3.3 billion, it acquired CFR Pharmaceuticals, a Latin American pharmaceutical company. The deal adds $900 million in anticipated revenues, while the company is anticipated to grow at double-digit rates in the coming years. The deal has no real impact on 2014's earnings, although accretion is expected in 2015. The deal with CFR is much more substantial, adding about 4.1% in annual revenues.With this deal and the smaller deal of Veropharm, the company is increasing its exposure to emerging markets even more. Following quicker growth in emerging and developing markets, it would not be unthinkable to see Abbott generate half of its revenues from these markets by 2016.The increase in deal activity follows the split from AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), which became effective in January of 2013. The company has focused the most of last year on its own operations, but under command of CEO Miles White, is now entering the M&A market.Takeaway For InvestorsFollowing the split of AbbVie and Abbott about one and a half year ago, shares of Abbott have seen solid returns, increasing from roughly $32 to $41 at the moment.The company has a solid balance sheet and great product, as well as geographic diversification. The company has operations in 150 countries, and actually derives 40% of its sales from emerging countries. About 30% of revenues are generated in the US, with a similar percentage of revenues derived from the activities in the rest of the world. As mentioned earlier, the increased focus and recent deal-making might push the revenue percentage of emerging countries towards 50%.In terms of products sales, Abbott has solid diversification as well. The company generates 30% of sales in nutritionals, a quarter in medical devices, and slightly lower percentages in established pharmaceuticals and diagnostics.Despite the excellent diversification and exposure to emerging markets, Abbott reported a 2.5% drop in first-quarter revenues. In all fairness, adverse currency movement shaved off 3% in reported revenues. Even then, growth is anything but impressive, especially given the huge exposure to ""growing"" emerging markets.With the latest two deals, Abbott will, however, add more than a billion in sales, thereby increasing revenues by 4%-5% next year. The deals furthermore improve the growth profile a lot, thereby boosting appeal to investors. The guidance of double-digit growth for CFR alone should boost overall revenue growth by 0.5% per annum on top of the one-time jump in reported revenues.The improved growth profile, solid balance sheet and diversified operations are key attractions for Abbott. The valuation is a bit demanding given the gap between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings. While I don't mind an occasional amortization charge hitting GAAP earnings, I am less tolerant to structural discrepancies between both metrics, especially if it is explained by stock-based compensation.I like a little bigger margin of safety before jumping on the bandwagon. As such, I don't think that shares offer compelling value for me at current levels.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2299905,44001,2014-07-05T02:24:55-04:00,"In the past couple of months, the company has bought a Chilean and Russian pharmaceutical company.The stock is fairly valued on 2015 earnings estimates but is expensive on earnings growth expectations.The dividend payout ratio is a bit high right now with respect to earnings.","The last time I wrote about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) I stated, ""Due to the bearish technicals, falling financial efficiency ratios, and reduced 2015 earnings estimates, I will not be adding to my position right here."" Since writing the article, the stock has increased 6.75% versus the 6.12% gain the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) posted. Abbott is engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a portfolio of science-based healthcare products, which operates in four segments: Diagnostics, Medical Devices, Nutritionals and Generic Pharmaceuticals.On April 16, 2014, the company reported first quarter earnings of $0.41 per share, which beat the consensus of analysts' estimates by $0.05. In the past year, the company's stock is up 20.1% excluding dividends (up 22.05% including dividends) and is losing to the S&P 500, which has gained 23.6% in the same time frame. Since initiating my position back on May 28, 2013, I'm up 15.07% inclusive of reinvested dividends and dollar cost averaging. With all this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to evaluate the stock on a fundamental, financial and technical basis to see if right now is a good time to purchase more of the stock for my dividend portfolio.FundamentalsThe company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 30.14, which is expensively priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 16.91 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. The 1-year PEG ratio (2.38), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is expensively priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 12.69%. The company has great near-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 12.69%. In addition, the company has great long-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 11.86%. Below is a comparison table of the fundamental metrics for the company when I wrote all articles pertaining to the company.FinancialsOn a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. The company pays a dividend of 2.1% with a payout ratio of 63% of trailing 12-month earnings while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 6.9%, 12.5% and 8%, respectively, which are all respectable values. Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I don't believe the 2.1% yield of this company alone is good enough for me to take shelter in for the time being. Below is a comparison table of the financial metrics for the company for when I wrote all articles pertaining to the company.TechnicalsLooking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock in overbought territory with a current value of 72.79. I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next. I see that the black line is above the red line with the divergence bars increasing in height, indicating bullish momentum. As for the stock price itself ($41.89), I'm looking at $42.31 to act as resistance, and $41.60 to act as support for a risk/reward ratio, which plays out to be -0.69% to 1%.Global ExplorationThe company has been on a global hunt for acquisitions of late, first acquiring Chilean generics drug maker CFR Pharma back in May for $2.9 billion and now acquiring Russian pharmaceutical manufacturer Veropharm for a value between $395 million to $495 million. In actuality, Abbott is purchasing Garden Hills, a limited liability company that owns a controlling interest in Veropharm. The purchase will be taken from cash on the balance sheet and is expected to close some time during the fourth quarter of 2014. Veropharm's product portfolio consists of women's health, central nervous system, cardiovascular, gastroenterology, and oncology products.Abbott is a company which makes about three quarters of its revenue outside of the United States. The company obviously sees that the world population is growing and making more money, therefore people are moving into the middle class and need health attention. I applaud the company for not sitting on their laurels but choosing to make things happen. I must admit, I've been debating for quite some time whether to sell out of Abbott or Covidien (COV) from the healthcare portion of my dividend portfolio, but the decision was made very easily for me by Medtronic a couple of weeks ago. I'll be holding on to this healthcare conglomerate for a while longer now.ConclusionThe company recently declared a $0.22 per share quarterly dividend with an ex-date of 11Jul14 and pay date of 15Aug14 for a forward yield of 2.21% and is the main reason why I will be buying a smaller batch than usual next week. Fundamentally, I believe the stock to be fairly valued on next year's earnings estimates but expensive on growth expectations while next year's earnings estimates have started to increase again. In addition, the company has great near- and long-term earnings growth potential. Financially, the dividend is a bit small and the payout ratio is a bit high with respect to earnings. On a technical basis the risk/reward ratio is about equal, but I think it will continue to move up before it moves down. Like I said, I will only be buying a small batch this time around, only for the dividend. I think the entire market has shot up far too fast in too short of a time.Disclaimer: This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future.

2262953,56732,2014-06-11T05:35:20-04:00,Abbott Labs is seriously contemplating selling off a portion of its senior drugs that generate roughly $2 billion in annual sales.The company has recently announced an agreement to acquire CFR Pharmaceuticals located in Latin America.The acquisition would not only complement the existing businesses of Abbott but would also enhance the company’s geographical presence.,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a global healthcare company that generates revenue through four operating segments: pharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition. The company has devoted its efforts to the discovery, development, manufacturing, and marketing of health related products. The following discussion highlights the company's efforts to strengthen its top and bottom lines in the future, strengthen its existing businesses, and increase its geographic presence.Revenue DistributionGeographically, the company extracts approximately 60% of its revenues from developed markets while the remaining percentage is drawn from the developing markets. Distribution of the aggregate top line of the company among its four operating or functional segments is graphically represented in the following chart.Source: Annual Report, 2013Financial StandingOver the first quarter of FY2014 the company saw weakness in its top line and that caused a decrease of 2.5% due to currency translations. Although the company's profit margins are high they are following a decelerating trend while sales have been on a decline in the US. Weakness was also seen in the company's established pharmaceuticals segment which saw a decline in revenue of 3% YoY last year. According to recent news, the company is seriously contemplating selling off a portion of its senior drugs that generate roughly $2 billion in annual sales. Coupled with this sell off is the hyped acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals whose impact will be discussed in the next section of this article.Upon further digging, we see that Abbott's ROE is almost 55% lower than that of the industry with Abbott's ROE trending at 9.47 while the industry's looms around 20.88. DuPont Analysis reveals that although the company generates better than industry net profit margin and a lower share of its assets are being financed through debt the company is extremely inefficient in deploying its assets. A comparison of the company and industry is shown in terms of DuPont breakdown below.Source: ReutersThe asset turnover ratio of the company falls short of the industry average by 55% which is reflected in the ROE figure of the company. Asset efficiency is one arena where Abbott presently lags behind its peers; however, the company is taking steps to bring forth improvement in this regard.Abbott Acquires CFR PharmaceuticalsAbbott Labs is making investments in high growth markets to enhance its competitive position and better utilize its assets. That being said, the company has recently announced it would acquire CFR Pharmaceuticals located in Latin America. The acquisition is intended to up the revenue chunk and market share of the company in the domestic market. In fact, CFR's addition to the company's asset base would put Abbott amongst the top ten pharmaceuticals in Latin America.The acquisition is expected to be highly beneficial for Abbott as it would add roughly $900 million to the top line of the company upon its first full year of sales (FY2015); however, the impact would be negligible on FY2014 earnings. The top line enhancement translates into an additional per share earnings of $0.07.CFR's acquisition is expected to be concluded towards the end of the present year and would strengthen various units of the company, namely the women's health, central nervous system, respiratory, and cardiovascular units.Note that CFR itself distributes its products in 15 countries. This means that the acquisition would not only complement the existing businesses of Abbott but would also enhance the company's geographical presence. The Latin American pharmaceutical market is estimated to reach $73 billion by the end of the present year and is projected to grow at a rate of 14% through 2018 to $124 billion as forecasted by IMS. CFR's sales are expected to grow tremendously across the emerging markets which are key growth areas for Abbott. CFR's Cardio pharmaceutical unit realized a growth rate of 26% in sales driven by Central America, Peru, Chile, and Columbia whereas Neumobiotic sales marked approximately 29% growth across Chile, Peru, Columbia, Paraguay, and Bolivia. The CFR acquisition would also allow Abbott to enter the Asian market and establish its foothold there.Shareholders' ReturnsAbbott Labs' dividend yield of 2.23 is superior to the industry average of 1.66. The company distributes as much as 45% of its profits among its investors in the form of cash dividends. Take a look at the following chart to see the dividend yield and the declining trend of outstanding shares.Source: YchartsMoreover, Abbott's total shareholder returns continue to trend higher than the S&P 500's returns over the years.Source: Company PresentationConclusionIn my opinion, the company is a strong buy. CFR Pharmaceuticals would greatly enhance the company's geographical presence and would indeed be a great add-on to the top and bottom line performance of the company. Investors would not only profit from the price appreciation in the following years but the company's own policy to reward investors is quite enticing as well.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

After the writing the article, the stock increased 2.87% versus the 1.88% gain the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) posted. Abbott is engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a portfolio of science-based healthcare products, which operates in four segments: Diagnostics, Medical Devices, Nutritionals and Generic Pharmaceuticals.On April 16, 2014, the company reported first quarter earnings of $0.41 per share, which beat the consensus of analysts' estimates by $0.05. In the past year, the company's stock is up 7.99% excluding dividends (up 9.94% including dividends) and is losing to the S&P 500, which has gained 14.94% in the same timeframe. With all this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to evaluate the stock on a fundamental, financial and technical basis to see if it's worth buying more shares of the company right now for the healthcare sector of my dividend portfolio.FundamentalsThe company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 28.1, which is fairly priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 15.87 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. The 1-year PEG ratio (2.35), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is expensively priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 11.96%. The company has great near-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 11.96%. In addition, the company has great long-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 11.51%. Below is a comparison table of the fundamental metrics for the company for when I wrote all articles pertaining to the company.FinancialsOn a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. The company pays a dividend of 2.25% with a payout ratio of 63% of trailing 12-month earnings while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 6.9%, 12.5% and 8%, respectively, which are all respectable values. Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I don't believe the 2.25% yield of this company is good enough for me to take shelter in for the time being. Below is a comparison table of the financial metrics for when I wrote all articles pertaining to the company.TechnicalsLooking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock muddling in middle-ground territory with a current value of 54.11 and downward trajectory. I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next. I see that the black line is above the red line with the divergence bars decreasing in height, indicating bearish momentum. As for the stock price itself ($39.06), I'm looking at $39.79 to act as resistance and the 20-day simple moving average (currently $38.81) to act as support for a risk/reward ratio, which plays out to be -0.64% to 1.87%.Recent NewsConclusionAbbott has a pretty decent dividend here if you're a bit scared of the market volatility going on right now. Fundamentally, this company is fairly valued on next year's earnings estimates but expensive on earnings growth potential, while short and long-term earnings growth expectations are excellent. However, earnings estimates for 2015 have been reduced by a penny from last month. Financially, this is a low yielding dividend company that is well supported, but the financial efficiency ratios have decreased. Technically, the stock dropped from overbought territory back on 14May14 and has some bearish momentum. Due to the bearish technicals, falling financial efficiency ratios, and reduced 2015 earnings estimates, I will not be adding to my position right here.Disclaimer: This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future.

However, the company's earnings are negatively impacted by several factors that obscure the company's true earnings. These factors are:Source: Abbott 2014 First Quarter ResultsAdjusting for the above factors, the company's earnings per share come to $2.00 for the trailing twelve months, giving the company a P/E ratio of 20.65. Which is much more reasonable than the company's reported P/E ratio of nearly 30.Abbott is very well diversified both across the health care industry and geographically throughout the world. The company generates 40% of its revenue in emerging markets. It's revenue is split nearly equally between the company's 4 divisions: established pharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition. Source: Abbott 2013 Annual ReportThe company reported constant currency sales growth of just 0.5% for the first quarter of 2014. Growth is not likely to remain flat throughout the rest of the year. Abbott expects earnings to grow about 10% this year to between $2.16 to $2.26 per share for the full fiscal year.Abbott's heavy exposure to emerging markets will drive future growth in the business. The company stands to benefit from heavy investment from emerging market governments into the healthcare sector. Abbott is also benefiting from aging populations around the world.Johnson & Johnson Current Events & Growth ProspectsJohnson & Johnson posted strong first quarter constant-currency sales growth of 5.3% for the first quarter of 2014. Sales growth reached double digits in company's Asia-Pacific and Africa region. Source: Johnson & Johnson First Quarter PresentationJohnson & Johnson operates in 3 segments: Pharmaceuticals (40% of revenues), Medical Devices & Diagnostics (40% of revenues), and Consumer Products (20% of revenues). Source: Johnson & Johnson 2013 Annual ReportJohnson & Johnson's revenues are diversified both throughout the healthcare industry and the world. The company generated about 45% of first quarter 2014 revenue in the US. The company does not generate as high a percentage of its revenues in emerging markets as Abbott Laboratories. With that being said, Johnson & Johnson still has a strong presence in emerging markets. The company generated about 18% of first quarter revenues in the Asia-Pacifc & Africa region. This region also had the highest growth rate for Johnson & Johnson for the first quarter of 2014, which shows that the company is gaining traction in emerging markets.Johnson & Johnson's future growth will be driven by increased medical product and pharmaceutical sales to an aging global population. Increased health care spending both domestically and in emerging markets will also provide strong tailwinds for Johnson & Johnson.Final ThoughtsBoth Johnson & Johnson and Abbott Laboratories have long growth runways ahead. Johnson & Johnson has the lowest standard deviation of any business analyzed by Sure Dividend. The company's extremely low volatility is due to its diversification both within the health care industry and geographically, and because of the company's strong stable brands and status as the largest publicly traded healthcare business in the world.Abbott Laboratories stands out due to its heavy exposure to emerging markets. The company generates more revenue from the developing world than the US. Over the next several years, Abbott will likely see over 50% of its revenue coming from quickly growing emerging markets.The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing ranks Abbott Laboratories as a Top 10 stock due to its strong growth rate and low volatility. Johnson & Johnson ranks as the 28th highest stock gaining ground because of its extremely low volatility, which is partially offset by the company's relatively low revenue per share growth rate over the last 10 years.Disclosure: The author is long ABT.

2217203,64213,2014-05-14T10:23:22-04:00,"Some historical context on Abbott and its 2013 spin-off, AbbVie.A side-by-side comparison of key metrics of Abbott and AbbVie. Also included is the relative rating assigned based on a simple system.An analysis of which of the two will be a better investment for a long-term dividend growth and income portfolio.","Comparing Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) is akin to an ""apples to oranges"" comparison. However, it does make sense, since AbbVie was a spin-off of Abbott in January 2013, and if someone had Abbott prior to 2013, they would automatically have AbbVie shares. Many investors ponder over whether or not they prefer one over the other, or if they should instead continue to hold both of them. This question gains more relevance for anyone who wants to pick one of these two. I will try to provide some perspective and analysis.Abbott LabsAbbott Laboratories is a 125-year old large-cap diversified healthcare company with an excellent track record. Abbott is a member of the S&P Dividend Aristocrats Index, which means it has been raising its dividend for 25+ years. It also declared its 361st quarterly dividend on April 22nd, 2014. The current dividend of ABT is 2.3% (based on the price of $38.50 as on 1st May 2014), and its dividend has grown at a CAGR of approx. 9.5% in the last twenty years (for the combined Abbott, including the parts of business which is now AbbVie).You might notice that Abbott's dividend payments took a dive in 2012 and 2013, but that should not be considered as dividend cut, as it was due to the spin-off of AbbVie (more on this in next section). And if the dividend of the two companies were combined together for 2012/2013, it would amount to an increase.Abbott derives 70% of its sales outside of the US, and 40% from the emerging markets - particularly in India, China, Russia and Brazil, which bodes well for its future growth. The new Abbott has four distinct divisions, namely nutrition, diagnostics, medical devices and established pharmaceuticals.AbbVie Inc.On January 1st, 2013, Abbott Laboratories separated into two publicly traded companies, one in diversified medical products, which retained the Abbott name and ticker symbol of ABT, and the other in research-based pharmaceuticals, which was named as AbbVie Inc. Abbott distributed all the outstanding shares of AbbVie to original Abbott shareholders, each original Abbott shareholder receiving one common share of AbbVie for every one common share of original Abbott owned.AbbVie retained the research-based pharmaceutical organization, and markets its products in 170 countries. It has a diverse product portfolio, including several market-leading medicines, but draws over 50% of net revenues from its flagship medicine ""Humira"". However, its product pipeline appears to be strong, especially the potential of its new drug for Hepatitis. AbbVie's peers are Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY), Eli Lilly & Co. (NYSE:LLY), Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD).Comparison of Key Metrics for the Two CompaniesThe below table that I created shows key metrics based on the full financial year 2013, as taken from Morningstar and Google Finance.1 Close price on 05/07/2014.2 Dividend growth is from 2002 until 2012 (prior to spin-off).3 Until year 2012 (prior to spin-off, the combined Abbott had been increasing the dividend for 40 years. However, for AbbVie as a separate company, dividend history is only one-year old).Which of the Two Companies Deserves Your Dividend Income Dollars?The simple answer, in my opinion, is both; provided you acquire them at the right price. If you were invested in Abbott prior to 2013, you would automatically have received an equivalent number of shares in AbbVie at a rather attractive price. AbbVie shares have appreciated 47% since the company split. In comparison, Abbott has only gained about 17% during this time. Also, since the two companies now operate in different industry segments, one can hold both of them and gain a diversification advantage.However, this question becomes more relevant if you were to choose only one of the two. Abbott shares did not have the big run-up as AbbVie had during the last year, and hence, they are more reasonably priced at this time. Also, Abbott scores on AbbVie in terms of projected growth estimates at 11.5%, compared to 7.8% for AbbVie. Lastly, Abbott's debt load (debt-to-asset ratio) is low, compared to AbbVie's almost 50%.However, before we can fully answer this question, let's look at the future returns based on the projected growth rates for these two companies. I will rely on the F.A.S.T. Graphs™ research tool to facilitate this process. The growth rates assumed in these calculations are taken from S&P Capital IQ (S&P Research team) and are normally median estimates. In this example, they are 11.5% for Abbott and 8.5% for AbbVie. Please note that future growth rates extending far into the future is a tricky business and could vary from the actual rates by a wide margin.You may notice from the above earnings estimates that both Abbott and AbbVie are expensive to some degree, based on their current prices, but over the next ten years, their total earnings (and hence the returns) are likely to be similar. AbbVie is likely to pay more in dividends, but not by a wide margin.Now, let's assign a rating to each of the two companies, based on the information that we already have and using a simple rating system that I have created and used for some time. Like any other mechanical rating system, this system is not perfect by any means and would not substitute other means of research, but it can provide an unbiased decision point. Below is a table that I created showing the relative ""rating"" for Abbott and AbbVie. Please see the complete rules and disclosures about this rating system here. This system takes into account three elements; fundamental ratios, growth estimates and the dividend strength of the company. Each of the criteria gets a rating based on pre-defined rules. The net total rating is the sum total of individual ratings, and results in a value that is between 0-10, 10 being perfect and 0 being the worst.The above model rates the two companies just about the same, with a slight edge to Abbott.Concluding RemarksIn my opinion, both of these companies are likely to serve any dividend and income portfolio well into the future. However, the entry price does matter. At the current prices, they both are slightly expensive, but someone like me, who already holds positions in both at a much lower cost-basis, should be well served in the long run. If someone was to initiate a new position at current prices, it will be wise to dollar-cost average the investment so as to take advantage of future dips. If your goal is to choose stability and less volatility, then choose Abbott over AbbVie. On the other hand, if the goal was to have a better growth and total return, AbbVie may be a better choice.Disclaimer: The examples and stocks quoted in this article are for information purpose only; it should not be construed as recommendation to buy or sell any securities.Disclosure: I am long ABT, ABBV.

The business has excellent long-term growth prospects.Abbott Laboratories will benefit from 2 macro-economic trends: the aging of developed nations, and the rapid growth of emerging markets. The company currently generates approximately 40% of its revenue from emerging markets, as compared with 30% of revenue in the US. As these nations move up the income ladder, one of their first priorities is to expand healthcare. Abbott Laboratories is particularly well-positioned to benefit from the growth of consumer power in emerging markets. The company expects 75% of its pharmaceutical revenue to come from emerging markets over the next several years.Today, less than 25% of the world's population is over 50.

Further, the business has paid quarterly dividends for 90 years since 1924. Interestingly, Abbott Laboratories encourages dividend investing on the company's investor relations page through a 1-page PDF document.

It is a large cap company serving both the developed and developing markets through a broad portfolio of leading businesses. Recently, Credit Suisse upgraded Abbott Laboratories to outperform from neutral, and raised the price target from $44 to $46. The price target set by Credit Suisse is 16.16% above the current market price of the stock, which is $39.60. In the past year, the stock has demonstrated a 4.87% upward price appreciation. In this article, I will try to ascertain the future growth prospects of Abbott and assign a reasonable price target for the company's stock.Abbott Laboratories has been in the news since it confirmed an acquisition deal earlier in May. To assess the company's future performance after the benefits of the acquisition deal come to fruition, it is essential to look at the company's pre-acquisition performance.Abbott's Latest PerformanceAbbott's business portfolio is established around four business segments: pharmaceuticals, diagnostics, medical devices and nutrition. Its $5-billion pharmaceutical business has been under pressure due to government price controls, austerity measures in developed European markets, and economic uncertainty in the emerging markets. In order to achieve positive growth and combat investors' concerns regarding the sluggish performance of the pharmaceutical segment, some serious steps had to be taken. There were rumors regarding divestiture, but the company didn't confirm any such news. The following graph shows the company's financial performance in the recent 5 quarters.Source: BloombergOver the past two consecutive quarters, Abbott has seen its profit margin decline from 18% to 7%. In the latest quarter, Abbott Labs experienced a 6.6% revenue decline in its growth-starved generic business partially affected by currency fluctuations. Last year, the same business had declined 3% in terms of revenues. Besides pharmaceuticals, the nutrition division also suffered from a 1.7% decline in revenues year-over-year in the most recent quarter.Abbott Acquiring CFR PharmaceuticalsAbbott Laboratories has been a leaner and more concentrated organization after spinning off its proprietary pharmaceutical division, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). Abbott has confirmed that it is going to acquire CFR Pharmaceuticals SA (CFR) for $2.9 billion, along with assuming $430 million in the company's debt. CFR Pharmaceuticals is the biggest pharmaceutical company in Chile, with a wide product portfolio consisting of a variety of products for women's health, central nervous system, heart and respiratory diseases. CFR has a wide geographic presence in 15 markets across Latin America, as listed below.Out of the total 15 markets, CFR operates in 4 main markets that contribute a majority of the company's revenues; they are: Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Peru. Together, Chile and Colombia contribute 51% of the company's revenues, while Argentina and Peru combined contribute 28% of CFR's top line. The remaining 21% of the company's revenues are attributable to the markets it operates in. CFR Pharmaceuticals generated revenues of $768 million in 2013 from sales of branded generics. CFR Pharmaceuticals has products in difficult-to-substitute, high-growth business segments.Benefits for Abbott LabsGeographic ExpansionThrough this acquisition, Abbott will be recognized as one of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies in Latin America. The Latin American market is highly lucrative, as it is estimated to reach $124 billion by 2018. CFR Pharmaceuticals will open up new emerging market opportunities for Abbott Labs. On its own, Abbott has a robust presence in the emerging markets, but its foothold in those markets is not growing significantly in general and specifically with regards to its generics business.Acquisition Accretive To EarningsThis acquisition will prove beneficial for Abbott Laboratories, since it is projected to add $900 million to the company's top line in 2015, and that will be the first full year CFR will operate in complete integration with Abbott. This deal will not have an impact on Abbott's 2014 revenues or earnings. Abbott will enjoy a strong product pipeline comprising of more than 1000 products from CFR Pharmaceuticals. CFR's business, which is seamlessly in line with Abbott's therapeutics business, will bolster the Abbott's business areas concerning women's health, central nervous system, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.Concluding RemarksThe acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals by Abbott Laboratories will pave the way for the acquiring company to bolster its geographic presence and product pipeline in the emerging markets, as well as Latin America. Moreover, the company's surging diagnostics division and nutrition division make up a substantial portion of the company's goals for the long run. Abbott reiterated its full-year 2014 ongoing earnings per share guidance of $2.16 to $2.26, reflecting double-digit growth at the midpoint of the guidance range. Abbott declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share in February. Therefore, I am bullish on this stock, and investors should consider it a worthwhile investment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a Gemstone Equity Research research analyst.

2224093,21820,2014-05-18T09:55:46-04:00,Acquisition provides open door to Latin America and Central America growth.Latin America pharmaceutical market is expected to grow 70% by 2018.Abbott Laboratories trades at 15.9 times fiscal 2015 estimated earnings per share prior to acquisition.,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has been relatively quiet since spinning off its U.S. drug business, which included Humira, AndroGel, and Kaletra. Since the spin-off, which occurred 1/1/13, shares of Abbvie (NYSE:ABBV) are up 50%, while Abbott has seen shares rise 22%. Abbott announced its first acquisition since the split on Friday with CFR Pharmaceuticals. The deal will significantly boost Abbott's international presence and will boost sales and earnings, which should see shares move 20% higher.Abbott Laboratories announced the acquisition of CFR Pharmaceuticals, a Chile-based drug company. The deal more than doubles Abbott's Latin America branded generics presence. The deal also makes Abbott a top ten pharmaceutical company in Latin America. Abbott is paying $2.9 billion, plus assuming $430 million in outstanding debt to acquire the company.CFR Pharmaceuticals had sales of $768 million in 2013. Abbott estimates that CFR will add $900 million to sales in its first full year (2015). Abbott then expects double digit sales growth for several years. The company's CEO Miles D. White had this to say:The deal gives Abbott a huge boost in Latin America, where CFR has a strong presence in 15 countries. The company has key areas of focus in women's health, central nervous system, cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. The key to the press release on Friday for me was the growth being seen in Latin America. The Latin America pharmaceutical market is expected to hit $73 billion in 2014. That number is expected to grow to $124 billion by 2018, or a growth of 70% in four years.Here are the countries where CFR Pharmaceuticals has a presence:The company lists Chile, Peru, Argentina, and Colombia as its strongest markets. Emerging market sales were 30.5% for CFR in fiscal 2012. That number is expected to grow to 41.4% of total sales by fiscal 2017. Colombia is becoming one of CFR's strongest markets, after a 2012 acquisition of Lafrancol. In December 2013, CFR had a market share of more than 8% in Colombia. This ranked better than large pharma companies like Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) and Bayer (OTCPK:BAYZF). Also considering Abbott had a share of 4%, CFR could be dominant in Colombia for the future.Abbott will also try to bring its own products to new markets and better compete against foreign rivals with the deal. The company expects the deal ""to provide opportunity to expand each company's portfolio across Latin America.""CFR Pharmaceuticals has over 1000 products available for sale. CFR has 14 manufacturing facilities. The company also has 2300 medical representatives who visit over 140,000 physicians every month. The company has five core divisions:The company's top ten brands made up 16% of 2013 sales. Here is a look at how sales breakdown for several units:CFR has grown from a Chile drug company to a dominant force in Latin and Central America. The company started its international expansion in 1988 by entering Paraguay. In 2007, the company entered Asia with a joint venture in Vietnam. A deal to acquire 39.5% of Allergy Therapeutics (OTCPK:AGYTF) also gave CFR a presence in the United Kingdom.Here is a look at financials for CFR Pharmaceuticals:Here are some highlights from the CFR Pharmaceuticals March Presentation:I am incredibly bullish on this deal, as it gives Abbott a huge door open to growth markets in Central and Latin America. CFR's joint venture and presence in Vietnam could also help Abbott expand in the Asian region as well. Rather than go after companies with huge market capitalizations, like other large pharma companies are, Abbott is going for strong growth in the years to come.Abbott saw first quarter sales fall 2.5%, hurt by currency weakness of 3%. Earnings per share of $0.41 were in-line with company guidance. Here is a look at how sales break down by unit (international sales are based on operational and not reported):Abbott is seeing recovering market share in international markets and nutrition, which could significantly boost third and fourth quarter revenue and earnings. A new adult nutrition brand is launching in Japan soon and recent infant formula brand Eleva launched in China last week. Diagnostics was one area of significant growth, where Abbott reported a 5% gain. The company's bioresorbable vascular scaffold ABSORB is making significant progress towards approval in the United States, Japan, and China. This approval could provide huge growth for the Diagnostics unit over the next few years. Vision care sales were also strong, with a 10% gain for the company.For the full fiscal year, Abbott Laboratories sees earnings per share hitting a range of $2.16 to $2.26. The acquisition is not expected to impact fiscal 2014 earnings per share. Analysts on Yahoo see the company reporting earnings per share of $2.20. In fiscal 2015, earnings are expected to hit $2.46, based on sales growth of 5.5% to $23.7 billion.This acquisition is incredibly important for Abbott as it recognizes a new direction. The company saw declining sales in the United States in two of its three main business segments. The acquisition will give international sales a lift and give the company a focus on growing its brands in Latin and Central America with an open door to 15 countries.The growth from CFR will continue for many years as the company is in the middle of key growth markets for diagnostics and drugs. This is a deal that will reward shareholders for years to come.Shares are now trading for 17.7 times the $2.20 projected by analysts. Abbott will update fiscal 2015 guidance in the fourth quarter, and I expect it to be higher now with the near $1 billion in added sales from the acquisition. Shares trade at 15.9 times the earnings projection for 2015 before the deal. I think earnings per share will jump to at least $2.60 and could be much higher than that. I think a price-to-earnings of 18 is more reasonable for this company, which would equal a $51 price target for 2015. Shares of Abbott Labs trade around $39. Over the past 52-weeks, shares have traded in a range of $32.70 to $40.49.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2288693,31461,2014-06-26T16:54:04-04:00,"Abbott received CE Marking for its implantable Tecnis lenses in Europe.WHO says that global annual target for cataract surgeries should be 32 million by 2020.The global vision care devices market will reach $46 billion by 2017, representing significant opportunities for Abbott.","Abbott (NYSE:ABT) announced earlier this week that it has received CE Marking for its implantable Tecnis lenses in Europe. The company developed Tecnis Symfony IOLs (intraocular lenses) for providing cataract patients a continuous range of vision including far, intermediate and near distances. While standard IOLs are used only to improve distance vision, Abbott's Tecnis range of IOLs can also be used to help aging cataract patients focus on near objects.Often cataract patients suffer from a diminished ability to focus on near objects as a result of aging, which is known as presbyopia. No FDA-approved implantable device is available in the market to treat presbyopia. However, a few startups are working to develop presbyopia implants. I believe that Abbott will enjoy the first mover advantage with its implantable Tecnis lenses in the growing vision care market.Abbott's Opportunity in Vision Care Devices MarketThe global vision care devices market, a segment of the consumer healthcare market, is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.4% from 2010 - 2017, according to a research report. The report further says:At the recent William Blair conference, CFO and EVP of Abbott, Thomas Freyman said, ""In the $4 billion cataract surgery market, we hold the number two position in cataract lenses where we have been gaining share with recent new product launches which has resulted in double-digit sales growth.""In 2013, Abbott's revenue in vision care was $1.1 billion, with overall medical devices revenue totaling $5.5 billion. Since cataract lenses account for more than 65% of vision care sales for Abbott, I believe that the company's upcoming Tecnis lenses in Europe will drive its vision care revenue significantly. There were 3.5 million cataract surgeries in Europe last year and by the year 2020, the global annual target for cataract surgeries should be 32 million, according to World Health Organization.Source: WHOCompetitionAbbott's number one competitor in the implantable cataract lens market is Novartis (NYSE:NVS). Its Alcon division holds the number one position in the market. Moreover, two notable vision care startups, PowerVision and AcuFocus, which are actively working to develop presbyopia implants, will be among Abbott's future competitors. Apart from these startups, ReVision Optics, backed by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), will also compete with Abbott.ConclusionAbbott is trading at an attractive valuation compared to its peers and the stock might have meaningful medium-term upside.ABT PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YCharts  In terms of one-year forward P/E ratio, Abbott is trading at par with Novartis and Johnson & Johnson, its primary competitors in vision care. However, in terms of one year forward Price to Sales ratio, Abbott is trading at a significant discount. I would recommend buying the stock at the current price.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Let's examine its most recent quarterly results.We would have expected Abbott to raise its full-year outlook, at least by the magnitude of the quarterly beat, but the company confirmed its full-year 2014 ongoing earnings-per-share guidance.We think this means Abbott will be hiking its guidance in the near future, perhaps as early as next quarter.","Valuentum has always liked Abbott (NYSE:ABT). The firm has been one of the most successful companies for more than 125 years. Abbott has leadership positions in a number of attractive markets such as 'Diagnostics' - where it is #1 in immunoassay diagnostics and #1 in blood screening - and 'Nutrition' - where it boasts brand names such as Similac, Ensure, and PediaSure, leading to its #1 worldwide position in both worldwide adult nutrition and US pediatric nutrition. The firm's 'Branded Generics' segment has strong positions in emerging markets, while its 'Medical Devices' segment is #1 in drug-eluting stents, #1 in bare metal stents, and #1 in LASIK. Abbott continues to execute nicely.On Wednesday of last week, Abbott reported solid first-quarter results. On an operational basis, 'Diagnostic' revenues and 'Medical Devices' revenues advanced 5.1% and 0.3%, respectively, while its 'Nutrition' business revenues and 'Established Pharmaceuticals' segment revenues fell 1.7% and 0.7%, respectively. We're not reading too much into the declines in its 'Nutrition' operations, as the company is already well on its way to recovering and recapturing lost share from a supplier recall in August 2013 across certain international markets. We also think the weakness in the company's 'Established Pharmaceuticals' business will be short-lived, and management noted that key emerging markets such as India, Russia, Brazil and China represent the most attractive long-term opportunities in its branded generic product portfolio.The company exceeded its own bottom-line expectations during the period, posting first-quarter ongoing earnings per share of $0.41, above its previous guidance range of $0.34-$0.36 per share. We would have expected Abbott to raise its full-year outlook, at least by the magnitude of the better-than-expected performance, but the company confirmed its full-year 2014 ongoing earnings-per-share guidance of $2.16-$2.26. Management may still be exercising conservatism this early in 2014 relative to its year-end targets, and Valuentum expects the company to raise guidance at some point in the near future. The existing guidance represents double-digit growth at the midpoint of the range.Abbott is a Dividend Aristocrat, which means it has raised its dividend for 25+ consecutive years, and the company's recent quarterly dividend of $0.22 that it declared on February 21 was its 361st quarterly dividend. That's a fantastic track record of consistency and resiliency through the course of almost every imaginable market cycle. For investors interested in a strong dividend-paying equity, Abbott certainly fits the mold. At present, the company's annual dividend yield is 2.4%, and Valuentum is considering the company for inclusion in its actively-managed portfolios.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2146073,44001,2014-04-17T00:51:39-04:00,Earnings and revenue decreased annually and quarterly.Foreign exchange continues to batter the company.The company is so well diversified that a drop in one segment hardly affects the whole.,"The last time I wrote about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), I stated:""Due to the bullish technicals, great near-term earnings growth potential, and great long-term earnings growth potential I'm going to be pulling the trigger on a very small batch of this particular name right now."" Since that article was published, the stock is up 1.08% on the back of earnings, while the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) was up 1.05%. Abbott Laboratories is engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a portfolio of science-based healthcare products, which operates in four segments: Diagnostics, Medical Devices, Nutritionals and Generic Pharmaceuticals.The company reported earnings before the market opened on 16Apr14, and on the surface, all the results were mixed with the company reporting earnings of $0.41 per share (beating estimates by $0.05) on revenue of $5.24 billion (missing estimates by $50 million). What I'd like to do at this time is delve into the weeds and pick out some highlights from different portions of the report to see if the stock is worth buying at the present time.Segment RevenueBecause the company missed on revenues, I want to see which segments were the main contributors to the problem. Fortunately, Abbott is so diversified that all of its segments contribute about the same to the company. On a year-over-year basis, I only really see white noise and not a real dramatic impact on revenues. But on a quarter-over-quarter basis, I see one major outlier, the Established Pharma segment. The Established Pharma segment is focused on bringing value to patients through a portfolio of established pharmaceutical products in the developed world and particularly the fastest growing markets. On the quarter-over-quarter basis, the company lost 11% in revenues primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange rates.Income StatementThe first line item I noticed on the income statement is that amortization of intangible assets have decreased 12% from the prior quarter and 13% from the prior year. The next line item I noticed was that R&D spending was up 12% from the prior year, which is a great thing in the healthcare world, because if you're not innovating you're just going to be left behind. Total operating cost and expenses decreased 2% from the prior quarter, but increased 1% from the prior year. Operating earnings decreased 40% from last quarter and 27% from last year, primarily due to less revenue.Net interest expenses increased 35% from the prior quarter but decreased 12% from the prior year. Net foreign exchange losses decreased 67% from last quarter and decreased 93% from last year. The unfavorable foreign exchange rates seem to be a continued theme for the company, and will continue to be the case unless the dollar begins to weaken against emerging market currencies. Other income increased 200% from last quarter but decreased 50% from last year. Earnings from continuing operations decreased in dramatic fashion, obviously, on a quarterly and annual basis, down 42% and down 24%, respectively.Taxes on earnings from continuing operations decreased 48% from last quarter but increased 740% from last year. This made earnings from continuing operations come to a drop of 42% from last quarter and a drop of 38% from last year. Net earnings at the company decreased 36% from last quarter and 31% from last year.Net earnings from continuing operations decreased 30% from last quarter, while the company managed to reduce the share count 1% in the same time frame. However, with the share reduction, the bottom line was impacted dramatically with a 29% drop.ConclusionThe company reported earnings, which were 3% lower than a year before on slightly less revenue, while the share price was up 3.37% in the past year excluding dividends. The share count has decreased slightly for the entire year. I definitely hate that both earnings per share and revenue were down year over year. I do like that R&D spending increased for the entire year. I for one don't think the company should be purchasing shares right now and wait for a gift from Mr. Market, as I see the market pulling back right now. I know I wrote an article last night saying that this is a solid dividend stock and I still believe that it is, but I'm going to lighten up on my purchases in it right now because I want to make sure the sequential decrease in earnings isn't a trend.Disclaimer: This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future. These are only my personal opinions and you should do your own homework. Only you are responsible for what you trade and happy investing!Disclosure: I am long ABT, SPY.

2143773,44001,2014-04-16T02:38:55-04:00,The company has great near and long term earnings growth expectations.The stock appears to be halfway through an uptrend.The company recently gained approval for a stent by the FDA.,"The last time I wrote about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) I stated, ""Due to the bullish technicals, high increasing return on equity, and great near-term earnings growth potential I'm going to be pulling the trigger on a very small batch of this particular name right now."" Since the last article it popped 2.12% versus the 2.56% gain the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) posted. Abbott Laboratories is engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a portfolio of science-based healthcare products, which operates in four segments: Diagnostics, Medical Devices, Nutritionals and Generic Pharmaceuticals.On January 22, 2014, the company reported fourth quarter earnings of $0.58 per share, which was in-line with the consensus of analysts' estimates and is scheduled to report earnings Wednesday morning. In the past year the company's stock is up 2.26% excluding dividends (up 4.21% including dividends), and is losing to the S&P 500, which has gained 15.99% in the same time frame. With all this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to evaluate the stock on a fundamental, financial and technical basis to see if it's worth buying more shares of the company right now for the healthcare sector of my dividend portfolio.FundamentalsThe company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 24.98, which is fairly priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 15.37 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. The 1-year PEG ratio (2.01), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is expensively priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 12.42%. The company has great near-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 12.42%. In addition, the company has great long-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 11.71%. Below is a comparison table of the fundamentals metrics for the company for when I wrote all articles pertaining to the company.FinancialsOn a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. The company pays a dividend of 2.32% with a payout ratio of 58% of trailing 12-month earnings while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 7.2%, 13.3% and 8%, respectively, which are all respectable values. Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I don't believe the 2.32% yield of this company is good enough for me to take shelter in for the time being. Below is a comparison table of the financial metrics for the company for when I wrote all articles pertaining to the company.TechnicalsLooking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock bouncing off of oversold territory back on 11Apr14 with a current value of 47.67. I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next. I see that the black line is just about to cross above the red line with the divergence bars increasing in height, indicating some bullish momentum. As for the stock price itself ($37.97), I'm looking at $38.80 to act as resistance and $37.34 to act as support for a risk/reward ratio which plays out to be -1.66% to 2.19%.Recent NewsConclusionAbbott is a good defensive company with a solid dividend yield and will grow slowly over time. Fundamentally the company is fairly priced based on future earnings and on future growth potential. Financially, the dividend is growing and secured by earnings. On a technical basis I believe there is some bullish momentum. Due to the bullish technicals, great near-term earnings growth potential, and great long-term earnings growth potential I'm going to be pulling the trigger on a very small batch of this particular name right now.Disclaimer: This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future.

2145243,23479,2014-04-16T15:28:21-04:00,,"Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) is scheduled to release its Q1 2014 earnings on Wednesday, April 16. In the previous quarter, operational sales increased 3.3% year-over-year (y-o-y) to $5.7 billion, driven by robust sales of its Diagnostics, Vascular and Medical Optics products. Nutritionals, the company's largest business segment, continued to be impacted by the supplier recall that was initiated in international markets in August of last year and reported a marginal 1.1% y-o-y increase in operational sales. On the cost side, the healthcare conglomerate improved its gross margins by 60 basis points to 55.4% on the back of improving operating margins in the Nutritionals and Diagnostics businesses.In the company's first quarter earnings, we expect operational sales to grow in the mid-single digits, driven by continued growth in Diagnostics and a marginal improvement in Nutritionals. Abbott's management stated in the previous earnings call that the company expected adjusted gross margins to decline to about 54% in the first quarter of 2014 on account of increasing competition, foreign exchange impacts and the supplier recall in Nutritionals. We expect gross margins to match company estimates.Emerging markets contributed about 40% of total sales in the fourth quarter last year. We expect this to increase going forward as Abbott increases its presence in emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil, anticipating higher growth prospects compared to developed regions. The company introduced several new products last year and they are likely to contribute significantly to sales in the near future.We have a price estimate of $40 for Abbott Labs, implying a premium of over 5% to the current market price. Emerging Markets To Drive Growth In SalesSales in emerging markets grew 9% y-o-y in the previous quarter driven by strong performance in the Adult Nutrition business, Diagnostics and Established Pharmaceuticals (generic drugs). Together, the Nutritionals, Diagnostics and Established Pharmaceuticals divisions account for over 75% of Abbott's revenue and are likely to derive most of their future growth from emerging markets.Countries such as China, India, Russia and Brazil continue to grow at a faster rate than most developed economies and have a rapidly growing middle class population. McKinsey & Company predicts that the urban household income in China will double by 2022 and that the majority of its urban consumers will earn between $9,000 and $34,000 annually by that time. [1] As the middle class continues to grow in these markets, people are likely to increase their discretionary spending on nutritional products (such as food supplements) and point-of-care diagnostics.New Products Could Boost SalesIn 2013, Abbott launched several new products across its diversified businesses to boost sales and tap into new markets. This included over 70 new products in the Nutritionals, Diagnostics and Vascular divisions. Going forward, these new products are expected to significantly contribute to the company's sales. Some of these new products are as follows:Disclosure: No positions."
2134193,52502,2014-04-09T17:29:47-04:00,"I chose Abbott for April as part of my long-term monthly stock pick focused on companies with resilience and ability to thrive in the face of slow economic growth.It may be currently slightly overpriced, but it has many products, such as Similac, which we can expect to continue selling, even as the global economy remains slow.I-STAT is an innovative diagnostics portable and wireless tool Abbott provides, which can be the foundation of future innovation which will change medical practice methods.","At the beginning of the year, I decided to pick a stock each month, which fits my overall long-term view of the global economy in terms of how well it is positioned to thrive within the economic conditions I expect we will experience for the next few decades. My overall view is that the global economy will be sluggish, as already witnessed to be a trend since 2008. In view of this, I am looking at companies that fit the profile and business model which I think will give them an edge over the competition and help them survive and thrive, despite the overall negative economic environment. The focus is less on latest quarterly results, and more on whether the company in focus has the right products and is well-positioned for the next few decades. This is meant specifically for those looking for long-term buy and hold opportunities, with little downside and potential for regular steady returns on investment.My previous picks are Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB), Suncor Energy (NYSE:SU) and Barrick Gold (ABX). In the case of Kimberly-Clark, I identified global demographic trends as the main reason to consider the company due to aspects such as its leading role as an adult disposable diaper producer through its Depends brand. In the case of Suncor Energy, the current Canadian oil sands price discount due to transport bottlenecks, as well as a large reserve that can be extracted at a steady price compared to competition in other oil extracting regions where there is a tendency toward rising cost due to lower quality reserves are the main attractions. In the case of Barrick Gold, it is a large gold miner with decent quality reserves, which can be extracted at a price that is lower than the current industry average.My pick for this month is Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). It is a well-diversified healthcare company, which offers four main product categories. There is the pharmaceutical sector, the nutrition products sector, the medical devices sector and diagnostics.Source: Abbot 2013 reportMany of the products Abbott produces and markets have strong staying power in the face of tough economic times. Products such as Similac will not go out of style just because global economic growth is sluggish. This fact alone makes Abbott a very good long-term candidate, in my view. It is the diagnostics sector, however, which has me most interested in this company, but before I get to the details in regard to the specific product and why I see a bright future for it, I want to first introduce the current vital financial aspects of the company.It has a market cap of $58.5 billion, net sales of $21.8 billion and net earnings of $2.58 billion. Net sales increased 2% compared to 2012, while net earnings declined significantly from the almost $6 billion achieved in 2012. Based on 2013 results, this company seems somewhat expensive for the short-term, with a P/E ratio at over 23. I should also mention that this is a dividend-paying stock, which currently pays quarterly 22 cents per share. My interest is in the long term, and as such my main concern is looking at products which, I believe, will have a bright future, and therefore, have the potential to add significantly to the company's value. In the short-to-medium term, however, we can expect sluggish returns on investment due to the unfavorable price of the stock.The product I find intriguing is its i-STAT hand-held portable diagnostic devices (weighs about a pound, and is the size of a larger remote control). It is currently the only such device that is FDA-approved for use at a patient's bedside and in emergency rooms for clinical diagnostics (the name i-STAT is derived from the Latin word statim, which means immediately or instant). Tests which previously were done in laboratories, needing significant investments in space, equipment and personnel, can now be done with a hand-held device. The wireless version of the product received FDA clearance in 2011 and since then became a commonly used tool in hospitals, emergency services and doctor's offices. The wireless technology allows for the transmission of the collected data, saving time in emergencies and allowing for quick, cost effective diagnosis.i-STAT provides dozens of tests, from ordinary electrolytes to troponins, which are markers of myocardial infarction (heart attacks). It is especially useful when it comes to infant testing, because it only requires a single drop of blood, while regular labs often require a few milliliters, and for monitoring respiratory and circulatory (CO2 and O2 pressure, hemoglobin) parameters in patients hospitalized in intensive care units.This product may not be new, but it is a product with much future potential as further innovation makes its use more widespread, and cost-effectiveness will likely help it penetrate markets once it becomes possible to adapt it to established procedures around the world. This is a product that will transform laboratory medicine as it evolves through constant improvement and innovation and becomes a more and more accepted device, around which new medical practices will evolve.The fact that this product has such great potential to be a platform for great innovation, not only in technological terms, but in terms of medical procedures which the product will likely help shape perhaps for many decades to come, makes it a story worth watching and perhaps being a part of by making it part of one's long-term holdings. There may be some downward pressure on this stock for the short term, but I think there is great upside potential for the long term.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

This is best done by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries. What follows is a specific look at how Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.ABT data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 7/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - 12/31/2013Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryABT Dividend data by YChartsConclusion:Abbott Labs is a very strong company at the initial stages of the ModernGraham analysis, having passed all of the requirements of the Defensive Investor. The company also passes the requirements of the Enterprising Investor, except for the requirement regarding earnings growth. Moving on to the valuation stage, the company does not fare well after exhibiting a lack of earnings growth over the last five years. EPSmg (normalized earnings) have gone from $2.79 in 2009 to $2.74 for 2014, and this lack of growth clearly does not support the market's implied estimate of 2.98% earnings growth going forward. Accordingly, the ModernGraham valuation model has returned an estimate of intrinsic value that falls below a margin of safety relative to the price.Disclaimer: The author did not hold a position in Abbott Laboratories or any of the other companies listed in this article at the time of publication and had no intention of changing that position within the next 72 hours."

The stock is currently trading between $38-38.50 and the researchers have set a $45 price target. This reflects handsome upside potential. The company's current stock price was up 13.95% since the previous year as shown in the chart below.Source: YchartsI am writing this article to determine the drivers that will enhance the bright future prospects of the company. The company is involved in the discovery, development, production and sale of a diversified portfolio of science-based health care products.To begin, let us have a look at the activities initiated by the company in the previous fiscal year that will benefit the company's top and bottom lines in the current and future fiscal years.Acquisitions Will Prove to be ProfitableIn August 2013, Abbott acquired OptiMedica, an ophthalmic device maker, for $400 million. This acquisition will expand the company's vision care business by providing Abbott with an instant entry point into the laser assisted cataract surgery market.The global cataract surgery laser market is forecasted to reach $2.4 billion by the year 2019. The driver of this growth is the aging population; with growing age comes the development of cataracts and the need for surgery. The femtosecond lasers for cataract surgery have increased the quality of the procedure in a considerable manner and have resulted in more surgeons switching to this more reliable and safer technology. The change in demographics will also contribute to the growth in the demand for this technology and related services. The aging baby boomers and the fact that people older than 65 require 10 times more eye care than those younger than 65 create an extraordinary demand for cataract surgery.Additionally, in August 2013, Abbott acquired 100% of IDEV Technologies, net of debt, for $310 million in cash. The acquisition of IDEV Technologies enlarged Abbott's endovascular portfolio as IDEV Technologies, a privately held company, is concentrated on developing next-generation medical devices for use by interventional radiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional cardiologists.The rising demand for minimally invasive endovascular procedures offers growth opportunities for related devices manufacturers. The field of endovascular surgical intervention is growing quickly as minimally invasive techniques provide benefits over the traditional intrusive surgeries. Continuous device enhancements and an introduction of new generation devices are forecasted to drive double digit growth for the next couple of years. The endovascular devices market has observed a lot of consolidation through mergers and acquisitions with the niche players being acquired by tier 1 companies. Examples of these strategic moves by the players in the industry include Cordis Corporation's acquisition of Flexible Stenting Solutions in order to strengthen the company's portfolio in the treatment of vascular disease. Cordis is a unit of Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). All of these happenings in the industry have led to an anticipation of $1.6 billion, by 2016, for the global endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (NYSEARCA:AAA) repair market, which was valued at $1 billion in 2011.In case the above acquisitions had taken place before the beginning of FY 2013, the company's consolidated net sales and income for FY 2013 would have been significantly different from the reported amount. This indicates that these acquisitions did not reach their full potential in FY 2013. Hence a full-year contribution in FY 2014 will materially add to the company financial results for FY 2014.Ongoing Restructuring will Support the Bottom LineIn FY 2013, Abbott's management agreed upon a plan for cost reduction and improving efficiencies through various functional areas. These initiatives also include a plan to rationalize certain manufacturing operations in order to decrease costs and increase efficiencies in Abbott's established pharmaceuticals business.Abbott recorded employee related severance charges of around $78 million in FY 2013 in addition to other charges of around $4 million mainly for asset impairments. Approximately $35 million of the total employee related severance charges and other expenses in 2013 were charged to the cost of products sold and about $47 million is logged as selling, general and administrative expenses.The restructuring expenses incurred in FY 2013 will result in an overall cost reduction for the company in FY 2014. As a result, the company has projected improvements in its bottom line and issued ongoing EPS guidance for the full FY 2014 of $2.16-2.26 up from $1.62 in FY 2013. Not only it is in line with analysts' estimates but it will also turn into double-digit EPS growth in FY 2014 in comparison to FY 2013.In addition to acquisition and restructuring (internal factors), the company also has opportunities to expand into the growing emerging markets.More Business from Emerging MarketsRevenue generation across Abbott's businesses is well balanced in terms of geography; 30% is generated from the U.S., 30% from Western Europe, Canada, Japan and Australia, and 40% from the fastest-growing economies that include India, China, Russia, and Brazil. So, the company generates 30% of its total revenue from the U.S. and 70% internationally. The company's presence in the high-growth emerging markets gives it an advantage. The following pie charts show that the company is forecasted to generate 75% of its total revenue from emerging markets by FY 2016 up from its current 60%.Source: JP Morgan ABT PresentationAfter spinning off its proprietary pharmaceutical division, AbbVie (ABBV), Abbott is now leaner and more concentrated on growing its global reach.The company is turning its focus on emerging markets to cater to the rising demand in those countries for basic products such as nutrition supplements and generic drugs. Global healthcare and malnutrition problems are rising so there is an increased demand for nutrition supplements. The U.S. is a major market but the largest emerging markets for nutrition supplement are China and India. For generic drugs, the emerging markets represent the second largest market following North America. The emerging markets are forecasted to record a CAGR of 15.1% in generic drugs sales from 2011 to 2016, reflecting an increase from $57 billion in 2011 to $115 billion in 2016.Therefore, in the long run, the company anticipates that the growth rates in the emerging markets will be greater than the growth sourced from developed markets.Return to Shareholders and My RecommendationIn October 2013, Abbott declared a 57% increase in the company's quarterly common dividend, increasing it to $0.22 per share from $0.14. Through this increase the company has demonstrated itself as a shareholder-friendly dividend stock with 359 consecutive dividend payments and 41 straight years of dividend increases. The company's stock has a dividend yield of 2.29% that is greater than the industry average of 1.73%.According to the company's CFO's disclosure in the Q4 2013 conference call, the company is looking forward to increasing its payout to $1.7 - $1.8 billion for 2014. This can be seen as an indicator of the 2014 dividend raise.In addition to this, Abbott projects an increase in its share repurchases to more than $2 billion in 2014.With a market cap of around $60 billion, a $2 billion dollar repurchase equates to around 3.33% of the outstanding shares.Overall, the company has opportunities and the potential to expand into emerging markets in the coming years. For FY 2014, the company has more to earn from acquisitions made in the previous fiscal year. The company's dividend and return profile is attractive for dividend-growth investors.I would suggest investors consider adding this stock to their long-term portfolios as the stock is currently undervalued and trading at 25.27× TTM P/E in comparison to the industry average of 31.59×.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a Gemstone Equity Research research analyst.

1987541,24349,2014-02-03T01:38:02-05:00,,"It has been a year since Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) completed the spin-off of its branded pharmaceutical business, establishing AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) as a separate company. What remains with Abbott is still a global healthcare company with a portfolio of offerings focused in diagnostics, medical devices, nutritionals and branded generic pharmaceuticals. The stock was up ~20% in 2013, and dividend investors were rewarded with a huge dividend increase as well.Despite reporting solid results, the stock has sold off ~8% in the week following its earnings release. However, I believe Abbott continues to be an attractive company for long-term, dividend-growth investors.Recent Earnings ResultsAbbott recently reported fourth-quarter revenues of $5.66B worldwide, up 0.4% on the year before, but below consensus estimates of $5.72B. However, a stronger dollar lowered the value of sales in overseas markets. Removing this unfavorable foreign exchange effect we see that sales would have grown 3.3% (operational basis).Source: Abbott Press ReleaseConsistent with third-quarter results, sales growth in the fourth quarter was driven by Diagnostics and Medical Devices. Worldwide Diagnostic sales grew 5.9%, driven by strong growth in Core Laboratory and Point of Care Diagnostics sub-divisions.Worldwide Nutrition, which is split almost evenly between Pediatric Nutrition and Adult Nutrition, declined 0.8% compared to fourth quarter last year. Abbott issued a voluntary recall on pediatric nutrition products in some international markets this past August, causing a disruption in sales. Removing currency effects, Nutrition grew 1.1% this quarter. However, this is very low considering that Nutrition has typically been a high-growth segment of Abbott's product mix.The company reported diluted per share of $0.58, up 22% from the prior year quarter and clearly a very strong result. Despite the recall and challenges in its generics business (which I previously discussed), Abbott was still able to post strong growth on both the top and bottom line.Looking AheadAbbott also issued its EPS guidance for the coming year, which was in line with analysts' expectations. However, Abbott's forecast for first-quarter earnings was significantly below analysts' expectations for the quarter ($0.34-$0.36 vs. $0.48 respectively). I believe this is what caused investors to grow concerned, and in turn led to a selloff in the stock.In addition, nutrition sales have definitely taken a hit, and Abbott's generics business is under pressure overseas. So there are some clear risks that investors should be accounting for when they evaluate the stock.However, Abbott issued ongoing EPS guidance for the full-year 2014 of $2.16 to $2.26. Not only is this in line with analysts' forecasts, it would translate into double-digit growth in the coming year. I believe this is a positive sign, especially considering the following comment from Abbott's CEO, Miles White:Dividend GrowthAbbott is a Dividend Aristocrat, an index of S&P 500 companies that have annually increased their dividends for 25 consecutive years. In this most recent year, Abbott increased their quarterly common dividend payment by 57%, to $0.22 per share. However, Abbott maintains a relatively low payout ratio of 38% based on current earnings. So Abbott's earnings should easily cover the dividend going forward, and the company may have room to expand it by simply raising their payout ratio.In addition, Abbott projects an increase in its share repurchases to more than $2 billion in 2014. This will have a net positive effect for dividend-growth investors. By reducing the share count, Abbott could continue paying the same total amount in dividend payments, but the per share dividend would be higher for investors who continue to hold shares in the company.ConclusionThe combination of strong, double-digit earnings growth, share repurchases, and a conservative dividend payout ratio, leads me to believe that Abbott can continue to build on its impressive history of steady dividend payments and increases. Furthermore, the stock is not overly expensive considering its PE ratio is currently below 15. Therefore, I believe long-term, dividend-growth investors should certainly give this stock a closer look.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1976001,57152,2014-01-29T09:14:31-05:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), a pharmaceutical and medical devices giant, has reported its fourth quarter and full year 2013 earnings. Unlike its peer Johnson & Johnson, Abbott did not post very impressive results missing analysts' estimates for its top-line growth. However, an expansion in the adjusted operating margin enabled the company to match the average analysts' forecasts regarding the per share earnings.Operational and Reported Sales GrowthAbbott generated global sales of $5.655 billion during the fourth quarter of 2013 and missed Wall Street's expectation of $5.72 billion. The YoY growth in total sales was only 0.4% on a reported basis. The company's sales were primarily hurt by the considerable negative impact of foreign currency exchange and continued fallout from a product recall that has damaged the company's baby-formula products in Asia.This sales disruption in pediatric nutrition products is estimated to have reduced sales growth in the international pediatric nutrition segment's sales by approximately $94 million during the fourth quarter. These lower sales were offset by the worldwide increase of 5% in the adult nutrition segment. The international adult nutrition segment's sales grew by 14%. Abbot's total sales in the nutrition segment increased by 1.1% on an operational basis and decreased 0.8% on a reported basis.Besides the aforementioned declines, a weakened European economy pressured sales of Abbott's generic drugs and resulted in a very slow growth in the Established Pharmaceutical division. Much of the company's pharmaceutical sales declined due to the spin-off of its branded specialty drug unit in January 2013. However, the segment's revenues were somewhat supported by the higher sales in key emerging markets. The total sales in the Established Pharmaceuticals division increased by 0.7% on an operational basis and decreased by 4.3% on a reported basis compared to the results of the fourth quarter of 2012.Abbott's other two divisions, diagnostics and medical devices, have shown healthy growth on both an operational and reported basis. The diagnostics division jumped by 8.8% on an operational basis and by 5.9% on a reported basis on the back of significant growth in the core laboratory diagnostics and point of care diagnostics divisions. The segment experienced continued above market growth in both the developed and the emerging markets.The revenues in the medical devices division were primarily supported by the higher sales in the medical optics and endovascular segments. The vascular and vascular product lines also supported the division's revenues. This growth was partially offset by a slump in the diabetes care and other coronary product segments' sales. The overall growth in this segment was 4.1% on an operational basis and 2% on a reported basis.In full year 2013, Abbott's sales increased by 3.70% on an operational basis and 1.60% on a reported basis. The full year sales were also impacted by the stronger dollar and overseas sales disruption earlier in the year in sales of its baby formulae. The main driver of the company's full year sales growth were the nutrition and diagnostics division whereas the established and medical devices division reported sales decreased in comparison to 2012's sales.Earnings GrowthDuring the fourth quarter of 2013, Abbott managed to significantly cut its selling, general, and administrative expenses and also reduced its research and development expenses compared to results of 4Q2012 through its cost-cutting initiatives. The reduction in expenses improved the company's year-over-year operating margin by 4.4%. The company's year-over-year operating income jumped by 48.8% and reached $757 million in 4Q13 compared to $509 million in 4Q12.The company's interest expense also considerably declined in this quarter as a result of a change in Abbott's capital structure after AbbVie's (ABV) spinoff. This expense dropped slightly more than 76% YoY. These factors along with a 0.4% growth in sales drove the company's after-taxes earnings from continuing operations to $589 million compared to a loss of $522 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 reflecting an increase of almost 13%.There were no earnings from the company's discontinued operations this time to compare to the earnings of $1,575 million in 4Q12 so the company's YoY net earnings declined by 44%.The diluted earnings per common share this quarter were $0.37 per share down by 43.9% but the diluted earnings per share from continued operations jumped 20.8% reaching $0.58 per share versus $0.48 per share in 4Q12.Like the results of the fourth quarter, Abbott reduced its SG&A and research and development expenses in full year 2013 and this improved the company's operating margin by 1.9%. The improved margin along with lower interest expense and a 1.6% growth in sales enhanced the company's full year after-tax earnings from continued operations by approximately 312% compared to 2012.But again, due to a much lower income from discontinued operations in 2013 the company's net earnings declined 15.3% year-over-year. Full year diluted per share earnings were $1.62 compared to $3.72 per share last year.Cash Returns to ShareholdersIn October 2013, Abbott's Board of Directors decided to raise the company's quarterly dividends by 57% to $0.22 per share. This dividend is payable on February 15, 2014. The company is a member of the S&P 500's Dividend Aristocrats Index that tracks companies that have increased their annual dividend for 25 consecutive years.In 2014, Abbott intends to grow its share repurchase program to more than $2 billion.Anticipation of Future SalesIt is expected that Abbott's sales in coming years will grow at a good rate on the back of favorable global demographics and healthcare trends. The growing aging population worldwide would enhance the sales growth in the adult nutrition segment and support the growth in the other three divisions as well.Besides that, Abbott's increased product launches, strong investment in research and development and expanding footholds in emerging markets through next generation products will increase the company's worldwide market share and help it to add considerable growth to the top line. The launch of iDesignDx system, the acquisition of Optimedica and the launch of MitraClip will boost the revenues of the medical optics segment and the diagnostics division that are already performing remarkably.This growth would offset the effect of declining sales growth in the Established Pharmaceuticals division. The growth in this division is expected to remain suppressed due to increased competition in the demand for generic pharmaceuticals.Sustainability of MarginsAbbott's management intends to continue its cost-cutting initiatives in the future and improve its margins as it did successfully in 2013. For the nutrition and diagnostic divisions the company intends to maintain an operating margin of more than 20% until 2015 through product and market rationalization, supply chain management, integrating manufacturing processes and cutting costs in product materials and packaging.For the Established Pharmaceutical division the company intends to achieve an operating margin of approximately 25% through optimization of global sourcing, its manufacturing network, and supply chain. Management also intends to implement operational efficiencies to offset pricing pressures in this division primarily in the developed markets.Final ThoughtsThe first feeling that comes to mind after looking at Abbott's results is the feeling of disappointment as the company's net earnings have declined 44% and the top line showed a growth of only 0.4%. However, in order to properly analyze the company's results the negative impacts of non-recurring items and events should be excluded. After analyzing the adjusted results, the company's performance during the fourth quarter and full year 2013 seems quite satisfactory. Despite lower earnings, due to lower discontinued operations income, Abbott continued its habit of increasing annual dividends every year.The performance is projected to be continued in 2014 based on the increased demand of the company's products and its cost-cutting initiatives that would eventually enhance the net earnings and shareholders' profits.Since the company has offered handsome profits to the investors in the past and intends to increase the profits in 2014 through cash dividends and share buybacks I would recommend buying the company's stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by APEX Financial Consultants.

1966331,44001,2014-01-24T12:51:06-05:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a portfolio of science-based healthcare products, which operates in four segments: Diagnostics, Medical Devices, Nutritionals and Generic Pharmaceuticals. The company reported earnings before the market opened on 22 Jan 2014 and on the surface everything looked pedestrian with the company reporting fourth quarter earnings of $0.58 per share (in-line with analysts' estimates) on revenue of $5.65 billion (missing analysts' estimates by $70 million). What I'd like to do at this time is delve into the weeds and pick out some highlights from different portions of the report to see if the stock is worth buying at the present time.Segment RevenueFrom third quarter of 2013 every segment of the company was hitting on all cylinders, on an annualized basis the smallest increase we would see is 12% in any one segment. Unfortunately things don't work that way. Nonetheless, I believe it was a great quarter for revenues albeit missing analysts' estimates.Income StatementThe main thing to notice on the income statement is the massive 16% reduction in R&D spending from fourth quarter of 2012 to fourth quarter of 2013. I definitely don't like to see that in a biotech company because a biotech company is only really as good as its R&D and pipeline really. Overall total operating cost and expenses decreased by 4% causing operating earnings to increase by 48% from the prior year. Earnings from continuing operations before taxes are now in positive territory as is earnings after taxes. Net earnings however have decreased 44% due in large part to the loss of earnings from discontinued operations which were realized in 2012. After a 2% reduction in outstanding common shares Abbott produced $0.58 in earnings this quarter and is a 22% increase from fourth quarter last year, which is an awesome gain.ConclusionThe company reported earnings which were 22% higher than a year before on slightly more revenue while the share price was up 14.32% in the past year excluding dividends. The share count has decreased slightly for the entire year. I definitely love that both earnings per share and revenue were up year over year. I don't like that R&D spending decreased for the entire year. So why did the stock drop after it reported you ask? It is quite possible that the stock drop was due to the 44% decrease in net earnings. Going forward though this shouldn't be an issue as the there shouldn't be the earnings from discontinued operations to be compared against. If that is really the case on why the stock dropped, then it is not justified and the drop should be bought. On a fundamental basis this biotech is fairly valued with respect to 2014 earnings. The company reported good results but investors were spooked by the net profit drop. The company also announced that it plans to retire another $2 billion worth of outstanding shares in 2014 which accounts for about 3.5% of the outstanding shares at today's market price. I for one don't think the company should be purchasing shares right now and wait for a gift from Mr. Market as I see the market pulling back right now. Personally, I've been contemplating selling my shares and moving into a different biotech company. I just don't know which one yet, and in the meantime, this is a great company to keep my money parked.Disclaimer: This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future.

2009721,44001,2014-02-10T21:25:29-05:00,,"The last time I wrote about Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) I stated, ""I'm going to avoid pulling the trigger here and wait to see how they report."" Since the last article it dropped 6.09% versus the 2.31% drop the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) posted. Abbott Laboratories is engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a portfolio of science-based healthcare products, which operates in four segments: Diagnostics, Medical Devices, Nutritionals and Generic Pharmaceuticals.On January 22, 2014, the company reported fourth quarter earnings of $0.58 per share, which was in-line with the consensus of analysts' estimates. In the past year the company's stock is up 7.99% excluding dividends (up 9.72% including dividends), and is losing to the S&P 500, which has gained 18.57% in the same time frame. With all this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to evaluate the stock on a fundamental, financial and technical basis to see if it's worth buying more shares of the company right now for the healthcare sector of my dividend portfolio.FundamentalsThe company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 24.45, which is fairly priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 15.04 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. The 1-year PEG ratio (1.98), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is fairly priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 12.37%. The company has great near-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 12.37%. In addition, the company has great long-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 11.7%. Below is a comparison table of the fundamentals metrics for the company for when I wrote all articles pertaining to the company.FinancialsOn a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. The company pays a dividend of 2.37% with a payout ratio of 58% of trailing 12-month earnings while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 8.4%, 17.4% and 5.2%, respectively, which are all respectable values. Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I don't believe the 2.37% yield of this company is good enough for me to take shelter in for the time being. Below is a comparison table of the financial metrics for the company for when I wrote all articles pertaining to the company.TechnicalsLooking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock bouncing off of oversold territory back at the end of January with a current value of 48.43. I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next. I see that the black line is just about to cross the red line with the divergence bars increasing in height, indicating some bullish momentum. As for the stock price itself ($37.16), I'm looking at $39.13 to act as resistance and the 200-day simple moving average (currently $36.08) to act as support for a risk/reward ratio which plays out to be -2.91% to 5.31%.Recent NewsConclusionAbbott is a good defensive company with a solid dividend yield and will grow slowly over time. Fundamentally the company is fairly priced based on future earnings and on future growth potential. Financially the dividend is secure and return on equity is increasing.

Since the last article it has lost 6.63% versus the 2.2% gain the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) posted. Abbott Laboratories is engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a portfolio of science-based healthcare products, which operates in four segments: Diagnostics, Medical Devices, Nutritionals and Generic Pharmaceuticals.On October 16, 2013, the company reported third-quarter earnings of $0.55 per share, which beat the consensus of analysts' estimates by $0.03. In the past year the company's stock is up 19.66%, excluding dividends (up 20.83% including dividends) and is losing to the S&P 500, which has gained 25.62% in the same time frame. With all this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to evaluate the stock on a fundamental, financial, and technical basis to see if it's worth buying more shares of the company right now for the healthcare sector of my dividend portfolio.FundamentalsThe company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 21.98, which is fairly priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 17.8 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. The 1-year PEG ratio (2.11), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is expensively priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 10.43%. In addition, the company has great long-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 12.24%. Below is a comparison table of the fundamentals metrics for the company for when I wrote all articles pertaining to the company.FinancialsOn a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. The company pays a dividend of 2.22% with a payout ratio of 49% of trailing 12-month earnings, while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 7.3%, 15% and 13.6%, respectively, which are all respectable values. Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I don't believe the 2.22% yield of this company is good enough for me to take shelter in for the time being. Below is a comparison table of the financial metrics for the company for when I wrote all articles pertaining to the company.TechnicalsLooking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock near overbought territory with a value of 68.54 and upward trajectory. I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next. I see that the black line is above the red line with the divergence bars flattening out in height, indicating the bullish momentum is losing steam. As for the stock price itself ($39.35), I'm looking at $39.80 to act as resistance and $38.96 to act as support for a risk/reward ratio which plays out to be -1% to 1.14%.Recent NewsConclusionThe market has moved considerably higher in the past year and if you want a safety play then I believe the defensiveness of Abbott is one stock to be in during the first quarter, especially since earnings season is encroaching on us. Fundamentally the company is fairly priced based on future earnings and expensive on future growth potential. Financially it pays a low dividend yield, but I believe it can be increased significantly again in the future. Technically I see the stock reaching a maximum price around here based on the RSI and MACD charts. I'm going to avoid pulling the trigger here and wait to see how they report.Disclaimer: This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future.

This is a company that has displayed stable earnings growth, a strong dividend history, and is currently trading at fairly low PEmg and PB ratios. Compare this to some similar companies such as Merck (NYSE:MRK), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), and Johnson and Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and you will find Abbott Laboratories to be the strongest of the bunch.However, from a valuation perspective the company appears to be overvalued at the current time. While the EPSmg (normalized earnings) have grown from $2.27 in 2008 to an estimated $2.85 for 2013, that level of historical growth does not support the market's implied rate of 2.27%. However, if the company can achieve a growth rate of around 3%, the current price would be fair. As a result, Defensive Investors and Enterprising Investors should keep a close eye on Abbott Laboratories to find a more opportunistic time to purchase.Disclosure: The author did not hold a position in Abbott Laboratories at the time of publication and had no intention of entering into a position within the next 72 hours."
2029911,61751,2014-02-19T01:43:44-05:00,,"Dividend growth investors are a group of individuals that fill their portfolios with stocks that have a strong history of increasing their dividends every year. The allure of dividend growth investing is pretty clear; every year you get more cash than you received the year before. That money received can either be used to live off of, or to buy more shares in dividend paying companies. The latter choice provides a strong compounding effect that dividend growth investors get to enjoy. Usually, companies with some of the strongest moats and most reputable brands form the foundation of a dividend growth portfolio.Take Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) for example. These two stalwarts have been raising their dividends every year for over five decades. Procter & Gamble has been paying a dividend for well over 100 years! These are the kind of companies you want to be the backbone of your DG portfolio. They are almost guaranteed to provide investors with annual dividend raises of 5-10%, which sometimes can be a higher raise than you receive at your day job! While 5-10% annual dividend raises are great, dividend investors need to have stocks with higher dividend growth rates as well. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) just might be that missing link in your portfolio that will add some high dividend growth in the next few years.I first became intrigued with Abbott Laboratories after reading how Grace Groner put $180 into the company in 1935 and turned it into $7,000,000 by the time she died. She demolished the returns of the S&P with a simple buy and hold strategy. However, that was the past and the future is what matters. While the rapid growth of Abbott is over, it still has strong growth ahead. After splitting off its proprietary pharmaceutical division, AbbVie (ABBV), Abbott Labs is now leaner and more focused on expanding its reach around the globe.The company has more than proved itself as shareholder friendly dividend stock with 359 consecutive dividend payments and 41 straight years of dividend increases. Even with that track record, many dividend growth investors have either sold off their Abbott shares post split or have been staying on the sidelines. Considering dividend growth investors search for companies that provide a growing stream of income from dividends, one would wonder why they would not love ABT. The reason a DGI may have shied away from Abbott was that its starting yield was too low. Many investors usually have a minimum yield requirement of anywhere from 2% to 3% for any given stock. The reasoning behind this is that they need the dividend income for life's expenses or to purchase additional shares of companies. However, after the recent 57% increase of the dividend to $0.88 annually, Abbott Labs is back on many investors' radars. It is a stock that definitely belongs in any DG portfolio and I'm expecting another large increase in the dividend in 2014 that investors will love.FundamentalsAbbott Labs is in great financial shape with cash keeping steady around $8-9 billion throughout the year and total debt also remaining steady around $7-8 billion. This is a great sign for two reasons. The first being that debt has not been increasing and the second is the net debt position is essentially zero. Additionally, EPS growth is estimated to be around 11-12% annually over the next 5 years which is excellent for the long-term investor.The strong growth of Abbott is a story of emerging markets and mostly low sales growth in developed nations. Mr. Miles White, CEO and Chairman, laid out his expectations for 2014 in the 4Q 2013 conference call. The global nutrition business is expected to have high single digit sales growth in 2014 due to strong demand. Three manufacturing facilities are expected to come online in 2014, one in China, India and the United States, respectively.The global diagnostics business is expected to see mid to high single digit sales growth. Abbott's vision care division is experiencing rapid growth and is expected to grow sales in the double digits this year. The generic pharmaceutical division is expected to see low single digit growth mainly due to foreign exchange. It should be noted that this business segment only operates outside the US, amplifying the exchange troubles since most other divisions are global.The diabetes care business is expected to have global sales about flat due to solid international growth, but a decline in US sales as a result of reduced reimbursement in healthcare as well as competition. From all of this, it is clear that Abbott is experiencing robust growth from almost every business segment and that should bode well for the future.Dividends and BuybacksABT Shares Outstanding data by YChartsAs you can see, Abbott's buybacks actually do reduce the number of shares, a feat which cannot be said for all companies. There is slight dilution from compensation, but it is minor compared to the buyback. As a result of the split in January of 2013, only Q1 through Q3 counts were included. In the Q4 results, Abbott pledged to repurchase at least $2 billion worth of shares in 2014. With a market cap of about $60 billion, a 2 billion dollar repurchase equates to about 3.33% of the outstanding shares.Right now at a share price of $38-39, the dividend yield is only about 2.3%. However, the most recent increase in its dividend was an enormous 57%, and I'm expecting another large increase in 2014. With its current dividend, Abbott will be paying about $1.36 billion a year (.22 cents * 1.54 billion shares * 4 quarters). According to the CFO Tom Freyman in the Q4 2013 conference call, the company is expecting to increase that payout to $1.7 to $1.8 billion for 2014. We can use this info to estimate the 2014 dividend raise.Considering the mammoth share buyback, I'm expecting Abbott to have about 1.51 billion shares outstanding by October 2014, the time of the year they usually raise the dividend. We will do the math reverse this time using the midpoint of $1.75 billion for dividends. $1.75 billion divided by 1.51 billion shares outstanding = about $1.16 per share. I expect the next dividend to be $1.16 plus or minus a few cents. This would equate to an outstanding 32% increase in the dividend.I have made a table of future yield on cost (YOC) with a couple of assumptions. In the dividend column, I used the estimated 2014 dividend of $1.16 that was calculated above (32% increase from the current dividend of $0.88). For 2015 through 2018, I assumed a dividend growth rate of 11% (in line with estimated EPS growth). Furthermore, I included a column of today's prices and one at a price I would like to buy the company at. As shown, a respectable yield on cost of around 5% can be reached in only a few years.*Table is no guarantee of future dividend raises. Future dividend amounts are educated guesses made by myself, not Abbott Laboratories management.ConclusionOver the next few years, the dividend increases of Abbott will most likely be higher than other safe names like Coke and Procter & Gamble. With a low payout and high EPS growth, ABT may be in a sweet spot of dividend growth. A good dividend growth portfolio should include strong companies with lower but still inflation beating dividend raises like PG and KO, yet it should also contain higher growth names like ABT. This will provide just the right mix of dividend raises for a conservative investor.The future is bright for Abbott Laboratories via solid EPS growth, rising dividends and strong buybacks. With analysts estimating 2014 EPS to come in between $2.16 and $2.26, the current price of Abbott coincides with a 2014 PE of 17-18. This is a little too rich for my tastes. If an investor waits for the $34-$35 per share range, they could buy Abbott with a 2014 PE of about 15. Additionally, if instead an investor wants to dollar cost average into ABT for free, they can through Computershare for as little as $25 per month. The new ABT is the definition of shareholder friendly and deserves a spot in your portfolio.Disclosure: I am long PG. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1862171,23479,2013-11-25T15:29:57-05:00,,"Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) is one of the largest healthcare firms in the U.S. It spun off its proprietary pharmaceutical division as Abbvie (NYSE:ABBV) earlier this year and is now left with four main business divisions - Nutritionals, Diagnostics, Vascular and Generic Drugs. In addition to these four divisions, it also has a portfolio of diabetes care, medical optics and other healthcare products.In some of our previous articles, we have discussed the Nutritionals, Diagnostics and Generic Drug businesses in detail, but the vascular division has received relatively less attention. In this article we take a closer look at the business. What Are The Major Vascular Products?Abbott's Vascular division is in the business of manufacturing and selling coronary, endovascular, vessel closure and structural heart devices. Some of its more notable devices include:In the U.S. these devices are sold directly to hospitals but in international markets Abbott may also use distributors, depending on the characteristics of particular markets.What Is The Vascular Market Like?We estimate that the global vascular market is around $12 billion, with some other estimates as high as $15 billion, and we expect it to grow at around 6% annually over the next several years. The market is extremely competitive, as several major players compete primarily on technological advancements, efficacy and price.What Is Abbott's Market Share?Abbott has been an innovator in this segment, but some of its products have remained under pressure over the last few years due to intense competition and new product launches by competitors. As a result its revenues have lagged the growth of the market and its market share has been steadily declining. According to our estimates Abbott's market share in the global vascular market declined from 32% in 2010 to 26% in 2012.Going forward, we expect the rate of decline in Abbott's market share to moderate as some of its newly launched products continue to grow. Specifically, we are optimistic about the future of products such as Xience, Absorb and MitraClip. Abbott has recently also acquired a stent manufacturing company called IDEV technologies to boost its market share.Here is a brief look at the division's products:Xience: Xience is Abbott's new range of drug-eluting stents. It comprises four sub-types: Xience V, Xience PRIME, Xience nano and Xience Xpedition. The company has been developing this franchise over the last few years, and it currently leads the drug eluting stent market globally. The franchise was one of the major revenue drivers of Abbott's vascular division in Q3 2013, and we expect it to continue doing so in the near future as it is launched in more countries.Absorb: Absorb is the first-of-its-kind vascular scaffold for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), the most common type of heart disease in the world. Its specialty is that it gets dissolved within the body after its useful life, thereby eliminating the need for a surgery to extract it. The device has seen impressive uptake in Asia despite its higher prices, and we expect that to continue in other markets when it launches there. Abbott started clinical trials for the product in the U.S. and Japan in January and June this year, respectively. [1]MitraClip: MitraClip is an implantable device for treating patients with mitral regurgitation, one of the most common heart valve conditions which affects almost 1 in 10 individuals aged 75 and older. It is already available in various markets following European CE Mark approval in 2008, and was recently launched in the U.S. in October. [2] The device has been proven to reduce re-hospitalization rates and improve the quality of life in patients, and we expect its sales to continue increasing going forward on the back of increased demand. [3]IDEV Technologies: IDEV Technologies is a stent manufacturing company that Abbott purchased in August this year for $310 million, net of cash and debt. [4] Its flagship stent, called SUPERA Veritas, already sells in Europe for treating blockages in blood vessels due to peripheral artery disease (PAD), a sickness that ails 27 million people in Europe and North America. In the U.S. this stent is under FDA review for the treatment of the superficial femoral artery (SFA), which is ""the largest and fastest-growing segment of the peripheral market driven by the rising rates of diabetes and obesity"". [5] [6] Once approved, we expect SUPERA to be as successful in U.S. as it is in Europe due to latent demand in the market.Disclosure: No positions."

Financially, the dividend return on assets and equity are deteriorating from a month ago. On a technical basis I believe the stock to be in overbought territory and can see a pullback due to profit taking opportunities courtesy of the monster price appreciation in the past month.

1783612,24491,2013-10-29T15:37:50-04:00,,"Abbott (NYSE:ABT) reported mixed third-quarter results as a supplier recall in August in its 'International Nutrition' business forced revenue to come up just a bit short of expectations. The firm's top-line still advanced 4.3% on an operational basis led by strength in its 'Diagnostic' segment, where revenue jumped more than 10% on an operational basis (shown below).Image Source: AbbottIts 'International Nutrition' business revealed sales expansion of 3.4% on an operational basis - not a terrible showing, but a marked slowdown from the 7% growth rate recorded during the first nine months of the year (third quarter inclusive) and the 8.4% pace registered in the second quarter. Though we're not too worried about this hiccup, we note the market disruption caused by the supplier recall may continue to hurt segment performance through the first half of 2014.Third-quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $0.55, above the previous guidance range, thanks to strong margin performance. Abbott's third-quarter adjusted gross margin increased 70 basis points in the period (above expectations), while its third-quarter adjusted operating margin advanced 210 basis points over the prior-year period. We continue to believe there is further upside to both measures as the firm rolls in recent acquisitions (IDEV Tech and OptiMedica) and its 'Nutrition' business recovers.Looking ahead, Abbott confirmed its full-year 2013 ongoing earnings per share guidance of $1.98 to $2.04, which is in-line with our $2.03 per share forecast. The company also raised its quarterly dividend to $0.22 per share, marking the 42nd consecutive year the firm has increased the dividend. We expect to update our dividend report with the new information soon.Valuentum's TakeThe firm's reaffirmed 2013 bottom-line outlook and freshly-raised dividend give us confidence that Abbott's fundamental performance remains on track. Though we didn't like news of the supplier recall that is expected to continue to hurt segment results into 2014, the firm's underlying portfolio of business segments remains impressive. We continue to like its leadership position in the 'Nutrition' segment with names such as Similac, Ensure, and PediaSure, and we're looking forward to emerging markets expansion to propel future growth across all of its business lines.

The company will be paying 22 cents per share compared to 14 cents per share in 2013.The company's stock delivers an admirable return to its shareholders. Apart from the dividends, the stock price grew 21.86% year-to-date from $29.8 to $38.19.Abbotts' management strives for increasing shareholder value and sustaining brand equity by implementing effective strategies like expanding its market share and improving margins. To expand its market share the company has launched new products and made acquisitions over the last few months. In this article I will analyze the company's strategies to improve its market and shareholders' value.Maintaining Leadership in Vision CareAbbott is highly focused on its $1.1 billion Vision Care segment. On December 17th, the company refreshed its refractive portfolio by launching the iDesign Dx system in the USA. The system provides ophthalmologists with the ability to capture five optical measurements in one three-second scan to determine a patient's visual abnormalities and improve the ophthalmologist's ability to measure ocular aberrations with accuracy, precision and greater dynamic range.The technology that Abbott has used in its iDesign Dx system was previously used by NASA to measure optics in space telescopes and reflects the efficiency and effectiveness of Abbott's device. This high level technology gives the company an edge over its rivals.The research suggests that the probability and prevalence of ocular diseases increases with age. As the aging population is increasing in the US so the number of sufferers of ocular diseases increases. However, ocular diseases also affect the younger generation because the use of computers in our lives has increased and the patients suffering from ocular aberrations are subject to visual blurring while using computers.These incidences show the rising demand for Abbott's new iDesign Dx system in the market. The device currently provides the most effective tool for diagnosis so I expect that it would increase future revenues for Abbott and negatively impact competitors' revenues.To enhance its leadership position in the vision care market Abbott acquired Optimedica. Abbott made the acquisition of this privately-held Silicon Valley-based ophthalmic device company in August 2013. Optimedica expands Abbott's business into the femto second laser-assisted cataract surgery market which is currently a rapidly growing market. Cataract surgery remains the number-one surgical procedure in the world. The global cataract market is projected to grow 3-4% annually mainly on the back of the increasing aging population. Abbott's cataract segment now represents about 60% of its Vision Care sales and continues to outpace market growth.Based on these circumstances I expect that Abbott's Vision Care business will add considerable value to its revenues in the coming future.Launch of MitraClipDuring October 2013, Abbott's MitraClip got approval from the FDA. The device provides breakthrough treatment options to physicians for patients suffering from degenerative mitral regurgitation ""MR"". The therapy can be offered to patients with comorbidities who are at high surgical risk and would not otherwise undergo surgery. The device is safe and effective even for the most ill and debilitated patients and causes a 73% reduction in rehospitalization for heart failure. More than 11,000 patients in more than 30 countries have been treated with the MitraClip device. Approximately 25% of high surgical risk patients currently being treated worldwide have degenerative mitral regurgitation and this remains a very important target population.Like the iDesign Dx system, MitraClip will also bring handsome profits for Abbott due to its high demand throughout the world and its effectiveness. It also provides Abbott with an edge over its competitors.Focus on Emerging MarketsCurrently, Abbott is expanding its business in the fast-growing emerging markets such as India, China, Brazil and Russia. In China the company is trying to double its market share of diagnostics business as China provides a market growth opportunity of 20% in the next three years whereas Russia and Brazil provide an opportunity to grow its market size by 6% and 10% respectively till 2016.The company will also expand its foothold in the emerging markets through its nutrition, medical devices and pharmaceutical segments and plans to introduce next-generation products in all of these segments by 2014. This expansion will help Abbott in offsetting the impacts of negative revenue growth of its pharmaceutical business.Improving MarginsBesides adding growth to its top line through new products and expansion into potential markets Abbott is also focusing on improving its margins to generate better profits. For its nutrition segment it intends to expand the operating margin to 20% compared to 15.7% in 2012 through product and market rationalization, supply chain management, integrating manufacturing processes and cutting costs in product materials and packaging.For its diagnostics segment the company expects to exceed its 20% operating margin by 2015. From 2007 to 2012 Abbott's management has successfully brought an expansion of greater than 1000 basis points to its operating margin in this segment.In its pharmaceutical segment the company's management expects an operating margin of approximately 25%. To achieve this strong margin profile the company continues to optimize its global sourcing, manufacturing network, and supply chain. The management also intends to implement operational efficiencies to offset pricing pressures primarily in the developed markets.During the first nine months of 2013 the company's operating margin improved by more than 300 basis points, compared to the same period in 2012, mainly due to a reduction in selling, general and administration expenses. SG&A expenses were reduced by 211 basis points.Performance in 2013During the first three quarters of 2013 Abbott's revenues increased by 2.1% on a year-over-year basis. The healthy revenues along with improved operating margins and lower interest expense augmented the company's net margins by around 700 basis points. The adjusted net margin in 2013 was 11.08% compared to 6.94% in 2012. The interest expense decreased as a result of lower levels of borrowings in 2013. However, the actual (non-adjusted) net margin during the first three quarters of 2013 was lower than the net margin in the same period of the previous year due to higher non-recurring earnings in 2012.This year Abbott significantly reduced its debt level as well. The company's debt-to-equity ratio by September 30, 2013 was 0.33 compared to 0.75 by December 31, 2012.Final ThoughtsAbbott is implementing really effective strategies to maintain its leadership position in the market and to further expand its share in the global market. To further add value to its bottom line results the company is effectively improving its margins. So, in my opinion, Abbott's profits in the coming periods will be considerably better than its profits during the first three quarters of 2013 thus giving shareholders the opportunity to increase their earnings.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by APEX Financial Consultants.

In this particular situation, Abbott Laboratories is nearly down 10% overall from where I have been dollar-cost averaging it. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a portfolio of science-based health care products which operates in four segments: Diagnostics, Medical Devices, Nutritionals and Generic Pharmaceuticals. On July 17, 2013, the company reported second-quarter earnings of $0.46 per share, which beat the consensus of analysts' estimates by $0.02. Since last writing about the stock back on September 9, 2013, the stock is down 0.99%, and is losing to the S&P 500, which has gained 0.07% in the same time frame. With all this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to evaluate the stock on a fundamental, financial and technical basis to see if it's worth picking up some more of the stock right now for the healthcare sector of my dividend portfolio.FundamentalsThe company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 13.22, which is inexpensively priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 14.89 is currently inexpensively priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. Next year's estimated earnings are $2.23 per share and I'd consider the stock inexpensive until about $33. The 1-year PEG ratio (1.11), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is fairly priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 11.07%. The company has great near-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 11.07%. In addition, the company has great long-term future earnings growth potential with a projected EPS growth rate of 11.87%. Below is a comparison table of the fundamentals metrics for the company from the last time I wrote the article to now.FinancialsOn a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. The company pays a dividend of 1.69% with a payout ratio of 36.3% of trailing 12-month earnings while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 7.4%, 16.3% and 1.3%, respectively, which are all respectable values. Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I don't believe the 1.69% yield of this company is good enough for me to take shelter in for the time being if I'm initiating a new position. Below is a comparison table of the financials metrics for the company from the last time I wrote the article to now.TechnicalsLooking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock muddling around in oversold territory with a value of 39.17 with flat trajectory, which does not tell us much. To confirm that, I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next and see that the black line is below the red line, but the divergence bars are also flat in height, meaning we can trade sideways in the stock. As for the stock price itself ($33.03), I'm looking at $33.73 to act as resistance and $31.88 to act as support for a risk/reward ratio, which plays out to be -3.48% to 2.11%.Recent NewsConclusionThe tougher approval procedure is the only news I could find which could have made the stock drop in the recent past. If that is the news that is taking the stock down then consider me a buyer. I believe it to be a broken stock and not a broken company at this point. Abbott is inexpensively valued based on future earnings and fairly valued on future growth prospects (one-year outlook). Financially, the dividend payout ratio is low based on trailing 12-month earnings and I don't doubt management will be able to continue to increase the dividend going forward at double digit clips. Based on future earnings, the dividend payout ratio goes down to around 25% (if the dividend is kept steady). The technical situation of how the stock is currently trading is telling me we might be seeing some sideways movement. The short-term earnings growth potential, long-term earnings growth potential and dividend growth potential are what I like about the company. I know this stock does not qualify for some of the dividend growth investors out there because the yield isn't high enough, but every great company has to begin somewhere. I'm going to be buying a big position right here in the midst of this pullback.Disclaimer: These are only my personal opinions and you should do your own homework.

1744052,54532,2013-10-14T13:17:09-04:00,,"The rapidly aging population, rising incidences of chronic diseases worldwide, increasing population and increasing prosperity in emerging nations will lead toward high growth in the healthcare industry. In emerging markets, healthcare investment is forecasted to double to 30 percent of the global healthcare over the next decade.These factors are expected to positively impact the financial position of Abbott Laboratories (ABT). Abbott Laboratories is the largest international healthcare company with the strongest foothold in the emerging markets. The company mainly operates in five segments: medical devices, diagnostics, nutrition, established pharmaceuticals and proprietary pharmaceuticals. At the start of 2012 Abbott split into two companies: AbbVie and New Abbott. Its research based pharmaceutical business became AbbVie while the diversified medical product businesses became New Abbott.The company has a very sound position in worldwide markets. It has a leadership position in immunoassay diagnostics, blood screening, worldwide adult nutrition, pediatric nutrition, branded generics and in the development of several medical devices.Based on Abbot's strong market position and the supportive industry conditions, it is expected that the company's stock has an upside potential offering investors a highly attractive opportunity to capitalize.Let us explore the historical performance of the company.Historic PerformanceAs a result of the favorable industry scenario, net sales for Abbott have increased over the years. In the last five years, the sales of the company grew at a CAGR of approximately 6.2%. In 2012 the growth rate plunged significantly but still remained positive. The reasons behind this plunge include a YoY decline in the sales of pharmaceuticals and vascular segments within the company. The revenues in pharmaceuticals and vascular segments were down by 4.36% and 7.86%, respectively, in comparison to 2011. Geographically, sales declined in the Netherlands by 10.67%, in Italy by 5.2%, in France by 10% and in Spain by 11.4%. The decline was offset by an increasing demand in the company's pharmaceuticals in other sales regions especially in the United Kingdom where the YoY revenue growth was 8.03%.Moreover, 56% of Abbott's revenues in 2012 were subjected to various forms of rebates and allowances which reduced its consolidated net revenues.In 2010, Abbott's revenues increased sharply due to increased sales of HUMIRA and the acquisition of Solvay Pharmaceuticals. This provided Abbott with a complementary portfolio and expanded its presence in the international market. The acquisition added approximately $3.1 billion to the company's net sales in 2010. Both these factors also considerably improved 2011 revenues.Management's EfficiencyAbbott's management has been successful in controlling its selling costs resulting in a continuously improving gross margin over the years. The margin has improved by approximately 20% from 2008 to 2012. In 2012, management took the initiative to streamline various commercial operations in order to reduce costs and improve the efficiency of the company's diagnostics, established pharmaceuticals and nutritional businesses. This resulted in the reduction of the costs of the goods sold, a reduction in research and development costs and selling as well as a reduction of general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales.The increase in the gross margin of 2011 was primarily due to the improved margins in the established pharmaceutical, diagnostics and diabetes businesses.Net margin of Abbott in 2012 was better than 2011 and 2010 but it is lower in comparison to 2008 and 2009. The factors affecting the net margin in 2012 include increased interest expense, a $1.35 billion loss on the extinguishment of debt and a $62 million loss for the impairment of certain equity securities. The interest expense increased to bridge facility fees related to the separation of AbbVie from Abbott. However, this was partially offset by a lower tax rate in 2012 compared to 2011 and 2010.The working capital turnover of the company has been worsening over the years. The ratio has declined to 2.21 times in 2012 as the working capital of Abbott has significantly increased in 2012 in comparison to prior years. The increase is due to the increased amount of cash generated from operating activities as well as additional income and investments from the net issuance of long-term debt due to the separation of AbbVie from Abbott. The lower turnover shows that Abbott has generated lower revenues compared to the money it uses to fund the revenues.The profits generated on shareholders' investments have improved in 2012 in comparison to 2010 and 2011 as a result of considerable improvement in 2012 net earnings.Future OutlookThe table below shows the projected cash flows of Abbott for the next four years. For valuation purposes, I have grown the revenues based on the global market outlook for all five segments of the company. The terminal growth taken was 1.5% as the company operates in a mature industry. I expect the company's net margins to slightly decline as the proprietary pharmaceuticals segment is expected to show the least growth in upcoming years. Interestingly, for Abbott proprietary pharmaceuticals is the most efficient segment. A lower demand for proprietary pharmaceuticals means declining margins for Abbott. However, despite lower margins, its net income growth would exceed the industry average.To calculate the weighted average cost of Abbot's capital, I have used the CAPM model. The beta used in the model is taken from Morningstar. The market risk premium of 6% is the consensus premium used in the US market and the risk free rate of 2.7% is the long-term yield on US treasury securities.The target price of the company equals $38.9 giving a potential return of more than 15%. The price is derived based on the above calculations of projected cash flows and the company's WACC. It is expected that the company's stock price would reach this level in the next year thus posing an attractive opportunity to earn goods profits on their money.I have tested the valuation of the company by using a sensitivity analysis based on various terminal growth scenarios and WACC regimes. The company's stock provides a maximum upside potential of 97% whereas under the worst case scenario it provides a downside potential of 19%.Since the company provides a high upside potential and a low downside potential I would give buy recommendation on this stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1759052,29491,2013-10-22T02:47:06-04:00,,"The third quarter financials of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), the largest international healthcare company based in the U.S., were released to the investing public in the early hours of Wednesday, October 16. The company's non-GAAP earnings of $0.55 per share exceeded analysts' consensus estimates of $0.51 by $0.04 which is quite good. The company also delighted shareowners with the announcement of a more-than-expected dividend hike with its massive 57% increase in its quarterly dividend payout to be distributed among its shareholders. If anything at all, the massive dividend hike which will mark the 42nd consecutive year the global health company has increased its dividend was the big news in Abbott's Q3 2013 earnings release leading to a jump in the price of the stock since the earnings were released last Wednesday.The price levels of the shares of Abbott Laboratories have since gone up by about 11% between Wednesday, October 16 when the results were made public and Friday, October 18. Undoubtedly, the increase in price levels signifies that investors were pleased with the performance of the company as reflected in its Q3 financials. There is every reason to believe that the shares of the company will see more momentum and price gains in the coming days, weeks and even months because of the impressive results the company posted and its generous dividend payout. Interestingly, the improved dividend payout will be distributed to shareholders on Feb. 15, 2014 and to all shareholders recorded in the book of the company at the close of business on Jan. 15, 2014. That makes allowance for non-shareholders who want to benefit from the dividend hike to take position in the company between now and Jan. 15, 2014. Existing shareholders have the opportunity to either book some profits at some favorable price levels by selling some portions of their current holdings or by buying more shares now to earn more dividends.Abbott's CEO and Chairman Miles D., while presenting the third quarter financials, delightedly informed shareholders that:Abbott's Q3 Results at a GlanceAccording to the press release detailing the Q3 financials, Abbott grossed a whopping $5.37 billion in revenues for the quarter under review. By the gross revenues, there was an increase of 2.0% on the company's results for the corresponding quarter of the previous year although the earnings slightly missed consensus by about $0.02 billion.Abbott's GAAP net earnings halved to $966 million but its net earnings from continuing operations increased by 128% to $173 million according to the earnings report. As stated above, Abbott's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter was $0.55 up by $0.04 per share when compared with the consensus estimate. The company reported that gross margins increased by 160 basis points to 54.4% of its total earnings. The company also reported impressive operating earnings of $630 million which represent 11.7% of its total revenues.Abbott's Potentials for Future GrowthAbbott's business is in five segments and they are: diagnostics, medical devices, nutrition, proprietary pharmaceuticals, and established pharmaceuticals. The company split into two companies - AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) and New Abbott - in 2012. In global healthcare markets, Abbott has sound footing by commanding leadership position in blood screening, immunoassay, adult nutrition, branded generics, pediatric nutrition, and in the design and development of many modern medical tools. In its 2013 Q3 results, Abbott's nutrition business recorded an increase of 1.9% in earnings with a total of $1.63 billion and sales in its diagnostics segment also increased by 8.0% to $1.12 billion. Also, in its 2013 Q3, Abbott's medical devices segment recorded an increase of 1.9% to $1.34 billion with growth influenced mainly by increased performance of its medical optics market but the company's earnings from its established pharmaceuticals fell by 2.9% to $1.23 billion which was largely due to the not-too-favorable currency movements.Abbott has successfully implemented very tight cost control in all major cost-related areas like selling, general and administrative expenses. In the 2013 Q3 results, Abbott's costs fell some 415 basis points to 32.3% of total revenues. In fact, Abbott's management has been excellent in controlling its costs leading to great improvement in its gross margin over the years which also necessitate a decrease in the costs of goods sold and in the costs of its R&D. Abbott's margin has continuously improved by an average of about 20% from 2008 to 2012. I do believe the company has the capacity to keep maintaining an improved upside potential into the foreseeable future. Therefore, I place a buy rating on Abbott.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1736632,38201,2013-10-09T12:27:55-04:00,,"Abbott (ABT) recently acquired two medical device manufacturing companies, IDEV Technologies and OptiMedica. Abbott closed the IDEV Technologies deal for $310 million and OptiMedica for $250 million. Both companies have a unique product with huge market potential. Abbott's Mitral regurgitation, or MR, treatment device MitraClip has received a favorable recommendation from FDA advisory committee. Also, the company recently announced a share repurchase program and consecutive quarterly dividend for the quarter, ended in September 2013.  Growing the inorganic wayAfter spin-off from AbbVie, Abbott is looking for new revenue drivers to increase its top-line. The above mentioned acquisitions bring two unique products with huge commercial potential. IDEV Technologies' Supera Veritas stent is a small mesh tube that is used for the treatment of narrow or weak arteries in peripheral artery disease, or PAD. PAD occurs when blockages build up in the arteries, limiting the free flow of oxygenated blood to the organs. This disorder can lead to heart attack. Supera Veritas' design is based on biomimetic principles; its strength and flexibility helps it to mimic the body's natural movement, which allows the blood to flow efficiently in the treated area. Abbott's conventional stent market is maturing, but the treatment of peripheral artery with Supera Veritas' stent opens a new opportunity for Abbott. From 2000 to 2010 the number of people with peripheral artery disease increased 24%, from 164 million to 202 million, worldwide. The product is already available in the European market and it is currently under regulatory consideration in the U.S.Abbott is expanding its vision care business with OptiMedica's Catalys Precision Laser System. This system is designed to allow surgeons to replace the technically demanding manual steps in cataract surgery with an image guided, femtosecond laser technology. The Catalys laser system has approval in Europe and is cleared by the FDA. According to WHO's estimates, by 2020 about 32 million cataract operations will be performed worldwide, which shows huge potential for the system.Both the deals are a good fit in Abbott's portfolio, and we expect a positive impact on Abbott's revenue from the first quarter 2014.After favorable vote, FDA approval is likely for MitraClipMitraClip is a device to treat MR, a heart valve deficiency that occurs when the heart's mitral valve doesn't close properly and allows blood to flow backward in the heart. If the mitral valve doesn't work efficiently, blood can't flow properly through heart to the rest of the body, and the consequences can be as serious as heart failure. MitraClip treatment involves implanting a metallic clip that connects the two leaflets of the mitral valve, which reduces the size of the valve opening, thereby reducing backwards bloodflow. MitraClip was originally developed by Evalve, which was acquired by Abbott in 2009.The device is approved in the European market and has been available for the past five years, but the FDA hasn't approved it for the U.S. market. However, in March this year the FDA advisory committee voted favorably for MitraClip, and we expect the FDA to approve the treatment by the first quarter 2014. About four million people in the U.S. suffer from Mitral regurgitation, and 250,000 new patients are diagnosed each year with moderate to severe mitral regurgitation.In a research published in JACC Journal on cost effectiveness of MitraClip compared to mitral valve surgery, the clip treatment proved more cost efficient. The research showed at the price of $18,000 per clip, Mitraclip reduced the treatment cost by $2,200 per patient. If approved by FDA and priced at similar levels, the product has huge commercial potential in the U.S. market.Another share buy-back programAbbott continues to deliver value to shareholders through its share buy-back program. On June 14, 2013, the company announced a new share repurchase program of up to $3 billion of its common stock. The new share repurchase program will replace the previous $5 billion buy-back program, which it announced in October 2008. The company took almost five years to complete the previous buy-back at an average yearly repurchase of $1 billion. Assuming the same pattern, we expect Abbott to take a maximum of three years to complete a new buy-back program.Consecutive dividends for 359 quartersOn Sep 12, 2013, Abbott's board of directors declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.14 per share. This is the 359th consecutive quarterly dividend announced by Abbott since 1924. Dividends are particularly important for investors to consider; since 1926, dividends have contributed over 50% of the total market return. The best performers in terms of consecutive dividend in the marketplace include Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Procter & Gamble (PG). Johnson & Johnson has grown its dividend for 51 consecutive years; the stock has a fair dividend yield of 3%, and Procter & Gamble grew the dividend for 57 consecutive years with the current dividend yield of 3%. In past 20 years, Procter & Gamble has increased its dividend extraordinarily by 776%, which means had you bought the stock in 1993, then you would have earned a yield of 33%. We think, in the long term, these stocks will provide great returns for income investors.ConclusionIDEV Technologies and OptiMedica are both a good fit in Abbott's portfolio. We expect the acquisitions to contribute positively to the company's revenue by the first quarter of 2014. Also, the favorable vote from the FDA advisory committee on MitraClip will expedite its approval in the U.S. market. The new buy-back program and consecutive dividends reinforces the company's commitment towards increasing shareholders' value. We expect the latest developments in Abbott will brighten the company's outlook, and we advise investors to stick with the stock for positive returns.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1779912,21877,2013-10-28T18:30:37-04:00,,"The FDA appears to be in an uncharacteristically benevolent mood, waving through Abbott Laboratories' (NYSE:ABT) mitral valve repair device MitraClip despite a barely positive panel vote back in March. Coming just ahead of the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics meeting in San Francisco this weekend, which will see several presentations on MitraClip, the approval is perfectly timed to gain cardiologists' attention and kick-start sales.Unfortunately, for Abbott, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) does not seem so generous. Analysts from Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) say that the limited reimbursement the CMS is likely to grant MitraClip will not be enough to cover the cost of the device, and it will be nearly a year before Abbott can do anything about it.PaymentsMitraClip is used to pin the mitral valve's two leaflets together, partially closing them, to prevent valvular regurgitation - the backflow of blood from the left ventricle into the left atrium. The FDA has approved its use in patients with significant symptomatic degenerative mitral regurgitation who are too sick to undergo surgery. This population has no treatment options, which explains how the device was approved despite the panel's ambivalence about its efficacy (Shock adcom endorsement for MitraClip but U.S. approval still a long shot, March 21, 2013).Reimbursement, however, looks set to limit sales in the short term. According to Deutsche Bank's Kristen Stewart, MitraClip is most likely to fall under the CMS category DRG 250, which covers percutaneous cardiovascular procedures without stent placement but with major complications or comorbidities (MCC), or DRG 251, which is the same but without MCC.The average Medicare payments under 250 and 251 are $17,330 and $11,447 respectively - MitraClip costs around $30,000. Abbott had applied for a new technology add-on payment, but was denied. The company can try again but, if the add-on granted, it will not come into effect before October 1, 2014.MitraClip has been approved in Europe since 2008 and sales should approach $140-$150m this year, Ms. Stewart said. U.S. sales in the first year - it will be launched immediately - could be even lower, thanks to the reimbursement situation.Down the line, Abbott is also seeking to expand the indications for which MitraClip may be used. The Coapt trial in the U.S. and the European Reshape-HF study are trialing the device in heart failure, which can be a consequence of mitral valve disease. Both trials have all-cause death and repeat hospitalizations due to heart failure as their primary endpoints. The completion dates are August 2016 for Reshape-HF and January 2017 for Coapt.Heart failure is a hard condition to treat and has many aetiologies, and medtech companies are attempting to tackle it through widely varying strategies. MitraClip's success in mitral regurgitation is rather a surprise; an approval in heart failure would be impressive indeed."

It however retained its portfolio of branded generic medicines (also called “established” medicines). This portfolio currently comprises well-known drugs such as Creon, Biaxin, Klacid, Klaricid, Influvac, Serc, Brufen, Synthroid, Duspatal, Dicetel and Duphaston etc.The drugs in this portfolio are exclusively sold in international markets (not in the U.S.). Specifically, Abbott is focused on growing this business in 14 key emerging markets. These markets currently comprise approximately 50% of its business’ sales today, and this proportion is expected to increase to approximately 65% by 2016.Within these emerging markets, the company is working toward increasing the breadth of its product offerings by launching new and improved formulations. At the start of 2013, Abbott was working on 20-30 key brands. Depending on the drug, its development effort focuses on new data, formulations, combinations or indications. It is also working on building country-specific portfolios to best meet the needs of each local market. These country-specific portfolios are likely to have its global as well as local pharmaceutical brands, depending on their suitability to the local market needs [10-K 2012, Abbott, December 31, 2012].The sales of Abbott’s generic pharmaceutical business have been declining in the recent past due to unfavorable macroeconomic conditions in Europe and Japan, partially offset by the growth in emerging markets. Sales for this division declined almost 4.4% in 2012. The trend continued in the first six months of 2013, as revenue dropped by 3.4% year-on-year.However, the company’s management expects low single-digit operational sales growth in the third quarter and beyond. The growth is likely to be driven by emerging markets, where Abbott has been working on expanding its portfolio and has recently won some tenders [Abbott Laboratories (ABT) CEO Discusses Q2 2013 Results – Earnings Call Transcript, SeekingAlpha, July 17, 2013].Abbott is also focused on improving its commercial execution in order to improve sales. It recently created two new commercial leadership positions – one for developed markets and another solely focusing on emerging markets. It is also working on increasing its brand awareness at hospitals, pharmacies, and with the end consumer. Additionally, it is looking to get its drugs registered in newer geographies. We forecast Abbott’s revenue from branded generic drugs to grow at low single digits for the next several years and reach around $6 billion at the end of this decade. A higher growth rate is unlikely because the generic drug market has intense competition and pricing of these medicines is always under pressure.Disclosure: No positions"
1584202,24491,2013-07-30T13:29:11-04:00,,"Global healthcare company Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) issued decent second quarter results that revealed the strength of the firm's international portfolio. Excluding changes in foreign exchange rates, worldwide sales advanced 4.2% thanks primarily to expansion in its international 'Nutrition' segment, which advanced over 18% on an operational basis (excluding currency) during the period. Growth in emerging markets, which now represent more than 40% of Abbott's total sales, was impressive, jumping more than 13% from the same period a year ago. Second-quarter adjusted gross margins of 55% and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.46 both came in ahead of internal projections. Year-over-year comparisons were difficult given the spin-off of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) at the beginning of the year. Abbott rolled out 24 new products in its 'Nutrition' segment during the period and launched the first HCV genotyping test as well as Tecnis. Overall, we thought the quarterly performance was decent, though the Abbott story very much remains an international (non-US) one.Image Source: AbbottPerformance in the company's 'Nutritional' segment was balanced, as pediatric and adult sales both advanced at a high-single-digit pace during the period, led by international expansion. The firm credited geographic expansion initiatives for pediatric nutrition growth and increased global Ensure demand for higher adult nutrition revenue. We have a high degree of confidence that international growth will continue to drive its 'Nutrition' segment and that Abbott will be able to achieve its target of a 20% segment operating margin by 2015.The firm's 'Diagnostic' segment enjoyed nice expansion across the board, though it, too, was led by international performance. 'Core Laboratory' diagnostic sales advanced roughly 6% on an operational basis (excluding currency), while strength in its two smaller subsets-Molecular and Point of Care diagnostics-was also apparent. All in, revenue in the segment advanced 7.6% on an operational basis (excluding currency), and we note particular strength in 'Core Laboratory' diagnostic sales in China and Russia, which jumped 30%. The firm also received approval for the first FDA-approved hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotyping test in the US, which will help expand the firm's 'Molecular' diagnostics portfolio.Performance in the company's 'Established Pharmaceuticals' segment was flat. Abbott continues to build its local product portfolios across a variety of expanding emerging markets, where operating revenue increased 4.4% in the period. However, a 3.4% operating decline in 'other markets' revenue driven by austerity measures in Western Europe largely offset the gain.The firm's 'Medical Devices' segment also was relatively flat during the period, revealing only a modest 0.2% growth rate on an operational basis (excluding currency). Abbott's 'Medical Optics' (primarily cataract sales) and 'Endovascular' subsets were the only two within its 'Medical Devices' segment to experience operational (excluding currency) sales expansion. The firm expects worldwide sales to continue to improve through the course of the year thanks in part to the recent launch of Tecnis in Japan and Tecni Toric in the US. Still, we continue to watch the firm's 'Medical Devices' segment closely, given recent performance at Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG).Looking ahead, Abbott confirmed its ongoing earnings per share guidance for the full year 2013 of $1.98-$2.04 (representing double-digit expansion). The bottom line will also be aided by the board's $3 billion share buyback program.Valuentum's TakeIt's hard not to like Abbott Labs. The company's leadership position in 'Nutrition' with Similac, Ensure, and PediaSure is impressive, while its 'Diagnostic' segment remains well-positioned for profitable growth. Emerging markets will play an even more important role in the firm's 'Established Pharmaceuticals' segment in coming years, and its 'Medical Devices' division has top 'Vascular' positions and an advancing new product pipeline in 'Diabetes Care.' However, the firm is trading almost at our fair value estimate (at the time of this writing), revealing little upside from a valuation standpoint.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1569282,31361,2013-07-24T17:02:07-04:00,,"In July, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) acquired Idev, a Texas-based privately held company for $310 million. Idev makes a stent to treat blockages in leg arteries.As demand and prices for heart stents continue to tumble, the $500 million market for peripheral artery disease market looks better every day as the next target. A blockage in the leg arteries affects about 27 million people in the U.S. and Europe, and it is fueled by rising obesity and diabetes rates.Supera VeritasIdev's Supera Veritas is a different class of stent. It is characterized by great flexibility and strength, a resistance to fracture and the ability to truly support the anatomy.Veritas' design is based on biomimetic principles: attempting to mimic the body's natural movement to promote blood flow in the treated area while offering strength and flexibility. These properties are especially important in the treatment of blockages of the blood vessels in the thigh and knee where rapid and frequent movement occurs with daily activities like walking, sitting and standing.The Veritas is a self-expanding nitinol stent built with six pairs of closed end interwoven nitinol wires with a closed cell geometry.Supera Veritas is already approved in Europe for use in the legs. In the U.S., it is cleared for treatment of biliary strictures (narrowing of a bile duct) related to cancer. For other uses, it is still under FDA review.In October 2012 during a VIVA (Vascular Interventional Advances) conference in Las Vegas, Kenneth Rosenfield, MD, presented findings from the Superb study.264 subjects were enrolled in 34 sites. The mean lesion length was 8 cm, with 73 percent of the lesions having moderate to severe calcification.Dr. Rosenfield reported that freedom from target lesion revascularization (NYSEMKT:TLR) and restenosis (a narrowing of a blood vessel), at 12 months was achieved in 79 percent of patients, easily exceeding the performance goal of 66 percent.The primary safety endpoint was composite of all death, TLR, or any amputation of the index limb to 30 days, which was achieved in 99.6 percent of subjects, a significantly higher rate than the goal of 88 percent.Independent core lab review of x-rays showed a stent fracture rate of 0 percent. Responses from Peripheral Artery Quality-of-Life Questionnaires showed a positive impact on the quality-of-life for patients treated with Veritas stents.MarketThe increasing prevalence of PAD is expected to place a heavy economic burden on the healthcare system. In patients with PAD, fatty deposits accumulate on the inner wall of the artery, causing blockages that reduce the flow of blood to lower parts of the leg. Patients with PAD can experience leg pain when walking and, if untreated, the disease can progress with severe consequences such as critical limb ischemia and amputation.PAD usually affects men over age 50 and women over 65. Smoking and diabetes add to the risk. About eight million Americans have PAD, many of whom are not even aware they have the condition.Many PAD patients aren't aware they have the disease because they may initially overlook the most common symptom, leg or foot pain while walking. In advanced stages, PAD carries a threat of amputation and even death.Because leg arteries are subject to different physical forces than coronary arteries, some treatments derived from heart disease aren't as effective when applied to PAD.Beyond the advice to quit smoking and eat healthy foods, there are three main treatment options for PAD patients: a drug called cilostazol (manufactured by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. under the trade name Pletal), the only medication specifically approved for the condition; a supervised exercise program; and procedures to clear arterial blockages, or to create a bypass around the blockages, to improve blood flow to lower legs and feet. Most patients also get drugs to lower cholesterol and blood pressure to reduce overall cardiovascular risk.Few devices are available for treating PAD and doctors sometimes have little choice. The Wall Street Journal quotes a doctor as saying:""Sixty to seventy percent of what we do in the vascular territory is off-label use.""The strategies for treating PAD are just emerging and their benefits remain to be proven with further study, he also said.ZilverWith only one drug-coated peripheral stent approved in the U.S., and subsequently recalled, a bare metal device like Supera Veritas could help Abbott carve out a niche.In April, 2013, a recall was issued for Cook Medical, Inc.'s Zilver PTX Drug-Eluting Peripheral Stent, including all sizes, diameters, and lot numbers manufactured or distributed starting December 1, 2012.Complaints focused on the separation of the tip and inner catheter, which could impose additional surgery on patients to remove the catheter tip. Failure to do so can create thrombosis, amputation, possible cardiac arrest, and death.In Europe, Zilver PTX has been available since September 2009. Cook is a private company and does not release sales figures, but Zilver PTX has met with success in clinical trials and uptake ought to have been good.Cook had huge hopes for the product and the recall was a disaster.Cook says it has altered its manufacturing process to fix the problem, but it will take time to get the FDA to sign off on the new system.One factor in Cook's favor is the paucity of alternatives. The other possible options for treating the peripheral arterial disease include balloon angioplasty, bare-metal stents, drug therapy or surgical bypass. Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) and C. R. Bard (NYSE:BCR) are developing drug-coated balloons for peripheral arterial disease, but no other drug-eluting stents are likely to reach the U.S. for many years.BalloonsAn up and coming idea is the use of drug-coated balloons without stents.Newer-generation balloons include a carrier designed to ensure that the drug remains attached to the balloon until it has been inflated and facilitates penetration into the tissue. Studies show that paclitaxel (the drug used in coating) remains in the tissue for days or weeks, even months, thereby producing a long-term effect. No hardware is left in the body.So far, all the balloons to reach the market employ paclitaxel to guard against the vessel re-narrowing.In coronary stents paclitaxel has been largely replaced as a coating material by the more effective 'limus mTOR inhibitors, (sirolimus, everolimus and novolimus). The reason that the mTOR inhibitors have not made a quick transition to the drug coated balloons is that, unlike paclitaxel, they are not absorbed quickly enough by the vessel wall.Drug-coated balloons will have a good shot at the U.S. market. The leading balloon, Medtronic's IN.PACT Admiral, is slated for U.S. approval for peripheral artery disease in 2015. By that time Zilver PTX stent probably will have returned to the market, but the recall may have left a bad taste about the technology among doctors.CompetitionThe delay between European and U.S. approval of medical devices is notorious and it is called the ""device lag."" No such lag exists in the approval of drugs.The lag averages around three to five years. Zilver PTX, for example, saw a three-year delay, but with drug-coated balloons, it will probably be a lot more.Analysts at Goldman Sachs say that by 2017, Medtronic and CR Bard will hold leadership positions in drug-coated balloons, with 39 percent each of the worldwide market, which will then be worth $500 million. This is a small change compared to the drug-coated stent market, which already stands at $4.5 billion and is growing.In the peripheral arena drug-coated balloons could do well, better than in coronary artery disease where the competition is heated and the field is crowded.Investors' summaryAnalysts at Cowen point out that greater emphasis on peripheral vascular opportunities is key to Abbott's growth. The company has launched a version of Xience called Xience Prime BTK (below the knee) for critical limb ischemia in Europe, and is also pursuing CE mark for a below the knee version of the Absorb, its dissolving drug-coated stent.Abbott's vascular products had a worldwide market share of 32 percent in 2010, according to analysts at Trefis, but this declined to around 26 percent in 2012. The company must know that the Idev acquisition alone cannot reverse this trend, though it will presumably improve it a little.In the second quarter Abbott's total sales were $5.45 billion. Excluding currency impacts, mostly the effect of a weaker yen versus the U.S. dollar, sales grew 4.2 percent.Abbott Labs reported a profit of $476 million and the operating margin rose to 11.5 percent from 10.6 percent.The company's largest business is nutritional products, which includes baby formula and adult drinks marketed under the Ensure brand. Excluding currency impacts, nutrition sales rose 8.4 percent, while the company's diagnostics business reported sales growth of 7.6 percent.Abbott's device business badly needs new directions and innovations and this must have been the thinking behind the Idev purchase. Further actions in the same direction are needed and presumably coming.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1551712,21877,2013-07-16T18:16:55-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is working hard to increase its market share in the various med-tech sectors in which it operates, but over the past few years it seems to have been able to do little more than cling on to what it already has. In a clear stab at achieving that elusive expansion, Abbott has bought the stent developer IDev Technologies for $310 million and ophthalmic laser firm OptiMedica for $250 million plus a potential $150 million in milestones. Peripheral vascular technology and cataract surgery are both fast-growing areas, but competition is increasing all the time, and Abbott could find itself running as fast as it can just to keep up.Clear-EyedThe Catalys Precision Laser System Abbott has obtained through the OptiMedica acquisition was cleared by the FDA a year ago, and is also CE marked, for making incisions into the lens in cataract removal surgeries. Most cataract surgeries are performed by hand, but the greater precision offered by lasers means they are growing in popularity. Currently, Abbott's cataract device sales represent 60% of its total medical optics sales -- putting them at around $600 million worldwide in 2012 -- and are growing faster than the market, the company said, boosted by more than 30% growth in emerging territories.On the vascular side, the purchase of IDev brings the Supera Veritas peripheral stent. With the coronary stent market full to bursting and dominated by drug-eluting stents, chief among them Abbott's own Xience family, peripheral stenting is becoming the new battleground. With only one drug-eluting peripheral stent approved in the U.S. -- and subsequently withdrawn -- a bare metal device like Supera Veritas could help Abbott carve out a niche. A version of Supera Veritas gained 510(k) clearance from the U.S. FDA in May for use in the bile duct rather than the blood vessels. The vascular version is awaiting premarket approval (PMA) for the much larger opportunity of peripheral artery disease in the superficial femoral artery.Clean-LimbedAnalysts from Cowen have pointed out that greater emphasis on peripheral vascular opportunities is key to Abbott's growth. The company has launched a version of Xience called Xience Prime BTK (below the knee) for critical limb ischaemia in the EU, and is also pursuing CE mark for a below-the-knee version of the Absorb, its dissolving drug-eluting stent. Abbott's vascular products had a worldwide market share of 32% in 2010, according to analysts at Trefis, but this declined to around 26% in 2012. The company must know that the IDev buy alone cannot reverse this trend, though it will presumably help to alleviate it a little.Both deals are expected to close by the end of the year, and neither will affect Abbott's 2013 earnings forecast, the company said. These deals are moves into hot areas, but they are unlikely to do a huge amount to turn Abbott's problems around. In the first quarter of this year, the company's vascular and diabetes sales dipped 7.7% and 0.5%, respectively, compared with the first quarter of 2012, and its medical optics business, which includes devices for refractive and corneal applications as well as for cataracts, was down 0.6%. The company's shareholders appear to have drawn their own conclusions about what these deals mean for Abbott. Its share price rose less than 1% on the news."
1554722,21820,2013-07-18T07:05:28-04:00,,"Yesterday, pharmaceutical and nutrition giant Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) reported second quarter earnings. The company's earnings per share came in ahead of forecast, thanks to strong emerging market and international growth. The company earlier announced two acquisitions throughout the week that will help grow business units and boost weakened domestic sales.In the second quarter, Abbot Laboratories saw earnings per share of $0.46. This came in slightly above analysts' forecasted $0.44. Total revenue of $5.45 came shy of analysts' estimate of $5.52 billion. Excluding foreign exchange rates, total revenue increased 4.2%. The company saw strong growth in both nutrition (+8.4%) and diagnostic (+7.6%).In the second quarter, emerging market sales grew to $2.3 billion, an increase of 13.4%. International sales in the nutrition segment grew 18.4%, thanks to the launch of Abbott products in several new regions.Here is a look at financials:The company's largest business segment (nutrition) saw declines of 3.1% in the United States. Internationally, the unit was another story with sales increasing 18.4%. The international segment of nutrition posted almost $1 billion in sales and represents the future of Abbott.Despite worries of pricing in China, Similac and Pediasure continue to be leaders around the world in the infant formula market. Abbott Laboratories is number one in the United States market and is on its way to the number one share in many other regions.Other highlights from the quarter include:· Launched 24 new products in Nutrition segment.· Received FDA approval for first Hepatitis C genotyping test.· Approval and launch of TECNIS Pierce Intraocular Lens for cataract patients.· Announced 358th quarterly dividend, $0.14.· New $3 billion share repurchase program.Two acquisitions were announced this week by Abbott Laboratories. Both were stated as having no immediate impact on fiscal 2013 earnings per share. However, going forward, I think both will power growth in the United States and international markets.Abbott announced its acquisition of IDEV Technologies for $310 million. The privately held company is a medical device company used by radiologists, vascular surgeons, and cardiologists. The company has a self expanding stent system that treats blockages related to peripheral artery disease. The product, which is approved in Europe, helps to prevent re-blockages successfully. In the United States, the product is only cleared for the treatment of biliary structures related to cancer. In the United States, the device is pending the approval from the FDA for the treatment of superficial femoral artery. Obviously, Abbott sees the potential sales from new uses for the device, pending United States approval.Over 1500 patients were studied in trials. The company believes there are 27 million people in North America and Europe who suffer from peripheral artery disease, who could benefit from IDEV Technologies devices.Abbott's other acquisition was OptiMedica, a privately-held company focusing on ophthalmic devices. Abbott paid $250 million upfront, with the possibility of $150 million in additional milestones. The company has a precision laser system that allows surgeons to replace some manual steps in cataract surgery. As a very complex surgery, doctors use the devices for better precision and accuracy. The devices are approved in Europe and North America.Abbott has a line of monofocal, multifocal and toric intraocular lenses. Cataract sales made up 60% of Abbott's vision care segment. In the second quarter, the company's medical optics unit had sales of $97 million in the United States and $183 million in international markets. Total sales of $280 million actually dropped from last year, with a 0.8% drop in the United States and 1.4% drop in international sales. OptiMedica also has a 3D laser device, which was recently given a patent for its technology.This was a huge acquisition for Abbott Laboratories. In 2013, 22 million cataract surgeries are expected to be performed around the world. With the technology of OptiMedica, combined with Abbott's existing products, the company will be a leader in vision for an aging population. Cataract surgeries are performed on people generally aged 65 to 70. I expect this acquisition to boost the medical devices segment going forward and having a material impact on earnings per share in 2014. I look forward to hearing more about this integration on future earnings calls. This is a deal that will payoff for Abbott Laboratories.For fiscal 2013, Abbot Laboratories re-confirmed guidance of $1.98 to $2.04 in earnings per share. Analysts on Yahoo Finance are forecasting full-year earnings of $2.01. Analysts see full-year revenue of $22.4 billion. In fiscal 2014, analysts expect earnings to increase to $2.24 on revenue of $23.7 billion.Year-to-date, shares of Abbott Laboratories are up 11.8%. Shares still trade down from their adjusted 52-week high of $38.77. I think with the spin-off of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) and a much narrower focus on Nutrition and Vision products, Abbott Laboratories is set for strong growth ahead. This is a great play on population growth (infant formula), aging population (medical devices, vision products), and international pharmaceutical growth.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1551332,25120,2013-07-16T15:14:46-04:00,,"Shareholders in Abbott Laboratories (ABT) are awaiting an eventful week. On Monday, the company announced two deals to further expand its operations.On Wednesday, investors will get a chance to see how the company has performed in the second quarter. Irrelevant of the outcome of the second quarter results, and the nice additions which the firm has made, shares offer little appeal on the back of premium valuation multiples.As such, I refrain from making an investment. This does not automatically translate into a short thesis as I don't see a catalyst for a correction at the moment.IDEV TechnologiesAbbott announced that it has reached an agreement to acquire IDEV Technologies. Abbott will pay $310 million net of cash and debt for the privately held company. IDEV focuses on the development of next-generation medical devices used by radiologists, vascular surgeons and cardiologists.The company's products include SUPERA Veritas which treats blockages in blood vessels due to peripheral artery diseases. Veritas is cleared for treatment related to cancer and is currently being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The treatment is currently not approved in the US but has been studied on more than 1,500 patients.The deal is expected to close by the end of the year, and will not materially impact 2013's earnings.OptiMedicaAbbott announced that it has reached another agreement to acquire OptiMedica Corporation. Abbott will pay $250 million net of cash, plus additional payments of up to $150 million. Contingency payments are dependent upon achievement of certain milestones for the privately held company.With the acquisition, Abbott will expand its vision care business in the femtosecond laster-assisted cataract surgery market. OptiMedica's Precision Laser System allow surgeons to replace manual steps during cataract surgery with a precise, computer-guided laser technology. The system has obtained the CE mark in Europe and has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration.Some 22 million cataract surgeries will be performed in 2013 and the aging world population will boost demand going forwards.Again, the deal will be expected to close by the end of the year. The deal will not materially impact the 2013's full year earnings per share guidance.ValuationAbbott Laboratories ended its first quarter with $8.52 billion in cash, equivalents and short term investments. The company operates with a total of $7.10 billion in total debt, for a net cash position of around $1.42 billion. All in all, Abbott has sufficient liquidity to finance the deals.For the first quarter of 2013, Abbott generated revenues of $5.38 billion which is up 1.8% on the year. Earnings from continuing operations advanced by 4.6% towards $674 million. The company is predicting normalized earnings per share of $1.39-$1.45 for the full year, implying that earnings come in around $2.2 billion. Full year revenues could come in around $22 billion.Trading around $35 per share, the market values Abbott around $55 billion, or its operating assets just below $54 billion. As such, operating assets are valued around 2.5 times annual revenues and 25 times annual earnings.Abbott pays a quarterly dividend of $0.14 for an annual dividend yield of 1.6%.Some Historical PerspectiveAbbott Laboratories has split itself up on January the 1th of 2013. The biopharmaceutical division which is best known from its Humira drug, which treats rheumatoid arthritis, got split up as AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). Abbott itself is now completely focused on medical devices, nutritional products and diagnostics, among others.Shares of the company trade with year to date gains of 8% after reaching highs of $38 in May of the year. Shares have fallen a bit, currently trading around the $35-$36 mark.Investment ThesisIt is quite an eventful week for shareholders in Abbott as the company does not only report the news of the two acquisitions. The firm is due to report its second quarter earnings on Wednesday as well.The company guided for earnings from continuing operations of $0.27-$0.29 per share. Including $0.16 per share in special items, Abbott could report earnings of between $0.43 and $0.45 per share.OptiMedica which will be bought for up to $400 million is a competitor of Bausch & Lomb, which has been bought by Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX) earlier this year. Abbott already sells lenses involved for cataract surgery and care.John Capek, which leads Abbott's medical division, said the laser products could generate annual revenues of several hundred million dollars in five years time. The usage of laster procedures could increase from a current 20% of cataract surgeries, towards 70% in three or four years times.The $310 million addition of IDEV, which is known from its Supera Veritas stent system, seems nice as well. The product treats blockages of blood vessels due to artery disease. The product could generate annual revenues of a few hundred million in a dollars as well in a couple of year's time.The reported price tag of $560 million for the company's combined represents just 1% of Abbott's market capitalization. The valuation seems fair given that Abbott expects to see rapid revenue growth in the year's coming forward. The company furthermore gets the hand on two interesting products and technologies.Both eye care and peripheral artery are growth markets with an aging and increasingly obese societies in Europe and the U.S.Overall the additions seem very fair, but investors will be looking forward to Wednesday's earnings. Shares trade at premium valuations, at 2.5 times annual revenues and 25 times annual earnings. These are premium valuations, supported by solid growth rates, a history of increased dividends and a solid balance sheet.At these levels shares are fairly highly valued, a bit too high to my taste. I refrain from making an investment in the company on the back of the outlined valuation motives. I am hesitant to short the stock as well. While the valuation is high, it is not excessive. I don't see an immediate catalyst for a short thesis as well.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1681002,44001,2013-09-09T09:09:04-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of a portfolio of science-based health care products which operates in four segments: Diagnostics, Medical Devices, Nutritionals and Generic Pharmaceuticals. On July 17, 2013, the company reported second-quarter earnings of $0.46 per share, which beat the consensus of analysts' estimates by $0.02. Since last writing about the stock back on July 5, 2013, the stock is down 2.19% excluding dividends (down 1.8% including dividends), and is losing to the S&P 500, which has gained 2.46% in the same time frame. With all this in mind I'd like to take a moment to evaluate the stock on a fundamental, financial, and technical basis to see if it's worth buying some more of the company right now for the healthcare sector of my dividend portfolio.FundamentalsAbbott currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 13.34, which is inexpensively priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 15.02 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. Next year's estimated earnings are $2.23 per share. The 1-year PEG ratio (1.18), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is fairly priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 11.22%.FinancialsOn a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. Abbott pays a dividend of 1.67% with a payout ratio of 36.3% of trailing 12-month earnings (or 32% based on free cash flow) while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 7.4%, 16.3% and 1.3%, respectively, which are all respectable values but nothing to go writing home about. Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I believe the 1.67% yield of this healthcare company is good enough for me to take shelter in for the time being.TechnicalsLooking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock muddling around in oversold territory with a value of 33.52 with upward trajectory, which is a bullish pattern. To confirm that, I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next and see that the black line is below the red line, possibly about to cross above the red line with the divergence bars increasing in height to the upside indicating the stock is about to have upward momentum. As for the stock price itself ($33.50), I'm looking at $34.54 to act as resistance and $32.02 to act as support for a risk/reward ratio, which plays out to be -4.41% to 3.1%.Recent NewsConclusionAbbott is fairly valued based on future earnings and on future growth prospects (one-year outlook). Financially, the dividend payout ratio is low based on trailing 12-month earnings and on free cash flow, but I don't doubt management will be able to continue to increase the dividend going forward; based on future earnings the dividend payout ratio goes down to around 25% (if the dividend is kept steady). The technical situation of how the stock is currently trading is telling me we might be seeing some upward pressure. The bullish technicals, earnings growth and safe dividend are what I like about the company. I know this stock does not qualify for some of the dividend growth investors out there because the yield isn't high enough, but every great company has to begin somewhere. Also, if you were fortunate enough like I was to own Abbott before the spin-off of Abbvie (NYSE:ABBV) and you held onto Abbvie you are getting rewarded handsomely from that perspective with a 3.65% yield and 25.4% capital appreciation since the split.Disclaimer: These are only my personal opinions and you should do your own homework. Only you are responsible for what you trade and happy investing!Disclosure: I am long ABT, ABBV. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
1751112,25120,2013-10-17T11:58:56-04:00,,"Shares of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) jumped up on Wednesday after the company reported its third-quarter results. While non-GAAP earnings quite comfortably beat consensus estimates, it was the aggressive dividend hike, which received applause from investors.I do suspect that shares might see some momentum in the coming weeks or months on the back of the solid results and the dividend hike. Yet I remain on the sidelines as I don't see convincing upside from these current levels.Third-Quarter ResultsAbbott Laboratories generated third-quarter revenues of $5.37 billion, up 2.0% on the year before, but slightly missing consensus estimates at $5.39 billion.GAAP net earnings halved to $966 million. That being said, last year's earnings included earnings from discontinued operations of $1.60 billion. Net earnings from continuing operations rose by 128% to $773 million.Abbott reported adjusted earnings of $0.55 per share. Analysts were looking for non-GAAP earnings of $0.51 per share.GAAP earnings from continuing operations rose from $0.21 per share last year to $0.49 per share over the past quarter. Note that last year's earnings were negatively impacted by cost reduction programs. CEO and Chairman Miles D. White commented on the third quarter results:Looking Into The Results...As noted above, Abbott reported a 2.0% increase in total revenues. In local currencies, sales were up by 4.3% as adverse currency movements shaved off 230 basis points in revenue growth.Despite the revenue growth, the absolute costs of goods sold fell in dollar terms. Consequently, gross margins rose some 160 basis points to 54.4% of total revenues. Abbott also showed very tight cost control in selling, general and administrative expenses, which fell some 415 basis points to 32.3% of total revenues.As a result, operating earnings more than doubled to $630 million, representing 11.7% of total revenues.Looking Into The Divisions...The nutrition business reported a 1.9% increase in revenues towards $1.63 billion. In constant currencies, revenues would have been up by 3.4% driven by a solid performance of pediatric and adult nutrition sales. A sales disruption through a supplier recall impacted sales by a sizable $90 million over the quarter and will hurt sales in the coming quarters as well.Diagnostics sales rose by 8.0% to $1.12 billion as they rose by 10.5% in local currencies. Sales rose across the board with revenue growth in the mid-double digits in the smaller molecular and point of care business.Established pharmaceuticals revenues were down by 2.9% to $1.23 billion, which is entirely explained by adverse currency movements. In local currencies revenues were up by 0.6%, driven by a solid performance of the emerging markets.Medical devices saw a revenue increase of 1.9% to $1.34 billion, including 2.0% currency headwinds. Notably the medical optics market performed really well.ValuationUnfortunately Abbott Laboratories did not provide a balance sheet for the third quarter yet. The company ended its second quarter with $9.39 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments. Total debt stood at $7.93 billion, for a net cash position of almost $1.5 billion.Revenues for the first three months of the year came in at $16.2 billion up 2.1% on the year before. The company reported GAAP earnings of $1.99 billion, down 59.5% on the year before. Note that non-GAAP earnings actually rose by 13.6%.At this pace, annual revenues should come in around $22 billion, while the company guides for ongoing earnings of around $2 per share, and GAAP earnings of around $1.50 per share, or around $2.3 billion.Factoring in gains of over 6% on Wednesday, with shares exchanging hands at $36.00 per share, the market values Abbott at $56 billion, or its operating assets around $55 billion.This values the company at 2.5 times annual revenues and roughly 23-24 times annual GAAP earnings.Abbott increased its quarterly dividend by some 57% to $0.22 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 2.4%.Some Historical PerspectiveAt the start of the year, and after quite some preparations, Abbott was finally split up. Former Abbott Laboratories consisted of Abbott and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV). Abbott is now focused on diagnostics, medical devices and nutritionals, among others, while AbbVie is a pure pharmaceutical company.Since the start of the year, when the companies have been separated from each other, AbbVie has been the clear winner. Its shares have seen year-to-date returns of around 37%, while shares of Abbott are trading with gains of 10%.Investment ThesisObviously, the big news in the earnings release is the big 57% dividend hike, boosting the dividend yield to a more appealing 2.4% at the moment. Note that investors will only receive this higher dividend halfway during February. Both the decision to raise the dividend, and the size of the hike, came as a surprise, which positively surprised the market.Based on the solid non-GAAP results, Abbott is sticking to its full-year earnings target of $1.98 to $2.04 per share, suggesting shares trade around 17-18 times earnings.This seems a bit rich given the 2% reported headline growth but note that Abbot has had some setbacks, including currency headwinds, which shaved off over 2% in revenues, and the recall of milk formula brands in China. This recall hurt sales of nutritional products by $90 million in the quarter. So excluding these items, revenues would have risen by 6% while Abbott has a long history of showing solid revenue growth.While the recall will still affect operations in the coming quarters, the effect of the recall and adverse currency movements will continue to diminish in the coming quarters. Looking through these short-term headwinds, Abbott was actually performing reasonably well, especially in its diagnostics business.Back in July, when Abbott announced the acquisition of IDEV Technologies, I last took a look at the company's prospects. At the time, Abbott furthermore announced the acquisition OptiMedica for a combined value of up to $560 million.I concluded that shares were fairly valued, or even a bit expensive according to my taste. Ever since, the company has taken some measures to improve cash flows to shareholders. The company announced a $3 billion share repurchase program in June and now announced a dividend hike, which boosted the dividend yield to 2.4%.If Abbott executes its repurchase plan within two years, the repurchases could represent another payout of roughly 3% per annum to shareholders, for combined payouts of some 5.5%. This seems quite attractive given that Abbott's core markets continue to grow at a healthy 5-7%, driven by solid emerging market presence.Trading around $36 per share I see the possibility for shares to re-test year-to-date highs of around $38. That being said I don't see shares going much higher than those levels, or possibly $40 per share in the remainder of this year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1535992,44001,2013-07-05T14:49:19-04:00,,"The Japanese yen has been having violent swings of late; we saw it go from a low of 94.29 yen/dollar to a high of 100.59 yen/dollar just in the past month! With this weakening in the yen once again versus the U.S. dollar, what does this really mean to companies such as Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)? I believe it means bad news for American companies (such as Abbott that) export their products to Japan and depend on that market; the stronger dollar makes their products more expensive. Abbott logged about 22% of its 2012 sales in Japan, equating to roughly $8.6 billion in sales to the land of the rising sun. In addition to a falling yen you have the great Chinese baby formula fiasco of 2013. These issues are pretty critical to the bottom line of the company and with that in mind I want to evaluate on a fundamental, financial, and technical basis if it's worth buying more of the stock right now.(Click to enlarge)FundamentalsAbbott currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 10.41 (value excludes Abbvie earnings), which is priced inexpensively, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 15.25 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. Next year's estimated earnings are $2.25/share. The PEG ratio (0.86), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 5-year horizon), tells me that Abbott is inexpensively priced based on a 5-year EPS growth rate of 12.02%.FinancialsOn a financial basis the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. Abbott boasts a dividend of 1.64% with a payout ratio of 38.8% while sporting return on assets, equity, and investment values of 9%, 20.9% and 1.3% respectively; which are all very respectable values. If maybe you feel the market will retract a little more and would like a safety play I don't believe you should hide in Abbott for the dividend yield, but you should hide in it for its long term growth potential.Technicals(Click to enlarge)Looking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock nearing oversold territory with a value of 35.19 with a downward projection; this tells me that there may be a little bit of downside to the stock. To confirm that, I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence (MACD) chart next and see that the black line is below the red line with the divergence bars flattening out in height, indicating the stock may trade side-to-side shortly before what I believe to be a move up in the stock. As for the stock price itself ($34.25), I'm looking for the 200-day moving average to act as support. If the stock can bounce off the 200-day moving average, I can see it going to $35.74, but if it can't, I see it going down to $32.79 for a risk/reward of -4.26% to 4.35%.Recent NewsConclusionAs you can see from the two graphs I included in this article the stock price and the falling yen are strongly correlated; when the yen/dollar ratio goes up then the stock price goes down. When you add the complication about the Chinese formula story you have a more than expected drop in stock price. With these items in mind, I believe Abbott to be valued inexpensively with great double digit growth estimates and room to grow its dividend. On a technical basis I consider the stock to be leveling out around here in oversold territory and see this as a huge buying opportunity. I might be stretching it a bit here when I say that this scenario is similar to the London Whale scenario that embroiled JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) this time last year, or the U.S. government suing Standard & Poor's (MHFI) at the beginning of this year, but those two moments in time proved to be awesome buying opportunities for those two companies making me believe this baby formula fiasco to be an excellent buying opportunity for Abbott. I'm going to put my money where my mouth is and pick some up right here.Disclosure: I am long ABT, ABBV, JPM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

As these companies begin to report a sizable earnings growth, Moody's has established its outlook for the industry as stable. It has also been stated that the outlook may even be improved to positive if the expected EBITDA growth exceeds 4%. This outlook, however, is highly dependent up on the pricing situation in Europe. Acquisitions are also expected to take full swing as some of the companies have deleveraged their capital positions after large transactions and are now set to pursue further growth.Stock PerformanceAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is among the prominent players in the industry with a market capitalization of $59.2 billion and total revenues of $39.97 billion in FY12.Source: BloombergThe above chart shows the stock price of Abbott and its close competitors, Medtronic Inc. (NYSE:MDT) and Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK) in the past three years. The chart clearly reflects upon the outperformance of Abbott against its competitors.Growth Strategy:The improvement in the stock price has occurred because the company pursues an aggressive growth strategy with more than 30 medical devices and 150 product launches scheduled for FY13. Also, 40% of the company's sales come from emerging markets. In FY12, the company announced its aim to improve the emerging markets sales proportion to 50% by FY15. At the same time, unlike its former subpart Abbvie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), the company has not taken up unsustainable proportions of financial risk to support its growth strategy.Data Source: MorningstarThe above chart shows the research and development costs incurred by the company in the last six years. We see that a substantial improvement has occurred in the focus on research and development as indicated by the trend line. The emphasis on this growth aspect has proved to be prolific for the company has these costs have clearly contributed to the revenue and asset growth of the company. The revenues of the company have reported a CAGR of 7.8% and the total assets have shown a CAGR of 12.2% since FY08.Source: Annual Report FY12The table above provides a detailed business segment analysis. Proprietary pharmaceuticals are the largest contributor to the company's revenues and total assets. Amongst the smaller sections of the company's business operations, the growth appears to be triggered from the nutritionals segment as the net sales in the past three years have increased by 16.97% and total assets increased by 10.45%. The operating earnings of this segment also reported a 31.1% rise as compared to FY10. Moving forward, analysts believe that the nutritionals segment will serve as the key growth driver due to expansion in the product's market.Financial StabilityAbbott Laboratories' consistent profitable performance has been supported by impeccable financial stability as the company has maintained its liquid assets and limited the financial risk to a manageable degree.Source: Abbott LaboratoriesThe above chart shows some key ratios which measure the financial risks of the company since the beginning of FY10. The debt to equity ratio has been restrained showing that the company is careful when it comes to leveraging in order to support the company's growth. At the same time, the current ratio of the company and the free cash flows to firm have demonstrated a substantial improvement over this period as the company's profitable operations continue to contribute to strengthen its liquidity position.Comparative AnalysisIn order to address the investor's viewpoint in this situation, a comparative analysis has been conducted using important valuation metrics and investor consideration indicators. This will reflect upon the potential of the company in a forward looking aspect.Data Source: MorningstarThe above table shows key valuation metrics of Abbott Laboratories and two of its competitors, Medtronic and Stryker Corp. along with the industry averages. The analysis clearly shows that Abbott Laboratories growth aspects have not been priced by the market as the company remains undervalued against its competitors and the industry average in terms of all valuation statistics. Furthermore, the company's dividend yield of 3.4% is unmatched across its competitors and the industry which shows the high degree of emphasis on addressing investor's return.ConclusionThe pharmaceutical industry is on its way towards recovery. Increasing demand from emerging markets is likely to support this recovery due to economic progress. Technological innovations and new products will also further the growth in the market. The prolific growth strategy of the company, coupled with the efficient management of financial resources will extend the upswing of the company's stock price. This will further be supported by the substantial undervaluation of the company and the stock will prove to be a profitable venture of equity investors. Taking these factors into consideration, a buy recommendation is proposed as Abbott Laboratories prepare to experience aggressive growth in the coming future.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1409301,44001,2013-05-07T13:09:31-04:00,,"Prior to the spinoff of Abbvie (NYSE:ABBV) from Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) in early 2013 the joint company used to pay a pretty good dividend of 2.83% and post-split Abbott now pays a 1.52% yield while Abbvie pays a 3.58% yield. The aggregate of the companies delivers a quarterly dividend rate of $0.54 as opposed to the $0.51 rate prior to the split. After the split Abbott retained the generics pharmaceutical and nutritional business, which should drive growth for the stock price and the dividend for the future. If you want a very good example of a nutritional company that did well after a spin-off you don't have to look any further than Mead Johnson Nutrition (NYSE:MJN). Mead Johnson is up nearly 200% and pays a dividend yield of 1.68% since being spun off from Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) back in 2009.Some Abbott products you may recognize include Pediasure, Prevacid, Ensure and Blink. Abbott reported most recently on April 17, 2013, and closed that day +2.42% with adjusted EPS up 3% while revenue was up 3.5% (excluding foreign exchange) based on strong performance in the nutrition and diagnostics segments as well as emerging markets. As the emerging market populations all over the world begin to get wealthier the first thing they will begin to do is eat healthier and/or eat richer. By eating healthier you can count on Abbott nutrition bars to be consumed such as Glucerna or Zone Perfect. For the people whose stomachs have long yearned for eating rich and unhealthy foods you can almost count on heartburn to occur and Abbott has an answer to that in the form of Prevacid. Whichever way you want to look at it, emerging economies are growing and their people have been salivating for quite some time just to be able to eat some developed economy foods; Abbott has answers in the nutrition side of the business.During the month of April Jeffries Group reiterated its buy rating on the stock while raising the price target from $40 to $42. Deutsche Bank also reiterated its hold rating but raised its price target from $33 to $35. Stifel Nicolaus also maintained a buy rating but increased the price target from $40 to $44. Several other firms maintained their ratings on Abbott and also increased their price targets. The constant reiteration of the rating but small incremental increases in price targets shows that analysts are not willing to stick their necks out too far but are willing to say the stock will move upwards. That's what I like to call ""being cautiously optimistic.""Though Abbott reported earnings that were in-line and guided in-line for the next quarter it is in a defensive sector and everybody is going to continue to run to the stock for safety in case of a market downturn. Personally I believe the stock is actually a growth company with the emerging markets story and would continue to buy it for the growth story as opposed to safety. The company's history of raising the dividend sure doesn't hurt either. I've been accumulating Abbott from before the split with Abbvie but I will certainly be buying more of it because I believe in the emerging markets nutritional story; I once used to own Mead Johnson for the same reason.Disclosure: I am long ABT, ABBV.

1535162,23479,2013-07-05T07:00:52-04:00,,"Established in 1888, Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) is a diversified healthcare conglomerate with a global presence. The company spun off its proprietary pharmaceutical business as Abbvie (NYSE:ABBV) earlier this year and now operates in four main segments: Nutritionals, Diagnostic, Vascular and Generic Pharmaceuticals. In addition to the above mentioned segments, the company also has a portfolio of Diabetes and Medical Optics products.The company looks very different since the split, without the massive proprietary pharmaceutical business. Accordingly, we have launched a new model for the firm in order to fully capture its new structure and business environment. The remainder of this article discusses the key drivers that we believe will drive the company’s stock going forward. We have a $38 price estimate for Abbott, which is around 10% ahead of the current market price.Growth In Emerging MarketsWe expect the most significant tailwind assisting Abbott’s top line for the next few years to be the growing demand for its products in emerging markets. Countries like China, India, Russia and Brazil continue to grow at a faster rate than most developed economies, and have a rapidly growing middle class. For example, McKinsey & Company predicts that the urban-household income in China will double by 2022 and that the majority of its urban consumers will earn between $9,000 and $34,000 annually by that time. [1] As the middle class continues to grow in these markets, people are likely to increase their focus on healthy living and increase their discretionary spending on nutritional products (food supplements) and point-of-care diagnostics.Further, as emerging markets grow, governments (and people) in these countries are also likely to focus more on the use of sophisticated testing platforms in order to stave off infectious diseases, cancers and cardiovascular problems. This is likely to drive the demand for new diagnostic products for many years to come.Given the huge opportunity, Abbott has been heavily investing in emerging markets. Under its current plan, the company intends to increase emerging markets revenue as a percentage of total revenue from 40% today to around 50% in 2015. [2]Continuous Investments In R&DAbbott has been continuously investing in its R&D centers in order to develop new and more innovative products. It has opened six manufacturing and R&D facilities in its nutritional and pharmaceuticals businesses in the Asia Pacific region during the past three years, including three in China. The new R&D centers situated in emerging markets are especially beneficial for the company’s nutritional business because these centers can help develop products that better meet the local needs and preferences of consumers in these countries. The company’s investments in R&D have already resulted in a 5x increase in the number of new nutritional products launched annually since 2008 and a 10x increase in both clinical trials and patent applications. If even some of these new products gain the favor of their target audience, we expect the company to grow at a faster rate than the market itself.Within the diagnostics division, the company is developing six next generation systems from the ground up based on customer needs and market analysis. [2] As more of these products are launched, we expect the company to continue increasing its market share in the diagnostics market also.Currently we forecast Abbott’s R&D expenditures to remain at 6-7% of revenue for the next few years as it continues to develop new products. However, we expect the figure to start declining over the long term as more and more of the company’s R&D work is happening in low-cost centers like India and China. The company currently projects that by 2016 more than 35% of its R&D staff will be located in high growth emerging markets like China and India.Drive For Efficiency And ScaleWhile Abbott’s top-line is expected to continue growing, the company is constantly looking to reduce its costs in order to maximize margins. The new manufacturing units that are being built by the company around the world are deliberately located nearer to the markets they are intended to serve. This is likely to reduce Abbott’s distribution and logistics expenses significantly when these plants become operational. Further, these plants are designed to be more efficient and use the latest technology that improves yields and, as a result, margins. The company is also looking into its raw material and packaging material costs in order to improve its gross margins.On the distribution side, Abbott started selling its products directly to its customers in several of its markets. It recently acquired its distributor in Vietnam, which is its largest nutrition business outside of the U.S. and China, and will from now on reach out to customers directly in this market. We believe that with a focus on reducing logistics costs and by removing middlemen, the company will able to make gradual improvements in its margins going forward.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
1497092,31361,2013-06-12T11:49:48-04:00,,"Stent sales are not doing so great these days.In the first quarter of 2013 Abbott Laboratories' (NYSE:ABT) sales of medical devices fell 4.6% to $1.33 billion, with revenue from stents and related vascular products down almost 8% to $742 million due largely to price pressures in the United States. Innovation is possibly the key way out of this predicament. One important new product in the field is the dissolvable stent.Abbott LabsAbbott's Absorb stent was the first dissolvable stent for the coronary artery disease that is made of plastic. It now has competition: Elixir Medical's DESolve and Boston Scientific's (NYSE:BSX) Synergy, two CE-approved implants that are gaining traction on the back of positive study data.Absorb, the world's first drug-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS) has been available since September in more than 30 countries across Europe and parts of Asia-Pacific and Latin America. Absorb is not yet approved for sale in the U.S. Abbott calls Absorb a ""scaffold,"" suggesting that it is a temporary structure -- unlike a metal stent, which is a permanent implant. The scaffold provides support to the blood vessel until the artery can stay open on its own, and then dissolves naturally.Absorb is made of polylactide, a naturally dissolvable material that is commonly used in medical implants such as dissolving sutures. The potential benefits of a scaffold are significant. The vessel may expand and contract as needed to increase the flow of blood to the heart in response to normal activities, such as exercising. Also, treatment and diagnostic options are broadened, the need for long-term treatment with anti-clotting medications may be reduced, and future interventions would be unobstructed by a permanent implant.Absorb has been a bit slow being accepted in Europe, but it has been a success in India. The Times of India reports that doctors have implanted more than 2,500 Absorb stents since the device's launch in late September, spread across 250 centers in 45 cities. Cardiologists told the newspaper that user demand is driving the quick adoption, as patients -- lured by Absorb's promise to dissolve in the artery after about two years -- request the latest technology in their procedures. Patients seem to like the idea that the implant leaves no metal in the body.From the Times article:If the device's popularity in India is any indication, the company will have no trouble reaping revenue around the world. Abbott is also likely to be first in the U.S. market, since it has started an FDA-targeted trial of 2,250 patients in January. The study will compare Absorb to Abbott's well-established Xience stents, aiming to duplicate the positive safety and efficacy data of the device's five previous studies.ElixirWhile Abbott Laboratories leads the way in the dissolvable stent market, Elixir Medical is right on its heels, winning a European approval for its DESolve device. In a six-month trial of 126 patients that ended last year in October, the completely dissolving stent effectively propped open the blood vessel with a low 3.25% rate of major adverse cardiac events. The company announced the results at the recent EuroPCR conference in Paris.This brings Elixir closer to rival stentmaker Abbott. But Elixir has its hand in a few different stent markets as it is the only company with three CE-marked drug-eluting models: the biodegradable DESyne, the durable polymer DESyne, and this one, the DESolve. Elixir believes its device, which dissolves faster than Abbott's, has a chance to carve out a share of the market. The company believes that DESolve's ability to maintain radial strength, self-appose to the nominal vessel wall, and return patients to normalcy after one year will put it at the forefront of the dissolvable stent market.Elixir is using novolimus coating, a novel m-tor inhibitor that is an active metabolite of sirolimus, the drug that was used in Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) Cypher stent and that has a well-established safety profile. But novolimus has added features of being able to better penetrate the tissue and on a more consistent basis, which means the stent coating can be loaded with a lower drug dose. Elixir plans to start selling a broad range of DESolve stent sizes around the world later this year. The company hasn't said whether or when it will pursue FDA approval for the device.Elixir Medical is a Sunnyvale, Calif.-based privately funded company. The lead investor is the Invus Group, a large New York-based equity investment firm.Boston ScientificBoston Scientific's Synergy, the company's first foray into the dissolvable stent market, has so far proven just as effective as the company's long-running Promus Element, showing rates of 1.1% target lesion revascularization and 0% stent thrombosis after two years. That 1.1% revascularization figure is well below Promus Element's 6.1% rate, Boston Scientific notes, suggesting that the absorbable device could provide long-term benefits over traditional polymer-coated stents. Both devices are CE marked, but are yet to be approved by the FDA.The Synergy stent is coated with a bioabsorbable PLGA polymer and everolimus drug combination to create a low initial weight, ultra-thin, uniform coating that is applied to the outer surface of the stent. PLGA stands for copoly lactic acid/glycolic acid and it is a superior material for sustained-release formulation.Investor SummaryIn the first quarter of 2013, Abbott Lab's worldwide sales increased 3.5%. Sales were driven by 9.0% operational sales growth in Nutrition, including 14.8% international growth, and 6.4% operational sales growth in Diagnostics. Worldwide vascular sales were $742 million, down 7.7% from a year before. Within that, revenue from the drug-eluting stents and bioresorbable vascular scaffold product portfolio amounted to $387 million, down 4%.Abbott is projecting EPS for full-year 2013 of $1.98 to $2.04. The company was first with a dissolvable stent internationally, and it is on its way to being the first in the U.S. market. Abbott's management believes Absorb is the key to growth for the whole vascular business. While the device's European adoption is taking a bit longer than the company anticipated, CEO Miles White has said he's confident Absorb will become a ""workhorse"" stent for the company over time.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1379461,44981,2013-04-28T05:51:19-04:00,,"At the start of the year, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) completed its separation with the research based pharmaceutical business into a separate publicly traded company, called AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV). The spinoff clearly separated the business into two bodies with different approaches to the future growth. Following the separation, the stock price of Abbott has demonstrated an appreciation of 12.88%. On the other hand, AbbVie stock has had a steep rise, and the stock has gone up by more than 34% since the start of the year.Since the company's incorporation in 1900, it has expanded its range of business activities. It is currently involved in the discovery, development and production of a variety of healthcare products. The nutrition segment is the largest source of revenues for the company as it contributed to approximately 31% of sales in the first quarter of 2013. The revenues in general are fairly distributed among all business segments, which also include diagnostics, established pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Similarly, after the spinoff, Abbott has also become substantially diversified with respect to regional risk as it only conducts 30% of its operations in the US and 30% in other developed markets. The remaining 40% of its business comes from emerging markets creating a stable geographical distribution of revenues.Post Spinoff PerformanceIn the first quarter of 2013, Abbott reported a 1.8% rise in net sales to a total of $5.38 billion, which missed analyst estimates by a slight margin. As compared to the first quarter of 2012, the revenues from the nutrition segment increased by 8.7%. The diagnostics segment also showed an increase of 4.4%, whereas established pharmaceuticals and medical services showed declines of 1.9% and 4.6%, respectively. The company reported earnings of $0.42 per share, showing a 5% increase as compared to the first quarter of the last year. These results reflect a fairly decent performance of the company as it delivered on its budgeted performance. The company has also forecasted annual earnings ranging between $1.98 and$2.04 per share.What will drive the Future growth?The approach to expand emphasis on global operations coupled with the manageable levels of debt in the capital structure of the company, direct towards a stable outlook of the company. The long-term growth prospects of the company also appear to be robust. The operating margins of the stronger business segments, nutrition and diagnostics, are expected to expand during the current year. Furthermore, the company has already registered a substantial benefit from its geographical diversification as the growth in emerging markets is driving revenues. In fact, exploring emerging markets seems to be at the forefront of Abbott's growth strategy as Miles White, CEO of Abbott, said in an earnings call that a bad day in the emerging markets still turns out to be better than a good day in developed markets.What should Investors Expect?With the prospect of increase in demand, growing revenues are likely to have a positive impact on the stock price. From a fundamental view point, the company is operating at a P/E of 11.03 as compared to the industry average of 29.98. Abbott's P/S of 1.6 is also substantially below the industry average of 4.87. Currently, the company offers a decent dividend yield of 1.6% -- a large increase in capital return is not expected from the company in the short-term. However, Abbott has announced a periodic increase in its dividends. There are better investments available in the market if the motive is to collect dividends. However, the prospect of steady future growth make Abbott an attractive investment.ConclusionThe company aims to expand its operations and create a global presence by improving its product portfolio and exploring emerging markets. This strategy of the company to pursue long-term profitable growth, coupled with considerable undervaluation and a growing return to investors, makes it an attractive investment for long-term investors. Abbott is a mature company and it is likely to have steady single digit growth. On the other hand, AbbVie is growing rapidly, and it can prove to be a solid short-term investment. AbbVie's stock is likely to move up sharply compared to Abbott's. At the moment, the pharmaceutical sector is looking towards the emerging markets for the future growth, and Abbott's strong presence in these areas will give the company an edge over its peers.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1359461,35521,2013-04-22T16:09:15-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) engages in the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of healthcare products worldwide, operating in four business segments: Established Pharmaceuticals Division (NYSE:EPD), Medical Devices, Diagnostics and Nutritionals. Despite mixed global economy, ABT continues its growth from emerging market, led by the nutritional segment.Strong Q1 ProfitFor Q1, 2013, sales increased 1.8% to $5.38B, which was slightly below analysts' expectation of $5.42B. However, without the research-based pharmaceuticals business, which spun out as AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) at the beginning of the year, ABT reported earnings of 42 cents a share, beating analysts' consensus by a penny. Management also confirmed the full-year 2013 ongoing EPS outlook, which is for double-digit growth at the mid-point of the range. Despite a mixed global economy, ABT managed to deliver its current growth expectations and management expects to see some improvement in the second half of 2013.Emerging MarketsABT continues to expand in the emerging markets, where the demand for healthcare and nutrition is going rapidly. In Q1, more than 40% of total sales were in emerging markets with strong growth seen in China, India, Russia and Vietnam. Management expects to expand ABT's emerging market sales to more than 50% of total sales over the next few years. Driving growth in emerging markets remains a key priority for ABT. By 2015, management expects to more than double ABT's presence in China, which is the largest and fastest growing nutritional market in the world.Margin ExpansionThe operating margin for Q1 was in line with management's expectation, and the company is on track to delivery about 100 basis points of expansion for 2013, where nutrition and diagnostics are driving much of the improvement. Nutrition is expected to improve at least 300 basis points for 2013.OutlookThe management confirmed ongoing EPS guidance of $1.98 to $2.04, reflecting double-digit growth over 2012 at the midpoint of the range. The management forecasted an ongoing adjusted gross margin ratio for 2013 of approximately 55%. Overall, the management continues to project expansion of the full-year adjusted operating margin by around 100 basis points in 2013. For Q2, 2013, management is forecasting ongoing EPS of $0.35 to $0.45 with mid-single digits of operational sales growth.Analysts' Calls and EstimatesOn April 19, 2013, RBC Capital Market reiterated an outperform rating with a target price of $38 (up from $37) for ABT. On the same day, Jefferies also raised estimates and its price target on ABT from $42 to $43. The firm commented,Analysts currently have a mean target price of $39.65, suggesting 6.59% upside potential based on the closing price of $37.20 on April 19, 2013. Analysts, on average, are estimating an EPS of $2.02 with revenue of $22.51B for 2013. For 2014, analyst are projecting an EPS of $2.26 with revenue of $23.84B, which is 5.90% higher than 2013.Fundamentally, ABT's key stats will be compared to its peers in the industry of medical devices, including Medtronic, Inc. (NYSE:MDT) and Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK), to see where it stands.Source: MorningstarABT's margins are above the industry average. ABT has the highest ROE among companies; however, it also has the highest debt/equity ratio. From the valuation perspective, ABT remains undervalued with a Forward P/E of 10.4, which is below S&P 500's average of 14.3. MDT is another solid medical devices company with high margins and strong ROE while generating steady cash flow. SYK, on the other hand, has the strongest balance sheet. Investors need to be aware that comparing ABT to other medical devices makers will not reveal the full picture for ABT as it operates in other major segments, including established pharmaceutical and nutritional segments.Technically, ABT is on the long-term uptrend since mid-November, 2012. ABT is approaching its long-term uptrend resistance.Source: Finviz.comBottom LineWith the mixed global economy, nutritional business should continue to be the growth driver, which is also the largest segment for ABT. If ABT fails to break through its long-term uptrend resistance, investors may want to wait for a pullback to establish the long-term position. Investors can also review the following ETFs to gain exposures to ABT:Disclaimer: Investors and traders are recommended to do their own due diligence and research before making any trading/investing decisions.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in ABBV over the next 72 hours.

1329321,31361,2013-04-09T07:27:28-04:00,,"Nutrition is not a glamorous business, but an efficient one. It is suitable for employing large factories, continuous process manufacturing and direct-to-consumer marketing.Nutrition, after the split of the company, accounts for roughly 30 percent of Abbott Laboratories' (NYSE:ABT) overall revenue for 2012 when adjusting out the $18 billion proprietary pharmaceuticals revenue. In the post-AbbVie world, nutrition is Abbott's largest division, with $6.471 billion in sales last year.GrowthAbbott Lab is the U.S. leader in pediatric nutritionals and the worldwide leader in adult nutritionals.In 2012, nutritional sales grew by more than 9 percent in the U.S., while operational revenue internationally jumped more than 8 percent. U.S. growth actually outpaced Abbott's domestic branded-pharmaceutical growth before the AbbVie spinoff, and the nutritionals segment topped all divisions with more than $1 billion in sales in overall growth.Importantly, half of this business comes directly from the patients and consumers who use the products, rather than third-party payers. This makes Abbott Lab one of the most customer-facing companies in healthcare, which motivates the company to build direct, long-term relationships with the people it serves.Abbott is watching changes in demographics very closely and is trying to adjust its business to the changes.For example, the global population is aging rapidly, with the over-70 group expected to grow from 269 million to 1 billion by 2050. As the world leader in adult nutrition and the number-two maker of cataract devices, Abbott is well-positioned to serve this growing need.Pediatric nutritionals are surging in particular. The unit recorded astounding 14 percent domestic sales growth in 2012, rising to total revenue of $1.44 billion in the U.S. But the best numbers come from overseas, as international sales of pediatric nutritionals dwarfed domestic sales by nearly $600 million in 2012.Why the international surge? For years, Abbott has focused a lot of time and resources in expanding its nutritional business overseas, and it has paid off.The company has been building research and development infrastructure closer to regional customers and launching products in emerging markets.IndiaIndia plays a particularly significant role: Abbott has focused heavily not only on pediatric nutrition in the world's second-largest nation, but also on diabetes nutrition in a country where it's estimated more than 50 million people live with diabetes.Growth in India and other emerging markets should also help Abbott in the sports nutrition business. The company is a major player in the business, and the worldwide sports nutrition market is expected to eclipse $6 billion by 2018.A new plant is being built in the Indian city Jhagadia, in the state of Gujarat by Abbott India at an estimated cost of $66 million. It is located on 45 acres of land and it will make the Ensure range of nutritional drinks for elderly people and the pediatric nutritional drink PediaSure.Abbott India had opened its first nutrition research and development center in India in 2012 at Bangalore through a tie-up with Syngene International Ltd., Biocon's contract research unit.Abbott India has a network of 18 distribution points, which cater to 11,000 stockists and 70,000 retailers and employs over 1000 people.Earlier in 2010, Abbott had acquired India's Piramal Healthcare's domestic formulation business for $3.72 billion, thereby making Abbott one of the largest drug firms in the country.EfficiencyOf all business divisions, nutrition offers the best opportunity to improve margins.The company is building three new efficient plants, partly as a response to demand, but also as an effort of getting the production closer to the customers, improving logistics costs, and building those plants in a very efficient way that can improve the margins.There is also a focus on distribution. Over the years, as Abbott has expanded, particularly outside the U.S., it tended to rely on distributors to a large degree. This has changed over the last year or two, bringing the margins into the company, and taking full control of the distribution in the countries.The company has a pretty detailed, well laid out plan to achieve its margin objectives. The goal is to get it in the 20 percent range by 2015, and at the pace it is going, there is a chance it will get there a little bit sooner.ProductsAbout 55 percent of the business is pediatric, and 45 percent is adult nutrition, which is a very promising field. Abbott' products include some of the world's most trusted brands in pediatric, adult and sport performance nutrition.The pediatric nutrition brand, Similac, is designed to meet babies' specific nutritional needs by supporting brain, eye and immune-system development and helping build strong bones. Similac Total Comfort, which was launched in key international markets, has quickly become the standard for infants with digestive system intolerance. Gain (also known as Similac Stage 3/4/5), is a line of growing-up milks for older babies and toddlers, is a particularly important product in fast-growing markets such as China.For older children, the PediaSure family of products is the number-one pediatrician recommended brand for complete, balanced nutrition.Abbott' presence in adult and medical nutrition is anchored by Ensure. The company is expanding the potential of the Ensure brand with specially formulated versions that help rebuild muscle and strength naturally lost over time, support digestive tract health and the immune system, and help build strong bones.In 2012, Ensure Clear was introduced, a complete nutrition in a refreshing, fat-free beverage.Other condition-specific products are Glucerna Triple Care, designed to help adults with diabetes, and a medical nutrition portfolio of products that meet the needs of patients recovering from illness.Then there is a line of sports nutrition products, including Myoplex. These products help athletes and the occasional gym goer discover how much more they can do.These products are generally marketed and sold directly to customers and to institutions, wholesalers, retailers, healthcare facilities, government agencies, and third-party distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers or third-party distributors.Regulatory aspectsNeedless to say that getting approvals for nutritionals is easier than for new drugs.Depending upon the country or region, if claims regarding a product's efficacy will be made, clinical studies typically must be conducted. Most other product development, such as a product form change from liquid to powder, generally does not require clinical studies.In the U.S., the FDA wants to be notified of proposed new formulations or packaging changes related to infant formula products.For other nutrition products, notification or pre-approval from the FDA is not required unless the product includes a new food additive.In some countries, regulatory approval may be required for certain nutritional products, including infant formula and medical nutritional products.CompetitionAbbott does face a fierce competition in nutritionals.Major competitors are Swiss giant Nestle which has recently purchased Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) infant nutrition business for $12 billion and Mead Johnson Nutrition (NYSE:MJN), which has separated from Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) in 2009.Pfizer's old unit made 85 percent of its sales in emerging markets, and Nestle will battle with Abbott for dominance in these sought-after markets.The Chinese market is especially important. China's infant formula market already represents more than 20 percent of the $41 billion worldwide market and could alone reach $25 billion by 2017. It's crucial that Abbott steps up its nutritional business in China.For Ensure, competition comes from Boost, made by Nestle Nutrition, and store-label brands.ResearchTo stay ahead of the competition, intensive research is needed. 80 new products were launched in 2012 and 100 clinical trials started over the last three years.Abbott's in-house HEOR studies (Nutrition Health Economics and Outcomes Research) are intended to help the medical community understand the importance of adult nutrition and its impact on lowering costs in the healthcare system.Abbott's nutrition research is focusing on six health benefit platforms where better nutrition can have a significant impact on overall health: immunity, cognition, lean body mass, inflammation, metabolism and tolerance.Investor's summaryFor 2013, Abbott Labs is forecasting a double-digits growth for its global nutrition business. This includes low to mid-single digit growth for the U.S business and double-digit growth for the international business.The greater growth opportunity probably lies outside the U.S. India and China are important to the company, but so is a broad exposure to all emerging markets.The share price has done well since the split, it has ranged year-to-date from $32.75 to $36.32.In this economy, nutrition is a good business to be in and the company has well thought-out plans to advance its leading position.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1341161,24433,2013-04-15T07:32:42-04:00,,"Abbott Bringing More Interest to Galectin-3We saw fresh news regarding Galectin-3 last week from Abbott Labs (ABT), which continued its excellence in the diagnostic products market with the CE marking of the Architect Galectin-3 assay in Europe (link). Note that the CE Marking is similar to an FDA approval, and clears the product for market launch.This  is exciting, as Galectin-3 is a biomarker that is strongly prognostic  for heart failure, which allows healthcare providers to identify those  patients who are at higher risk for re-hospitalization or death.Also  exciting is the potential for Galectin-3 to become a more prominent  biomarker of cardiovascular risk in clinical trials, which could  generate significant sales revenue for Abbott due to the sheer size of  cardio risk trials. Two notable trials include:1.) GlaxoSmithKline's (GSK) STABILITY trial for Lp-PLA2 inhibitor darapladib, which has an estimated enrollment of 15,8282.) Amarin Corp's (AMRN) REDUCE-IT trial for Eicosapentaenoic acid capsule Vascepa, which has an estimated enrollment of 8,000With the introduction of Architect, Abbott  has already introduced a very useful tool into the market for  cardiovascular risk diagnostics, although (as mentioned below)  Galectin-3 may see additional potential as a biomarker in other diseases  and indications. In addition, it holds promise as a therapeutic target.Galectin-3: Brief OverviewGalectins are a very interesting family of proteins that are part of the bigger class of proteins known as ""lectins."" Lectins are proteins that interact with carbohydrate sugars outside of the cell membrane to cause important events and to modulate important activities. For instance, galectins may cause cells to migrate to new areas, or even multiply.""Galectins"" refer to the 15 known lectins that bind specifically to β-galactoside, and play a major role in the mediation of cell-cell interactions & adhesion. Also very interesting is their importance in the regulation of blood vessel growth, immune regulation, and inflammation. Galectins connect to β-galactoside with something known as a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), which is a section on these proteins that recognizes and interacts with the target, and ""triggers"" the effect that the Galectin was supposed to have.Galectin-3 in particular is the oddball of the group due to its structure. The protein has a carbohydrate recognition domain and an Amino Acid tail, which allows it to form oligomers - or ""bundles"" of Galectin-3. Overexpression of Galectin-3, which can form those ""bundles,"" has been linked to cancer and organ failure in non-clinical studies.The Curious Case of GCS 100As of now, the only drug that inhibits Galectin-3 is GCS 100, a first-in-class Galectin-3 agonist that was born at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Institute and originally developed by Prospect Therapeutics. Prospect collapsed in the financial maelstrom of 2008/2009, which ultimately allowed La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company (NASDAQ:LJPC) to acquire the rights to the compound.Ongoing research suggests that Galectin-3's role in various other diseases may be significant, as Galectin-3 overexpression has been shown to lead to fibrosis and scarring of tissue which leads to additional complications found in other indications, but La Jolla is limiting itself to the diseases/indications that have the strongest links to Galectin-3 overexpression. These include Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), Chronic Liver Disease (cirrhosis), and cancer immunotherapy but not cardiovascular risk (possibly for strategic reasons).Treatment of CKD has proven difficult, and the disease generally leads to poor outcomes and co-morbidities which is why CKD seems to be a particularly great indication for a first-in-class Galectin-3 inhibitor. The drug's safety profile should prevent the outcome of Abbott and Reata Pharmaceuticals' bardoxolone - a Phase III CKD therapy that was abandoned in 2012 after patients died in the trial.For the CKD indication in particular, GCS 100 is in a Phase I/II trial which just started enrolling at the beginning of the year. This implies that we will see fresh data in Q3 2013.The TakeawayNew studies suggest that Galectin-3 is a lot more important than we thought, and it may rise to prominence as a biomarker for cardiovascular risk (and other indications) due to the commercial availability of Abbott's Architect assay.Abbott is a diversified company that has probably the best overall product line for diagnostic products, and may have a big winner with Architect due to the overall importance of Galectin-3.After its failure with bardoxolone last year, Abbott may be looking for another way to develop a CKD treatment. La Jolla happens to have the only Galectin-3 inhibitor in clinical development, which synergizes not only with Abbott's presumed desire to play the CKD treatment market but with newly launched Architect assay which should help boost the overall profile for Galectin-3.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1293731,35611,2013-03-21T16:57:40-04:00,,"Until recently, Abbott Labs (ABT) was one of the most diversified players in the healthcare space.Then in January, Abbott Laboratories completed a spin-off of AbbVie (ABBV). The company was essentially split in half, with each shareholder of the combined company gaining one share of each of the new entities.The distinction between the companies is Abbott is now focused on nutritional products and generic drugs, while AbbVie is now a traditional drug maker built largely around Humira, a best-selling rheumatoid arthritis injection that produced $9.3 billion in revenue in 2012.Or put another way, AbbVie is focused on the future, while the new Abbott is focused on the here and now.AbbVie's two major drugs, both arthritis medications, are Humira and Androgel. The company has several products in the pipeline that would treat Hepatitis C, Parkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis and Endometriosis. AbbVie's long-term plans indicate that their new products would be introduced in 2015, and until then it would depend on existing drugs for revenue. The new treatments are expected to generate an estimated $4 billion to $6 billion in revenue a year.Meanwhile, the sales of Abbott's nutritional products in emerging economies are estimated to grow by 35% this year. Abbott's generic drugs are also key to growth in emerging markets. For example, generics make up 70% to 80% of the retail pharmaceutical market in India, according to McKinsey & Company. China's government is also pushing generic drugs as a way to lower the country's healthcare costs.2012 Earnings ReportWhen the company announced its fourth-quarter and year-end earnings, which included the operations of AbbVie, two business categories showed the most improvement: point-of-care diagnostics and nutritionals, both of which now fall under the Abbott umbrella. Net sales for point-of-care diagnostics jumped 15.7% in 2012 compared to 2011, to $348 million. Nutritionals net sales grew 7.7% for all of 2012 and 10.2% for the fourth quarter compared to the same periods in the prior year. With nearly $6.5 billion in revenue, the business segment is probably the most important element to the new Abbott's continued success.On the downside, Abbott's vascular sales fell around 8% for the quarter and full year. The primary culprit was U.S. sales, which dropped by 24.6% in the fourth quarter year-on-year and 20.7% for all of 2012. Established pharmaceuticals also experienced declines. Sales were down 2.4% for the fourth quarter and 4.4% for the year.Earnings per share grew 23.6% from 2011 to 2012. Sales increased 2.6% for the full year and 4.4% for the quarter as compared to 2011.The company is forecasting 2013 earnings above Wall Street expectations. Abbott expects full-year earnings per share of between $1.98 and $2.04, compared with analysts' previous expectations of $1.95.New Products on the HorizonThe company says that it has more than 150 registration approvals and new product launches planned for this year for its established pharmaceuticals business. Abbott's medical device division will roll out several new products in 2013, including launching the Xience Xpedition drug-eluting stent in the U.S. this month and in Japan later this year. This system is extremely beneficial for people suffering from complex coronary anatomy.The company is also high on the PLEX-ID system, which has the potential to change the way doctors identify and fight diseases. According to the company, it can identify and differentiate more than 750,000 bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. One of the advantages of this system is that proper diagnosis can cut down on the over-prescribing of antibiotics.In addition, an Abbott drug, Kaletra, was part of the treatment of a well-publicized case in which an infant girl was ""cured"" of HIV. While Kaletra makes up a small portion of Abbott's overall sales, that proportion could grow if it does in fact become part of a larger HIV treatment regime.Abbott's sales are diversified throughout the world, with 30% of sales in the United States, 30% from other developed markets (Canada, Western Europe, Japan, and Australia) and 40% in emerging markets such as India, China, Russia and Brazil.History of DividendsShares of Abbott are trading at a relatively low price-to-earnings ratio of 9.2, with a current price of $35.The company's year-end balance sheet shows a long-term debt-to-equity ratio of 0.68. Its liquidity ratios are strong also, with a quick ratio of 1.7 and a current ratio of 2.4.Abbott built up its cash position in the last year, from $6.81 billion at the end of 2011 to almost $11 billion at the conclusion of last year. Its income from continuing operations has skyrocketed from under $400 million in the fourth quarter of 2011 to almost $2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012, basically a 500% increase in just over a year.In February, Abbott declared a quarterly common dividend of 14 cents per share, which marked the 357th consecutive quarterly dividend to be paid by Abbott since 1924. The dividend is currently yielding 1.6%Abbott has increased its dividend payout for 40 consecutive years and is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks companies that have annually increased their dividend for 25 consecutive years.One thing that will be tricky for investors is being able to benchmark this year's results against last year's because they won't have a baseline comparison of just the Abbott division until the first quarter of next year.Since completion of the spin off, investors have been drawn to AbbVie since it now owns the key business segment and some flagship products. However, many analysts believe Abbott offers an attractive investment opportunity also. Its size, growth prospects, balance between its business units and diverse customer base make it well positioned. However, until it has had some experience operating without the AbbVie lines of business, most analysts have rated the stock as a hold.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: This article was written by an analyst at Catalyst Investments.Disclaimer: Catalyst Investments is not a  registered investment advisor or broker/dealer.

1240831,24491,2013-03-01T15:08:24-05:00,,"Abbott's (NYSE:ABT) split into two companies has made life a little confusing for the individual investor. However, we've updated our work on the new Abbott's dividend coverage, and we were generally pleased with what we found. Let's dig into our dividend growth forecasts for the new Abbott, which is now independent of AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV).Abbott's Investment ConsiderationsAbbott's Return on Invested CapitalAbbott's DividendFor starters, the safety of Abbott's dividend is excellent (please see our definitions at the bottom of this article). We measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate in any given year, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges, which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend in any given year. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying these cash outlays well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing cash a company has on hand plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends. As income investors, however, we'd like to see a score much larger than 1 for a couple of reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future. For Abbott, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion score is 4.4, revealing that on its current path the firm can cover its future dividends with net cash on hand and future free cash flow over 4 times. We also use our dividend cushion as a key decision component in choosing companies for addition to the portfolio of our Dividend Growth Newsletter (please see our links on the left sidebar for more information).Now on to the potential growth of Abbott's dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity it has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. To do so, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in 10 years, the company has a nice growth rate, and a nice dividend cushion, its future potential dividend growth would be excellent. Though our historical information shows a reduction in the dividend, this was mainly a result of the spin-off of AbbVie (and not a cut by any stretch of the imagination). However, we still rate the firm's dividend growth potential as good (and not excellent), as we'd like to get a better feel as to whether management will deliver on its capital allocation plans successfully.All things considered, the new Abbott's dividend yield is below average, offering just a 1.6% annual payout at recent price levels. We prefer yields above 3% and don't include firms with yields below 2% in our dividend growth portfolio. Plus, we currently think the shares are fairly valued. But while the new Abbott doesn't quite meet our criteria, its dividend growth potential and safety look sound.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1230261,21877,2013-02-27T14:40:04-05:00,,"The advent of transcatheter heart valves has had a  seismic effect on valvular disease: more patients can be treated more  safely and more cheaply than ever before. The trouble is, the devices have  only been approved for the replacement of two of the four valves in the  human heart.Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is  attempting to extend the percutaneous approach to a third valve. Its  MitraClip device is designed to repair, rather than replace, a malformed  mitral valve. On March 20, an FDA panel will decide whether to advise  the agency to allow this. But with efficacy data from its pivotal trial,  Everest II, less than superb,  Abbott must hope that the lack of a non-surgical alternative will swing the panel's vote.Initial PopulationThe MitraClip is implanted using a catheter  inserted into the femoral vein in the leg and threaded through to the  heart. It is then used to pin the mitral valve's two leaflets together,  partially closing them, with the intention of preventing valvular  regurgitation -- the backflow of blood from the left ventricle into the  left atrium.Abbott is  taking a cautious approach to U.S. approval, seeking the FDA's blessing  in patients too sick to undergo open-heart surgery. This is a similar  strategy to that employed by Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE:EW) when it was seeking  approval of the transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) device Sapien, still the only transcatheter heart valve on the U.S. market (see: ""Therapeutic focus -- Transcatheter aortic valves boosted by guidelines,"" Oct. 1, 2012).Approval of Sapien was subsequently expanded from  patients entirely ineligible for surgery to include those with more  moderate disease. Abbott will doubtless aim to walk the same path.Climbing EverestThe first step on that journey is to get MitraClip past the adcom, and the Everest II results will be key here. In Abbott's  favor are data showing that the device was significantly safer than  surgery, and that the two interventions showed similar cure rates, with  21% of MitraClip recipients and 20% of surgically treated patients being  free from grade 3+ or 4+ mitral regurgitation at one year.A green light is by no means assured, though. The  trial’s primary endpoint, a combination of 12-month rates of death,  surgery for mitral valve dysfunction, and grade 3+ or 4+ mitral  regurgitation -- the most severe grades -- significantly favored surgery.  Rates of death were the same in both arms, at 6%, so MitraClip's  failure was solely based on the necessity for revision surgery.MitraClip was CE marked five years ago, and  analysts from JPMorgan suggest that sales in Europe could reach $140 million  this year. Joanne Wuensch, a BMO analyst, expects European sales to  double in 2013, aided by reimbursement in Germany, which began last  month. But the FDA is harder to please than the European authorities. Abbott must hope that MitraClip's safety will see it through."
1344351,23479,2013-04-16T11:07:08-04:00,,"Abbott Labs  (NYSE:ABT) is scheduled to release its earnings for the first quarter  of this year on April 17. This is the first earnings result after the  company spun off its proprietary pharmaceutical division as AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), and all eyes will now be on the remaining divisions of the  company.We expect the nutritionals division to  be the key driver of revenue growth as favorable demographics in the  developed markets drive demand. The untapped opportunity in emerging  markets is also a big plus for the division. Furthermore, we expect Abbott's  profit margins to increase as the company remains focused on increasing  efficiency.Abbott's share price is up over 15%  since the spin-off and the stock currently trades at around $37. We are  in the process of updating our model for the company and will soon  release a fresh price estimate.Nutritional Division to Drive GrowthAccording to our estimates, the  nutritional division is the largest and most promising division within  Abbot Labs and accounts for over 30% of our estimated value for the  stock. The segment has witnessed nearly 7%-8% revenue growth over the  last couple of years driven equally by price and volume improvements. In  2012, overall revenue from this segment grew by 7.7%, accounting for  foreign exchange losses, on a 4.2% increase in sales volume and 4.5%  growth in prices.Going forward, we expect the nutritional  division's sales volumes to continue growing in developed as well as  emerging markets. While in developed countries the aging population and  an increasing rate of chronic diseases among the older population will  continue to drive demand for nutrition products, the rise of the middle  class is likely to boost sales in emerging markets. Abbott already has a  strong presence in China and recently opened a nutritional R&D center in India  to develop affordable nutrition products for the country's vast  population. We believe that these affordable products will open  previously untapped markets for the firm and continue to propel the  company's sales.Abbott has also made some manufacturing  and distribution process changes that are likely to drive margin  improvements across its businesses.Expecting More Data From the Vascular DivisionAbbott's vascular division saw some  action late last year when Xience Xpedition, the company's  next-generation drug-eluting stent (DES), received regulatory approval  in the U.S. in December. The Xience portfolio brought in revenues of  around $1.6 billion for the company in 2012, and it will be interesting  to see if the latest approval in the U.S. accelerates revenue growth for  this drug.We will also look for the management's  opinion on MitraClip, a device for the treatment of mitral regurgitation  (one of the most common heart valve conditions). As mentioned in a  previous article, Abbott  Labs got conflicting responses from U.S. regulators regarding the  pending approval of MitraClip last month. While the FDA staff  recommended against approving the device and sought more data, an  advisory panel to the FDA voted in favor of the device, stating that its  benefits outweigh the risks. MitraClip is one of the major devices in  Abbott's vascular products pipeline and we are waiting to know more  about Abbott's management opinion about the situation.Disclosure: No positions."
1177941,23704,2013-02-13T10:17:49-05:00,,"Very nearly a year ago, I wrote a couple of articles about the Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)/AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) stock split.As we are so fond of doing it is time now to check up on how this opportunity is playing out, since the actual split took place at the start of 2013.We did a lot of work in the previous article to try to figure out the value of the company at the time and came up with three cases, of which the low was around $72 per share, and so our estimate that there was considerable upside in this deal proved to be pretty close, and anyone who went long on that basis is doing just fine.So naturally, the question of the day is: What to do? Do you cash out, sit on your investment for awhile longer, with the hopes that we are headed for the ""high case"" where the deal might be even more, or even double down because the value of the deal is still a little lower than we had predicted a year ago?As of a few days ago the ABT portion of the investment was lagging behind a little in the marketplace, per the following chart:Even though ABT was ostensibly the more conservative of the two investments, we will focus on that one for the moment.There is a company overview on this link. Company sales are supposed to be $22B, with market leadership in nutritionals, established pharmaceuticals, a Medical Device business, and a Vascular business, which included a line of stent products.The gross operating margin of this set of businesses is on the order of 55% and based on the net margin estimates we came up with last year, of around 23%, we can arrive at a revenue estimate as follows:I've also included the estimates I came up with a year ago, and have to say I am not too unhappy with the accuracy of those numbers.Now, for the estimate of earnings, based on the above sales and expected margins:Based on the operating margin assumptions above, including the net margin estimates for this business we arrived at last year, we come up with about $2.37 per share for the coming year. As a figure check, we can compare that with the analyst estimates for the upcoming year of about $2.10 this year, and $2.55 next year, so this is in the realm of plausibility.If you do a stock screener, of greater than $5B companies in the Pharmaceutical industry, with a profit margin of 23% and a growth rate of 5%, you get a list of two companies: Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) and Allergan (NYSE:AGN) with an average PE of 19.5, and a price-to-sales ratio of an average of 6. If the marketplace eventually gives ABT exactly that much respect, the upside is somewhere between $46 and $82.If you do a stock screener on just the nutritionals business, and for the sake of argument call it the ""food business,"" with revenues of about $5B, a profit margin of greater than 15% and a growth rate of 5 percent, you get ""zero companies"", that business by itself would be the best investment in that otherwise relatively low margin industry.If you use the same valuation method we used before, price-to-sales ratio, and assume that the management is able to run the business equally as effectively as  rivals Johnson and Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), you get the following:Side issue: The company has already declared a dividend of 14 cents per share for the first quarter, which amounts to a 2% insurance policy. The AbbVie stockholders are getting 40 cents per share, the total of 54 cents per pre-split ABT amounts to a 3 cent per share dividend increase.So where are we on all of this?Based on a couple of different valuation methods, and comparing ABT with similar companies in its industry with comparable growth rates, and profit margins, we can still be pretty comfortable in predicting an upside of at least 10%, and potentially more.The headwind, of course, is that we are heading into a period of government-induced headline peril, which has a chance to spook the overall market, and if that happens, we will have to rethink the situation.Also, as we are fond of saying, every time in the above article that you see the words ""if."" ""estimate,"" ""might"" and ""could"" there is some uncertainty factor.The world is full of chaos, and there are no guarantees on anything. We will have to do some work now on AbbVie to see whether that part of the trade is fairly valued.Disclosure: I am long ABT. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: I entered the trade yesterday at a price of about $34.50"
1167281,31361,2013-02-08T04:28:19-05:00,,"As of January 1, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) and AbbVie began operating as independent companies. For both companies it means a new beginning, each inherit part of the assets and traditions from their predecessor company and both have to design ways to achieve more with less.DividendAbbott declared a quarterly common dividend of $0.14 per share. Abbott's dividend is payable on Feb. 15, 2013, to shareholders of record on Jan. 15, 2013.On Jan. 4, 2013, the board of directors of AbbVie declared the company's quarterly cash dividend of $0.40 per share. AbbVie's cash dividend is also payable on Feb. 15, 2013, to shareholders of record at the close of business on Jan. 15, 2013.Abbott's annualized cash dividend of $0.56 per share, combined with AbbVie's annualized cash dividend of $1.60 per share, equals a total annualized cash dividend of $2.16 per share, compared to the annualized cash dividend of Abbott, prior to separation, of $2.04 per share.Future quarterly dividends are subject to approval by each company's board of directors.AbbVie's dividend is proportionally higher as a percentage of earnings per share than Abbott Labs, which is proportionally lower. But both managements plan to grow the dividend in the future.Traditionally investors expected steady returns from Abbott and they transfer that expectation to the successor companies.NutritionNutrition is the fastest growing segment in Abbott's portfolio and has the best chance for margin improvement. For 2012, the operating margin improved nearly 250 basis points over 2011 mainly due to driving down freight and distribution costs and optimizing the supply chain. The company has shifted to direct distribution in certain foreign markets.Abbott is working hard on its nutrition business, 80 new products were launched in 2012 and 100 clinical trials started over the last three years.In 2012 worldwide nutrition sales were $6.471 billion.In the U.S, the company maintained its market share for the leading infant formula Similac and delivered double digit growth of both PediaSure and Ensure.The company rolled out several new Similac products. Similac Total Comfort was launched in four key markets: Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and Russia, and it is now available in 19 countries. Similac Stage 2 and HQPro, a protein powder product were launched in India.Shifts in demographics are closely followed by the company. Abbott introduced in the U.S. Ensure Complete, a nutritional shake for older adults that is beneficial to the muscle, heart, immune system and the bones. Complete shakes feature a special ingredient, Revigor, and 13 grams of protein to help promote muscle health.Emerging market sales comprised more than 40% of the nutrition sales and grew double digits for the full year for both pediatric and adult.DevicesAbbott is the global leader in drug eluting stents.Xience XpeditionXience Xpedition is a next-generation stent, featuring a new delivery system and a variety of sizes with diameters available from 2.25 mm to 4 mm, including a unique 3.25 mm diameter, and lengths from 8 mm to 38 mm.Vascular device sales reached $3.071 billion in 2012. This business grows most rapidly outside the U.S. from where now more than 60% of the sales originate.Xience Xpedition was launched in Europe in August, in the U.S. recently and in Japan a rollout is planned by mid-year.Abbott's Xience drug eluting stents are the only ones in the U.S. market proven safe for direct stenting. Direct stenting refers to stent positioning and deployment without prior balloon dilatation of the stenosis, an innovation that saves time and money.The Absorb stentAbsorb is the world's first drug eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS).Absorb is made of plastic and coated with a drug called everolimus to inhibit in-stent thickening in the coronary arteries. Everolimus was developed by Novartis (NYSE:NVS) and licensed to Abbott.It is available in more than 30 countries across Europe and parts of Asia Pacific, including India and Latin America. Not yet approved in the U.S. The Absorb III clinical trials are ongoing, and the results will be used to support the U.S. application.Abbott calls Absorb a ""scaffold"" meaning that it is a temporary structure, unlike a metal stent, which is a permanent implant. The scaffold provides support to the blood vessel until the artery can stay open on its own, and then dissolves naturally.The potential benefits of a scaffold are significant. The vessel may expand and contract as needed to increase the flow of blood to the heart in response to normal activities such as exercising. Also the need for long-term treatment with anti-clotting medications may be reduced; and future interventions would be unobstructed by a permanent implant.MitraClipMitraClip is a less invasive device for the treatment of patients with mitral regurgitation, the most common heart valve disease in the world. Mitral regurgitation affects more than 8 million people in the United States and Europe, and is four times more prevalent than aortic stenosis. Abbott's MitraClip system is available in Europe and parts of Asia and is currently under FDA review.Peripheral Artery Disease (PAD)Abbott has launched the Absolute Pro Vascular Self-Expanding stent system and the Omnilink Elite Vascular Balloon-Expandable Stent System, both for the treatment of iliac artery disease, a form of peripheral artery disease (PAD) that affects the lower extremities.Vision CareIn its market-leading Lasik business, Abbott is expanding its laser platform into new applications, mainly cataract surgery.The cataract business now represents nearly 65% of Abbott's global vision care sales. Strong double-digit cataract growth were seen in emerging markets especially India and China.DiagnosticsMore than 346 million people worldwide are living with diabetes, and the World Diabetes Foundation estimates that number will increase by nearly 27 percent by 2030.Abbott received European approval for its test Architect HbA1c (IA) Assay which helps physicians to monitor treatment efficacy of their diabetic patients.The HbA1c test differs from a patient-administered blood glucose test, which takes a snapshot of a patient's blood sugar level at a moment in time. The HbA1c test must be performed on a laboratory instrument.DrugsAbbott has a portfolio of hundreds of branded generic pharmaceuticals consisting of many trusted brands throughout the world.More than 150 new drug approvals and product launches expected in 2013.The launches include improved formulations of trusted brands, such as Creon (treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in cystic fibrosis) and Brufen (a pain reliever), as well as new products, such as Amitiza, a treatment for chronic constipation.The company's strategy is increasing access to the drugs for patients by operating locally in each market and building country-specific portfolios. The sales pattern with drugs is the same as other products: 60% of the drug sales are in emerging markets and 40% in developed markets.Investor's summaryWhat may be considered as base line for the New Abbott is the sales figure for those products in 2012 that are inherited from Abbott Laboratories: about $21.5 billion.Abbott's vascular revenue slumped 8.1% in the fourth quarter to $760 million, dragged down by a 24.6% slide in U.S. stent sales.Abbott attributes the drop to the expected declining royalties from its Promus stent, which it used to supply to Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX). Boston is now making the product itself, therefore the royalties shrink.In spite of that 2012 was a great year, the old Abbott generated a cash flow of more than $9 billion, exceeding expectations.In 2013 the New Abbott is looking forward to another strong year. Earnings per share are projected in the range of $1.98 to $2.04, representing double digit growth over 2012.Abbott is well positioned to become a leader in the new healthcare environment. The company is balanced across four business segments: Branded Generics, Medical Devices, Diagnostics and Nutrition. This business mix provides the company with a diverse customer base and payer group.Abbott holds leadership positions across all four major business segments and has many opportunities to develop its pipeline. These include next-generation diagnostic systems, medical devices in coronary, endovascular and structural heart treatment, as well as innovations in branded generics and nutrition.These businesses have more rapid innovation cycles, local solutions and improved formulations and packaging.New Abbott's management pledges to remain focused on financial discipline, improving margins and generating a strong cash flow, projected upwards to $4 billion in 2013.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1161861,24349,2013-02-06T16:18:22-05:00,,"On January 2nd, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) completed its previously announced spin-off of its pharmaceutical business, establishing AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) as a separate company focused on biopharmaceuticals and new drug development. Since completing the transaction, there has been a fair amount of investor enthusiasm in AbbVie, which includes among its assets its best-selling, anti-inflammatory drug Humira, as evidenced by the stock's rapid 10% gain during the first month of trading. In contrast, the ""new"" Abbott has been relatively flat, and many investors are unsure whether or not they should hold onto the shares.Earnings & Dividend PotentialOne challenge that investors face in evaluating Abbott is the lack of clarity around the company's recent performance. While Abbott did release its fourth-quarter and fiscal-year results for 2012, they continued to report these metrics as a single company, including the now separated proprietary pharmaceutical business. So investors do not have a clear, separated baseline of financial performance for the new Abbott. The management team has stated that they will release a post-separation baseline of the quarterly income statement on both the GAAP and non-GAAP basis with appropriate reconciliations prior to Abbott's first quarter earnings release in April.However, Abbott did provide guidance and their business outlook for 2013 that reflected only the new Abbott businesses. For FY 2013, Abbott is guiding EPS for $1.98-$2.04, and Q1 EPS of $0.40-$0.42, before specified items of ~$0.17. Taking the full year EPS guidance and the current market price of ~$33/share gives us an P/E ratio of around 16.5. While this doesn't necessarily scream ""cheap"", it is interesting to note that the companies earnings' yield would be ~6.1%, or just about 2x the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond rate. Furthermore, the management team is very focused on growing sales at a mid- to high-single digit rate, while continuing to return capital to shareholders in the form of share buy backs and dividends.Management's past actions appear to support this guidance, as Abbott has increased its dividend for 40 consecutive years. Abbott previously declared a $0.14/share dividend ($0.56/share annualized) following the spin off, giving the company a meager 1.7% dividend yield. However, using management's full year EPS guidance of $2, the current dividend is supported by a very low 28% payout ratio. Given the low payout ratio, the strong free cash flow (guidance of $4B for FY 2013), the stability and diversification of the business units, as well as Abbott's history of returning capital, it is a good bet that this dividend will be increasing this year, and steadily going forward.Company Balance SheetInvestors also face a challenge in evaluating Abbott's balance sheet, though it will likely be another positive aspect for the company. Back in November 2012, prior to the separation, Abbott completed one of the largest U.S. corporate bond offerings on record, selling almost $15B of bonds through the new AbbVie unit. The proceeds were used to pay a $8.5B cash distribution to Abbott from AbbVie. Abbott's management has been consistent in its plans to use the proceeds to execute a tender offer for their debt outstanding, as well as to pay down a portion of commercial paper outstanding. In other words, to reduce its debt.While the tender process while likely expensive given the current interest rate environment, it is also very likely that it strengthened the company's balance sheet in the long run. AbbVie was able to issue 10-year bonds at ~2.8% and 30-year bonds at ~4.5%, so it is probably safe to assume that at least Abbott's short-term borrowings are on excellent terms. Back in Oct, management provided guidance on what the balance sheet for the separated Abbott Labs would look like: $7.5B in debt (combination of long-term debt, commercial paper and other short-term borrowings) and $5B in cash. Investors will have to wait for either the carve-out updated financial statements or the Q1 earnings release to get a more granular update. However, the company's strong free cash flow and history of allocating capital intelligently suggests that the estimated level of debt will not be a problem for Abbott going forward.Potential ConcernsThere are still several concerns that investors should be aware off, especially given Abbott's global footprint and expected growth internationally. First, the fiscal problems present throughout Europe have resulted in an environment of austerity, and the healthcare industry has not been spared from this headwind. The Established Pharmaceutical Division [EPD] generates roughly 1/4 of Abbott's overall revenue, and a large portion of the business commodity generic business comes from Europe. However, the European segment of the business has been experiencing a high degree of pricing pressure and utilization decline due to the austerity pressure, so sales have been declining. This weakness is Europe is counteracting the growth that EPD is experiencing in developing markets, and stunting overall growth for division.Abbott has been attempting to adjust costs so that they appropriately match the market opportunities in the region, as well as capturing market share from competitors, in order to offset the decline. However, this will likely continue to be a problem for EPD throughout 2013, and certainly one issue investors will want follow closely.In addition to Europe, EPD also faces potential challenges in India. Although emerging markets segments, including India, have been experiencing strong growth in revenue, India's new drug pricing policy may pose a significant threat to this geographical segment of EPD's business. Abbott's EPD has roughly $800M - $1B in exposure to the Indian market, so significant changes in the pricing environment would obviously have an impact on the company. Industry estimates show that implementation of the new policy would bring ~30% of the market under price control, and significant increase from the 18% under price control from the previous drug-pricing policy established in the mid-1990s.On a positive note, the policy does take a market-based approach to setting prices, in comparison to the previous cost-based mechanism. Still, foreign pharmaceutical companies, Abbott included, will likely have a harder time adjusting their cost structure to match an price controls implemented. So it is hard to see how this does not potentially slow revenue growth and/or significantly impact margins for EPD, which have been very healthy until this point. Abbott's management team believes they have appropriately captured these factors in their planning assumptions for 2013, so it should not significantly impact their provided guidance. However, investors would be smart to pay close attention to how these issues develop, and whether other developing countries follow suit.ConclusionSince completion of the spin off, investors have been drawn to the more sexy, ""fraternal twin"", AbbVie, however, Abbott Labs appears to be an attractive investment opportunity as well. It is one of the largest and fastest growing diversified healthcare investments available, with a balance across its four business units and a diverse customer base and payer mix. Additionally, the company is well positioned to take advantage of the growth opportunities present in the faster growing, emerging economies. At its current price, Abbott seem fairly, but not overvalued, and should provide long-term investors with both solid capital appreciation as well as dividend growth.Disclosure: I am long ABT.

1221441,35611,2013-02-25T12:50:44-05:00,,"William Osborne, a member of the board of directors at Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), bought 10,000 shares of the company at over $33/share. This is positive news for Abbott, as this insider purchase indicates Osborne's confidence in the company. This purchase has also encouraged investors to buy ABT stock, and the consensus recommendation on NASDAQ and NYSE is indicative of this development.Writing a general introduction about Abbott has become a lot more interesting since the company split into two separate entities this January. Out of the two entities, one retained the name of Abbott Laboratories while the other was named AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV). Each shareholder gained one share of ABT and one share of ABBV upon the split.Currently, ABBV shares are valued at $38.46 with an indicated annual dividend of $1.6, a P/E ratio of 12.53, and an EPS of 3.1. ABT shares are valued at $34.26 with an indicated annual dividend of $0.56, a P/E ratio of 9.15, and an EPS of 3.75. Both companies operate in the pharmaceutical sector. AbbVie specializes in advanced research and development of pharmaceutics and therapies, and Abbott develops and sells healthcare products throughout the world.Although Abbott has a diverse range of products, its main strength lies in its global outreach. Only 30% of Abbott's sales activities are directed at the US market, with another 30% catering to developed markets, and 40% to emerging markets. Abbott has operations in Canada, Europe, Japan, China, India, Australia, Brazil, and several other parts of the world.The total revenue generated by Abbott Laboratories in 2012 was more than $39 billion with a gross profit of over $24 billion. These figures a slight improvement from the $38 billion in revenue and the $23 billion in gross profit earned in 2011. These numbers are going to change this year, but so far both ABBV and ABT have proven to have a greater combined worth than the legacy Abbott Laboratories.The value of ABBV has risen from $34 to over $38 with a slight fall in the early weeks of February where the value dipped below the $36 mark. ABT stock was initially priced at $34, and briefly crossed the $35 mark a few days ago. It has been about two months since Abbott split into two companies, and AbbVie seems to be doing a lot better than Abbott when it comes to the stock market.Why Would Osborne Buy Abbott Shares Instead Of AbbVie?Given the discussion in the previous section, it seems obvious that any novice investor should go for ABBV instead of (or along with) ABT at this point in time. While ABT has shown stability, ABBV has shown significant growth. Does Osborne know something we don't?When it comes to insider purchasing, it can be used as an indicator of future growth. If the purchase value is in hundreds of thousands of dollars, the insider surely expects greater returns and has therefore chosen to invest in the company instead of diversifying his portfolio. Although insider trading activity for Abbott has been high since Osborne's purchase, and more than $680,000 worth of stock has been sold by several executive vice presidents and senior vice presidents of the company from February 1 onwards, none of those individual sales were greater than $163,000, and the lowest one was just below $14,000.Insider trading in smaller amounts is common in the stock market, and insiders sell when they reach their targets and wish to diversify their portfolios. However, insider selling in large amounts sends a negative message, and an average investor is inclined to think that the stock is about to drop. For an organization as large as Abbott, trades in the range of hundreds of thousands may not be very significant. However, $338,500 is still a lot of money, so why would anyone, especially an insider like Osborne, choose Abbott over AbbVie?The answer to this lies in the long term risks associated with AbbVie and the growth potential in Abbott. Experienced investors like William Osborne do not buy shares based on the market trends of two months; they wish to invest in something that can grow over time and can build value over a longer period.AbbVie's long-term plans indicate that their new products would be introduced in 2015, and until then they would depend on Humira and Androgel (drugs for arthritis patients) for revenue. The company has several products in the pipeline, mostly drugs for Hepatitis C, Parkinson's Disease, Multiple Sclerosis and Endometriosis. When those drugs are released in the market, they will generate an estimated revenue of $4-$6 billion a year. However, this pipeline will only start producing in 2015, so buying AbbVie is essentially committing your money for 3 or possibly 4 years knowing there may be little return.Although AbbVie's indicated annual dividend of $1.6/share is more than twice what Abbott plans to pay this year, hey are still a high risk investment.Meanwhile, the sales of Abbott's nutritional products in emerging economies are estimated to grow by 35% this year. Along with the nutritional products, Abbott's generic drugs will also do well in these markets. China has pushed generic drugs in order to reduce healthcare costs, and the market is ripe for Abbott to gain sales. In India, the generic drug market is estimated to grow even further, leaving Abbott with yet another opportunity to grow its market share.With the per capita income rising in emerging economies, more and more people will be able to buy Abbott's generic drugs and nutritional products. Hospitals and other healthcare facilities in emerging economies would also be able to afford Abbott's medical devices. With Abbott making 40% of its sales in emerging economies, it seems as if 2013 would be the year of growth for ABT stock. Keeping all those factors in mind, it is no surprise that William Osborne chose ABT over ABBV for his insider investment.What Does This Mean for YouAs a potential investor, you have read about Abbott's split, stock value, growth potential and the recent insider purchase and trading. Now, we have to decide whether ABT is worth the investment.Investors interested in the pharmaceutical sector have many options including GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), Novartis AG (NYSE:NVS), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK). Compared to these companies, Abbott is a very low risk investment. Abbott has a diverse portfolio within the pharmaceutical industry, and holds a sizeable market share in emerging economies.40% of Abbott's sales activity is based in countries like China and India. With these markets presenting new opportunities, Abbott's market share is bound to increase even if they do not drastically change their current strategy.The only negative factor that may discourage investors from buying ABT stock is that the company's balance sheets, net worth, past trends and several other economic indicators from Q4 2012 cannot be applied to either AbbVie or Abbott. The fact that ABT has inherited its name from the legacy Abbot laboratories, and that AbbVie has inherited huge products such as Humira and Androgel do not make things easier.AbbVie's rapid rise in stock value has come from the fact that the company inherited Humira, and Abbott's lineup looks rather flat in comparison. If you are looking to make a buying decision based on past performance indicators, you would have a tough time deciding whether to invest in ABBV or ABT at all. However, if you consider the growth potential, investing in ABT is a no brainer.Many analysts advocate buying Pfizer and/or Merck, but we recommend you look at these two main ideas:We recommend buying and holding ABT shares, as all factors indicate the company would grow steadily and that the investors would benefit in the long run.Additional Disclosure: Catalyst Investments is not a registered investment advisor or broker/dealer.

1154631,21544,2013-02-04T13:08:26-05:00,,"I have been a shareholder of Abbott Laboratories for several years. I liked the fact that the company was constantly undervalued, and also managed to offer a very attractive yield plus above average dividend growth. My last addition to my position occurred in the final weeks of 2012. In my last analysis of the stock, I was bullish on its business going forward.On January 1, 2013, Abbott Laboratories split into two companies, one which retained its name Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), and another named Abbvie (NYSE:ABBV). For every share of legacy Abbott Laboratories, shareholders received one share of Abbvie and one share of the new Abbott. Following the split, Abbott declared a dividend of 14 cents/share, while Abbvie declared a dividend of 40 cents/share. The total annual dividend combined for both companies of $2.16 is above the $2.04/share annual dividend declared by legacy Abbott in 2012. This former dividend champion had boosted distributions for 40 consecutive years. For legacy Abbott shareholders, this new dividend from the sum of the parts translates into the 41st consecutive year of higher dividend income.Abbott is focused on nutritionals, diagnostics, generic drugs and medical devices. The company yields 1.70%, but has the potential to grow earnings significantly over the next few years. Abbott Laboratories is expected to earn $1.95/share in 2013, which translates into a forward P/E of 16.80. Approximately 40% of sales will be derived from emerging markets, while 27% are derived from the US. The company has opportunities in medical products that have consistent earnings per share growth and strong sales, coupled with large mix of products addressing different areas of healthcare. Abbott is the leader in each of its four segments, which contribute almost equally diversified revenues for it. For example, in its medical devices segment, Abbott is number one for Lasik surgeries and a number two for Cataract surgery. Other positive trends behind each of the four businesses include favorable long-term healthcare and emerging markets growth. There is an increased demand for healthcare products due to the aging of the population in much of the developed world as well as the increase in chronic disease.In the generic drugs segment, BRIC's account for over 30% of sales, which are expanding at the high teens. Emerging markets as a whole accounted for 60% of sales in this segment in 2012, which could increase to 70 -75% by 2015. Driving trends behind this include population growth coupled with rising incomes. Other growth factors include improving access to healthcare for people who have not had access to modern facilities before.In the medical devices segment, growth could be driven by continued innovation, margin expansion, as well as capitalizing on emerging market growth. The firm is a leader in LASIK and holds a number two spot in the cataract segment of the market. Cataract is a market segment identified as very profitable and growing rapidly by Abbott. The company is developing new technologies to drive market share growth. In addition, Abbott is advancing new product pipelines to address unmet testing needs of insulin-users. New products such as its drug-eluting stents, coupled with cost reductions, could lead to margin improvements in this segment.In the Nutrition segment, growth could be driven by several factors such as a high number of emerging markets birth rates, tripling of aging population in the next 35 years, a 70% increase in the emerging market middle class households by 2016, as well as the growing awareness of nutrition by consumers. The company expects to add over a billion in incremental sales from innovations by 2016, and also plans on expanding aggressively in seven key emerging markets. In addition, the firm also plans on increasing margins from 13% of sales in 2011 to over 20% in sales through a few initiatives on product packaging, supply chain and distribution and improving efficiencies for manufacturing processes at different plant locations.Growth in the diagnostics segment could come from higher sales in emerging markets, margin expansion and new products that are result of continuous reinvestment in R&D. This segment has managed to increase margins from 8% in 2007 to 18 in 2012. The company expects margins to be higher than 20% by 2016. Abbott expects a 4% - 5% growth in this segment through 2016, most of which would come from emerging markets such as China, Brazil and Russia. Diagnostics products represent less than 5% of hospitals costs, but drive the majority of decisions. With the increased awareness of health and disease prevention and increased amount of healthcare spending, this segment offers the opportunity for more growth, provided that adequate products to meet demand are offered to clients.Abbvie is focused on numerous drugs including Humira, Kaletra, Lupron, Synagis etc.. Almost 55% of revenues are generated in the US, and 14% in emerging markets. The drug generates 9 billion in sales worldwide, which has grown by approximately $1 billion/year since 2008. Humira generates approximately 50% of revenues for Abbvie, but percent of income. Abbvie's patent for Humira in the US expires at the end of 2016, while the European equivalent is expected to expire by April 2018. However, since HUMIRA is a biologic and biologics cannot be readily substituted, it is uncertain what impact the loss of patent protection would have on the sales of HUMIRA. This provides a higher barrier for entry. As a result, sales are not going to fall right off the cliff, since it would be more difficult for competitors to reverse engineer it and create a generic substitute. In the meantime, the drug is expected to provide low double digit sales growth at least until 2016-2017.The strong cash flow generated should be sufficient to advance Abbvie's pipeline of drugs. The company has more than twenty compounds in Phase II or Phase III development. Over the next three years, Abbvie expects to launch a few new products treating Hepatitis C Virus, Parkinson's disease, multiple myeloma, multiple sclerosis and an inhibitor for chronic lymphocytic leukemia. In addition, the company could grow by expanding presence in Emerging markets such as Brazil, China, Russia, Mexico, India and Turkey. Strategic acquisitions could also pave the way for future growth in revenues.One of the drugs that could offset some of Humira's decreasing sales after 2017 is its Hepatitis C Virus product, for which market entry is targeted for early 2015. This is a $3 billion dollar market, which could grow 5- 6 times by 2020. The US, Japan, Brazil, China and Russia represent over 90% of worldwide sales.Abbvie is expected to earn $3.06/share in 2013, which translates into a forward P/E of 12.20. The company also yields 4.40%, and has an adequately covered distribution.Usually spin-offs perform very well after the event, with the stocks delivering outstanding returns on aggregate in the first year or two after the event. I would wait for a few years to see how both companies develop as separate entities. I did like the legacy company with its long history of earnings and dividend growth, and believe that both Abbott and Abbvie will grow shareholder wealth over the next decade. So far, Abbvie looks like a company that is more mature and therefore pays out a higher proportion of earnings than Abbott. Hence, Abbvie's yield at 4.40% is higher than the yield on Abbott. I would monitor the growth in distributions, and would automatically sell if dividends are cut or eliminated in either firm. However, since both companies have not had a chance to operate for long periods of time, I would simply hold on to my position.Disclosure: I am long ABT, ABBV.

1152961,24389,2013-02-03T12:23:51-05:00,,"By: Ahmed IshtiaqAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has taken a new shape after the spinoff. After the separation of AbbVie (ABBV), we will now have a clear idea of how profitable are the nutritionals, devices, diagnostics, and established pharmaceuticals segments. At the moment, Abbott is not as profitable as some of its competitors. The margins are quite high in the industry; however, Abbott has not been able to exploit the opportunity. Nonetheless, the company reported impressive earnings for the fourth quarter of 2012. Abbott exceeded the market expectations by $0.01 per share. We decided to perform a fair value analysis for Abbott using out discounted earnings model.As of January 31, 2013, ABT stock was trading at around $36.39, with a 52-week range of $33.33 - $38.52. It has a market cap of about $53.6 billion. The trailing twelve-month P/E ratio of 8.1 is slightly lower than the forward P/E ratio of 9.2. P/B, P/S, and P/CF ratios stand at 1.9, 1.4, and 5.8, respectively. The operating margin is 19.7% while the net profit margin is 16.6%.Abbott has a 3-star rating from Morningstar. The majority of analysts covering Abbott have a strong buy recommendation for the stock, and they expect the stock to outperform the sector. Wall Street has diverse opinions about the company's future. The average five-year annualized growth forecast estimate is 9%.We can estimate Abbott's fair value using a discounted earnings plus equity model as follows.Discounted Earnings plus Equity ModelThis model is primarily used for estimating the returns from long-term projects. It is also frequently used to price fair-valued IPOs. The methodology is based on discounting the present value of the future earnings to the current period:V = E0 + E1 /(1+r) + E2 /(1+r)2 + E3/(1+r)3 + E4/(1+r)4 + E5/(1+r)5+ Disposal ValueV = E0 + E0 (1+g)/(1+r) + E0(1+g)2/(1+r)2 + … + E0(1+g)5/(1+r)5 + E0(1+g)5/[r(1+r)5]The earnings after the last period act as a perpetuity that creates regular earnings:Disposal Value = D = E0(1+g)5/[r(1+r)5] = E5 / rWhile this formula might look scary for many of us, it easily calculates the fair value of a stock. All we need is the current period earnings, earnings growth estimate, and the discount rate. To be as objective as possible, I use Morningstar data for my estimates. You can set these parameters as you wish, according to your own diligence.ValuationHistorically, the average return of the DJI has been around 11% (including dividends). Therefore, I will use 11% as my discount rate.In order to smooth the results, I will also take the average of ttm EPS along with the mean EPS estimate for the next year. The average EPS for Abbott is $1.92.Wall Street holds diversified opinions on the company's future. While analysts tend to impose subjective opinions on their estimates, the average analyst estimate is a good starting point. Average five-year growth forecast is 9%. Book value per share is $17.27.(You can download FED+ Fair Value Estimator, here.)I decided to add the book value per share so that we can distinguish between a low-debt and debt-loaded company. The lower boundary does not include the book value. According to my 5-year discounted-earnings-plus-book-value model, the fair-value range for ABT is between $25.97 and $43.24 per share. At a price of about $33.80, Abbott is trading at a price within its fair value range. The stock still has up to 27% upside potential to reach its fair value maximum.Comparison with PeersAbbott peers include Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Novartis (NYSE:NVS). The table below lists some important metrics for comparison.Source: MorningstarAbbott is currently trading at a discount compared to its peers. EPS growth figures are poor for almost all the participants in the industry. However, Abbott has the worst operating margin compared to its peers. On the other hand, net margin for the company is better than its peers. Furthermore, the debt-to-equity ratio is in line with the industry.SummaryAbbott has to improve its margins as the company is currently falling behind its competitors. Our valuation model indicates that there is substantial upside potential in the stock. There are a lot of growth opportunities in the market, which the company needs to exploit. I believe the separation of operation will allow the company to focus better. As a result, the operational efficiency of Abbott will improve. At the current price levels, Abbott represents an attractive investment opportunity.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: Efsinvestments is a team of analysts.

1124351,23479,2013-01-22T10:14:48-05:00,,"Abbott Labs  (NYSE:ABT) is set to announce its Q4 results on January 23. It will be  diversified healthcare company's last quarterly and annual earnings,  which will include the performance of research-based proprietary drugs  since its split effective from Jan. 1, 2013. We expect continued  strong performance in its pharma business supported by its   nutritional franchise. Sales in the vascular division could increase  marginally (excluding certain royalty and supply arrangement revenues  relating to Promus). We believe margins could improve as a result of   improved  efficiencies across several operating divisions. While a  strong U.S. dollar will weigh on overall reported sales, it could also  lower costs rather than sales, as has been witnessed in the last couple  of quarters.We are updating our model and price estimate for Abbott Labs.Pharma, Nutritional to Drive GrowthPost-spin-off, Abbott Labs is now left with generic drugs as   research-based proprietary drugs like Humira have been retained by  AbbVie. However since the split is effective from Jan. 1, earnings  will include sales from proprietary drugs including Humira and AndroGel,  which are expected to exhibit continued strong growth. However,  expected loss of revenues from cholesterol drug Trilipix/  TriCor and  HIV drug  Kaletra, will offset some of the gains. With Abbott's  significant presence in rapidly growing emerging markets like India,    China and Russia, we expect established  pharmaceuticals, which are  mainly generic drugs, to also perform well, if one excludes the   currency  impact.We expect the nutritional segment to continue to  post high  single-digit growth on back of Similac and other  pediatric nutritional  products like PediaSure,  Ensure and Glucerna. This will be offset by a  relatively slow growth from adult   nutritional products. Moderate  growth is expected from vascular  and diagnostics division (excluding  to certain royalty and supply arrangement revenues  and currency  impact), after the company launched various  products including its  next-generation Drug Eluting Stent (DES) XIENCE   Xpedition and  XIENCE PRIME in different parts of the world.However, the U.S. dollar is still firm against most of the currencies  around the globe, which will continue to weigh on overall revenues from  international market. While Abbott Labs will have relatively lower  margins excluding AbbVie business, we expect overall margins to improve  slightly. Abbott has manufacturing operations around the world, and a  strong U.S. dollar has historically favorably impacted costs, too.Long-Term Growth IntactPer capita income levels in many emerging markets  are rising    rapidly,  which should lead to better insurance coverage and  better    healthcare.  Additionally, new studies and increased access to     information have led  to rising health consciousness in these markets.    These factors should drive growth for new ""Abbott Labs.""In the pharmaceutical business, the company committed to several   purchases in the past like  Solvay and Piramal to diversify its   portfolio of offerings and expand  into emerging markets. On a similar   note,  the company recently opened a nutritional R&D center in India and struck an R&D deal with a Russian group to boost its nutritional business.In the vascular business, the  company will soon be launching its  next-generation DES XIENCE  Xpedition in the U.S.,  following recent FDA approval. Further, Abbott has begun phase III  clinical trials in  the U.S. to prove efficacy and safety for world's  first drug eluting  bioresorbable stent, Absorb, which dissolves in   patients' bloodstreams  after finishing treatment of  narrowed /diseased  arteries. While the  device is currently approved and being sold in  Europe and other markets,  the large U.S. market still evades it,  pending clinical trials.Disclosure: No positions."

The whisper number is $1.61, 11 cents ahead of the analysts' estimate.

The strongest price movement of -1.4% comes within ten trading days when the company reports earnings that beat the whisper number, and -1.3% within thirty trading days when the company reports earnings that miss the whisper number (negative reactor).Last quarter the company reported earnings three cents ahead of the whisper number.

Many investors believe that beating or missing the whisper number has the greatest impact on stock movement. If the number is exceeded, the stock is rewarded and prices move higher. If the number is missed, the stock is punished and prices move lower. Unlike the analysts estimate, the ""whisper number"" from WhisperNumber.com has actually been proven to have a greater impact on stock movement.Since 1998, WhisperNumber.com has been tracking and publishing ""crowd sourced estimates"" for earnings.

We also have two independent academic studies supporting the premise that investor expectations for quarterly earnings (our whisper numbers) provide greater returns when used as an investment vehicle, and have a greater impact on stock movement than analysts' consensus estimates.A company's ""price reaction"" to the whisper number expectation is the key - on average companies that exceed the whisper are ""rewarded,"" while companies that miss are ""punished"" following an earnings report.According to the Wall Street Journal, ""positive surprises are becoming so common they are nearly universal. They are predetermined in a cynical tango-clinch between companies and the analysts who cover them. All the numbers are gamed at this point.""

Meanwhile, we provide the detailed  structure and prospects of the companies following the spin-off.See our complete analysis for Abbott Labs hereAbbott Labs: A Well-Diversified Play Post spin-off, Abbott Labs has a diverse portfolio of healthcare products including:While this business is left with products having relatively lower  margins, we expect   growth to be fairly stable in the long term. These  businesses have a   significant presence in rapidly growing markets like  India,  China and  Russia and should provide a substantial growth  opportunity.In the pharmaceutical business, the company committed to several    purchases in the past like  Solvay and Piramal to diversify its    portfolio and expand  into emerging markets. On a similar  note, the   company recently opened a nutritional R&D center in India and struck an R&D deal with a Russian group  to boost its nutritional business. In the vascular business, the    company is developing a next generation Drug  Eluting Stent (DES),   XIENCE  Xpedition, which is expected to launch in Europe this  year and   in the U.S. in  2013. Further, the company’s XIENCE PRIME   received   approval in Japan  earlier this year.AbbVie: Dependence On Humira Could Hurt AbbVie has the higher-margin proprietary  pharmaceuticals and  biologics, including primary care and specialty care    drugs that  prevent and treat conditions  such as autoimmune diseases,    lipid  disorders, kidney diseases, prostate  cancer, thyroid diseases   and   HIV. The company’s prized asset, the blockbuster drug Humira, is part   of AbbVie and will drive future revenues for the  company.However, even greater dependence on  Humira is a concern. Humira will   lose patent protection in late 2016 in  the U.S. and  mid-2017 in   Europe. The company’s current pipeline doesn’t have a lot of very    strong potential  blockbuster drugs, which could limit its growth    potential in the  long term. Recently   its partner Reata  Pharmaceuticals discontinued a late-stage trial of   their potential  blockbuster drug for chronic kidney disease and   diabetes due to safety  concerns raised by an independent safety   committee.Another worry is the growing competition for Humira (Read: Pfizer Receives Major Boost As FDA Approves RA Drug Tofacitinib). Further, Tricor went off-patent in July 2012 while other drugs such as Niaspan and Kaletra are seeing a decline in sales due to significant competition.Disclosure: No positions."
1096781,25120,2013-01-06T08:06:18-05:00,,"This week, the long-anticipated split of Abbott Laboratories (ABT) finally took place. Shareholders who held their shares before the start of 2013 will now hold one share in Abbott Laboratories and one share in AbbVie (ABBV).The SplitAs a result of the split, shareholders will now own a medical device company which continues to operate under its old name. Shareholders will furthermore hold one share in AbbVie which continues with its proprietary pharmaceutical activities. Both companies generate roughly $21 billion and $18 billion in annual revenues, respectively.Shares of Abbott closed at $34.39 on Friday, while shares of AbbVie ended at $33.07, for a combined value of $67.46. The combined value of the holdings has increased 3.0% from Monday's closing price of $65.50 per share.Abbott announced the plans to split itself up already back in 2011. It has not been the first company which has come under pressure of shareholders to split itself up. Last year, ConocoPhillips split itself up into Conoco (COP) which focuses on exploration and production, and Phillips 66 (PSX), focused on the refining and downstream activities.Risky AbbVieMany commentators argue that the split is a good thing for investors, as it allows the market to price the businesses on an individual basis. Many attributed a possible conglomerate discount under the old structure to the riskiness of the proprietary pharmaceutical activities now held by AbbVie.The main risk lies within the Humira drug, which is focused on rheumatoid arthritis, which is facing competitive pressure from Pfizer (PFE). The drug generated roughly $8 billion in annual revenues, compared to total revenues of $18 billion for the entire business. The drug is losing patent protection at the end of 2016 in North America and a year later in Europe. Another worrisome factor is the empty pipeline of the business after the expiration of Humira. Luckily for AbbVie, the company has time and resources to alleviate the concerns.Steady Abbott LaboratoriesAbbott Laboratories, on the other hand, owns very diverse and stable businesses. It generates revenues from four major divisions including generic drugs, nutritionals, vascular and diagnostics, thereby providing quite some diversification.Even more interesting, the business generates some 40% from its revenues from emerging markets, including India and China, and aims to boost that percentage to 50% in the coming years.AbbVie's ValuationAs a result of the split, AbbVie has been given roughly $7.2 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments and it operates with a total debt position of roughly $15.7 billion, for a net debt position of roughly $8.5 billion. The market values the spin-off at $54.4 billion.For the first nine months of 2012, AbbVie generated $13.2 billion in revenues on which it reported a net income of $3.7 billion. At this pace, the company is on track to generate annual revenues of $17.6 billion on which it could earn almost $5.0 billion.This values AbbVie's operating assets at roughly 3.1 times annual revenues and roughly 11 times annual earnings. The company will pay $0.40 in dividends per share on a quarterly basis for an annual dividend yield of 4.6%.Abbott's ValuationAbbott on the other hand ended its third quarter with a net debt position of $2.5 billion. Abbott is valued at $52.3 billion at the moment.For the first nine months of 2012, Abbott generated $15.8 billion in revenues on which it net earned $1.2 billion. The company is on track to generate annual revenues of $21 billion on which it could earn roughly $1.6 billion. This values the firm at 2.5 times annual revenues and 32-33 times annual earnings.Abbott is expected to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share for an annual dividend yield of 1.7%.Investment ThesisAbbVie is without a doubt the more risky business on an operational basis, given its reliance on Humira. On the other hand, Abbott has superior product and geographical diversification.Investors should note that this risk is already priced after the split. Shares of AbbVie trade at 3.1 times 2012 revenues and merely 11 times earnings. Furthermore, the company pays a 4.6% dividend yield.Abbott on the other hand, trades at 2.5 times annual revenues and 32 times annual earnings. This earnings multiple is expected to come down significantly as analysts expect earnings to increase significantly in the coming year. The company pays a quarterly dividend of just 1.7%.Following the spin-off, the risk-reward ratio for AbbVie's shares is far better than Abbott at the moment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1926 and has increased its dividend payments for 40 consecutive years.Dividend Income vs. MMA: Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account (MMA) or Treasury bond? This section compares the earning ability of this stock with a high yield MMA. Two items are considered in this section, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. NPV MMA Diff. 2. Years to > MMAABT earned a Star in this section for its NPV MMA Diff. of the $1,193. This amount is in excess of the $500 target I look for in a stock that has increased dividends as long as ABT has. The stock's current yield of 3.07% exceeds the 2.42% estimated 20-year average MMA rate.Memberships and Peers: ABT is a member of the S&P 500, a Dividend Aristocrat, a member of the Broad Dividend Achievers™ Index and a Dividend Champion. The company's peer group includes: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) with a 4.2% yield, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) with a 3.5% yield, and Eli Lilly & Co. (NYSE:LLY) with a 4.0% yield.Conclusion: ABT did not earn any Stars in the Fair Value section, earned three Stars in the Dividend Analytical Data section and earned one Star in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a total of four Stars. This quantitatively ranks ABT as a 4-Star Strong stock.Using my D4L-PreScreen.xls model, I determined the share price would need to increase to $93.45 before ABT's NPV MMA Differential decreased to the $500 minimum that I look for in a stock with 40 years of consecutive dividend increases. At that price the stock would yield 2.2%.Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the target $500 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 3.4%. This dividend growth rate is lower than the 6.9% used in this analysis, thus providing a margin of safety. ABT has a risk rating of 1.25, which classifies it as a Low risk stock.ABT is the best of breed pharmaceutical company with its wide array of patent-protected drugs, diagnostics business, nutritional division and vascular group. Effective January 1, 2013, ABT will spin off its R&D-based drug business in the form of shares of a new publicly traded firm called Abbvie. Some analysts believe the spin-off will result in higher valuations for each company, with investors better able to focus and appreciate the respective growth potential of each firm.With its strong financials and excellent management team, ABT is in a position to support and continue to grow its dividend. I will continue to add to my position when it is trading at or below my calculated fair value of $55.21 and as my allocation allows.Disclosure: At the time of this writing, I was long ABT (5.1% of my Dividend Growth Portfolio) and also held positions in JNJ. See a list of all my dividend growth holdings here.Disclaimer: Material presented here is for  informational purposes only. The above quantitative stock analysis,  including the Star rating, is mechanically calculated and is based on  historical information.

1024011,33161,2012-11-21T16:09:07-05:00,,"Since the beginning of the year, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has delivered a 12% return. This excellent return has been coupled with a 3.23% dividend yield which has added to shareholder gains. Even though ABT has delivered strong performance over the course of the year, it has erased nearly 12% of gains over the past month and a half. Through this article, I will present the case that this pullback in share price represents a purchasing opportunity in a fundamentally strong organization.A Breakout of ReturnsIn order to study ABT, I have relied heavily on return on assets and return on equity. Return on assets is the net income of the firm divided by average total assets. This ratio is very helpful for an analyst in that it demonstrates how efficiently an organization is able to translate assets into profits. Return on equity is the net income of the firm divided by directly-invested shareholder equity. Return on equity provides insight into the skill of management in using investments to bring income into the organization. In the chart below, 5 years of returns can be seen for ABT.Analysts are very fortunate when studying the history of this organization in that returns have trended fairly consistently throughout the years. Beginning in 2008, return on assets and return on equity increased until the middle of 2009, in a fairly uninterrupted uptrend. During this time period, Abbott Laboratories strengthened itself by generating a stronger return on its asset and shareholder investments. This period of strong performance was marked by share volatility in a reflection of global economic trends. In the middle of 2009, ABT reversed its multi-quarter fundamental improvement and began a process in which returns declined until the third quarter of 2011. Over this time period, share price experienced volatility and oscillated around $50 per share. During the fourth quarter of 2011, a fascinating development occurred in which organization returns began an uptrend. This uptrend was noteworthy in that ABT's stock experienced a strong upwards breakout on high volume in November of 2011. This breakout led to strong buying for the next 3 quarters and share price increasing by over 30% at its highs.The most recent quarter of financial performance of ABT was excellent. Returns have surged to multi-year highs and in so doing, ABT has substantiated its recent gain in share price. Currently, ABT is able to deliver $25 in profit for every $100 of directly-invested shareholder equity and $10 for every $100 of assets. These returns are very strong and may continue in the future. As previously shown, returns tend to trend fairly consistently within ABT and it has been in a fundamental uptrend for the past year. I believe that it is entirely possible that the trend which began in late 2011 will continue into the coming business cycle. For this reason, I believe that the recent decrease in share price represents a buying opportunity in ABT. ABT has proven its ability to generate profits from its assets and equity and over the past year it has experienced a fundamental ""bottoming"" in which performance has markedly improved. I believe that investors seeking to purchase ABT may be rewarded with a strong return as the recent surge in price continues in the future.Technically SpeakingEven though I advocate purchasing ABT, I do not believe that investors should immediately buy the security. The trend has been very strong over the past year, but the recent pullback should be a warning shot to any investor. Prices do not increase for ever and investors who are late to the show expose themselves to greater quantities of risk. ABT has technically ended its multi-month uptrend and investors would be wise to wait until a new upwards breakout has occurred. Through patience, a trader or investor can best position himself to profit from an increase in ABT's share price. Technically speaking, I believe that any week which ends above $65 per share represents a purchasing signal. ABT has historically struggled with the price level of $65 and over the past 5 months, both support and resistance has been found here 3 times. For this reason, I believe that many individuals view this level with added significance and I believe that a new trend will have started if price is able to overcome this threshold. In the chart below, I have graphically shown this critical level as well as the broken trend line which signals the end of the uptrend.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1028391,24491,2012-11-26T11:55:15-05:00,,"As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In the combined Abbott's (NYSE:ABT) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $76, higher than where it is currently trading.At Valuentum, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from one to 10, with 10 being the best. Essentially, we're looking for firms that overlap investment methodologies, thereby revealing the greatest interest by investors (we like firms that fall in the center of the diagram below). We like stocks that score nine or 10 on our scale.Click to enlarge images.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Abbott Laboratories posts a VBI score of four on our scale, reflecting our ""fairly valued"" DCF assessment of the firm, its attractive relative valuation versus peers, and very bearish techinicals. We compare Abbott to peers Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Merck (NYSE:MRK), and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE).Our Report on Abbott LaboratoriesAbout AbbottAbbott is a healthcare company that is dedicated to discovering new medicines/therapies and new and innovative ways to manage health. The firm's product lineup spans the continuum of care, from nutritional products through pharmaceutical therapies.Investment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsBusiness QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Abbott Laboratories' three-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 26.3%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of Excellent. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Abbott Laboratories' free cash flow margin has averaged about 21.2% during the past three years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively strong. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. (For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com.) At Abbott Laboratories, cash flow from operations increased about 30% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 37% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Abbott Laboratories' shares are worth between $61.00 and $91.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's low ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $76 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 22.1 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 13.5 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 3.4% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's three-year historical compound annual growth rate of 9.6%. Our model reflects a five-year projected average operating margin of 26.2%, which is above Abbott Laboratories' trailing three-year average. Beyond year five, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.1% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Abbott Laboratories, we use a 10% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $76 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Abbott Laboratories. We think the firm is attractive below $61 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $91 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Abbott Laboratories' fair value at this point in time to be about $76 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Abbott Laboratories' expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in year three represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $95 per share in year three represents our existing fair value per share of $76 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

This dividend champion has boosted distributions for 40 years in a row.The company's last dividend increase was in February 2012 when the Board of Directors approved a 6.30% increase to 51 cents/share. The company's peer group includes Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) and Merck (NYSE:MRK).Over the past decade this dividend growth stock has delivered an annualized total return of 8.30% to its shareholders.The company has managed to deliver a 6% average increase in annual EPS since 2002. Analysts expect Abbott to earn $5.08 per share in 2012 and $5.27 per share in 2013. In comparison, the company earned $3.01/share in 2011.The growth would come from an increase in sales in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis drug Humira and the Xience drug eluting stent. The company's growth is also dependent on the successful integration of the pharmaceuticals unit that it purchased from Solvay for $6.2 billion in 2010, which included Abbott with the cholesterol drugs Tricor and Trilipix. New launches and overseas market expansion should add in to Abbott's bottom line as well. Threats include generic competition to some of its cholesterol drugs. Abbott announced its intent to split in two companies in October 2011. The deal is expected to close by January 1, 2013.The first one will be a research-based pharmaceuticals company, named Abbvie, which will own Abbott's premier drug names such as Humira, Lupron and Synagis to name a few. It would be basically a drug company, which focuses on keeping its pipeline of new drugs coming to the market, through constant investment in research and development. Drug companies have faced steep patent cliffs over the past several years, which has intensified mergers in the sector. The second company will be a diversified medical products company, and its name would remain Abbott. It would own established nutritional products, medical devices and diagnostics products as well as generic drugs outside of the US.The return on equity has remained above 20% over the past decade, with the exception of a brief decline in 2006. Rather than focus on absolute values for this indicator, I generally want to see at least a stable return on equity over time.The annual dividend payment has increased by 8.70% per year over the past decade, which is higher than the growth in EPS.A 9% growth in distributions translates into the dividend payment doubling every eight years on average. If we look at historical data, going as far back as 1983, one would notice that the company had managed to double distributions every six years on average.The dividend payout ratio has mostly remained above 50%, with the exception of a brief decline in the 2008 - 2009 period. Based on forward earnings, the company's dividend payout ratio will likely decrease below 50%. A lower payout is always a plus, since it leaves room for consistent dividend growth minimizing the impact of short-term fluctuations in earnings.Currently Abbott is attractively valued at 15.90 times earnings, yields 3.20% and has a sustainable distribution. I recently added to my position in the stock.Disclosure: I am long ABT, JNJ. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it.

990711,35521,2012-11-08T12:28:07-05:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) engages in the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of health care products worldwide and operates in five segments: Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products, Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products and Vascular Products. With its wide lineup of patent-protected drugs and strong operations in all segments, the long-term growth outlook for ABT is optimistic and ABT will continue to enjoy a wide economic moat. Moreover, ABT's decision to split itself into two is likely to result in two well-positioned companies, one in drug and the other in diversified health-care, with strong competitive advantages. However, in the short-term, ABT is under some selling pressure after hitting a 52-week high and investors may want to wait until the technical trend starts to reverse before setting up the long position or leveraging the options strategy to acquire the stock at a discounted price.Recent Development and Fundamentals OverviewOn Oct. 17, 2012, ABT exceed its third quarter guidance with double-digit growth in EPS. ABT posted $1.9 billion net income and $1.30 EPS ($1.21 GAAP EPS), with a 10% increase compared to its $1.18 EPS during the same period a year ago, as reported by Marie Cabural from ValueWalk. Despite the missing of sales estimate, the Company reported a higher gross margin of 63.8%, as compared to the estimate of 62.0%. During the period, the Company spent $1.16 billion in R&D and the drug and medical devices maker announced the initiation of a Phase 3 HCV clinical trial for its interferon-free hepatitis C (HCV) program in genotype 1 (GT1) patients.ABT also announced its plan to split the operations into two separate companies, where the split could occur in early 2013. The diversified medical products business will retain the Abbott name, and the newly formed company, AbbVie, will be a research-based pure-play pharmaceutical company. However, as stated by Miles White, Chairman and CEO of ABT, investors should not to ""look for anything big"" and ""my focus is primarily organic,"" as reported by Bruce Japsen from Forbes.On Nov. 5, 2012, as reported by Reuters, ABT subsidiary AbbVie Inc. announced the pricing of a $14.7 billion private placement notes offering. The offering details are as followed: $3.5 billion of 1.20% senior notes due 2015, $4 billion of 1.75% senior notes due 2017, $1 billion of 2.00% senior notes due 2018, $3.1 billion of 2.90% senior notes due 2022, $2.6 billion of 4.40% senior notes due 2042, and $500 million of floating rate senior notes due 2015 (the Floating Rate Notes, and, together with the 2015 Notes, the 2017 Notes, the 2018 Notes, the 2022 Notes and the 2042 Notes, the Notes). The proceedings will be used to fund the previously announced cash tender for certain of Abbott's outstanding notes.From the fundamental perspective, the splitting of ABT should enhance its operating margin and net margin with increased focus and efficiency, where ABT's current operating margin of 16.1% ttm and net margin of 12.4% ttm are both trailing the industry average of 22.7% and 16.0% ttm. Investors should be comfortable with ABT's higher than average ROE of 19.2 and much lowered debt-to-equity of 0.5, as compared to the average of 6.0 in the industry of major drug manufacturers. ABT is currently fairly valued, despite higher than the average P/E, which can be justified with its diversified portfolio of patent drugs and its solid cash flow, supported by the strong balance sheet.As written in my article of ""3 Solid Healthcare Stocks To Ride The Baby Boomer Trend Through Options,"" ABT is another great company to capture the trend of aging baby boomers and increased drug shortage, accompanied by controlled supply.Technical AnalysisOn Tuesday, ABT closed at $64.82 with a 0.34% drop. The volume of 5.50M was 37% less than the average 30 day volume of 8.74M, where the reduced volume may be caused by the U.S. presidential election. ABT had dropped 10.56% after hitting a 52-week high of $72.47, before the Q3 earnings release on Oct. 17. As seen from the chart below, the MACD (12, 26, 9) indicator started to show a bearish sign on Oct. 17 and ABT sliced and closed below its 50-day MV of $67.52 on Oct. 18. Since then, ABT was trading below its 50-day MV and in the range of $64 - $66. The momentum indicator RSI (14) of 34.55 is also showing increased selling momentum and below 30 is considered as over-sold. The next major technical support for ABT will be at $62.30, the 200-day MV, followed by $59.55, S2 pivot point. If ABT can clear the major resistance of 50-day MV, the next resistance is $70.47, R1 pivot point, followed by $75.45, R2 pivot point.Options PlayWith the near-term uncertainties due to the election effect and the continued selling pressure, we suggest ABT investors to wait and build the position slowly for this great long-term healthcare holding. If MACD starts to show a bullish signal and RSI (14) starts to increase toward 50, the middle line, investors can review the credit put spread options play as below to acquire ABT stock at a further discounted price if the options play fails to generate the profit. For example, if ABT stabilizes at $62 and when the above technical indicators start to show the bullish sign, a credit put spread can be set up by shorting 1x Feb. 2013 Put at the strike price of $60 and buying 1x Feb. 2013 Put at the strike price of $55.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

991671,25159,2012-11-08T15:29:02-05:00,,"Abbott (NYSE:ABT) recently announced financial results for the third quarter ended September 30th, 2012. Diluted earnings per share, excluding specified items, were $1.30, reflecting 10.2% growth, exceeding the company's guidance range. Diluted earnings per share under GAAP were $1.21, including specified items. Excluding foreign exchange, worldwide sales at $9.77 billion increased 4.1%. This was made up of $4.2 billion in the United States and $5.55 billion in the rest of the world. Reported sales decreased 0.4%, if you account for an unfavorable 4.5% effect of adverse foreign exchange rates.Abbott is narrowing its ongoing earnings-per-share guidance for 2012 to $5.06 to $5.08 a share from $5.00 to $5.10 a share, showing another year of strong performance. Including specified items, projected earnings per share under GAAP would be $3.83 to $3.85 a share for the full-year 2012. Net earnings amounted to $1.94 billion compared to $303 million in the same quarter of the previous year. However, it should be noted that the same quarter of the previous year included $1.5 billion in litigation reserves. For the nine months to September 30, 2012, total revenues at $$29 billion showed a 2% increase over $28.47 billion recorded in the same quarter of the previous year. Net earnings at $4.9 billion showed a 57% increase over the figure of $3.11 billion year on year. Diluted EPS per common share was $3.06 per share against $1.98 per share, an increase of over 54%.In emerging markets, sales increased more than 10%, excluding foreign exchange, with strong double-digit growth in many of the key emerging markets across Abbott's businesses. Worldwide Nutritionals sales increased 6.3% in the quarter, excluding an unfavorable 1.8% effect of foreign exchange. U.S. Nutritionals increased 5.0%, with U.S. Pediatric Nutritionals sales grew 7.9% on gains for the infant formula, Similac, and double-digit growth of PediaSure. U.S. Adult Nutritionals grew 3.1%, driven by growth of Ensure and Glucerna. International Nutritionals grew by 7.4%, excluding an unfavorable 3.3% effect of unfavorable foreign exchange rates, driven by continued growth of both the pediatric and adult segments. Global sales of Core Laboratory Diagnostics increased 7.2%, excluding an unfavorable 5.5% effect of foreign exchange rates, driven by 8.3% international growth, excluding an unfavorable 6.8% effect of foreign exchange. Worldwide Proprietary Pharmaceuticals sales grew by 6.4%, excluding an unfavorable 4.0% effect of adverse foreign exchange rates, because of strong growth in key franchises including HUMIRA and AndroGel.In October 2011, Abbott announced plans to separate into two publicly traded companies with one company in diversified medical products and the other company in research-based pharmaceuticals. The diversified medical products company will consist of the branded generic pharmaceuticals, devices, diagnostics and nutritionals businesses, and will retain the Abbott name. The research-based pharmaceutical company, named AbbVie, will include Abbott's current portfolio of proprietary pharmaceuticals and biologics. It is expected that the two companies will each pay a dividend which, when combined, will at least be equal to the current Abbott dividend at the time of separation. The separation is expected to be completed on January 1st, 2013.Abbott has made significant progress in 2012 in development of its pharmaceutical pipeline, which currently includes more than 20 compounds or new indications. Abbott's antiviral program is focused on developing treatments for Hepatitis C (HCV), a disease that affects more than 170 million people worldwide. The broad-based HCV program includes three mechanisms of action in clinical trials, including protease, polymerase and NS5A inhibitors with the objective of transforming current treatment practices by shortening the duration of therapy, improving tolerability and increasing cure rates. The company recently initiated a Phase 3 clinical program to evaluate its interferon-free regimen in HCV genotype 1 (GT1) patients.There are some factors to be considered in analyzing the company. The company has paid a dividend since 1924 and the present dividend yield stands at around 3%. The company is focused primarily in the manufacture of healthcare products which people buy even in tough economic conditions so that the company is for all intents and purposes recession proof. It also does not have a major patent cliff problem. Finally, the company has a strong balance sheet with a cash flow of around $11 billion compared to $18 billion in debt.One of the company's more interesting products is the newly introduced plastic stent called Absorb. Since September 2012 Absorb, the world's first drug-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS), has been available in more than 30 countries across Europe and parts of Asia Pacific and Latin America though it is not yet approved for sale in the U.S. Unlike a metal stent, this stent dissolves naturally when support for the blood is no longer required. Absorb is coated with a drug called everolimus, which inhibits in-stent thickening in the coronary arteries. Everolimus was developed by Novartis (NYSE:NVS) and licensed to Abbott. San Diego based Reva Medical's ReZolve Bioresorbable Coronary Stent is also designed to restore blood flow and promote arterial healing, before gradually dissolving. Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) is an investor in Reva while Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX), a major player in stents, has an option to negotiate for a worldwide exclusive right to distribute its stent products.The revenue growth at Abbott is in sharp contrast to competitors such as Merck (NYSE:MRK), which saw a 4% decline, and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), which saw a 2% decline. I expect Abbott's strong product development pipeline will lead to continued growth. This is a strong and well managed healthcare company with a decent dividend yield. If you are looking for great exposure to the healthcare sector, I strongly recommend buying Abbott today.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

956221,29161,2012-10-26T18:37:41-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has been a leader in the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries for a long time now. Based on the fact that this company's dividends are solid and its revenues are stable, added to the intended spin off, Abbott is an ideal investment for those interested in investing in these industries. With its business strategically diversified into the pharmaceutical, medical, and nutritional industries, Abbott is here to stay.Just recently, the shares of this giant company were hitting new 52-week highs but, after the company reported its earnings for the third quarter, its stock experienced a pullback. Even at this, there is every indication that the company's stock, within the next few days and weeks, will bounce back. Naturally, it would take a lot to fully convince most investors as to why they should consider buying Abbott. For this reason, I want investors to take the following factors into consideration.Factor number one is based on the fact that presently the company's stock yields almost 3%. The company has also paid a dividend since 1924. The second factor is that since the company is concentrated primarily in the manufacture of healthcare products, even though times get extremely tough, there is every tendency that it would not experience a huge drop as far as its revenues are concerned. A consumer would rather cut back on his or her expenses on luxury items than cut back on healthcare. Factor number three borders on the company's balance sheet, which is confirmed to be very strong with a cash flow of around $11 billion and $18 billion in debt.Here is another reason why investors should cash in on the current pullback in Abbott's stock: the company currently has plans to separate the company into two different publicly traded companies in a few months time. This means that there would be an increase in shareholder value. With the creation of the two separate companies, while Abbott handles the manufacture of consumer brands and medical devices and is expected to generate around $21 billion in revenues, the other company, AbbVie, will take care of the production of prescription medicines, with an expected revenue generation of around $18 billion. And finally, the company is not looking back when it comes to investing in research and development. This is an endeavor that is known to lead to the manufacture of new products, and at the same time, increase the future growth potential of a given company.In 2011 alone, Abbott spent about $4.1 billion on R&D. The company has also announced positive data for prospective Hepatitis C treatment. Although this data for prospective Hepatitis C treatment is still in phase 2b, the Hepatitis C market is currently worth more than a billion in any given year. The company's revenue will surely experience a boost, if this potential drug for treatment of Hepatitis C finally sees the light of day. With all these facts, I don't think any investor in the health and pharmaceutical sector would need further promptings to start investing in Abbott Laboratories.This brings us to Merck (NYSE:MRK). The company is one of the largest drug manufacturers in the world. Not only does it manufacture pharmaceuticals, it also manufactures vaccines and some consumer health products. In the last four months, the company's shares have risen from the $37 it maintained in June to well over $47 per share currently. With its 52-week range between $32.31 to $47.99, earnings estimates for 2012 at $3.81 per share, earnings estimate for 2013 at $3.72 per share and annual dividend of $1.68 per share at 3.6% yields, it could be the right time for investors to take their profits and wait for a correction in the company's stock. The company recently reported third quarter earnings. Global sales amounted to $11.5 billion, a 4% decrease compared to the same quarter in 2011. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased to $0.95, while GAAP earnings came in at $0.56.Now let's compare Abbott to another giant in the healthcare and pharmaceutical world, GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK). Among the top rated pharmaceutical companies, GlaxoSmithKline has stayed ahead with a 223.8% EPS growth in 2012 and 8.78% projected growth for 2013. In comparison to the firms mentioned above, the company's 2.4 debt-to-equity ratio is rated as the highest. The company also has an annualized dividend of around $2.11 with a sustained increase of 3.6% in its stock as shown in its last earnings report. The company's recent earnings report showed a total of $8.3 billion in revenue for the second quarter, which is a decrease of 2% year-on-year (YOY). Its operating profit was $2.23 billion, a 1% decrease YOY. The company's sales in the U.S. declined 6%, while sales in Europe showed a decline of 8%. These declines were mostly as a result of discontinued production of certain brands, increase in generic competition and regulatory and macroeconomic headwinds. In Japan, the sales of pharmaceuticals and vaccines increased by 6%. There was a general increase of 7% in the sales of consumer healthcare products. It would also interest investors to know that GlaxoSmithKline has plans of launching about 8 new products in the next 2 years. These products include but not limited to treatments for HIV, type 2 diabetes and COPD.Altria (NYSE:MO) has continued to maintain sustainable dividend levels but the company really needs to work on reducing its debt. With its acquisition of a 27% stake of SAB Miller, it should also be working towards the evaluation of such an acquisition and to determine if the dividend can actually outgrow inflation.Finally, I will make a mention of Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), another major pharmaceutical company. With the company's newly approved drugs, Inlyta and Xalkori and the ones awaiting approval from FDA, it is estimated to generate aggregate revenues of $700 million in 2012, $2.2 billion in 2013, $3.2 billion in 2014, $4.3 billion in 2015 and $5.3 billion in 2016. This means that after 2013, the company's new products will greatly impact its revenue growth. Xalkori is among the couple of drugs that are expected to become blockbuster drugs from Pfizer.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1354711,23479,2013-04-19T13:11:52-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) announced on April 17 that its total sales for the first  quarter of 2013 were almost $5.4 billion, up 1.8% from the same period  last year. As mentioned in our pre-earnings analysis,  the primary driver for this growth was the company’s nutritional  division, which benefited from an over 14% revenue growth in the  emerging markets - especially China. The company’s diagnostics  division’s revenue also grew by 4.4% y-o-y on the back of sales growth  in Core Laboratory and Point of Care Diagnostics products. The only area  of concern for the company was its medical devices division, where  revenues declined y-o-y by 4.6%.The earnings result of the company is  generally in line with our expectations, and going forward we expect the  nutritional business to continue growing on the back of increasing  demand in emerging markets. Another reason why the sale of nutritional  products is also going to be strong in the future is that the company  continues to leverage its strong brands and launch new products.Abbott’s stock currently trades at  around $37 per share. We will soon release an updated model for the  company on our website and revise our price estimate for the same. Nutritionals Continue To Drive SalesAs mentioned in our pre-earnings article,  the nutritionals division accounts for nearly 30% of the value in  Abbott’s stock and its revenue has been growing at a healthy pace of  7-8% over the last couple of years. The current quarter’s revenue growth  of 8.7% is actually higher than that average and is hence positive for the company.Driving this growth are Abbott’s  pediatric nutritional products such as Similac and PediaSure. These  products account for 58% of Abbott’s total 1Q13 nutritional sales of  around $1.7 billion and the worldwide sales of these products increased  over 13% y-o-y in this quarter - primarily due to a strong demand pull  from emerging markets. The company continues to expand geographically in  these markets and is also benefiting from an uptake in newly launched  products.At the same time, the company’s adult  nutritionals business witnessed around 3% of y-o-y revenue growth in  this quarter and is benefiting from a “continued expansion of the adult  nutrition market where Abbott is the global leader.” [1]Diagnostics Division Also Growing WellAbbott’s diagnostics division reported a  4.4% y-o-y increase in its worldwide sales and the major highlights for  this division were (1) Point of Care Diagnostics, which grew around 27%  in the U.S. due to continued uptake of new assays and continued market  penetration, and (2) core laboratory diagnostics products, which grew by  5.9% on an operational basis on the back of a strong performance in key  emerging markets, such as China, Russia and Brazil.Going forward, we expect the sales in  this division to continue growing as new products from the company hit  the markets. Abbott is currently “developing six new platforms across  Core Laboratory, Molecular and Point of Care that are designed to  improve service to customers, enhance laboratory productivity, improve  efficiency and reduce costs."" [1]However, Medical Devices Are DecliningAbbott’s worldwide medical devices sales  decreased by 3% on an operational basis as the largest segment within  this division, Vascular products, was “impacted by pricing pressure and a  decline in procedures due to market conditions,"" according to the  company’s press release. [1] An expected decline of certain royalty revenues further affected these revenues.However, there were signs of hope within  this segment as the company’s new product introductions like the XIENCE  Xpedition (which is a drug-eluting stent) and Absorb (claimed to be the  world’s first and only coronary bioresorbable vascular scaffold) are  seeing strong demand in emerging markets.While we expect pricing pressures and  market conditions to continue pushing profits for this segment downwards  in the near term, there is a likelihood that once market conditions  improve a lot of pent up demand for surgical procedures will be released  and Abbott’s vascular products sales in the U.S. will improve.Disclosure: No positions."
1021511,23479,2012-11-20T15:22:32-05:00,,"This year through October, big pharmaceutical companies have seen a surge in their stock prices. With close to 30-35% return, Abbott Labs  (NYSE:ABT) has outperformed the overall healthcare sector. But the  stock slumped almost 10% from the highs seen in October after it  announced results. However, we believe the company will bounce back  based on  our $67 price estimate,  barring no major negative developments in the U.S. economy and the  market. Below, we discuss the factors that could take the company’s stock  back to our price estimate.Pharmaceuticals -  These include primary care and specialty care drugs that prevent and  treat conditions  such as autoimmune diseases, lipid disorders, kidney  diseases, prostate  cancer, thyroid diseases and HIV.In the pharmaceuticals segment, we expect overall pharmaceutical  sales to increase in the near term backed by key proprietary drugs  including Humira,  AndroGel and  Creon. Further, there are no major  patent expiries in the near term except for   Tricor, which went  off-patent in July. Humira is Abbott’s single largest source of revenues  and the undisputed leader in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The  drug garners close to $8 billion in sales. While the drug’s growth now  seems to be slowing down, as witnessed in the last quarter, it is still  significantly higher at 10%, considering the higher base sales.Further, as competition grows, we anticipate the drug to exhibit  mid-single digit growth, taking its sales to top $10 billion by 2013. It  may be difficult to change a  physician’s prescription   habits for  biologics, which could reduce the gravity of the competition. Also, the  company is banking on expanding the   drug’s base to new indications to  fend off competition from   new entrants. The addition of new  indications may continue to drive growth for Humira. Other drugs like  Androgel (testosterone gel) also continue to see strong demand growth.In addition, the company acquired Solvay and Piramal’s Healhcare  solutions business to diversify its  portfolio by adding generics and  expand  into emerging markets. Abbott also struck a R&D deal with  ChemDiv Research Institute (CDRI), a part of Russian R&D group  ChemRar High Tech Center.Emerging markets are expected to grow at double-digit rates, much  faster than the developed U.S. and European markets. Per capita income  levels in many emerging markets   are also rising rapidly, which should  lead to better insurance coverage and healthcare. Additionally, new  studies and better access to   information have led to rising health  consciousness in these markets. The acquisitions place the company well  to tap the substantial growth opportunities. We believe the company will  be able to leverage its global  footprint  and strong brand to take  advantage of untapped  opportunities  and drive further  growth in these  markets. However,  ineffective patent laws in many of these countries  have proven to be a  hurdle for large pharmaceutical companies.As the emerging markets will see their revenue share increase, the  company’s EBITDA margins could decline, as margins from international  markets are usually lower than that  of the  U.S. market due to higher  price sensitivity among consumers. However, we have already incorporated  these factors into our forecast.Our concerns are aroused by the fact that the company doesn’t  have  many blockbuster potential candidates in its phase III pipeline,  which  could hurt Abbott after it loses patent protection for Humira in  2016. The company’s partner, Reata Pharmaceuticals, recently announced that it will discontinue a late-stage trial of  its potential blockbuster drug for   chronic kidney disease and diabetes  due to safety concerns raised  by  an independent safety committee. This has also already been factored in  by the market.A couple of days ago, the  company’s experimental hepatitis C drug showed   promising results in  phase II  clinical trials. We will wait  for  further details before taking  any  stand.Nutritionals  – These include pediatric, adult, healthy living and sports nutrition  products, such     as infant formulas, snack bars and meal replacement  shakes.After facing a setback following voluntary recall of infant formula     Similac in 2010, the company has started to regain consumer  confidence and market share. Abbott's pediatric  nutritional registered  high single digit growth in the last couple of  quarters largely due to Similac and other  pediatric nutritional  products   like PediaSure, Ensure and Glucerna. We expect the company to  maintain the momentum on new product launches, coupled with its strong  position in the rapidly growing emerging markets.Abbott has been building manufacturing facilities in the huge and  untapped China. However, this is not the only country the company is  focusing on. It recently opened a nutritional R&D center and a  manufacturing unit in India,  which will help Abbott develop affordable  nutrition products for  malnutrition and diabetes while addressing local  preferences for taste  and texture. The company is also considering adding  local sales and  distribution functions in this facility. We believe  that such moves will certainly help the company increase  its  penetration in emerging markets, which will boost sales.Vascular -  These include minimally invasive medical devices for heart disease,  strokes, carotid artery diseases, and other serious vascular conditions.This  segment has been the company’s largest contributor  to growth  of late  due to the success of its XIENCE/PROMUS coronary  stents. While  the  division is seeing a sharp decline in revenues in the short term,  it is  mostly due   to certain royalty and supply arrangement revenues   (including Promus)   and currency impact. However, even with a strong   U.S. dollar, we expect the company to pick up its market share going   forward.Abbott’s Absorb is the world’s  first drug-eluting bioresorbable  (doesn’t require mechanical removal)  vascular scaffolds.  In addition,  Abbott launched MitraClip in Europe, which treats the   most common  heart valve defects in the world, which  is estimated to   affect 8  million people in the United States and Europe. Further, the  company  recently launched its next generation Drug Eluting Stent (DES)    XIENCE   Xpedition in Europe, and expects to launch the product in  the   U.S.  in  2013. These factors should drive growth  for Abbott’s   vascular  franchise.Diagnostics -  These include systems and tests used for screening for drugs of abuse,  cancer,      therapeutic drug monitoring, fertility, physiological  diseases and      infectious diseases such as hepatitis and HIV.The division has shown consistent growth in the last couple of  quarters due to an increase in demand. We foresee an  increase the  company’s market share going forward.Abbott has made several  acquisitions, including Starlims Technologies and  Ibis Biosciences.  Through the Starlims Technologies acquisition,  Abbott added   laboratory informatics systems to its diagnostics segment.  The Ibis   Biosciences acquisition has strengthened Abbott’s position  in the fast   growing market for molecular diagnostics for infectious  disease. We  think the company should be able to leverage its global  brand and  scale to  increase its market share in the in-vitro  diagnostic market.  Further, Abbott has a strong presence in rapidly  growing markets like  China,  India, and Brazil through other  businesses.We believe the recent sell-off in the company’s stock following the  results announcement and setback from Reata Pharmaceuticals may be  overdone following fiscal cliff worries. As these concerns subside, the  stock could once again move toward its fair value of $67. Abbott is in the   process of splitting its business into  two distinct      companies to   unlock value, and our current    analysis does  not reflect  the planned  split (Read Abbott Labs: A Look At The Company Post Spin-Off).See Full Analysis for Abbott HereDisclosure: No positions"
951841,31361,2012-10-25T17:05:33-04:00,,"As of January 1, 2013 Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) will be split into two companies: a proprietary pharmaceuticals business, called AbbVie, with a new ticker symbol, ABBV, and a company retaining the Abbott name , focusing on medical devices, diagnostics, and nutritional products.The transaction will take place as a tax-free distribution to Abbott shareholders of a new publicly traded stock for AbbVie. The stock distribution ratio will be determined at a future date. It is expected that the two companies will each pay a dividend that, when combined, will at least equal the current Abbott dividend at the time of separation.The safety of a company's dividend rests on many factors, of which a most important one is the development and success of innovative new products.Standing out among Abbott's many innovative products is the newly introduced plastic stent called Absorb.The Absorb stentSince September 2012 Absorb, the world's first drug-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold (BVS), has been available in more than 30 countries across Europe and parts of Asia Pacific and Latin America. Absorb is not yet approved for sale in the US.Abbott calls Absorb a ""scaffold,"" suggesting it is a temporary structure, unlike a metal stent, which is a permanent implant. The scaffold, which provides support to the blood vessel until the artery can stay open on its own, later dissolves naturally.Like a metallic stent, Absorb works by restoring blood flow to the heart. It is made of polylactide, a naturally dissolvable material that is commonly used in medical implants, such as dissolving sutures.Generally speaking, a stent is a small mesh tube used to support narrow or weak arteries. Stents are usually made of metal, but sometimes fabric is used in larger arteries.Absorb is the first stent made of plastic for the treatment of coronary artery disease.The potential benefits of a scaffold are significant. The vessel may expand and contract as needed to increase the flow of blood to the heart in response to normal activities such as exercising. Also treatment and diagnostic options are broadened, the need for long-term treatment with anti-clotting medications may be reduced, and future interventions would be unobstructed by a permanent implant.Absorb completely dissolves in the body, except for two pairs of tiny metallic markers that help guide placement and remain in the artery to enable a physician to see where the device was placed.Competing bioresorbable stents use other types of plastics.The international launch of Absorb follows years of trials in more than 20 countries. According to Abbott, study data shows that Absorb performs as well as the best-in-class drug-eluting stent during major adverse cardiovascular events and target lesion revascularization.Absorb is coated with a drug called everolimus, which inhibits in-stent thickening in the coronary arteries. This is the same drug used in Abbott's Xience coronary stent systems. Everolimus was developed by Novartis (NYSE:NVS) and licensed to Abbott.CompetitionA few companies have fallen behind Abbott in developing a similar stent and are trying to catch up.San Diego based Reva Medical's ReZolve Bioresorbable Coronary Stent is also designed to restore blood flow and promote arterial healing, before gradually dissolving and leaving nothing behind. It is being tested in Brazil and Germany.The ReZolve stent is designed to offer full x-ray visibility, providing clinically relevant sizing. In addition, the ReZolve stent may reduce the incidence of late-forming blood clots, a rare but serious problem associated with drug-eluting metal stents currently in wide use.Reva uses a polymer technology originally developed at Rutgers University and the company is still working with researchers at Rutgers to improve the technology.In addition to other payments, Rutgers is expected to receive royalties of $70 to $100 per scaffold sold once the product becomes commercial. In the meantime the Rutgers License requires annual licensing payments of $175,000 until the technology has been commercialized.Boston Scientific Corp (NYSE:BSX), a major player in stents, was once an investor in Reva and now has an option to negotiate for a worldwide exclusive right to distribute its stent products. Another major medical device manufacturer, Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), is still an investor in Reva.At the end of 2011, Reva's accumulated deficit was approximately $150 million.Elixir Medical Corp. (Sunnyvale, CA)'s DESolve Bioresorbable Coronary Scaffold System is made from a PLLA-based polymer (poly-L-lactic acid) and coated with a polylactide-based resorbable polymer-drug matrix.Elixir Medical is a privately funded company. The lead investor is the Invus Group, a New York-based equity investment firm with over $4 billion under management.The DESolve Scaffold will soon be studied in a trial enrolling 120 patients in up to 15 centers in Germany, Belgium, Poland, Brazil, and New Zealand.The Berlin based German company Biotronik is developing a second-generation Dreams magnesium-based resorbable stent.Investor's summaryThe much-anticipated split will start a new chapter for Abbott under Miles White, the company's chief executive since 1999.Under White, Abbott has grown largely through acquisition, buying Knoll Pharmaceuticals for about $7 billion in 2001 to gain access to the blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira. Among its other multi-billion-dollar deals was the purchase of Guidant's vascular device business, enabling the company to build up a heart device segment.In 2010, Abbott completed more acquisitions, including that of Solvay Pharmaceuticals and Piramal Healthcare. This has allowed average annual growth in revenues of close to 20% in the past two years.Also, Abbott is expanding into emerging markets in a big way. It has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on new manufacturing plants in India and China.But for the future, White emphasizes ""internal growth,"" focusing in particular on Abbott's nutritional products, such as the flagship infant formula Similac and adult nutritional products like Ensure and Glucerna.At the separate company AbbVie, the business will focus on proprietary pharmaceuticals such as Humira, which is expected to lose patent protection in 2016. Humira's global sales were up 10 percent to $2.3 billion in the third quarter of 2012.Humira is expected to drive sales at AbbVie to a peak of $18 billion. But AbbVie will most likely be hit hard by the generic competition when its various patents expire for products like Humira, Tricor, and Niaspan.Under Rick Gonzalez, a long-time Abbott executive and designated CEO of AbbVie, the new company is banking on the future with several treatments in late-stage clinical trials, such as a drug to treat hepatitis C.For the third quarter of 2012 Abbott reported earnings of $1.94 billion.That compares to $303 million in the third quarter of 2011 when Abbott experienced a slew of restructuring and other costs related to the split into two companies.Management says the combined dividend for the 2 companies will be at least equal to Abbott's pre-separation dividend. It is expected AbbVie will pay an annual dividend of $1.60 per share, starting with the quarterly dividend in February. This, like all dividends, will be subject to approval by the future AbbVie board in January 2013.The new Abbott plans to pay a dividend of $0.56 per share, in line with its peer group and growth prospects, also starting in February and also subject to approval by Abbott's board.This way the combined annual dividend rate of $2.16 for the 2 companies exceeds the current rate of $2.04.The range of Abbott's share price for the past 52 weeks was $52.05 to 72.47 and the market cap of the company is $103.81 billion.On their first day of independent operation, both ABT and ABBV will be Fortune 200 companies, and in the top ten in their respective industries.They will both have broad product portfolios and global reach, with a very strong balance sheet and significant, durable cash flow.Both are expected to be excellent long term investments.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

943661,22251,2012-10-23T18:35:35-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories' (NYSE:ABT) share price has taken a beating recently, and historically strong pullbacks have generally proven to make for good long term entry points. However, one should always hedge oneself just in case the situation takes a turn for the worse, and that is where the bull put spread comes into play. You simultaneously sell one out of the money put and purchase one put that is farther out of the money for a net credit. You purchase a put that is further out of the money to hedge your position just in case things do not work out as planned. The maximum gain is achieved if the price of the stock trades at or above the highest strike price. Your total risk is equivalent to the spread between the two strike prices. This would only occur if the stock closed at or below the lower strike price.Benefits of a Bull Put SpreadTechnical outlookThe purple lines in the above chart clearly illustrate that every time the stock has pulled back strongly, it has proven to be a good long term buying opportunity. The stock has a pretty good level of support in the $60-6$63 ranges. A test of this zone should lead to higher prices. Additionally, the stock has historically rallied every time it has tested the -2 standard deviation Bollinger bands (indicated by the yellow boxes in the above charts). It is currently trading below this band so it should be ready to trend higher relatively soon. Consider waiting for the stock to test the $62-$63.00 ranges at least before putting this strategy into play.The competitionAbbot Labs will be compared against its competitors using several key rations such as quarterly revenue growth, P/E, EBITDA, operating margin, PEG, etc. If you feel that competitor would make for a better investment, you could utilize a similar strategy.M= Million B= BillionCharts of valueThe blue shaded area represents the dividends. The orange line represents the valuation growth rate line. Generally, when the stock is trading below this line and in the shaded green area, it represents a good long term entry point. The stock is currently trading well below this line. Hence the current setup could make for a good long term entry point. According to Fast Graphs, it has an estimated earnings growth rate of 8.00%.When a stock is trading above the EPS and EPS consensus estimate line, it is a bullish phase, and the outlook is for higher prices. The stock has just managed to trade above the EPS consensus line.Bull Put SpreadBoth parts of this transaction need to be implemented simultaneously.The May 2013, 60 put is trading in the $1.78-$1.81 ranges. If the stock pulls back to the stated ranges the put should trade in the $2.20$2.40 ranges. We will assume that the put can be sold at $2.30 or better.The May 2013, 55 puts are trading in the $0.83-$0.88 ranges. If the stock pulls back to the stated ranges the put should trade in the $1.00-$1.20 ranges. We will assume that this put can be purchased at $1.10 or better. After the transaction is complete, you will have a net credit of $120.00. Your maximum risk is $380, and your maximum profit is $120.00 for a possible return of 31%.Strategy to boost your returnsOne method of boosting your gains would be to purchase a put with less time on it, while selling one with more time on it. The risk of this strategy is that while you boost your gains as a result of having to put up less money, you also raise your risk. Your position will only be hedged for a limited time. Once the put you purchased (lower strike) expires, you will effectively be selling a naked put and your margin requirements could rise unless you purchase another put. If you opt for this strategy, then you should consider either buying a new put or closing the position out when the put you originally purchased expires.Risks associated with this strategyThe main risk is that you over leverage yourself because the capital requirements are so small. Using the example in this article, you would need $4500 to sell one cash secured put in Merck. However, you would only need $500 to write one bull put spread. This means you could technically write up to 9 bull put spreads. There is always the chance that the shares could be assigned to your account if the stock is trading below the strike price of the option you sold. Thus, the biggest risk is that an investor might abuse this strategy. If the shares are put to your account, you could always turn around and sell them, provided you had the funds in place to cover the initial purchase.The net credit you get from the trade is usually much smaller than the maximum amount of money you could lose from the trade. Thus, it's would be wise to close the short option out or roll the option before your position hits the maximum loss point. You roll the option by buying back the put you sold and selling a new out of the money put. Your breakeven point with Abbot Labs is $58.50.ConclusionThe biggest and most dangerous mistake an investor can make is to abuse this strategy. There is always a chance that the shares could be assigned to your account. The hedge you have in place via the long put does not prevent this from taking place. If the shares are put to your account, you could be in big trouble if you over leveraged yourself. You could always turn around and sell the shares or put the shares to the seller of the lower priced put you purchased, but you would need to have the money in place to cover the first part of the transaction. This is a conservative strategy, and if you abuse it, you will have converted it from a conservative strategy to a speculative one.Options tables and competitors data sourced from yahoofinance.com.

938021,25120,2012-10-22T06:08:39-04:00,,"Shares of Abbott Laboratories (ABT) have lost some 4.5% of their value over the past week. The medical device manufacturer and developer of pharmaceutical drugs, reported its third quarter results on Wednesday before the market open.Third Quarter ResultsAbbott reported third quarter revenues of $9.77 billion, down 0.4% on the year. In constant currencies, revenues were up 4.1%. Foreign exchange headwinds were bigger than analysts anticipated, who expected Abbott to report $9.94 billion in revenues.The company reported net earnings of $1.94 billion, up from $303 million last year. Last year's earnings were severely impacted by a $1.4 billion after-tax charge related to litigation reserves.Diluted earnings per share came in at $1.21, while adjusted earnings per share rose 10.8% to $1.30 per share. Earnings beat analysts consensus by two cents.Adjusted earnings exclude the $527 million costs associated with the split off of the company and restructuring and integration costs, partially offset by a $386 million benefit related to a resolution of tax positions.Segmental InformationIn constant currencies, growth in international markets came in at 4.7% for the quarter, while US operations showed a 3.1% increase in revenues.In constant currencies, the proprietary pharmaceutical division reported a solid 6.4% increase in revenues to $4.42 billion. Solid growth was also reported in the nutritional business, which was up 6.3% to $1.60 billion. Core laboratory diagnostics revenues were up 7.2% to $854 million. Abbott reported revenue declines in some of its smaller divisions including molecular diagnostics, vascular, diabetes care and medical optics.OutlookFor the full year of 2012, Abbott is now anticipating adjusted earnings per share to come in between $5.06-$5.08. This is a narrowed forecast compared to an earlier guided $5.00-$5.10 per share.GAAP net earnings are expected to come in between $3.83-$3.85 per share.ValuationAbbott did not provide a consolidated balance sheet with its third quarter results. Therefore I take a look at the end of the second quarter when the company held $11.0 billion in cash, equivalents and short term investments. The company operates with $18.1 billion in short and long term debt for a net debt position of $7.1 billion.For the first nine months of 2012, Abbott generated $29.0 billion in revenues. The firm net earned $4.9 billion, or $3.06 per share under GAAP rules. Full year revenues are expected to come in at $39 billion, while net earnings are expected to reach $6.2 billion, of $3.84 per share.After last week's drop, the market values the firm at $104 billion. This values the firm at 2.7 times annual revenues and 17 times annual earnings.Currently, Abbott Laboratories pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 3.1%.Investment ThesisYear to date, share of Abbott have risen some 18%. Shares started the year around the $55 mark and steadily rose to year highs of $72 in recent weeks. The correction over the past week send shares back to $66 per share.Over the past five years, shares have risen some 30%. Shares moved between $40-$60 for most of the period before breaking out towards the upside this summer. Between 2008 and 2012, Abbott grew its annual revenues from $29.5 billion in 2008 to an expected $39 billion in 2012. Net income rose from $4.9 billion to an estimated $6.2 billion, in the meantime.Abbott seems to be on track for another solid year. Key will be the split up in two companies, still expected to occur on January 1th, 2013. The split was already announced at the end of 2011, and will create two new companies. Abbott Laboratories will be the medical device company, continuing with all activities besides the proprietary pharmaceuticals division. AbbVie will continue with the proprietary pharmaceutical activities. At its current rate, AbbVie will generate annual revenues of approximately $18 billion, while Abbott Laboratories will generate revenues of $21 billion.Many other large US companies have already split up this year. ConocoPhillips continued as Conoco (COP) and Phillips 66 (PSX). Other recent split-up include Tyco International (TYC), Kraft Foods (KFT) and ITT International (ITT).Under its current form, Abbott has a lot of divisions which gives the impression that the company has diversified operations. However, roughly $8 billion of the proprietary pharmaceutical division's annual revenues of $18 billion is generated by top drug Humira.Humira, which focuses on rheumatoid arthritis, is rapidly facing competitive pressures from Pfizer (PFE), among others, putting pressure on the value of the entire company. While these pressures could undoubtedly have an impact on the value of AbbVie, the impact on Abbott Laboratories should be close to none after the spin-off.The market has reacted quite favorable to spin-offs lately. Let's have a renewed look at Abbott, when the exact terms of the split-off have been announced. Overall, the valuation looks reasonably appealing for a pharmaceutical company at 17 times earnings, which pays a 3.1% dividend yield. With both companies being valued as ""pure-plays"" the market overhang of concerns of Humira would no longer weigh on the valuation of the medical devices business, which could possibly unlock some more value.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

948861,29021,2012-10-25T05:36:12-04:00,,"Abbott (NYSE:ABT) recently released the findings from a three year study evaluating its drug Humira in patients with moderate to severe Ulcerative Colitis. At 60 weeks, the remission rate was an incredible 55% of these refractory cases. In the same field, last week Humira received a ""positive opinion"" by the European Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) regarding survey results concerning Humira administered to pediatric patients with Crohn's disease. Both Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's disease are Inflammatory Bowel Disorders and are remarkably similar to each other.Abbott also recently announced its Hepatitis C research findings. At 12 weeks (SVR-12), there was a 99% favorable response to Abbott's drug combination given to patients suffering from active Hepatitis C. Abbott's stock price jumped 3% to an all time high of 72 dollars that day. Currently, Abbott is at 66 dollars per share.Third quarter earnings results just released October 17, 2012 were hit and miss. At first glance, an EPS of $1.30 represented a 10% increase from Abbott's guidance range. A double-digit growth. At a second glance, currency differential accounted for most of the growth. Abbott still narrowed its EPS guidance to $5.06 to $5.08 from $5.00 to $5.10 for 2012. The actual EPS projected for 2012 would be $3.83 to $3.85 under GAAP which still reflects a strong performance.Pharmaceuticals and AnalysisAround 54% of Abbott's revenue stems from its pharmaceutical sector and Humira is the star player. Humira is an immune suppressing biological and is the second highest revenue producing medication in the world. It represents 15 to 18% of Abbott's earnings. Other drugs such as AndroGel account for 34% of revenue.Abbott has remarkably few patent expires on the horizon compared to GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), Merck (NYSE:MRK), and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). It appears that Abbott is depending on recent global acquisitions providing a list of drugs sold in emerging markets. The nutritional sector should get a boost from R&D openings in India and Russia. Projected medication sales in Asia, China, and South America is a large, positive number. All these areas are recruiting and setting up physicians, and it is the doctor who writes that prescription. Sales appear to directly surpass the 16 billion dollar projections, which translates into a 5% to 8% increase in stock price.JAK InhibitorsThese compounds are another group of biologicals that are currently in studies evaluating their effectiveness treating Rhuematiod Arthritis. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), Pfizer , Novartis (NYSE:NVS), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) are all heavily invested in the JAK inhibitors. The earliest JAK Inhibitors could hit the market would be early 2013. However, most JAK Inhibitors are in Phase III trials, and there is a reasonable chance these compounds will fail and not receive FDA approval. JAK Inhibitors will compete directly with Humira, so if the verdict is disapproval for marketing, revenue from Humira will continue to skyrocket.Either way, with new indications for use in the pipeline, Humira's growth may be rejuvenated. Humira still dominates in the Rheumatoid Arthritis treatment market. If the JAK inhibitors are approved, these compounds will compete for market share against Humira. If Humira gets FDA approval for use in patients suffering from Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease, it opens a 1.4 million strong market just in the U.S. This market is larger than the rheumatoid Arthritis market.No matter how I look at the numbers, I see Humira exceeding 12 billion dollars in sales by 2016, bypassing the projected 10 billion dollar forecast.I believe Abbott's earnings will grow from 39 billion in 2011 to the upper 40's to 50 billion dollars per year by 2016. Unfortunately, it is difficult and dangerous to forecast Abbott's EBITDA margin due to the European currency markets and the uncertainty regarding U.S. tax structure.Abbott is expected to split into two publicly traded companies in early 2013. If anything a split should stabilize the pharmaceutical sector and buffer any effects of losing the patents. Abbott has settled litigation with Impax and has no current or pending court dates.Analysis SummaryAbbott will lose patent exclusivity on some minor products; Tricor (2012), Kaletra (2016), Niaspan (2013), and Trilipix (2016), but compared to Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Eli Lilly, and Novartis, Abbott is in a much better position.Humira may face competition beginning in 2013 by JAK inhibitors from Eli Lilly, Pfizer, Novartis, and Johnson and Johnson. If this class of compounds receive FDA approval, JAK inhibitors will be indicated for treating Rheumatoid Arthritis and myeloproliferative bone marrow disorders. After examining the studies, I feel that Humira's indications will expand to include the treatment of Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's Disease. Both of these inflammatory bowel afflictions are considerably more common than Rheumatoid Arthritis. At the very least, Humira will obtain authorization to treat inflammatory bowel disease as an OFF-LABEL application. Abbott's market for Humira will increase by 1.4 million people just in this country. Revenue will respond accordingly.Hepatitis C infects 170 million people worldwide and is often fatal. The results of that study were astounding-99% clearance of the virus after 12 weeks. If the results are reproducible and verified this represents a significant medical breakthrough. The market is immense and most likely to exceed Humira in revenue.Abbott's global sales continue to grow rapidly. The margins are less, but there is a substantial volume.When the Patient Protection and Affordability Care Act become implemented, mandated increased Medicaid rebates appear. Such action will affect margins but the percentages, and absolute number of patients involved is small enough not to affect revenue significantly.ConclusionMost analysts rate Abbott as a hold to a strong buy. Given my analysis, Abbott is a safe buy at current market prices of $65 to $69 per share for the long-term investor going out to 2017. Abbott is in a position to gain a lot of market share and enter into real, significant markets for new drugs. In a few years, Abbott has the potential of becoming the market leader in pharmaceuticals.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

933631,29461,2012-10-18T16:28:53-04:00,,"Reported figures for the third quarter show that revenues for Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) fell by less than 1% to $9.77 billion. Analysts had expected a revenue figure of $9.94 billion. EPS for the quarter, however, beat analyst expectations and stood at $1.3, excluding onetime items, against a consensus estimate of $1.28. The company's shares are down 4.28%. The stock has yielded a one-year return of 36%. The company also recorded $478 million of restructuring charges relating to job cuts.We believe the stability that the company will gain from the proposed spin-off is priced in, and we do not forecast capital appreciation at this point. We therefore recommend the stock as a hold.Company description:Abbott Laboratories discovers, develops and manufactures a wide variety of healthcare products and operates through five segments, namely Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products, Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products and Vascular Products. Although the company does not face many patent expirations in the near future, it will face generic competition in the future due to the patent loss for TRICOR in July this year.ABT's blockbuster drug remains HUMIRA, which will also be a key driver of growth for AbbVie. Last year, the drug accounted for 20% of total revenues and substantial double-digit growth this year. Sales of the drug in the current quarter rose 15.3% to $2.3 billion. There are several factors that contributed to this strong performance, including 1) increasing patient demand that led to a market share increase in dermatology and gastroenterology, and 2) its approval for new indications for example UC in the U.S. and Europe, and axial SpA in Europe, with the drug being approved for a total of 8 indications. Furthermore, emerging markets were a strong contributor to earnings with sales for the quarter reaching $2.6 billion, representing an increase of 10% on an operational basis.The company's nutrition business faced some challenges when it recalled its infant formula Similac back in 2010. Since then, the company has bounced back in its high cash flow generating segment and recorded double-digit growth in its key pediatric and adult nutrition products like PediaSure Clear, Similac with Lutein, Ensure Clear and Glucerna Hunger Smart.Abbott is a leader in the global nutrition market and is set to benefit from the increase in the global nutrition market, which will grow to $50 billion by 2016 from the current figure of $35 billion. An aging population and low penetration rate of nutritional product will fuel growth. The business has performed well within the U.S. and plans to rapidly progress outside the U.S. by investing in product pipeline and infrastructure, bolstered by modern manufacturing facilities in India and China. China remains the largest market for the nutrition business and has a potential of $7 billion.The company has plans to spin off the pharmaceutical segment into a separate entity by the end of 2012. AbbVie, the name suggested for the new entity, will be focusing on branded brands like Humira. The move is driven by a belief to isolate Abbott from the uncertainties of the pharmaceutical business, which involves the constant struggle to innovate and bring new drugs into the market to generate a steady stream of revenues. Instead, the business will be left with the stable and predictable business of nutrition, generic drugs and heart stents, and thereby generating more predictable cash flows for its shareholders.Valuations:Table 1:The dividend yield provided by the company is the lowest amongst its competitors cited above. The total debt-to-equity ratio is 74%, along with an interest coverage ratio of 14.5x. We do not forecast price appreciation at the moment, and therefore recommend the stock as a hold. The company has maintained a three-year average dividend coverage ratio of 2.5x, representing its substantial cash flow to make payments to its shareholders.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Qineqt's Health Care Analyst.

933991,24627,2012-10-18T18:15:31-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a leading healthcare and pharmaceutical company that looks like an ideal investment due to stable revenues, a solid dividend and even some potential upside due to a upcoming spin off. This company has a business that is diversified into three major categories:1) Pharmaceuticals: Including products for pain care, cardiovascular, renal care, metabolics, anesthesia, neuroscience and others.2) Medical Products: Including products for animal health, diabetes, vascular, hematology, diagnostics, and more.3) Nutritional Products: Including products for pediatric nutrition, healthy living and medical nutrition. This range of products includes well-known brands such as: Ensure, Isomil, Pedialyte, Similac and others.Abbott Laboratories shares were recently hitting new 52-week highs, but the stock has experienced a pullback after the company reported earnings. However, it still appears to be in an uptrend and the stock could bounce back and resume the upward path in the coming days and weeks. Here are 4 reasons why it makes sense to consider this stock now:1) Since this company manufactures products that are primarily related to healthcare, it is not likely to see a big drop in revenues if times get tough. Even in a recession, consumers will continue to spend on healthcare and cut back on luxury items first. This company also has a very strong balance sheet with about $11 billion in cash and around $18 billion in debt.2) Abbott shares make sense for income investors as the stock currently yields nearly 3%. It also has a history of dividend increases and it has paid a dividend since 1924.3) Abbott plans to separate into two publicly-traded companies in the coming months, and this could unlock more shareholder value. Abbott will hold the medical device and consumer brands, and ""AbbVie"" will be the new company that holds the prescription medicines.4) The company continues to invest in research and development which could lead to new products and future growth potential. In 2011, it spent about $4.1 billion on R&D. It also recently announced positive data for a potential Hepatitis C treatment. This was a phase 2b study, so it is still early but the Hepatitis market is worth over a billion per year, which means it could have blockbuster drug potential.Here are some key points for ABT:Current share price: $65.61The 52 week range is $52.05 to $72.47Earnings estimates for 2012: $5.06 per shareEarnings estimates for 2013: $5.39 per shareAnnual dividend: $2.04 per share which yields 2.8%Data is sourced from Yahoo Finance.

926201,23407,2012-10-16T06:37:06-04:00,,"Abbott (NYSE:ABT) gave investors another reason to be long AbbVie when the company splits in two later this year, reporting it met endpoints in its Phase IIb trial for ABT-450, an ex-interferon treatment of Hepatitis C, genotype I.Currently, Hep C is treated using combination therapies which still rely on interferon and often Ribavirin, to improve efficacy. However, interferon patients suffer significant side effects, suggesting non-interferon therapies will mark a big step forward in patient care.Big Pharma is targeting non-interferon options.Outside of Abbott, a number of big pharma companies are working on non-interferon treatments, including Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY), with asunaprevir and daclatasvir, Merck, Gilead (NASDAQ:GILD), with GS7977, and Vertex, with VX-222.Bristol Myers combination therapy of asunaprevir and daclatasvir generated a 77% success rate 24 weeks after treatment ended in Phase II. As the drug moves to Phase III, investors should be watching to see if the success rate in hard-to-treat patients, which was much lower than null responders at 64% versus 91%, respectively.Gilead's GS7977 paired with Ribavirin in Gilead's Electron trial showed 88% of patients were virus free 4 weeks after completing treatment.Vertex's VX-222, combined with Incivek and Ribavirin and without interferon, produced a success rate of 83% after 12 weeks, prompting Vertex to conduct a Phase IIb trial of this ex-interferon regimen with full data expected at the Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases in November.But, Abbott's success will be hard to top.Abbott's combination of ABT-450 with ABT-267, ABT-333 and Ribavirin showed a 99% cure rate after 12 weeks following treatment. Hard-to-treat case, those most interferon intolerant, showed a 93% rate.Abbott plans to move the drug into Phase III, studying the combinations both with and without Ribavirin.Hep C is a massive market.In spring 2011, both Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Vertex (NASDAQ:VRTX) gained approval for boceprevir (Victrelis) and teleprevir (Incivek), respectively. Both drugs further improve interferon and ribavirin's effectiveness and both are high priced drugs generating significant sales.In Q2, Vertex pocketed $328 million from Incivek and guided for full year sales of $1.1-1.25 billion - making Incivek the fastest drug to reach $1 billion in history. Merck's Victrelis was no slouch either, generating $126 million in Q2 sales.According to the World Health Organization, some 2-4 million are chronically infected in the U.S., with another 5-10 million in Europe and as many as 12 million in India too. At a prevalence rate of 3%, some 170 million may carry the disease worldwide. Here in the U.S., about 150k new cases are diagnosed annually.According to Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX), spending on Hep C therapies rose 194% last year, thanks in part to Victrelis and Incivek. Spending is likely to double to $85 billion in the next 20 years as boomers age. Peg interferon remains a big piece of the spending, controlling over 40% of Medicaid's Hep C spend in 2011.This suggests a significant opportunity for the next generation of hep C treatments as they siphon sales away from peg interferon, which gives investors another compelling reason to be long Abbvie following Abbott's spin-off.Finally, Abbott is historically sluggish in November over the past decade, suggesting any weakness next month may prove a good opportunity to add to positions.Source: Seasonal InvestorDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

918531,25651,2012-10-11T11:29:28-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is currently one of the most appealing investments in the Big Pharma sector. Abbott continues to increase applications for its industry leading rheumatoid arthritis drug, Humira; its patent doesn't expire until December 2016. Abbott Laboratories recently put Depakote misbranding litigation to rest by settling with all concerned parties. Abbott has also unveiled a promising product for CAD, and remains focused on developing treatments for hepatitis C.Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Novartis (NYSE:NVS), and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD) are the firms most comparable to Abbott Laboratories. Pfizer and Abbott are around 22 times earnings, while Johnson & Johnson and Gilead are closer to 21 times earnings. Novartis' $3.53 EPS is the highest, while Gilead's EPS is around $3.30 and Abbott's EPS is around $3.09. Abbott's EPS growth has been around 1.5% in 2012, and is projected to increase about 6.3% for 2013. Abbott's ROE is 19.2%; its operating margin is around 16.1%, and its profit margin is around 12.3%. Abbott's current ratio is about 1.53, and its debt-equity ratio is around 0.74. All of the major pharmaceutical companies' price-to-sales ratios are around 2.9.Abbott has the lowest beta score among these firms; its average volume is around 5.6 million, and its relative volume is around 1.1. Abbott's 29.2% year-to-date stock increase and 5.5% increase in the past month is the highest among the four major pharmaceutical firms. Gilead is a stronger growth stock in the sector; its stock increase has been 68% year to date and 15.2% in the past month. But Abbott's 2.5 short ratio and 0.9% float ratio are both lower than Gilead's corresponding ratios. Abbott's annualized dividend is about $2.04 per share; its stock has increased around 7% since the last earnings release.In Abbott's recent earnings release, second-quarter net sales totaled $9.8 billion, increasing 2% year over year; total costs decreased to $7.7 billion from $7.84 billion year over year. Abbott's second-quarter operating earnings increased to $2.86 billion from $2.59 billion year over year; net earnings decreased to $1.72 billion from $1.94 billion year over year. Long-term debt increased to $17.12 billion from $15.48 billion year over year; cash and cash equivalents on hand at the end of the first half increased to $7.05 billion from $4.07 billion year over year. Abbott's first half 2012 U.S. sales totaled $7.9 billion, increasing 6% year over year; international sales totaled $11.36 billion, increasing 1.4% year over year. The stronger U.S. dollar decreased international sales by 5.1% year over year.First-half 2012 Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products totaled $8.45 billion, increasing 6% year over year; operating earnings increased to $3.48 billion. First-half U.S. Proprietary sales totaled $4.53 billion, increasing 7% year over year; Humira sales totaled $1.82 billion, increasing 26% year over year; and AndroGel sales totaled $508 million, increasing 20% year over year. First-half International Proprietary totaled $3.91 billion, increasing 4% year over year; excluding negative currency impact, these sales increased 10.6% year over year. These Humira sales totaled $2.43 billion, increasing 11% year over year. U.S. Pediatric sales totaled $731 million, increasing 20% year over year. Excluding impairment charges, R&D expenses increased 9.4% in the first half 2012; Abbott allocated $1.1 billion to Proprietary Pharmaceuticals, focusing on developments in biologics, hepatitis C, diagnostics, and chronic kidney disease.Abbott recently announced that the FDA approved Humira's use for an additional indication. When other treatments have already failed, Humira is now approved for inducing and sustaining clinical remission for patients who suffer from moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis; the EC approved Humira for this use in April 2012. This is the seventh approved indication for Humira in the U.S.; it's the first self-administered biologic for ulcerative colitis in the last seven years. A few weeks ago, the EC also approved Humira for patients who suffer from moderate Crohn's disease but have not responded to conventional treatment.A few weeks ago, Abbott unveiled Absorb, a drug-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold. This device is used to treat coronary artery disease. It is an alternative to the metallic stint used to restore blood flow back to the heart. As opposed to a stint, the scaffold eventually dissolves, naturally, once the vessel is open or unblocked and the artery can sustain adequate blood flow to the heart. This device is available in certain regions in Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East, and Europe; it's currently under development for the U.S. This device is revolutionary in coronary artery disease treatment and should significantly increase sales in Abbott's Vascular Products segment.Gilead is currently the leader in the hepatitis C market; Abbott is a close a second. Bristol Myers recently discontinued its candidate after a death in the clinical trials, causing the FDA to put two similar products from Idenix Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:IDIX) on hold. The CDC projects that there are 2.7 million to 3.9 million people in the U.S. living with the hepatitis C virus. Gilead Sciences acquired Pharmasset for $11 billion to bolster its hepatitis C pipeline; Abbott has developed two candidates of its own, internally, without any massive acquisitions. Gilead, Abbott, and Idenix will also present data from recent studies at the November Liver Meeting.Abbott recently reached a settlement with the DOJ to pay $700 million in fines for the illegal marketing of Depakote for non-approved uses. In May, Abbott agreed it would plead guilty to the misbranding misdemeanor and pay $1.6 billion to federal and state authorities. The settlement consists of $500 million in criminal fines, $198.5 in lost profit, and $1.5 million to Virginia state officials. Abbott also paid $800 million for civil settlements with state and federal officials and $100 million for states to resolve consumer protection claims. Abbott will be on probation for five years, but the bad publicity surrounding this situation is now behind the firm.Despite the headlines for flubbed credentials and not having college a degree, Abbott and analysts are more than confident in Richard Gonzalez's ability to head AbbVie, the impending spin-off of the pharmaceutical division. Gonzalez has been with Abbott for 30 years and was an integral proponent and catalyst in the firm's consistent earnings and sales volume growth. Upon regulatory approval, Abbott's scheduled split into two firms at the end of 2012 should enable each entity to increase its focus on their respective niche functions.The prominence and horizontal expansion of Humira bodes well for AbbVie, and products like Absorb will help Abbott continue to lead the medical devices industry. The split will allow each firm to focus on their niche, in turn bolstering their portfolios and individual pipelines. Current shareholders should hold the stock long term, while interested investors should initiate a position by mid-October.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

885821,29021,2012-09-24T17:10:10-04:00,,"It is no secret that sexual prowess is highly sought after, especially as we grow older. The intense demand for sex hormone boosting therapies reflects this in the growing number of products that aim to boost the level of testosterone among men, and estrogen among women. The premise of my article is to understand the context of a testosterone gel being marketed by Abbott (NYSE:ABT). Abbott's Androgel is a million dollar testosterone gel popular with aging men who are trying to find a quick fix for reduced sex drive, weight gain, fatigue and depression.While it is true that testosterone can mitigate some of these problems, the results are not conclusive and the risks of using such a gel can more than outweigh the benefits. Androgel's website has a quiz targeted at men who may have sexual difficulties. It poses obvious questions that will invariably yield affirmative answers. Yet, those 10 questions are the same used to diagnose whether men have testosterone levels which are low enough to warrant the use of testosterone gel or require a visit to an endocrinologist.Testosterone replacement therapy is highly debated and it is not clear whether middle-aged men need to be treated for what might be normal levels of male hormone given their respective ages. By convincing men to purchase testosterone gels and use them as needed, the pharmaceutical industry in general is sending a very wrong signal about how much it cares for people's health and safety. Many endocrinologists admit that a normal and healthy male would have a testosterone level between 300 and 1,000 nanograms per deciliter. This number is expected to drop below 300 as a man grows older, as in post-40. But, sexual difficulties can be experienced by men who have a normal and healthy level of testosterone as well, raising serious doubt about the necessity for testosterone replacement therapy.Endocrinologists and pharmacological researchers point out that testosterone can be boosted by adopting healthy lifestyles which include regular exercise, protein-rich diet and staying healthy. However, those who have a seriously low level of testosterone can be prescribed these gels and patches by endocrinologists or physicians. Most women that I know who are menopausal know the risks of estrogen replacement therapies. They make calculated and informed decisions after consulting with medical practitioners and endocrinologists. Men on the other hand believe testosterone can help them build muscle mass, increase sexual drive, achieve firmer and long lasting erections and elevate mood magically. Unfortunately, these results are not achieved by using testosterone gels, and they may instead lead to undesirable consequences.Pharma companies like Abbott have underlined the importance of making an informed decision, and that decision must always be made after consulting with physicians. Investors may want to note that the market for testosterone will only grow, no matter how the product is advertised. Middle aged men will continue to look toward testosterone replacement gels as a solution to their problems, increasing sales and revenue. While the target demographic is coaxed to become aware of the risks of using testosterone without a prescription, investors will stand to gain from the various testosterone boosting products that are increasingly being prescribed by physicians.And, it is not just Abbott that has begun to market testosterone gels. Most of its competitors have their own versions of testosterone replacement therapies. Watson Pharmaceuticals (WPI) launched its Androderm patch, which releases testosterone into the blood stream directly, but slowly. This product has remained particularly popular with baby boomers who are growing older but desire a more active lifestyle. The Androderm patch brought in more than $87 million in sales last year. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) launched an even more attractive product - Axiron. Axiron works like a roll-on deodorant that needs to be rubbed into the arm pit. Obviously, the company targeted men younger than baby boomers by doing so. Axiron resulted in sales of $48 million. Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) Depo-Testosterone IM is an injection-based testosterone supplement that is prescribed to men and boys with low levels of the male hormone. But, bodybuilders and older men have abused this injection to achieve an ideal state of masculinity.Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) had reported that it is working on JNJ-37654032, which was touted as a neo-anabolic. The compound was purported to have fewer side effects than conventional anabolic steroids. Curiously, I could not find the latest information about JNJ-37654032 after 2008. It is not clear what Johnson & Johnson has planned about the future of this neo-anabolic. Merck (NYSE:MRK) was in the news sometime ago because of its Propecia, which is suspected to interfere with testosterone levels in men. Propecia is a hair loss drug that attacks naturally occurring DHT (an androgenic hormone) and prevents hair loss. It does prevent hair loss, but also causes sexual side effects, some of which may be irreversible.Of all these, I think Abbott is one of the best companies to invest in, even with the questionable nature of testosterone gels. Its rheumatoid arthritis drug Humira is a cash cow, and the company had total sales worth $2.3 billion in the second quarter. At $67.33, Abbott trades impressively. The company's market cap is $105.66 billion and it has an enterprise value of $112.53 billion, as of September 12th. With an operating cash flow of $8.75 billion and a free cash flow of $7.62 billion, Abbott is in a position to spend money on advertisements and campaigns such as the one it has launched for Androgel. It has a total debt of $18.09 billion, but that is not something I would worry about. If you are an investor, you certainly have many reasons to feel assured about Abbott's competitiveness in the short and long-term. If you are trying to boost your virility, purchase Abbott shares, but seek your endocrinologist's opinion before buying its testosterone gels.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

849791,30861,2012-09-06T08:58:56-04:00,,"There has been much buzz in the news lately regarding Abbott Lab's (NYSE:ABT) drug Humira. Humira is Abbott's largest selling drug on the market. It is primarily used to treat Rheumatoid Arthritis, but also carries significant value and potential to treat other auto-immune diseases. The FDA had been concerned over the overall effectiveness of Humira for treating other diseases such as Ulcerative Collitus. However, just recently, the FDA panel announced that they would back the marketing of Humira for treatment of Ulcerative Collitus. While this doesn't mean for sure that Humira will be approved by the FDA for the treatment of Ulcerative Collitus, it is a strong indicator that approval will happen soon because the FDA generally follows the voting of its board (Another similar case happened recently with Novartis (NYSE:NVS) and their drug for cystic fibrosis).Humira is labeled as an adalimumab injection and is in a class of medications known as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. Tumor necrosis factor is a substance in the body that causes inflammation and is a leading catalyst in autoimmune diseases. Humira blocks the actions of tumor necrosis factor, therefore decreasing body-wide inflammation, which makes it an attractive drug for treating many auto-immune diseases and not just Rheumatoid Arthritis.Diagnosed cases of autoimmune diseases have skyrocketed worldwide over the years. While many of these autoimmune diagnoses might be related to an evolution of better diagnostic tools and advancing research in disease identification, I believe that autoimmune diseases will be found to have a huge lifestyle factor surrounding them. Until the public begins to target specific dietary or lifestyle factors that they are willing to change, I see the number of autoimmune diseases continuing to rise. This, of course, could mean that the market continues to expand for Humira.The link for the following graph can be found here.Humira is by far the best drug on the market for treating autoimmune diseases, and has proven to be much more effective than Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Merck's (NYSE:MRK) drug Remicade. Humira's revenue was over $8 billion in 2011, and is expected to top $10 billion annually in 2013. Aside from treating Rheumatoid Arthritis, Humira has also been used to treat Plaque Psoriasis, Psoriatic Arthritis, Ankylosing Spondylitis, and Crohn's Disease. Adding Ulcerative Collitis to the list of diseases that Humira can treat would be another step in the right direction for Abbott and Humira to conquer more of the growing autoimmune market where they already control about 30% of total sales.Abbott is currently priced at about $65.50 a share. If Abbott gains leverage in the autoimmune market with Humira and is able to grow sales to $12 billion or above annually by 2016, according to Trefis, this would present a 5% upside from the current price estimate of $67.39. However, if sales were to fall to below $7 billion, Trefis believes this could be a potential downside of 4% or more in this segment of business alone. I tend to be optimistic knowing the given circumstances of rising autoimmune diseases and I say Humira and Abbott present a terrific growth opportunity to buy into.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

858791,29021,2012-09-11T04:06:23-04:00,,"If there's one pharma stock that's been attracting a lot of attention lately, it's Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). If you take a look at the charts, it's easy to see why Abbott's been so popular;  its share price has been constantly going up since April. As you can  see below, Abbott has suffered none of the steep price drops that have  hit competitors, such as AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN).So is Abbott really worth $66.99, or is this just another case of irrational exuberance?Humira Market Might Be GrowingMaybe not. An advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has voted 15-2 to recommend the use of Abbott's Humira  to treat moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The FDA has not yet  ruled on the panel's recommendations, but company spokeswoman Elizabeth  Hoff told Bloomberg  that she thinks this authorization might lead to $1 billion in  additional Humira sales. There is certainly a huge potential market for  this drug since as many as 700,000 people may suffer from ulcerative  colitis in the United States.This isn't the only good news about Humira that Abbott has received in recent weeks. The European Commission has approved the use  of the drug in more cases of Crohn's disease. It is unclear how many  new sales this will lead to because the commission has only approved the  use of Humira in cases where other therapies have failed.Although all is not well in the world of Humira, FDA staff have questioned Humira's effectiveness in some colitis cases. A report issued  on August 24 noted that the staff had not found much difference between  the effect of Humira and placebos in some colitis cases. Interestingly  enough, the FDA advisory panel that recommended the expansion of Humira  use was aware of the staff report's findings. The report did find that 17% of 248 colitis patients  studied achieved remission when treated with Humira. Around 8.5% of the  people treated with the placebo achieved remission. So the report did  find that Humira is effective, just not as effective as Abbott had  hoped.The same report did find that Humira is more convenient than Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) Remicade. The safety risks from Humira were about the same as those from Remicade. That means Humira is just as safe as Remicade and easier to use.Humira is used to treat a wide variety of autoimmune diseases  in addition to colitis. Other conditions it can be used to treat  include rheumatoid psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. The potential  market is huge; around 1.3 million Americans suffer from rheumatoid arthritis, and another 7.5 million are estimated to have psoriasis.The number of people diagnosed with autoimmune diseases is constantly increasing according to some authorities. There is also evidence that the modern lifestyle, including sanitation, is making autoimmune diseases worse.So it is easy to see why Abbott was able to sell $2.3 billion worth of Humira in the second quarter of 2012. Total sales of drugs for autoimmune diseases might grow to $34 billion a year by 2016 BCC research reported.Humira also competes with Pfizer and Amgen's (NASDAQ:AMGN)  Embrel, but it will face stiff competition from a host of new  autoimmune drugs that will come on the market in the near future. Pfizer  Inc is reportedly testing an experimental drug called tofactinib, which is supposed to treat both rheumatoid arthritis and colitis. Coronado Biosciences (CNDO) is testing an unusual treatment that involves parasites found in pigs.Humira Patent Cliff Four Years AwayYet the biggest threat to Abbott's Humira profits is the patent cliff. Humira's patent is scheduled to expire in December 2016. So Humira investors still have a little over four years of Humira revenues to look forward to before generics hit the market.This also means that generic drug makers like Teva Pharmaceutical Industries (NYSE:TEVA) and Mylan (MYL)  have plenty of time to develop a generic version of Humira. They may  need the time because Humira is a biologic drug that will be harder to  copy than a simple pill but not impossible to replicate. The huge  revenues that Abbott is making from Humira will give them a strong  incentive to try. Teva in particular seems to have the resources to make  a Humira copy; the FDA just approved its version of Amgen's Neupogen.What  this means for investors is that Abbott will be a growth stock for the  next three or four years, but at the end of that time it faces a very  steep drop off the patent cliff. That means that Abbott, like every  other pharmaceutical company, is not immune to generics. It simply has a  few more years before they become a serious threat to its blockbuster  drug.Abbott is a value buy for now, but like most pharmaceutical  companies, it faces a very uncertain future. Just as patients must be  aware of the potential side effects from drugs, pharmaceutical investors  must learn the potential risks from drug companies, in particular, the  patent cliff, which is a destroyer of long term value.Disclosure: I  have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any  positions within the next 72 hours.

890191,22251,2012-09-26T14:27:28-04:00,,"The covered call strategy is a great way to open a second stream of income and minimize the impact of volatile gyrations on one's portfolio. It is a very safe strategy to use as it does not increase an investors risk and to some degree provides some downside protection. If you are unfamiliar with a ""covered writes"" strategy, see our piece ""Benefits of a Covered Writes Strategy."" Today we are going to look at Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT). The stock has had a terrific run over the past 12 months, rallying from a low of $48.96 to its recent high of $70.41. The long term fundamentals are still good, but in the short to midterm time frames the stock is extremely overbought and due for a pull back. The best time to generally sell covered calls is when a stock is trading in the extremely overbought ranges.Some reasons for concernBenefits of employing this strategyIncome generationEach contract trades at a premium (the higher the beta the higher the premium), and the buyer of the contract pays you that premium for the right to purchase 100 shares of the stock at the strike price. The premium is deposited immediately into your brokerage account.Downside protection and reduction in portfolio volatilityIf the stock drops in value, the premium collected at least offers some type of return, and it can offset all or part of the loss depending on how severely the stock has pulled back. For example; if you sold a covered call against a stock when it was trading $20 for a premium of $2.50, then as long as the stock does not drop below $17.50 you are OK. In essence, you have reduced your entry price to $17.50. If this strategy is actively employed, then you could in general significantly reduce the volatility your portfolio is subjected to.Predetermined rate of returnThis strategy gives you a decent idea of what your rate of return on your investment will be. Regardless of what takes place you still get to keep the premium. If your shares are called away from you at the strike price, it is easy to figure your profit. This is the difference from what you paid for the stock and the strike price you sold the option, plus the premium you collected. For example, let us assume you sold SeaDrill (SDRL) Jan 2013, 45 calls for$2.50 when it was trading at $40. If SeaDrill trades above 45, your shares are called, and you are out at 45. So your profit is 4 plus the 2.50 which you received in premium for a total gain of 14.4%If the stock starts to drop in price, you lose money on paper (much like any other share holder) when the price of the stock falls in excess of the premium you received.Converts a common stock into a dividend paying stockThe moment you sell the call option, the stock you own, in essence, has turned into a dividend paying-stock. If it already pays a dividend you have turbo charged your gains.The option to repeat the process all over againIf your shares have not been called away from you, you can repeat the whole process again with the same shares of stock you own. Utilized properly this strategy can produce an income stream that can surpass the dividend paid out by that specific stock. If the stock does not pay out a dividend, you have just converted into one that does. If the stock is called, there is nothing to prevent you from buying another good stock and repeating the whole process again.Buy back the callIf you sold the call for a premium of $2.50 and the call is now trading at $1.00, you could buy the call back, and you still get to keep the difference, which in this case amounts to $1.50. You could take things one step further and start the whole process again by selling calls that are fetching higher premiums. For example, you sold calls on stock X when it was trading at $37 with a strike at 40 for a premium of $2.50. The stock is now trading at 34, so you buy the call back and sell new calls with a strike at 37.50.Technical OutlookThe stock is extremely overbought as indicated in the chart above. Over the past 12 months, it has not experienced even one significant pullback. Note also that the stock has a tendency to pull back every time it tests the +2 standard deviation Bollinger band (illustrated by the brown circles in the chart above). Given that the stock is in a strong up trend it could spike up to the $75.00 ranges before pulling back. The markets are also trading in the overbought ranges and are sorely in need of a pullback. There is a pretty good chance that the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) could trade to the 1390-1400 ranges before trending higher. If this comes to pass Abbott could easily drop down to the $64-$66 ranges.The Competition Suggested StrategyThe May 2013 75 calls are trading in the $0.93-$1.00 ranges. For this example we will assume that these calls can be sold for $.93 or better. For each call sold, $93 will be deposited into your account.If the stock trades above $75, your shares could be called away. If the shares are called away you will walk away with a gain of 9.04% based on the current price of the stock. This is a pretty good rate of return for roughly 7 months. Additionally, any dividend payments you receive will increase your yield. If the stock does not trade above $75, you get to keep the premium and you can repeat the process again. If the stock is trading above $75 and you do not want to give up your shares, you can roll the call. Simply buy back the calls you originally sold and then sell new out of the money calls.ConclusionThis is a good strategy to implement on a stock that is extremely overbought as it provides you with the chance to earn some extra money. It also allows you to sell the stock at a predetermined price. In other words, you are getting paid to put in a sell order. If your shares are called away you can always use the money to open a position in other great dividend players such as Altria Group (NYSE:MO), Philip Morris international (PMI), Southern Company (NYSE:SO), etc.Options tables sourced from yahoofinance.com.

876981,21873,2012-09-19T17:08:35-04:00,,"There comes a time when great companies reach a sell range. In our view, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) just approached that mark.After highlighting the fundamental and technical aspects of Abbott back at $47 on Sept. 24, 2009, in an update and actively accumulating the stock near the Jan. 31, 2011, low, the stock has risen 47% since 2009 and 53% since 2011 (excluding dividends). The annualized return is equivalent to +13.89% since 2009 and +28% since 2011. The stock outpaced the S&P 500 by roughly 13% from our 2009 review and by 37% since our early 2011 article.Click to enlarge image.Let's revisit our original assessment of Abbott in 2009. The stock was trading at 14 times earnings and 10 times cash flow, and was sporting a 3.4% dividend yield. Today, Abbott is currently trading at 22 times earnings and 12 times cash flow, and has a 3.0% dividend yield. The table below shows a summary of the relative change that has occurred since 2009.While our valuation model shows that Abbott is undervalued at a 3% dividend yield, 13 times earnings, and 10 times cash flow, we'd rather recommend selling the stock only if purchased near the $45-$47 price range as indicated in the article linked to above.Those not interested in following through with our sell recommendation can feel comfortable knowing that Abbott is a great long-term holding, with a minimum 40% downside cushion since our 2009 review. It's no doubt that income investors can hold shares of Abbott knowing that the dividend will be safe and will continue to grow. Anyone who bought Abbott at $47 would be sitting on a yield on cost of 4.3%. Not too bad when the 10-year Treasury bill is close to zero.In any event, we believe it may be a good time to offload shares of Abbott by either selling the entire position or selling the principle while letting the profit run.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

805841,23407,2012-08-14T12:13:25-04:00,,"Abbott's (NYSE:ABT) planned separation remains on track for year end, creating two stand alone companies: AbbVie, with the drug portfolio and pipeline, and Abbott, with nutritional products and devices. Investors may want to pick up shares of Abbott beforehand, particularly to gain exposure to AbbVie's thick drug pipeline.The reorganization hasn't been free. Costs so far have shaved $0.06 per share off earnings in the first half of the year. And, another $0.17 hit is expected in the second half too. On top of those costs, Abbott's international exposure has it wrestling with currency headwinds, which are weighing on reported results.But the reorganization costs are a temporary problem. And while currency is troublesome, the post-split AbbVie's pipeline offers plenty of U.S. based sales growth.Heading into the split, Abbott's revenue workhorse remains Humira, its massively successful blockbuster treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (""RA""), psoriatic arthritis and chronic plaque psoriasis. In the most recent quarter, the company's global proprietary drug sales rose 4.9%, or 9.3% ex-currency, on a 23% ex-currency jump in Humira sales to $2.3 billion. At a $9 billion annual run rate, Humira is one of the globe's best selling treatments.The company also saw sales growth in Androgel, used for testosterone treatment. The drug generated sales of $275 million in the quarter, up 26%. Sales of Creon, a pancreatic enzyme, were up 12% to $88 million in the States and 16.9% ex-currency to $74 million overseas. Lupron sales were $140 million in the U.S., up 4%, with another $60 million in international sales. And Synthroid sales were $120 million, despite generic competition. Overseas, Synthroid sales were up 19.8% ex-currency to $27 million.These drugs helped offset a 6.6% drop in TriCor/Trilipix sales and a 14.7% fall in Niaspan sales. However, both drugs remain significant, generating $388 million and $211 million in sales, respectively.AbbVie's upside depends on its pipeline.Like all major drug plays, Abbott is wrestling with offsetting future generic risk by developing a fatter drug pipeline.The company hopes to expand its Humira label to offset potential RA competition from Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Astra (NASDAQ:AZN)/Rigel (NASDAQ:RIGL) and Vertex (NASDAQ:VRTX). It's also advancing next-generation RA treatments through clinic, with its oral JAK-1 inhibitor in Phase IIa and likely heading Phase IIb in 2013. And it has BT-061 in Phase II for both RA and psoriasis.Abbott also expects Phase III results for Daclizumab in 2014. The drug is used to treat multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory disease affecting the nervous system affecting an estimated 2.1 million worldwide. Currently, the disease is treated with interferons like Biogen's (NASDAQ:BIIB) Avonex, with $414 million in Q2 U.S. sales, and Teva's (NYSE:TEVA) Copaxone, with $798 million in Q2 U.S. sales. Gilenya, a new treatment from Novartis (NYSE:NVS), also raked in $182 million in Q2 U.S. sales.Outside of the autoimmune drugs, AbbVie has bardoxolone in Phase III for chronic kidney disease. Enrollment in its 2000 patient Phase III trial is ahead of schedule with results expected next year. If the data continues to support the drugs efficacy, this drug has a good chance of reaching blockbuster status given the disease affects as many as 26 million in the U.S. alone.Abbott also has atrasentan in Phase II for kidney disease. Phase II results for use in diabetic kidney disease are expected by year end. So, investors should keep a close eye out for data, which will likely move the stock.Results from its Phase IIb Hepatitis C trial is expected this fall. Phase II data presented in April showed a 93-95% cure rate for Abbott's interferon free combination therapy. The company expects to enter Phase III next year with commercialization as early as 2015.In oncology, Abbott's elotuzumab for multiple myeloma is in Phase III. Multiple myeloma is the second most common blood cancer, with 22,000 new cases diagnosed annually. Current treatments include Celgene's (NASDAQ:CELG) Revlimid, with $934 million in global Q2 sales, and Velcade, with $204 million in U.S. sales last quarter.Abbott also has ABT-126 for the treatment of both Alzheimer's, which affects 5.4 million people, and schizophrenia. The drug is currently in Phase IIb with Alzheimer's data expected in late 2013.And in women's health the company's Elagolix is being ushered through trials. The treatment for uterine fibroids and endometriosis is in Phase II for fibroids and Phase III for endometriosis which affects as many as 10% of all women.While there is bound to be uncertainty heading into AbbVie's launch as a separate company, its solid product portfolio and better than peer pipeline suggest shareholders can benefit from trial data and new drug enthusiasm over the coming three years.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in ABT, AZN, CELG over the next 72 hours."
817391,25210,2012-08-20T11:54:19-04:00,,"In this article, I take a look at Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), a diversified healthcare company. We are going to evaluate it as an equity investment. We're going to examine the industry, the company's financial statements and the valuations.IndustryTypically, healthcare companies are non-cyclical. The companies typically have stable cash flows and high dividend yields. Drug firms and medical device firms have historically created value for investors. Their return on invested capital has been higher than their weighted average cost of capital. The industry has high barriers to entry. For drug manufacturers there is the threat of substitute products when their proprietary drugs are off patent. Initially their customers don't have much, if any, bargaining power. And the industry typically isn't supplied with unionized labor. The suppliers of labor don't have much, if any, bargaining power.Pharmaceuticals and medical devices are mature industries with little or no growth, industry consolidation and high barriers to entry. Industry growth is limited to replacement demand and population expansion. The companies should have brand loyalty and efficient cost structures. The industry usually avoids price wars. Companies in the industry with superior products or services are likely to gain market share and experience above-industry-average growth and profitability. However, the industry does face a potential threat from biotech.Between 2010 and 2011 Abbott's sales grew 10.5 percent. During the same period Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) sales grew 5.6 percent. J&J is trading at 2.88 times twelve trailing months sales and Abbott is trading at 2.66 times sales. Abbott's sales are forecasted to grow 2.2 percent this year while J&J's sales are forecasted to grow 3.5 percent. J&J is 8.3 percent more expensive on a price-sales basis.Rating System(The ratings, research and analysis in this article should be considered as a starting point for further research.)Abbott Laboratories -- Neutral or SellInvestment ThesisAbbott's revenue is increasing. However, operating income and net income have been flat. The financial performance of the firm isn't confirming the increasing valuation. However, Abbott isn't quite overvalued. Although, it is nearing overvalued levels.Investors would be wise to consider hedging positions using options or decreasing long exposure. New investors should either be neutral or consider short selling shares of Abbott. Also, U.S. equities are nearing the high of the year and may be headed for a correction in the coming months. However, the trend remains towards higher prices.Company vs. Industry [TTM](The company vs. industry data is courtesy of Reuters.)Enterprise OperationsNet sales increased 2 percent to $9.8 billion in 2012's second quarter compared to 2011's second quarter. Net sales increased 4.5 percent in the first quarter of 2012 compared to the year-ago quarter. Total operating expenses declined 1.8 percent in the second quarter. The operating margin was 21.5 percent. The year-ago operating margin was 18.4 percent. Net earnings declined 11.2 percent to $1.72 billion as the tax expense increased. The net profit margin was 17.6 percent. The cash dividend increased 6.3 percent. The dividend was almost half of earnings. Comprehensive income declined 94.8 percent to $122 million: the firm lost $1.65 billion on foreign currency translation. On a price-comprehensive EPS basis, Abbott is overvalued.More important than earnings is the quality of earnings, and Abbott's earnings are high quality. However, the company didn't generate enough cash from operations to cover its investing activities. Further, the firm issued $2.7B of short-term debt in the first six months of 2012. Abbott is paying dividends and repurchasing shares by issuing short-term debt. Paying dividends and repurchasing shares by issuing debt is unsustainable. Cash increased $239 million to $7.05 billion.Total current assets increased 10.5 percent in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. The increase is mostly because of an increase in short-term investments. Total assets increased 2.6 percent to $61.9 billion. The current ratio is 1.53. The cash liquidity ratio is 0.64. The financial leverage ratio is 2.52. Abbott is liquid and solvent.Segment DataOverall, the segment performance was strong. Almost all segments increased revenue and operating income. Performance in the proprietary pharmaceutical products segment, the largest segment, was strong as revenue increased 5 percent, and operating income increased 13.1 percent.Legislative IssuesThe changes to the Medicaid rebate rate will continue to have a negative impact on the gross profit margin of the proprietary pharmaceutical products segment.Legal ProceedingsWhile legal proceedings may have a material impact on 2012 cash flow, long-term the company isn't currently facing material risk from legal proceedings. There is about $800 million of liability being paid in the second half of 2012.Revenue-share is increasing and book value-share is decreasing. The indicators are conflicting. Conflicting indicators suggests investors remain neutral on Abbott Labs.Price-sales and price-book value are increasing. Both valuation metrics suggests the firm is overvalued or nearing overvalued levels.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
764311,24389,2012-07-31T06:26:57-04:00,,"Edited by Kate BoehmeEstablished in 1888, the Illinois-headquartered Abbott Pharmaceuticals (ABT) is a renowned pharmaceutical company, operating globally for the research, development and advancement of healthcare remedies. This company is continually expanding its existing services into more than 130 countries, including emerging economies in Asia.Abbott Pharmaceuticals has a proven record of operating successfully over long periods. The company pays regular cash dividends, assuring investors a reliable source of income. In spite of the worldwide economic volatility, Abbott continues to present positive financial statements. It maintains a steady revenue stream thanks to its diversified product portfolio.Financial Market ValuesAbbott is a public limited company registered under the New York Stock Exchange and the Chicago Stock Exchange. Outside of the United States, this company is also listed with the London Stock Exchange and the Swiss Stock Exchange.During the past year, Abbott stock has varied between $46.29 at its lowest, and $66.4 at its highest, which was achieved in the last week. Judging by these results, as well as data from the prior few years, it is clear that Abbott's share price is continuing to boom.Competitor AnalysesIn comparison to the general market, Abbott has a Beta coefficient of 0.31, which is fairly below the market average. Its financial indicators also look stable. In the last 10 years, the company's dividend payout ratio ranged from 40% to 60%. There has been only one year, when the payout ratio exceeded 100%. Abbott's earnings-per-share has increased from $2.50 in 2007 to $4.66 in 2011. Abbott Laboratories have thereby become well-established in the market, having been awarded a top 10 ranking amongst world pharmaceutical companies.Abbott's closest competitors can be listed as GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and Novartis (NVS), both of which also operate on a global scale for similar product lines. In terms of trailing P/E ratio, Abbott looks relatively expensive compared to its peers. However, the forward P/E ratios are more or less in line with each other's forward P/E ratios. Abbott supports the highest growth expectations, and thereby has the lowest PEG among these three.Financial Statements & Ratio AnalysesFrom the current public financial report, it can be observed that Abbott practices an exceptionally sound debt disclosure policy. This is clear in the levels of both short and long-term debt, which increased significantly between 2007 and 2010, but has actually been reduced in more recent years. Abbott's capital structure is more proportionate to its financial risk, the debt levels seem to be recovering further between 2011 and 2012.Among Abbott's different accounting policies, ""Sales Rebate"" appears to be most the significant component. Approximately 54 percent of Abbott's consolidated gross revenues are subject to some sort of various rebates and allowances. Since 2009, the rebate levels against the relative gross yearly sales have increased steadily, with values of $4.4 billion in 2009, $4.9 billion in 2010, and $5.5 billion in 2011. This strategy has brought the company's sales to a sustainable level, even during the worldwide financial crises. Abbott's success is particularly apparent, given the continuous growth of its gross income from 2007 through 2011.Theoretical AnalysisModigliani-Miller theorem (M-M Theory), which is often known as the capital structure irrelevance principle, is crucial to the development of financial theory. In essence, M-M Theory assesses how certain market price processes might have reduced or eliminated items such as bankruptcy costs, agency costs, taxes or asymmetric information. This theory is particularly relevant in assessments of the marketplace, where its efficiency can ensure that the value of a firm remains unaffected by the company's capital structure. One needs to look at the recent financial data, ratios and comparisons to industry standards to develop a picture of a stock according to M-M Theory.Our analysis suggests that Abbott presents the highest returns with regards to rational sustainability and fluctuation. Despite the relatively high leverage, Abbott is still clearly a sound investment. The debt can be compensated through the presentation of a stable portfolio of invested capital. This balance has sustained the company's operational growth regardless of any economic turbulence or fluctuations in the financial marketplace.Given the bullish market sentiment behind Abbott stock, it is apparent that Abbott's stock price fluctuates slightly; it does not change substantially, even though Abbott has good deal of debt, as well as large tax obligations. While many professionals believes the M-M Theorem is hard to implement accurately, this is clearly not the case, as evidenced by Abbott's financial estimation, positioning, and capital structure. Abbott's market price is largely independent of internal capital financing and debt or equity positioning issues.Based on Abbott's long-term performance in the market, it is certain that the theorem of Modigliani-Miller is perfectly suited to analyzing Abbott's business pattern. Applying the principles of M-M theory suggests Abbott as a reliable stock that is suitable for long-term investment.SummaryWith a high rate of investment, Abbott could cover any kinds of financial obligations that might arise from either nominal financial stress or emergency situations within the company. Abbott's share potential could therefore be considered as low risk level. Current performance ought to sustain the risk level at medium, and prevent any serious downslides. While the current price looks relatively expensive, the M-M theory suggests Abbott as a good buy. However, it should be noted that volatile global conditions, in which currency, commodity and financial markets are unpredictable, the application of such theoretical models are less helpful for predicting stock values.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
805421,25901,2012-08-14T09:37:02-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories' (NYSE:ABT) most recent earnings report reaffirms it's on schedule to fulfill its 2012 guidance, as well as completing its split into two profitable companies by the year's end. So far in 2012, Abbott has had vertical and horizontal growth in one of its flagship products, Humira. Abbott has also recently unveiled innovative and promising products from its device and diagnostics divisions, while building a robust pipeline of pharmaceuticals in conjunction with regulatory success as well. Below I will explain why shareholders should hold onto this asset for the long term to benefit from adequate dividends and increased wealth after the split, while interested investors should buy now before the stock price increases due to Abbott's continued success in the remainder of 2012 alongside the anticipation of the split.Alongside Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Merck (NYSE:MRK) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), Abbott is among the most prominent pharmaceutical firms in the world with over $100 billion in market cap. Abbott currently has the second highest stock price among these five, currently trailing only Johnson & Johnson by around $2. All of these pharmas are less than 2% beneath their 52-week high, Abbott is the furthest at around 1.99%. Abbott has the lowest beta and the lowest PEG ratio among these top-tier pharmaceuticals. Abbott has the second highest sales growth over the past five years, trailing only Merck. However, Abbott does have the highest sales growth for the quarter year-over-year (YOY) among these five large-cap pharmas.Abbott has a higher price to earnings ratio than Merck, Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline, while its price to sales ratio is lowest among these five large-cap pharmas. Only GlaxoSmithKline has a higher price to book ratio than Abbott. Abbott has the lowest dividend yield, gross margin, operating margin and profit margin among these five large-cap pharmas. Abbott has a dividend yield of around 3.09%, this equates to an annual rate of $2.04. Abbott has a current ratio, quick ratio and debt to equity ratio of around 1.5, 1.3 and 0.46, respectively - these are all better than the corresponding ratios for GlaxoSmithKline. Abbott's stock has had the second best performance among these five pharmas YTD, trailing only Merck by less than 40 bps.Recent Earnings ReportAn overview of the recent earnings report shows that Abbott is on pace for fulfilling its 2012 guidance and it should split into Abbott Labs and AbbVie by the end of 2012. Abbott Labs will maintain a focus on generic drugs, nutritional products, medical devices and diagnostic equipment; this generates around $22 billion annually in sales. AbbVie will focus on research-based drug activities on areas like HIV treatments, multiple sclerosis and hepatitis C among others; this generates around $18 billion annually. Overall, in the second quarter, revenue increased by 2%, this is the smallest increase in quarterly revenue for Abbott throughout the past three years.During the first quarter of 2012, Abbott's net sales were $19.2 billion, operating earnings were $3.68 billion and net earnings were $2.97 billion. Operating earnings and net earnings for the second quarter were $2.1 billion and $1.72 billion, respectively. Net sales in the second quarter totaled $9.81 billion; currency had a negative impact of 4.7%. Despite the negative impact of currency, many divisions reported growth during the second quarter. Proprietary Pharmaceutical sales increased by 4.9%, totaling $4.38 billion. This was mainly due to the 16.5% increase in Humira sales, totaling $2.3 billion.In the second quarter, Humira sales increased by 27.9% in the U.S and by 8.4% internationally. Abbott's working on receiving approval on more indications for Humira in order increase its revenue potential. Sales growth from Androgel and Creon also contributed to the increase in revenue in the Proprietary Pharmaceutical division. Nutritionals totaled $1.6 billion; this was a 6.3% increase. Sales in the U.S increased by 13.1%, totaling $741 million and international sales increased 1%, totaling $843 million. Point of Care Diagnostics, Molecular Diagnostics and Core Laboratory and Diagnostics also posted growth during the second quarter.Abbott currently has 20 products phase II or III. Acquiring Facet Biotech has helped Abbott improve its oncology portfolio. Abbott is developing products for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis as well. Abbott intends to file for FDA approval for its levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel for Parkinson's by the end of 2012. Abbott is also having success in Phase III with bardoxolone, a product for chronic kidney disease. Abbott Japan recently received approval in Japan for an additional indication for Humira to be used on rheumatoid arthritis patients that have had rapid progression of structural damage without requiring the initial requirement of inadequate response to conventional therapy. This is a significant step forward for treating early-stage RA patients.Abbott also recently received approval from the FDA on its Omnilink Elite Vascular Balloon-Expandable Stent System for patients with iliac artery disease. This is a significant addition to Abbott's already strong portfolio of products for peripheral artery disease. The stent uses a cobalt chromium alloy that is stronger than steel and optimal for long-term viability in patients. FDA recently approved both Abbott's Absolute Pro and Omnilink Elite stents because they were far below the primary endpoint goal in the clinical trials. In the U.S., 8 to 12 million people suffer from some form of peripheral artery disease.Abbott unveiled a variety of innovative products at the American Association for Clinical Chemistry Lab Expo this summer. The One-Lab platform was by far the most impressive. This tool provides a single interface for automating routine procedures for managing and tracking information in order to reduce errors and improve patient safety, while increasing and expediting the probability for regulatory approval. One-Lab consists of the Smart Center, Inventory Manager and Decision Center applications. One-Lab will be a vital tool for almost every lab setting and will be launched during 2012 and 2013 in the U.S., France, Germany, Italy, Australia, Belgium and Ireland.Abbott has proven to be a leader and major catalyst effectively driving innovation in both the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Abbott's strong financials and dividend yield, abundance of promising products in its pipeline, sophisticated device launches, and anticipated split into two successful healthcare firms are reasons enough for shareholders to hold this asset long term, while interested investors should buy sometime in 3Q12, before 4Q12.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
846001,25159,2012-09-04T18:19:50-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has been on a pretty good run recently. The company's year-over-year second quarter earnings per share increased by 38%, and over the last 52 weeks, the stock price has increased by 28%. The biggest revenue driver for Abbott is Humira. Humira is the blockbuster drug that is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and chronic plaque psoriasis. In the second quarter, Humira's sales totaled $2.3 billion, and it is estimated that its full year sales will total $9 billion. Abbott, however, believes that it can get even more value out of Humira. Abbott is now trying to get FDA approval to use Humira as a treatment for people with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis is a chronic disease that causes ulcers in the colon and affects about 700,000 Americans. Abbott hopes that the drug could be used in people who have not benefited from other medicines for the condition.On August 28th, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee voted 15 to 2 that the benefits of Humira outweighed its risks in treating ulcerative colitis. The FDA generally follows panel recommendations, although it is not required to do so. A final FDA decision is expected by the end of the year. The decision is important because of the large number of patients that Abbott could acquire if the drug is approved to be used for to be used as a treatment for ulcerative colitis.While the advisory committees vote is encouraging, it is not a guarantee that the FDA will accept Abbott's application to use Humira as a treatment for ulcerative colitis. In November of 2011 the FDA rejected Abbott's application, saying ""results from clinical trials did not conclusively show the drug helped stop the symptoms of the disease, which include diarrhea, rectal bleeding, incontinence, abdominal pain, fever, fatigue and weight loss."" As Humira already has known safety risks that include serious infections, the FDA staff said it was unclear if the injectable drug's modest benefits justify giving it to patients instead of other approved drugs, such as Johnson & Johnson's (NYSE:JNJ) and Merck's (NYSE:MRK) drug treatment Remicade.Humira's chances of getting approval for a treatment for ulcerative colitis are somewhat limited by the fact that Johnson and Johnson and Merck already have an approved drug for the treatment Remicade, for Ulcerative colitis. Johnson and Johnson and Merck are in a partnership to sale Remicade. Remicade is a formidable competitor to Humira as its second quarter sales totaled just over $2 billion. The advantage that Humira has over Remicade is that it is self-injectable while Remicade must be infused in a medical office.Also Take Into Consideration....On August 30th it was announced that the European Commission has approved Humira for the treatment of moderately active Crohns disease (NASDAQ:CD) in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to conventional therapy. Crohn's disease is a serious, chronic inflammatory bowel disease (NYSEARCA:IBD) of the gastrointestinal (NYSE:GI) tract that affects up to one million people in Europe.On August 28th it was announced that CE marking for a testosterone assay with improved sensitivity and clinical utility. The testosterone assay can accurately measure the wide range of testosterone levels seen in a number of different patient populations and clinical settings. Measurements of testosterone are used in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders involving:• The male sex hormones (androgens) including primary and secondary hypogonadism, delayed or precocious puberty, and impotence in males; and• In females, hirsutism (excessive hair) and virilization (masculization) due to tumors, polycystic ovaries, and androgenital syndromes.Abbott's plan to spin-off its pharmaceuticals and biologics division still appears to be on track to be completed by the end of the year. Abbott recently announced that the spinoff cost will total $0.17 per share in the second half of the year. The spinoff will be named AbbVie and its headline drug will be Humira. It should be noted that AbbVie has several other standout drug products such as Tricor which had second quarter sales of $388 million, Androgel, with second quarter sales of $275 million and Niaspan with second quarter sales of $211 million.ConclusionInvestors and Abbott shareholders will be very interested in the split-off of Abbott's pharmaceutical division. It was generally assumed that the reason for the spin-off, was because the value of the separate companies would be greater than the value of the combined company. Miles White Abbott's CEO stated that the two companies will be ""valued more accurately"" or ""appreciated more by investors"" as separate entities. Other spinoffs, such as Altria's (NYSE:MO) spinoff of Kraft (KFT), have seen market-beating returns since being fully sold off. Since the announcement of the split in October 2011, Abbott's stock price has increased by more than 25%. As a result of the rally in the stock price, I believe that most of the separated companies increased value has already been priced into the stock. But, I still believe that Abbott is a worthy investment because of its strong drug pipeline and its history as a good dividend payer.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

763411,32821,2012-07-30T18:18:13-04:00,,"A recent study by The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) revealed that Abbott Laboratories' (NYSE:ABT) Niaspan was ineffective in reducing the likelihood of heart attacks in patients with cardiovascular disease. This study, coupled with a June study by Roche Holding AG (OTCQX:RHHBY) questioning the effectiveness of Abbott's top-selling Humira line, present a threat to up to $4 billion in annual sales for Abbott.Niaspan is a niacin-based product prescribed by doctors to raise levels of good cholesterol in order to protect against heart attacks and strokes. The NIH study could decrease sales of Niaspan in the final two quarters of 2012; a potentially devastating blow for a product already on the decline. In 2011, annual sales of Niaspan nearly reached $1 billion, however, the drug's sales growth decreased substantially in 2012. According to Abbott's second quarter financial results, Niaspan year-on-year sales decreased 14.7 percent to $211 million.In addition to NIH's negative study, doctors are choosing not to prescribe Niaspan due to flushing and other uncomfortable side effects reported by patients. Niaspan's side effects are so prevalent that Abbott has dedicated a portion of their website to educating consumers about flushing. Furthermore, the side effects have prompted release of niacin-based alternatives to Niaspan as well as research and development of new products based on different chemical makeups.As Niaspan struggles, a few competitors have begun positioning themselves to capture some of Abbott's declining market share. For example, other niacin-derived drugs such as Niacor, Nicolar, and Slo-Niacin are now established alternatives to Niaspan. Other pharmaceutical companies have moved away from niacin all together, with Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Merck (NYSE:MRK) producing the Lipitor and Zocor product lines respectively. In addition, a new study by Weill Cornell Medical College and the Polytechnic School in Lausanne, Switzerland revealed that nicotinamide riboside (NYSE:NR), a cousin of niacin, yields many of same benefits as niacin without the flushing side effects. As a result, ChromaDex Corporation (NASDAQ:CDXC) recently licensed several patents from Dartmouth College and Cornell University to utilize NR. While NR is strictly an investigational alternative to Niaspan at this point, ChromaDex's aggressive push to secure these patents and history of mass producing other nutraceuticals like NR suggests that the company will also commercial a new product.Perhaps an even greater risk to Abbott's long-term growth is Roche Holding AG's (OTCQX:RHHBY) development of a new rheumatoid-based arthritis drug called Actemra, which could challenge Abbott's top-selling product Humira. In recent clinical studies, Actemra outperformed Humira in the reduction of tender and swollen joints. Roche is predicting FDA approval and subsequent commercialization of Actemra within the year, meaning a potential decline in Humira's U.S. sales in the near future.Humira is undoubtedly Abbott's bread-and-butter product, grossing $2.3 billion in the second quarter. This figure represents nearly 25 percent of Abbott's $9.8 billion in total quarterly sales. Roche's prediction that Actemra will cut into doctors' prescription of Humira by up to 30 percent would cost Abbott nearly $3 billion in annual sales.Despite the near-term risk, Abbott still has a strong foundation and most financial indicators are positive. Sales increased 6.1 percent in the second quarter, while Return on Capital and EPS continue to grow. As a result, the company's stock price is near its 52-week high of $66.80. Nonetheless, the disappointing performance of Humira in clinical trials, coupled with flushing side effects of Niaspan, render the pharmaceutical giant vulnerable to competition moving into the final two quarters of 2012 and beyond.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Disclaimer: The writer is not a licensed broker or investment adviser and therefore cannot recommend that you buy, sell, or hold any security.

732881,24361,2012-07-19T12:58:19-04:00,,"Drug, device, and nutrition conglomerate Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) continues to oscillate just above and below the point where it looks like an interesting buy in the healthcare space. Valuation may not be too demanding, investors nevertheless have reason to pause before jumping into this name. On both sides of the soon-to-be-split business, there is real work that needs doing.A Solid, But Somewhat Unbalanced, QuarterLong-term holders may be content that Abbott basically made numbers, but I have some issues with how the company got there. Revenue rose 2% as reported (up almost 7% operationally from last year and about 8% from Q1), but pretty much every item except Humira was a disappointment to one degree or another.Drug sales were up 2% as reported, with 9% operational growth in the Proprietary Pharmaceuticals segment, with Humira sales up 23%. Abbott continues to be exceptionally aggressive on pricing -- certainly helping to maximize the potential of the drug, but making it an even more compelling target for biosimilars. AndroGel was the only other drug to show meaningful growth (up 25%), but it's a relatively small contributor.Although somewhat short of Street estimates, 8% operational growth in nutrition was solid. Likewise, while diagnostics revenue missed estimates on larger forex headwinds, underlying performance was in the solid mid-to-high single digits. Diabetes was soft overseas, but grew more than 8% in the U.S. and initial reviews on InsuLinx have been positive. Vascular remains a mixed bag; operational growth of more than 4% after backing out royalties isn't terrible, but the company is still waiting for the U.S. business to go positive again.Below the top line, Abbott did pretty well operationally. There are some charges and expenses that create separate GAAP/non-GAAP results, but the performance was directionally similar. Gross margin improved almost three points, while operating income rose by 10% (adjusted) on controlled SG&A spending.Post-Split, Both Ends Need WorkWhile Abbott has given investors more information about the upcoming spin-off of the AbbVie business, there are still issues left to work out. Key among them is how the company's debt and cash will be sorted out -- it arguably makes sense to put more debt with the drug business, but investors were not pleased to see in the filings that this business is actually less profitable than believed.Leaving aside the capital structure, managements of both companies have work to do. Humira will be a dominant part of AbbVie's revenue, profits, and cash flow, and that's an inherently unstable situation. Even if Pfizer's (NYSE:PFE) tofacitinib is relegated to second or third-line status, the day will come when biosimilars, price competition from other a-TNF drugs at Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) or Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and/or payor pushback take their toll.Now, I'm optimistic that drugs like atrasentan and Elagolix and the company's Hep-C pipeline can contribute more than the Street presently expects, but it still leaves Abbott as a risky play -- arguably a bit too much like Forest Labs (NYSE:FRX) or AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) in terms of such high reliance on a very small number of drugs.On the device side, Abbott has a lot of work to do with its U.S. diagnostics business and needs to augment its drug-coated stent business with other lines. Not only are Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) and Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) legitimate threats to the stent business, but it would help greatly for Abbott to be in some additional growth markets (even if stents and diabetes are very solid plays on aging populations).Fortunately, this is a fixable problem - unlike JNJ (whose size makes value-additive deals in devices harder to find), Abbott can likely find more bang for its buck, and the combination of ongoing stagnation in the U.S. market plus the upcoming medical device tax should create a pool of motivated (or at least willing) sellers. I could certainly see Abbott considering companies like Vascular Solutions (NASDAQ:VASC), AtriCure (NASDAQ:ATRC), or Volcano (NASDAQ:VOLC) as targets, and even St. Jude Medical (NYSE:STJ) could be plausible, to say nothing of going beyond cardiology/vascular care.The Bottom LineNitpicking aside, I think Abbott is a high-quality company floating between slightly undervalued and slightly overvalued. Right now, I see it as more on the ""overvalued"" side, though not to an extent that I'd be in a hurry to sell. Investors looking to commit new capital to healthcare are probably better off with names like St. Jude, Covidien, or Sanofi right now, but Abbott remains a stock well worth watching as it progresses towards its split.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
726461,21445,2012-07-17T12:41:51-04:00,,"Abbott (NYSE:ABT) is expected to report Q2 earnings before the market open on Wednesday, July 18 with a conference call scheduled for 9:00 am ET. Analysts are looking for EPS of $1.22 on revenue of $9.84B. The consensus range is $1.20-$1.23 for EPS, and $9.68B-$10.04B for revenue, according to First Call. After reporiting better-than-expected EPS and revenue in Q1, the company gave a full-year EPS guidance of $5.00-$5.10, and said it expects the split into two publicly traded companies to be completed by the end of the year. Investors will look for further updates on the planned split and its timeline. In the previous quarter, Abbott received FDA approval for its Healon EndoCoat gel and FDA clearance for iFS Advanced Femtosecond Laser. It also had positive clinical results for hepatitus C treatment and rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Earlier in the quarter, RBC Capital said Abbott shares should be bought on weakness. The majority of analysts have maintained the company at Hold."
714051,24866,2012-07-11T07:03:05-04:00,,"From patent cliffs to Obamacare implementation, the conventional wisdom is that BioPharma is in a world of pain. As I have noted previously, drug manufacturers will face a non tax-deductible fee based on market share that ranges from $2.5B to $4.1B based on market share due to Obamacare. A separate 2.3% constitutional tax will be placed on medical devices starting next year, which really puts a damper on Abbott Labs (ABT) split. Next year, a 3.8% surtax on investment income and an additional 0.9% Medicare tax will be imposed on individuals making more than $200K per year. Qualified dividends and capital gains taxes will also more than double from 15% to nearly 40%.The dividend taxes will drag down shareholder value in high income-yielding healthcare companies, since equities are priced based on a given after-tax dividend yield and if the after-tax distribution falls, it follows that shareholder value must also decline. BioPharma has a low beta, so there is also not much room for speculation.Despite the above headwinds, I am still attracted to the sector. Eli Lilly (LLY) trades at just a respective 11x and 11.5x past and forward earnings versus corresponding figures of 18.6x and 12.3x for Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and 20x and 12.1x for Abbott. The respective dividend yields are 4.6%, 3.6%, and 3.2%. Investors should be mindful, however, that companies that typically offer high dividend yields do so sometimes - and by no means always - because there are limited growth opportunities. Ditto for companies with low multiples. Given that Lilly has the lowest multiples and the highest dividend yield while Abbott has just the opposite, it will be illuminating to look at growth expectations.Over the last 5 years, Lilly yielded 9.8% annual EPS growth versus a 1.4% decline for J&J and a staggering 22% growth for Abbott. One important thing to note is that valuing BioPharma is not about the past and all about the future. Producers have different phases of growth that come and go, and while we can get a general sense of the future based on patent cliffs and FDA decisions, it is hard to extrapolate over a decade long period.With that said, analysts forecast EPS declining 8.1% annually for Lilly over the next 5 years versus 6.6% growth for J&J and 8.5% for growth for Abbot. In this case, dividend yields and multiples appear to be a good indication of expected growth prospects.If EPS realizes 2013 EPS of $3.70, it will realize 2016 EPS of around $2.87 based on current expectations. By that time, however, growth prospects will be much better for the firm and a multiple of 15x is reasonable. That would put the future value of the stock in-line with where it currently stands. The dividend yield will also be reduced to an after-tax yield of 2.8% if the dividend tax hikes materialize (although I do not anticipate this). I thus encourage investors to stay on the sidelines unless rumors of productive R&D or buyouts materialize.J&J will have 2016 EPS of around $6.69 if it meets consensus expectations and no more. At a 15x multiple, this would translate to a future stock value north of $100. Discounting backwards by 8% yields a price target of $68.30. Thus, while J&J may appreciate by an average of 10% over the next 5 years on top of a 3.6% dividend yield, there is not a substantial margin of safety. The beta on the firm is 0.6 so there is also not much room for high risk-adjusted returns. Again, I recommend investors stay on the sidelines until catalysts arise and there is room for more speculation. J&J is a great company, but there are more undervalued picks right now.Abbott, in my view, is one such company with a reasonable discount to intrinsic value. If it achieves 2013 EPS of $5.36 and grows 8.5% annually thereafter, it will realize 2016 EPS of $6.85. A 15x multiple would place the future stock value at $102.75. Discounting backwards by 7% yields a price target of $73.25. The reason why I give Abbott a lower discount rate than its peers is because (1) the firm has grown 22% annually over the last 5 years so 8.5% annual growth forecasts seem too bearish, and (2) the stock has the lowest beta of 0.3.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: We seek IR business from all of the firms in our coverage, but research covered in this note is independent and for prospective clients.

712451,30201,2012-07-10T13:51:12-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) is a low beta (0.39) stock. Therefore I do not anticipate much volatility. Nevertheless, I believe that the market as a whole is heading lower for the short term. Those of you who are in possession of my spreadsheet (which tracks my market calls), can surmise that I have gradually exited long positions and am currently biased to the short side. Even though I try to maintain a market neutral posture, sometimes market realities necessitate a directional bias. Additionally, I have not been bashful in my previous articles about my views concerning a decline.That said, I suspect that Abbott will move to the downside in unison with the Dow and I anticipate a five to seven percent drop within the next three to six weeks. I am not bearish on Abbott. I merely anticipate a pullback and no issue is exempt from such merchandising activity.When you examine the block matrix which I have provided, you get a sense for the size of block which can be the impetus for a swing in this issue. I have also provided daily and weekly charts and have indexed with vertical white lines where the blocks occurred. Certainly there is enough information to reasonably conclude that the risk reward ratio heavily favors a short.As you can see from the blocks, $64.75 is a very strategic price point for the Designated Market Maker in this issue. On July 5 and July 6 there were six blocks which aggregated just under twenty five million shares. Each of these blocks traded at exactly $64.75 which represents over 1.6 billion dollars. In addition each block traded after the close. The question that should immediately come to mind: Is this a coincidence? I believe it is entirely on purpose.I believe this is indicative of heavy distribution and short selling by the Designated Market Maker in this issue. He will need to lower the price in order to cover his short position and accumulate before he advances this issue any further. He profits in a decline, as well as an advance. He never misses an opportunity to profit anywhere in the merchandising cycle. Since nothing human is without self interest; it stands to reason that if he does not hold inventory he has no incentive to advance the issue.We are now in a new quarter and the short term artificial demand from the window dressing will subside. This issue as well as others will be moving lower. Once again it is a consequence of a merchandising cycle.On the Basis of the foregoing, these are my views and observations:The Trade:I recommend establishing a short position in Abbott. Open your position with only 1/4 of whatever capital you intend to commit to Abbott at $66.29. Purchase the remaining 3/4 of the position at $71.59 and stop out at $74.40. Do not post your stop out. I have said it before but it is so important that at the risk of being redundant and in an abundance of caution I will say it again. It is too easy for the Designated Market Maker to cash investors out by moving the price above or below your stop out and move the price right back down or up again. In addition, when a stop out is triggered it converts into a market order and that could be disastrous if the Designated Market Maker decides to really take advantage. Remember the ""Flash Crash""? I would be looking to exit the trade at a downside price target of $58.50. Do not allow this position to exceed 5% of your overall portfolio. The Ex-Dividend date for this issue is July 11. As an extreme precautionary measure, I would not establish this position until after that date.There is always the possibility that the trade may not work out.There Is Never A Sure Thing (particularly on a short)Investors must realize and recognize that there is never a sure thing. Sometimes events that have a low probability of occurring bring forth very serious consequences should they come into being. Investors must judiciously consider what the inherent practical limits are and how much they stand to gain in relation to the risks involved in establishing any position.In addition, persistence can become desperate folly by allowing a losing position to become a viable argument for deciding on a new position. Rather, such decisions should be based on the current and soon-to-be circumstances.Any position in which one unexpected factor has a significant impact on your portfolio is the result of poor planning. It is a fault most commonly associated with people who want to explain away their losses. Sun Tzu - Art of War: ""Use an attack to exploit a victory, never use an attack to rescue a defeat.""If you follow the process recommended and the trade does not work, the overall loss in this model is $3,000.00. That amounts to .003% of the overall portfolio (theoretically valued at $1,000,000).Finally, never be a brave and brainless investor because a fool and his money are soon parted.A portfolio of $1,000,000 should position size in the following manner:This is a trade, not an investment.

696151,24114,2012-07-02T08:24:27-04:00,,"by James AllenAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the most appealing companies in the pharmaceutical industry. There are a number of promising opportunities across the globe for Abbott. In addition, Abbott has a strong balance sheet, a healthy pipeline of promising pharmaceuticals and an aggressive plan to split into two prominent entities. Shareholders and investors should invest in Abbott now as its price continues to rise due to its expansive pipeline and organic growth throughout the remainder of the year.Abbott's sales growth increased by more than 4 percent from the previous year, but declined by almost 9 percent from the previous quarter. Its beta is below .5, while the PEG ratio around 1.5. The current price is more than 12 times earnings; this has decreased from the trailing 12 months. Return on equity, operating margin and net margin has all increased over the last three quarters. Both the current ratio and quick ratio are around 1.5, while the debt to equity ratio has decreased marginally over the past three quarters. The dividend yield is around 3.2 percent and equates to over $2 annually.Abbott's past and projected growth rates on an annual and 5-year basis either meet or exceed the industry average. The trailing price to earnings ratio is slightly higher than the industry average. The dividend yield and net profit margin are slightly lower than the industry average, while the return on equity is above the industry average. These strong financials on the balance sheet depict a healthy defensive asset that could be advantageous to have in the portfolio.Abbott owns leading products in multiple sectors and has the most expansive global portfolio in the industry. Current operations are focused on the split into Abbott Laboratories and AbbVie by the end of 2012. It is also committed to additional buybacks and increased dividends for shareholders. Current shareholders will benefit from the split by ending up with shares in two promising healthcare entities by the end of 2012.These commitments and adequate balance sheet has almost every analyst rating Abbott as a buy right now.Abbott has been outperforming estimates for some time, shareholders and investors should expect more increases in the stock price as opposed to dips throughout the remainder of the year. Aggressive operations, a promising pipeline and effective products help drive this stellar performance in the markets. Shareholders should expect the price to increase upwards until the split at the end of the year.Abbott will continue to focus on the nutrition and healthcare lines while the new entity, AbbVie will head the pharmaceutical operations from the end of 2012 looking forward. With products like Januvia and Tykerb, competition in international pharmaceuticals is increasing from Merck (NYSE:MRK) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), respectively. Both of these large cap pharmaceuticals are increasing the number of products and molecules in Phase III of their pipelines that apply to a broad spectrum of prominent ailments like diabetes and cancer in emerging markets.However, both segments of the Abbott split should be able to continue to lead their respective sectors. The increasing opportunities in the nutrition and pharmaceuticals markets are partly due to the struggles Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is having with expiring patents and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is having in litigation.These organizations will also be competing amongst each other as Abbott continues to expand its global portfolio in emerging markets. The potential growth Abbott has in emerging markets in conjunction with its dominant product line is the main differentiating factors from the competition. As Pfizer suffers from its looming patent expiration, Abbott gains strength from horizontal expansion of its premier brands.Abbott's Humira is a leader in the industry, but it can also be used for several different types of ailments. This creates more earning opportunities, while mitigating R&D costs to develop and gain approval for new products. The prominence of Humira is one of the main reasons that the pharmaceutical segment AbbVie will continue to lead the industry after the split.Abbott dedicates around 10 percent of sales revenue to R&D, this is one of the main reasons it continues to have an abundant pipeline of products to maintain its leadership position in the pharmaceutical industry. Abbott has a promising product, LCIG, for advanced onset of Parkinson disease that has already been approved in 40 different countries. Abbott is currently trying to get this product approved in the U.S, getting this past Phase III clinical trials would help improve Abbott's less stellar pharmaceutical market share in the U.S. Abbott's stronger lines in the U.S are its nutritional products and healthcare products. Its presence in emerging markets around the world is the most appealing proponent for Abbott's potential growth and prominence in the future.Abbott has opportunities for its nutritional products to flourish in emerging markets like Brazil, China and India as well. India is an area of high growth due to its immense population, industrial actives and increasing proportion of people suffering from diabetes and malnutrition. Creating supplements and a reliable plan for assimilation here will create a blueprint for success to prosper in a number of emerging markets around the world. Shareholders should expect Abbott's price to increase as it experiences success in these parts of the world. There is room for growth in pharmaceuticals in the American market. On the aggregate, especially considering the split this year, Abbott is simply outpacing the competition like GSK in nutrition, healthcare and pharmaceuticals.After reviewing the Q1 2012 earnings call, it's easy to understand why the price and valuations of Abbott will continue to increase throughout the year. Abbott is very much on schedule for the split into two leading healthcare companies at the end of the year. It's experiencing increasing margins in most of its product lines and segmented divisions. The nutrition division is expected to be the main proponent that will drive improved margins over the next few years.Abbott has effective products in the market and in development for a variety of health needs including kidney diseases, oncology, immunology, Parkinson's, arthritis, dialysis, pancreatic enzymes, testosterone, vascular care and diabetes to name a few. Abbott has a growing market share in India, China, South America, North American and Europe as well. It's easily conceivable that even after the split, both Abbott and AbbVie will continue to be the leading organizations in their respective sectors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
673851,25901,2012-06-21T04:15:30-04:00,,"There is little doubt that companies and stockholders have high levels of anxiety due to the dire situation in Europe. This has not stopped investors from maintaining a bullish attitude toward Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), however, and I expect this to continue. Abbott has many solid developments making the news that will keep investors bullish into the near future. Abbott continues to be a strong investment, and there is no reason to expect this to change.The stock has been receiving positive attention from those interested in the market. Not only has the stock been performing well, but analysts have displayed an overwhelmingly positive attitude about the company. This is a good atmosphere that will continue to benefit the stock and should provide some confidence for shareholders. Given the global nature of its business, furthermore, this says a lot.One of Abbott's new global initiatives is the entry into the nutritional products market throughout India, which has acted as an area of high growth for Abbott. This is due to two main factors. First, India is the second most populated country on the planet and is in the process of industrialization. Second, India has a very high percentage of people suffering from malnutrition and diabetes. To put it simply, there is a large untapped market for nutritional products. Abbott intends to create supplements targeted for different regions throughout India. There will be a high cost for development in this market, but you can be sure that it will yield large returns.In fact, this has increased the positive sentiment about the stock even more, as some have raised their price target on Abbott due in part to the expansion into India. The push into India is seen by many as a part of the overall goal of entering into emerging markets. If the expansion in India ends as well as Abbott expects, you can bet that it will use this same business model to expand into other emerging markets. If Abbott can enter emerging markets early, it can guarantee long-term traction in these markets. Becoming a dominant player early can only bode well for the company and the stock.Abbott has not transitioned its core business though. There are many problems to be treated in its home market, the United States, and it is doing all it can to meet demand. It is attempting to extend the usage of its popular arthritis treatment Humira to other purposes. It recently announced that Humira yields significant results in patients who suffer from axial spondyloarthritis, which is rheumatoid arthritis affecting the spinal cord. This is good for Abbott, as its Humira product has already been through development. Thus, it would merely be entering a new market. The extension of an existing product into new treatments should allow the product to be more resilient, furthermore, as it will be less affected by patent expiration.This is not a slam dunk though, as its competition is hot on its heels. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), for example, has recently announced positive results for its Baricitinib, which treats rheumatoid arthritis. This shows the large amount of competition in relation to this kind of medication. This should have a small effect, however, only slightly improving Eli Lilly stock and slightly harming Abbott stock.Roche Holding (OTCQX:RHHBY) presents an even greater challenge to Abbott. Its rheumatoid arthritis treatment is beating Humira in the tests to extend its usage. Since Humira is a wonder-child for Abbott, this is bad news, and I would keep an eye on these results. I am sure Abbott is racing to stave off this threat, but if Humira is defeated, Abbott will have to find another cash cow. This is not an easy accomplishment by any means. Once again, I believe this will have a negative effect on Abbott stock.Other competitor GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) is attempting the same horizontal expansion of current treatments. Its drug Horizant has been approved for the treatment of nerve damage due to shingles. The drug was first used to treat restless leg syndrome, so this shows just one more example of this horizontal expansion. The expansion of current treatments is a new trend in pharmaceuticals with the idea that costs will be cut significantly by reducing the need for development and trials. The companies that can take advantage of this will have huge potential to increase margins overall.Despite this push for expansions of treatments, the development of new drugs should not suffer too much. For example, GlaxoSmithKline is developing a treatment for melanoma that significantly beat chemotherapy and treatments from its competition. Needless to say, this is great news for patients, and it will have a positive impact on GlaxoSmithKline stock.Not every company will bring strong competition though. AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) has been struggling for the past few months and has little to announce recently. Other than its bidding for Amylin, it has been almost nonexistent in the news of late. It needs some sort of injection, and a lot is riding on Amylin. Due to its lack of action, however, I expect AstraZeneca stock to be falling in comparison to its many competitors.Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) has also been struggling lately. With the upcoming expiration of its cholesterol drug Lipitor, it expects to cut 177 jobs. Pfizer sees patent expiration to be its main threat. A quick comparison with Abbott and GlaxoSmithKline makes this prediction a bit hollow. If the main threat is patent expiration, Pfizer has many problems. All of the major pharmaceutical companies are dealing with patent expiration, but Pfizer is handling this worse than the others. I would not expect Pfizer or AstraZeneca to pose much of a threat to Abbott in the near future, and I suspect that Pfizer stock will be struggling for some time.What does all this mean for Abbott? In general, I believe Abbott is a safe, strong bet. It will face much competition from other companies, but it is moving at such a fast pace that I am not concerned by this. Expansion into emerging markets and horizontal expansion of existing treatments will allow Abbott to push its core business even further, allowing it to focus on developing huge new treatments. While there are many major pharmaceutical companies that are successfully competing with each other, Abbott is among the best.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
927571,23479,2012-10-16T15:12:13-04:00,,"Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) is going to announce its Q3 results on Oct. 17. It is the  third major healthcare company in our coverage to announce its results   after Roche Holdings (OTCQX:RHHBY) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) announces its earnings on Oct. 16. (See our articles titled ""Roche Holdings Q3 Earnings: What We Are Watching"" and ""Johnson & Johnson’s Q3 Earnings: What We Are Watching."")   We expect continued strong performance by key pharmaceutical   drugs Humira, AndroGel, and Lupron supported by its  nutritional franchise. We believe margins could improve as a result of  improved  efficiencies across several operating divisions. Our price estimate for Abbott Labs stands at $67, in line with the current market price.Humira, Nutritional to Drive GrowthHumira is Abbott's blockbuster drug and contributed nearly 20% to the   company’s total revenues in 2011 and in the first half of 2012. It has shown   consistent double-digit growth rates. We have big expectations   from Humira in Q3 2012 as well. Other drugs such as AndroGel, Creon, Lupron, and   Synthroid may also continue with their strong showings. We expect a  decline in revenue from Tricor to offset some of the growth as the drug  went off-patent in July 2012. Another worry is the  government   investigation on Depakote, a drug for which the company has  set aside   $1.5 billion as litigation settlement.After facing a setback following the voluntary recall of infant  formula  Similac in 2010, the company seems to be gaining consumer  confidence and  market share. The company's pediatric nutritional  business registered  double-digit growth in recent quarters, largely due  to Similac and other  pediatric nutritional products like PediaSure,  Ensure, and Glucerna. We expect the nutritional segment to continue to  post strong growth.We expect moderate growth from the Vascular  and Diagnostics division after the company launched various  products, including its next-generation drug-eluting stent XIENCE   Xpedition and XIENCE PRIME in different parts of the world.Focused on Business Split, No Major Upside Without a Promising New DrugWe believe that in the short term Abbott might be better off than  most  of its major competitors, as no major patent expiry is due in the  near  term except for Tricor. Separately, Abbott will complete its  spin-off by the end of 2012 and  create two publicly traded companies.  This will make the old Abbott  immune to changes in product patents and  should bring about more  stability in its cash flows.We, however,  believe that the company's current valuation already  reflects all of  these factors after appreciating nearly 35% in the last  year.The company doesn't have a very strong Phase III pipeline with any   potential blockbuster drugs, which limits its growth potential. As   such, we don't see major upside to the company's current market price.  While the company's hepatitis C drug has shown promising results in Phase II clinical trials, we will wait for further details before taking  any stand.Disclosure: No positions."
666831,21835,2012-06-18T15:53:20-04:00,,"Linked here is a detailed quantitative analysis of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). Below are some highlights from the above linked analysis:Company Description: Abbott Laboratories is a diversified life science company that is planning to split into two publicly traded companies, one in diversified medical products and the other in research-based pharmaceuticals.Fair Value: In calculating fair value, I consider the NPV MMA Differential Fair Value along with these four calculations of fair value, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:ABT is trading at a premium to all four valuations above. Since ABT's tangible book value is not meaningful, a Graham number can not be calculated. The stock is trading at a 10.7% premium to its calculated fair value of $54.65. ABT did not earn any Stars in this section.Dividend Analytical Data: In this section there are three possible Stars and three key metrics, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:ABT earned three Stars in this section for 1.), 2.) and 3.) above. A Star was earned since the Free Cash Flow payout ratio was less than 60% and there were no negative Free Cash Flows over the last 10 years. The stock earned a Star as a result of its most recent Debt to Total Capital being less than 45%. ABT earned a Star for having an acceptable score in at least two of the four Key Metrics measured. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1926 and has increased its dividend payments for 40 consecutive years.Dividend Income vs. MMA: Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account (MMA) or Treasury bond? This section compares the earning ability of this stock with a high yield MMA. Two items are considered in this section, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:ABT earned a Star in this section for its NPV MMA Diff. of the $1,132. This amount is in excess of the $500 target I look for in a stock that has increased dividends as long as ABT has. The stock's current yield of 3.32% exceeds the 3.1% estimated 20-year average MMA rate.Memberships and Peers: ABT is a member of the S&P 500, a Dividend Aristocrat, a member of the Broad Dividend Achievers™ Index and a Dividend Champion. The company's peer group includes: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) with a 4.1% yield, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) with a 3.9% yield, and Eli Lilly & Co. (NYSE:LLY) with a 4.8% yield.Conclusion: ABT did not earn any Stars in the Fair Value section, earned three Stars in the Dividend Analytical Data section and earned one Star in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a total of four Stars. This quantitatively ranks ABT as a 4-Star Strong stock.Using my D4L-PreScreen.xls model, I determined the share price would need to increase to $80.77 before ABT's NPV MMA Differential decreased to the $500 minimum that I look for in a stock with 40 years of consecutive dividend increases. At that price the stock would yield 2.5%.Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the target $500 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 4.0%. This dividend growth rate is lower than the 6.9% used in this analysis, thus providing a margin of safety. ABT has a risk rating of 1.25 which classifies it as a Low risk stock.ABT is the best of breed pharmaceutical company with its wide array of patent-protected drugs, diagnostics business, nutritional division and vascular group. So, what does such a well-positioned company do as an encore? It splits itself into two well-positioned companies, a drug company and a diversified health-care company, each with strong competitive advantages. This split should result in higher valuations for each individual company. The spinoff should be completed by the end of 2012.With its strong financials and excellent management team, ABT is in a position to support and continue to grow its dividend. I will continue to add to my position when it is trading at or below my calculated fair value of $54.65 and as my allocation allows.Full Disclosure: At the time of this writing, I was long ABT  (5.6% of my Dividend Growth Portfolio) and also held positions in JNJ.  See a list of all my dividend growth holdings here.Disclaimer: Material presented here is for informational purposes only. The above quantitative stock analysis, including the Star rating, is mechanically calculated and is based on historical information. The analysis assumes the stock will perform in the future as it has in the past. This is generally never true. Before buying or selling any stock you should do your own research and reach your own conclusion."
651181,25953,2012-06-11T14:13:53-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is facing enormous costs for its decisions in marketing Depakote, its anti-seizure drug. The company marketed Depakote for uses it had not been approved for, and it downplayed the potential risks involved with taking the drug. As a result of its poor marketing decisions, the pharmaceutical company will have to pay $1.5 billion to the Department of Justice. Several states have ""benefited"" from the settlement, as Abbott has had to pay them as well. For example, New York, will receive $50 million in the settlement, and Connecticut, will receive $3.9 million. In total, the company had been sued by 44 states and the District of Columbia. Abbott's false marketing led to false Medicaid claims in these states, and Abbott must now pay that money back.The company engaged in ""off-label"" promotion of Depakote. This means that Abbott chose to market the drug for the treatment of schizophrenia, agitated dementia, and autism, even though it had not been approved for these uses. The drug had only been approved for treating epileptic seizures, manic episodes in bipolar disorder, and migraines. Abbott also aimed the drug at elderly citizens suffering from dementia, however, and downplayed the risks of the drug despite being well aware of those risks. In my opinion, this seems to indicate that the company is more concerned with its own well-being than with the well-being of others, which is far from being good news for its investors and stockholders.Abbott has managed to make the news, but only because it had to pay out the second largest settlement for a pharmaceutical company on record. Financially, this is not a good sign for the future of the company. You have to wonder why the company decided to do this in the first place. It must have known that it could not falsely market a drug for long without getting caught. At best, it shows shoddy planning and strategizing. I doubt that most people will see it this way though. As a result, the company may begin developing a reputation of being corrupt or dishonest.Making the situation even worse, it appears that the marketing strategy was systematically carried out by those in top levels of management at the company. This was not the result of the actions of a few isolated salespeople, therefore, and one can hardly fail to see this as corruption at the very top of the company. The blatant disregard for the well being of the state or the state-funded Medicaid program is something that is sure to push away a large number of key investors. In its marketing strategy, the company also promoted the drug for purposes that may not have been safe. The company is not only disregarding the state, therefore, but it is showing a lack of care for patients. Furthermore, I am not sure the fines are enough to stop Abbott from doing this again and embarrassing all those who have an investment in the stock. No matter what, this will have a hugely-negative effect in terms of both the company's image and the financial repercussions.While companies such as Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Abbott have decided to deal with their problems by splitting up their companies and selling off certain divisions, Merck (NYSE:MRK) says that it will not follow suit and conform to the trend of the day. The company plans to ""fix what is broke,"" rather than getting rid of potentially valuable assets. This seems sensible. For example, the company's animal health business is doing really well. Even if it is not a core asset, therefore, it would not be wise to sell this off now. I believe this will have a neutral effect on the company for now, but after some positive results come from Merck's plan, the stock will likely begin to go up.We all know that in the future, the leading stocks in the pharmaceutical industry will be those that found a way to deal with cancer. This is good news for Sanofi Aventis (NASDAQ:SNY) which will soon begin testing a new drug aimed at the treatment of liver cancer. The drug is novel and has never been seen before, which is one of the reasons I think it will work. Clearly, the attempts that have been made so far have yielded less-than-ideal results, so a new approach could be what makes all the difference. This may have only a slightly positive effect on the stock for now. If results from the test are positive, however, this would have a strong impact on the stock.Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) may be on to something with its new radioactive drug Amyvid, which can help physicians determine the cause of cognitive decline. The drug is specifically aimed at identifying Alzheimer's disease, something that can usually only be definitely diagnosed postmortem. Although this is an important breakthrough, the drug still falls short of giving a definitive diagnosis of the presence or absence of Alzheimer's. In addition, it will not be widely available to everyone who wants it. Consequently, the effect that this will have on Eli Lilly stock will be negligible at best.GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) is continuing to move forward by focusing on creating treatments for skin cancer that are more attractive than chemotherapy options, as that they have fewer side effects. This will make the two drugs - trametinib and dabrafenib - quite popular, as the side effects of chemotherapy make up a major problem that people with cancer face. In addition to fewer side effects, the drugs also seem to be able to prevent skin cancer from getting worse for longer than what chemotherapy is able to achieve. This is an even more important result, and this could be the break that GlaxoSmithKline has been waiting for. I predict that GlaxoSmithKline stock will be doing well as a result of this.The four competitors I have mentioned in a little depth, therefore, are all in better places than Abbott. While Abbott must deal with a bad image and huge financial consequences, other companies in the industry are moving forward. They are all in the news for things that will have neutral or positive effects on them. I would strongly discourage people from investing in Abbott at the moment, as other stocks hold more promise. Abbott stock will likely be dropping in the near future as it deals with the negative effects of its marketing strategy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
660981,25137,2012-06-14T21:48:34-04:00,,"As most Abbott (NYSE:ABT) investors know, the company will be splitting into two entities in the near future. One of the companies will be called AbbVie and will essentially take over Abbott's pharmaceutical business. When AbbVie becomes an independent company it will depend almost exclusively on Humira for all of its profits and revenue. Humira will be facing competition from a variety of new oral JAK inhibitors including tofacitinib which was recently recommended for approval by the FDA's expert panel. Also in 2016 Humira's patent will expire and it will face generic competition. While biologics currently don't face the dramatic free fall that regular compounds do when their patents expire, there is no doubt that Humira sales will start to steadily decrease. AbbVie will try to prolong this process by adding new indications but declining sales is inevitable. So with this article I am trying to provide investors of Abbott a look into how much potential AbbVie's pipeline will have in the post Humira world.Bardoxolone In an era where pharmaceutical companies are constantly coming out with ""me too"" drugs and reformulations, Bardoxolone is a breath of fresh air. This drug has the potential to be a true game changer in the treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease. Currently treatments such as ACE inhibitors and ARBs can only slow the progression of CKD. Bardoxolone looks as though it might have the potential to reverse it. Bardoxolone is currently undergoing a Phase III trial in patients that have Stage 4 CKD and Type 2 diabetes. The study will most likely report its data in mid 2013. Abbott is shooting for a 2014 entry if everything goes according to plan. Phase II data for Bardoxolone was very positive. The study compared a variety of doses of Bardoxolone to placebo in patients who were suffering from severe kidney disease. The results showed that all three doses of Bardoxolone increased GFR compared to placebo. Patients taking Bardoxolone were more likely to suffer a variety of adverse events including muscle spasms and hypomagnesemia compared to placebo. Enthusiasm has been tempered a bit by the possibility that other factors might be the cause of the increased GFR. The Phase III trial previously mentioned is measuring for patient outcomes such as cardiovascular death, renal transplants, and need for dialysis so the questions into Bardoxolone's true effectiveness will be answered soon. Of all the drugs in Abbott's pipeline Bardoxolone probably has the most sales potential, and could become a true blockbuster.DaclizumabDaclizumab is a drug being developed by Abbott with the help of Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB). A monoclonal antibody used to treat Multiple Sclerosis, unlike many other injectable treatments for MS Daclizumab is only taken once a month. It will be facing competition from a variety of established treatments and soon to be approved oral medications. As with most of the drugs I've included, Daclizumab had excellent phase II data. It was well tolerated compared to placebo and reduced annual relapse rates by over 50%. Daclizumab's next step is its phase III trial, which is just getting started and will be called DECIDE. It will most likely report results in about 3 years. Even if Daclizumab reports excellent phase III data it will be difficult for it to stand out among numerous treatments available. It will have to rely on an excellent safety profile and infrequent dosing schedule to build its sales. If this drug is approved,` look for it to start with low sales and slowly grow them from there.ElotuzumabElotuzumab is a developing treatment for multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a cancer that affects the plasma cells in the blood and has a five year survival rate of only 35%. Phase II data showed that when combined with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, elotuzumab achieved its primary endpoint 90% of the time. The primary endpoint defined by the study was a partial or better response as determined by IMWG criteria. Elotuzumab is currently undergoing a phase III trial and could be approved in the next couple years.ABT-450Hepatitis C has become a hot disease state in the last few years for drug manufactures. With a projected market of 12 billion by 2015, many pharma companies are coming out with their own treatments to capture a piece of the pie. This means ABT-450 will be entering a crowded and competitive market place. What makes ABT-450 special is that it is taken orally while many of the new Hepatitis C drugs are given as injectables. This will lead to ease of administration for patients and possibly decreased manufacturing costs for AbbVie. So far ABT-450 has completed 2 small phase II trials. The first trial, called Co-Pilot, treated 50 patients with a cocktail of medications that included ABT-450. Cure rates were over 90% for patients with no previous treatment and cure rates approached 50% for patients that had failed previous treatments. Although no serious side effects were reported, this was an extremely small trial so it is difficult to determine how ABT-450 will be tolerated in the long run. The second study was even smaller, testing only 11 patients that had not been treated before. These patients had a specific type of Hepatitis C that responds well to Interferon. Once again ABT-450 was given as a cocktail and 10 of the 11 patients were cured. If phase III trials are successful, a cocktail including ABT-450 could be on the market by 2014. What percentage of the 12 billion dollar Hepatitis C market ABT-450 will capture it difficult to estimate. However given that ABT-450 is given orally and Abbott has a couple other Hepatitis C compounds in its pipeline that could be included in part of a cocktail, sales approaching a billion are certainly achievable.ElagolixEndometriosis is a complicated disease that can cause debilitating pain in women. Currently there are limited treatment options for the estimated 100 million women suffering from Endometriosis. Elagolix is a oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist that Abbott is developing with its partner Neurocrine Biosciences (NASDAQ:NBIX). Initial phase II data was very promising, meeting all primary and secondary endpoints including decreasing dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain compared to placebo. Abbott and Neurocrine recently announced they have initiated a phase III trial studying Elagolix in the treatment of women with endometriosis. Elagolix is also currently undergoing a phase II trial studying its effectiveness in the treatment of uterine fibroids. Abbott is hoping to have a NDA submitted to the FDA by 2016. While Elagolix probably won't reach true blockbuster status it could add a few hundred million in revenue a year to AbbVie's coffers.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
659961,25032,2012-06-14T13:35:48-04:00,,"Last October, we were greeted with the news that pharmaceutical and healthcare giant Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) would be splitting into two partner companies. One company, that will retain the traditional Abbott name, will become responsible for the company's extensive range of nutritional drinks and healthcare drugs along with other related products. The new ""spinoff"" company, AbbVie, will focus on pharmaceuticals, in particular Abbott Laboratories' success story Humira, a drug that treats a number of types of arthritis, as well as other conditions such as Crohn's Disease (and generated sales of almost eight billion U.S. dollars last year). It is expected Abbott Laboratories will complete the company split towards the end of this year.News that plans for Abbott Laboratories to revolutionize its company structure are going full steam ahead are sure to be of great interest to investors; the stock is currently trading at just above $61 U.S. dollars. With prospects looking so good for the company, in both its pharmaceutical and healthcare divisions, is now the right time to invest? It seems incredibly unlikely that Abbott Laboratories would back out on its plans at this stage (a movement that would no doubt see its stock price plummet.) Even the most risk averse of investors can see little motive in not buying shares in the company, which should go from strength to strength over the next few years.Abbott Laboratories closest rival in healthcare is Merck (NYSE:MRK), the world's second largest company in the industry, and it now seems very much certain that Merck will soon be competing with a far more specialized Abbott Laboratories. Although shares in Abbott Laboratories are at the moment valued at around $61, when the company splits this won't be the case -- some stock value will go to new company AbbVie, meaning the share price of Abbott Laboratories will fall (investors will be given shares in both companies, so no real value will be lost).How this affects Merck depends on whether investors in Abbott Laboratories prefer to keep shares in both parts of the split company. I think that although prospects are positive for the divisions either side of the split, some investors will be tempted to put all of their money in the new AbbVie company. The reason behind this speculation is that AbbVie will gain ownership of Humira, which as a lone drug is pulling in a vast proportion of the company's current revenue. Particularly as new uses for the drug are still being discovered, Humira could indeed be the fire behind the rising stock price of Abbott Laboratories, and after the split this fire will solely be behind AbbVie. A shrinking Abbott Laboratories could see Merck take over part of this market share -- but this eventuality does remain unlikely, as it is more probable the healthcare industry on the whole will take a slight hit. Merck should probably be more concerned at the moment about a new HIV drug in the final testing stages by rival GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK). The new drug seems to be as effective as Merck's alternative, but has the advantage of having a daily rather than a twice-daily dosage.While GlaxoSmithKline and Abbott Laboratories have plenty of exciting prospects in the pipeline, spare a thought for embattled Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). The company has had to stem research and production costs in order to preserve bottom-line profits, and has been plagued by product recalls and court cases. One of the latest took Johnson & Johnson head to head with the state of Arkansas, where the local government won a landmark battle and received $1.1 billion in damages. This related to the promotion of the firm's drug Risperdal, and a judge has ruled that Johnson & Johnson downplayed the side-effects which this pharmaceutical product caused. Although the financial hit will be taken by a subsidiary, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, the news will still hit investors hard and affect confidence. I believe that with the U.S. government currently breathing down the backs of this company's activities, it's going to take a lot for Johnson & Johnson to earn back a relatively decent reputation in the corporate world.Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), a pharmaceutical company based in New York, produces a number of drugs that closely rival those supplied by Abbott Laboratories. As transformation into AbbVie takes place, Bristol-Myers Squibb will no doubt be doing all it can to stay in and ahead of the game. The company is currently facing the impending loss of monopoly over product Avapro, the patent for which runs out this year. It will likely dip into its $9 billion resources to secure new products from research companies in order the replace those lost (Plavix was also lost to generics last year).I strongly believe that after Abbott Laboratories splits into two, both of its children companies will be worthy of investment. AbbVie has Humira to carry it into its new era, and no doubt high levels of R&D funding will bring with it new products along with drug improvements. The healthcare company will focus on growing across the globe, with groundwork already established in the popular nutritional product lines Abbott Laboratories currently supplies. I would recommend investment in the Abbott Laboratories stock, although with its recent strong performance I would predict a slight dip in share value prior to the company split. At the moment, I predict Abbott follow an upward trend.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Two days later the market plunged and I realized I had to come up with a new approach to stock selection and timing, a better way of understanding what to look for to locate undervalued stocks and when to buy them. This worksheet is the culmination of that search and I've found it so useful I thought I'd pass it along.After completing this checklist I know whether I want to buy a dividend stock now, or wait, and know exactly why I'm making this decision. I also have a much better grasp of the stocks I own and what to keep track of in the future.Each heading or question has a blue link directly to the info needed. It may look confusing at first glance but only takes about 15 minutes per stock. Each step is explained below using Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) as an example. You can view or download a copy in PDF here, or a working ODT copy here.I mark each passing answer in green - each failing one in red.A - Pr/OEPrice to Owners Earnings - This is a gauge on how much cash per share there is after all expenses are paid. Less than 15 rates the stock a buy - 30 and above is a sell.Scroll down the Key Ratios page to Free Cash Flow (I will refer to this as: FCF). Use the last numbers available in that row. Then find Shares Outstanding five rows above. FCF ÷ Shares Outstanding = the Owners Earning (OE) Per Share number. Then divide the share price by the OE.For ABT I'm using the ttm (trailing twelve months) numbers and get OE of 4.845 ($7.631 billion dollars divided by 1.575 billion shares). Now divide the stock price by 4.845 and I get a number of 12.883. I enter that on the checklist. You can see the finished worksheet at the bottom of the page.Here's a quote from the article by Peter Mycroft Psaras where I learned of OE:""... you will see that I have proven that anyone buying stocks selling for 15 times or less a company's price to levered free cash flow would have done very well over the last 60 years, putting up results close to what Warren Buffett has achieved, which is only logical as he is the creator of the Owner Earnings ratio...""B - Cap FlowThis number is the percent of Cash Flow going towards capital expenditures. It should be less than 50%. Go to Morningstar.com Key Ratios page and scroll down to Operating Cash Flow and Cap Spending. Divide Cap Spending by the number above it. I get 16.9%.C - FROICThis simply tells you how much profit is in each dollar of capital invested. FCF is divided by Total Capitalization. Go to the Balance Sheet under the Company Profile at TheStreet.com and scroll down to Total Capitalization. This should be more than 15%. $7.631 FCF ÷ $36.48 billion Total Cap = 20.9%.D - ROEReturn on Equity should be greater than 15% - ROE for Abbott is 20.1%.E - Payout RatioShould be less than 50%. ABT's is 59% - I'll watch for that next year.F - TRowePrGrRThis measures the growth rate of an investment. Take the ROE number of 20.1% x (100 minus the Payout Ratio of 59% = 41%) which is a growth rate of: 20.1% x 41% = 8.24%. You want this above 15%. Article here for details.G - Div$/FCFThis is an alternate to the payout ratio on how safe a dividend is. It shows how much FCF is used to pay dividends. Ideal is less than 50%. Scroll down to Payment of Cash Dividends at TheStreet.com under Cash Flow. This number is divided by FCF and gives me 38.5%. $2.94 billion in dividends paid ÷ $7.631 FCF = 38.5%.H - Debt/Eq - copy this from the Company Profile page at TheStreet.com - we'd like to see this under 50%. Abbott's is 65%. I will watch out for deterioration in this number next year.I - YieldFor the latest yield increase I go to Yahoo Finance. I get 3.26% for ABT. I want 3%+ on any dividend growth stock.J - 4YrDivGrFour Year Dividend Growth Average - using the latest yearly dividend of $2.04 from Yahoo, go to Morningstar.com's - Key Ratio page and subtract the 2008 dividend of $1.41 which equals 63 cents. Divide that by $1.41 for a total four year 44.68% rise. Divide 44.68% by four years = 11.17% average growth per year. It should be greater than 8% per year with the Yield and Dividend Growth added together and totaling 10 or more. ABT's total is 14.37.Questions 1 - 5These are Yes / No questions. Go to Morningstar.com's Key Ratios page. Check each row of numbers for stability and growth for the past 10 years. Operating Margins have fallen for ABT from 20.3% to 14.8% last year - this rates a No. The rest are growing. Questions 1 - 11 by Adam  Bauer here.Question 6Check the share count for declining numbers. Abbott has had almost the same share count for the past 10 years.Question 7 - 9Using the same Key Ratios page, Abbott passes these also.Question - 10Valuation - Is the present P/E is less than the 5 year average. ABT's is higher than the 5 year and rates a No.Question - 11Has this investment kept up with the market - I go to the Performance page and see that it beat the S&P by 19.18% in 2011. (This can be somewhat confusing - it lists how ABT did for the past 5 years, as well as year to date. It also lists the S&P. Two lines below that is: +/- S&P 500 TR - This line represents how ABT did in comparison to the S&P.)I total five marks against ABT. This is within the parameters I use for putting new money to work, so I continue to the 5 year chart. I will wait and watch when a company has seven marks against it, or higher.Before buying any company I check the 5 year chart with a 50 DMA & 100 DMA to see the direction it is heading. In most cases:1) When the 50 day moving average is above the 100 day moving average, the underlying stock price tends to continue to go up consistently over time.2) When the 50 day moving average drops below its 100 day moving average, the stock price tends to continue to go down consistently over time.A buy signal is when the stock price is above the 50 and 100 DMA with the chart showing an upward bias.A hold signal is given when the stock price breaks below its 50 DMA and/or 100 DMA. Wait for it to bottom and turn up before buying.Here's the article on the 50/100 DMA in detail. As per the chart, ABT is passing this one also.Abbott Labs certainly rates a buy with both the worksheet and the 5 year chart test. Since I purchased it in August of last year it is up 25.57%.Any errors or omissions in this article are solely the fault of this author.Disclosure: I am long ABT."
650271,25319,2012-06-11T09:23:31-04:00,,"The next part of the dividend growth comparison series evaluates the dividend growth prospects of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). Let us take a look at the dividend basics of ABT:As in earlier exercises, let us take a look at the power of dividend growth for an investor who can set aside his/her money in ABT.Assume you purchase 1000 shares at the recent price level of $61 for a total initial investment of $61,000. The current yield works out to 3.3% as shown in the table below. A dividend growth rate of 8% has been assumed for the calculations below, even though the past 5 year average has been about 10%. Notice how the dividend payments and the yield on original cost more than double in 10 years, leading to $4000 in annual dividends.We have left out the DRIP part from this piece as some investors choose to reinvest the dividends and some do not. Some DRIP during bad times to accumulate more shares and opt out of DRIP when the price per share seems to be at a fair value. Capital gains will almost certainly contribute to the overall returns as well. ABT's price per share has increased about 27% in the past 5 years, while MRK and PFE have decreased and BMY has increased by a slightly lower 23%. However, in case the price dips, turning on the DRIP will be helpful in maximizing the returns when things turn around.Inflation has been ignored in this calculation as stocks are the best hedges against inflation when compared to other assets. 10 years is a reasonable time period for this exercise as the market typically moves through many cyclical highs and lows in a decadeWhere ABT Wins: Where ABT clearly stands out in comparison with its peers is the dividend growth rate. MRK, for example did not raise its dividend for 7 years until the latest increase towards the end of 2011. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) had to cut its dividend by half in 2009. BMY has managed to increase its dividend but the dividend growth rate has been an AT&T (NYSE:T) like 3% over the past 3 years.How ABT Wins: ABT's EPS has increased about 50% since 2007 - going from 45 cents a share in March 2007 to 78 cents a share in March 2012. Over the same period, the EPS of MRK and PFE have declined considerably. This answers why the company has been able to increase its dividends as well.Conclusion: It is very clear that ABT is the place to be when it comes to U.S. pharma stocks, with both dividends and earnings growth. Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) is an attractive name as well but being a French company, investors might be a bit reluctant to hold it right now with all the uncertainties in Europe.(Click to enlarge)Disclosure: I am long MRK. Purchased MRK in 2011 when the stock hit a low of about $30, which gave a yield of about 5.5%. BMY and ABT were also on the watch list back then but both did not present the same enticing entry points that MRK did."
633691,25901,2012-06-04T01:30:07-04:00,,"Over the last five years, Abbott (NYSE:ABT) has done a great good job of growing both its revenues and its net income. Abbott has increased revenues in each of the last five years by a total of 49.8%, while increasing its net income in four out of the last five years by a total of 31%. Abbott reported first quarter earnings on April 18th and continued its trend of increased earnings. During the first quarter, Abbott had earnings per share of $0.78, which was a 39% increase from earnings per share of $0.56 in the first quarter of 2011. First quarter revenues were $9.4 billion, which was a 59% increase from revenues of $5.9 billion in the first quarter of 2011. First quarter net income was $1.2 billion, which was a 43% increase from net income of $864 million, in the first quarter of 2011.In the first quarter of 2012, Abbott realized growth in each of its five business segments Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products, Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products and Vascular Products. However, its earnings growth was primarily spurred by its Proprietary Pharmaceutical Products division, which had a 10.2% sales increase, and by its Nutritional products division, which had a 9.9% sales increase. Abbott's earnings also received a huge lift from the increased sells of its blockbuster drug Humira, which had sales of $1.9 billion. Humira is used to treat patients with Arthritis and Crohn's disease. Other highlights from the company's first quarter earnings report included a 260 point basis increase in its gross margin and a 150% basis point increase in its operating margin from 2011.During the first quarter earnings call, Miles D. White Abbott's chairman and CEO said:While investors should be pleased with Abbott's first quarter earnings, they were probably more interested in hearing about Abbott Laboratories impending separation. Abbott will be transforming itself intoThe date of the separation is still unclear, but it will almost certainly be completed by the end of this year. Thomas Fryman Abbott's CFO and executive VP of investor relations said, ""During the second quarter, we expect to file the initial Form 10 with the SEC for AbbVie.""Positives for Abbott moving forwardAbbott is expecting strong earnings in 2012 and is raising its earnings-per-share guidance for the year to $5.00 to $5.10 from $4.95 to $5.05.Abbott has plans to lower cost byAbbott continued its record of increasing dividend. Over the last five years, it has increased its dividend by 72.8%. In the first quarter, the dividend was increased by 6.25% to $2.04 per share, with a yield of 3.3%. When the company separates, the dividend will be split between the two companies, and the dividend amount would be around $1 per share. The dividend yield should remain about the same.Abbott has received several approvals for important new products. These approvals include the European Approval for HUMIRA in Ulcerative Colitis, FDA Clearance for New FreeStyle InsuLinx Blood Glucose Monitoring System and FDA Approval for Absolute Pro Vascular Self-Expanding Stent for Iliac Artery Disease.Negatives for Abbott moving forwardPharmaceutical giant Abbott Laboratories said on Monday May 7th that it hadConclusionAbbott Laboratories is one of the most respected names in the pharmaceutical products business sector. The company has an excellent earnings record and has increased its dividend in each of the last forty years. The stock price is up by around 20% over the last 52 weeks and up by 53% over the last three years. Investors will off course take Abbott's history into account. After all, over the last year, Abbott has outperformed top competitors like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Merck (NYSE:MRK), Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). However, what investors will undoubtedly want to figure out, is how the spinoff of AbbVie will affect the stock's future performance. AbbVie's focus would be to continue to grow its leading brands. Abbott's focus would be to expand geographically, and to continue to develop new technologies. Abbott Laboratories has been a top pharmaceutical company for quite some time, and the new companies should continue to perform well after the split. I believe that the stock market is correcting from the fall and spring rally, and that best of breed, dividend paying stocks like Abbott Laboratories will be in demand. Prospective investors should do further research.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
644431,25159,2012-06-07T12:19:27-04:00,,"People are increasingly putting their money into health and well being, with the focus on living longer through the use of medicines and other artificial means. That means companies like Abbott (NYSE:ABT) have a really good chance of staying on top of the heap for a long time, since their healthcare products are in high demand.Companies like Merck (NYSE:MRK) have some concerns with the development of generic medicines curtailing its sales. It is easy to see the problems with a market where products are in such high demand. Competitors undercut you simply by developing cheaper substitutes. Yet, should this be a lingering concern for big, established companies? No. This is really only a temporary concern. These are generic medicines with no brand loyalty. Even though generics are a setback for now, they shouldn't cut too far into the earnings of the big pharmaceuticals.Conversely, Abbott's $1.6 billion settlement is definitely something to watch closely. This is even more concerning since the settlement was for the promotion of ""off label"" usage. This is the second biggest settlement by a healthcare company since Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) paid $2.3 billion in a settlement way back in 2009. This can be very dangerous for the company's perception. Yet, this shouldn't be too much of a problem, as one report indicates. There are still many good reasons to buy Abbott - it has a good dividend policy and stable financials which would allow the company to bounce back.One should also consider Pfizer's foray into nutritional supplements for children. The company is trying to reach more markets and latching onto global trends. Pfizer is proactively trying to show people that it has what it takes to maintain its growth.When you factor in Abbott's recent purchase of a hormone in the effort to separate itself from the dependence on its most popular product, Humira, you see that it is a company looking forward. Abbott Labs is seeking to expand its use of Humira to treat ulcerative colitis aside from its original use as an anti-inflammatory drug. The FDA is still investigating this. The delay might not be in Abbott's favor, especially when you consider the fact that they are planning to cut their companies in two.Lets take a look at the rest of the market to see how the competition stacks up. Pfizer was already mentioned above and the other big news for the company is that Oliver Brandicourt, head of the primary care unit of Pfizer, will handle the emerging markets department to replace David Simmons, who was at the head of the department since its inception. All eyes will be on him to see if he can recreate the success of Simmons, and that will have a direct effect on the company's stock. So, good luck to him.Meanwhile, GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) is pursuing a creative, if not expensive, strategy when it comes to collaborators. Instead of having a problem where you may face competition, just acquire them outright. This is really smart on its part, since it gets access to all of the research that the company is doing and it can see which ones will profit, either by developing on its own or selling to other pharmacy companies looking for a new product in the market.Now let's focus on Abbott's upcoming split. Yes, it is planning to cut its company in two: Abbott Labs and a new company that focuses on the pharmaceutical side, AbbVie. It might be a good time to mention that AbbVie's flagship product will be Humira, hence the bad timing of the FDA delay. People have so many questions about how this split will work. Some people speculate that it might damage the stock perception, since the prospect is very risky. Others say that AbbVie might be a good buy in the short term until Humira falls out of patent in 2016. In fact, the perception is so bad that Fitch & Moody has dropped its rating because of it. Is this a valid concern? Not really. Maybe people are just worried about it.So, what position should an investor take? If you have a position in Abbott, hold on to it. If you don't, try to acquire it for a lower price. This is not a company that you can feel comfortable buying into if only because the sentiment is that the split will be bad for it in this case, and that is what matters.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Abbott is the second largest marketer of diagnostic products worldwide. The company has five separate operation segments: Proprietary Pharmaceuticals Products, Established Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Vascular Products. Abbott will be splitting its operations into two separate companies soon though, and it is uncertain what exactly will come from this move.The following chart shows Abbott's five operation segments and their sales, incomes, and profit margins. Additional information can be found here.The split would create two different companies: Abbott Laboratories, which will remain an established pharmaceuticals division with nutritional, diagnostic, and vascular products, and AbbVie, which will consist of proprietary pharmaceuticals. This division will make Abbott Laboratories a $22-billion company and AbbVie about an $18-billion company.Abbott's focus would be to expand geographically, continue to develop new technologies, and focus on accelerating the margins/cash flow. Abbott will have a higher growth rate because the focus of the company will be expanding business into emerging markets. AbbVie's focus would be to continue to grow it's leading brands, but with a more intense research focus and focus on maintaining business in developed markets.Abbott has always been terrific at not only paying out a dividend, but expanding its dividend year after year. In fact, Abbott has increased its dividend payout for 40 consecutive years now and currently pays out a $2.04 dividend. The dividend amount is said to be split between the two companies when the company divides. The yield should remain the same, but the dividend amount would be valued at around a dollar per share.This article just scratches the surface of the split coming for Abbott Laboratories, but it highlights some of the main details of the move. No major pharmaceutical company has returned more to its shareholders than Abbott, both short term and long term.Abbott has outperformed all of its major peers including Mead Johnson Nutrition Company (NYSE:MJN), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Medtronic Inc. (NYSE:MDT), Covidien Public Limited Company (COV), Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX), Zimmer Holdings Inc. (ZMH), Becton, Dickson and Company (NYSE:BDX), C.R. Bard Inc. (NYSE:BCR), St. Jude Medical Inc. (NYSE:STJ), and Stryker Corporation (NYSE:SYK).Although there is a lot of uncertainty on the division coming soon, investors can be confident that if any pharmaceutical company could pull off a split like this, Abbott would be the one to do it.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
621621,22116,2012-05-29T02:45:39-04:00,,"Introduction and BackgroundLast October, shortly after Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) announced that it would be splitting itself up, I published ""Abbott: Still a Dividend Growth Stalwart?"" I examined the official announcement, an 81-slide presentation about the split, and other materials.My conclusion was, Rats! That is because Abbott had been a near-perfect dividend growth stock: Perpetually undervalued; in my Top 40 Dividend Growth Stocks every year (2008-2011); terrific dividend characteristics including a 3.6% yield and a 39-year dividend growth streak; and decent total returns. I had made a number of purchases of Abbott over the years, and it constituted about 9% of my public Dividend Growth Portfolio.But one hallmark of dividend growth investing is monitoring your stocks for a continuing high degree of confidence about what the company is likely to do with its dividend. We want dividends that are reliable and growing. The announced split introduced uncertainty on that score. I concluded that article with these thoughts:In fact, Abbott is not on my 2012 Top 40 list. Its dividend increase was 6.3% in April-not down to the 2%-3% level, but not up to the steady 9%-10% gains that had preceded it for several years. So a couple of months ago, I placed a 7% sell-stop under my shares, with the intention of reducing the gap by 1% per month until either the stock sold off, or new information appeared that removed uncertainty about the future reliability and growth of Abbott's dividend going forward.What Do We Know Now?It's funny. I consider the split to be easily the most important investment issue concerning Abbott, but I have read several articles and professional analyses since last October in which the split is not even mentioned. For example, Thomson-Reuters' most recent ""Stock Report"" on Abbott, published on May 25, 2012, spent 12 pages analyzing fundamentals and esoterica, including earnings, relative valuation, risk, price momentum, peer analysis, price targets, valuation, risk, and insider trading. The split was not mentioned once. The writers of these kinds of ""analyses"" act as if the split has not been announced, or they just discuss Abbott as if it will remain the same company as it is now.It will not. In its recent 2012 Annual Shareholders' Meeting Remarks and Presentation (April 27, 2012), and the associated call transcript, Abbott devoted quite a bit of time to the split.Here are two slides that were used at the shareholders meeting to illustrate the new companies.So far, the market has liked the split idea. The stock's price has been on a steady rise since the announcement last October.What About the Dividend?Similar to what was announced last October, management recently stated that both new companies are expected to pay a dividend that, when combined, will at least equal the Abbott dividend at the time of separation. Abbott's dividend is $2.04 per share, and at its current price its yield is about 3.6%, reflecting the combined impact of its steady price increase since the announcement as well as a 6.3% dividend increase announced in the first quarter of 2012.The company's 1, 3, 5, and 10-year dividend growth rates through 2011 were all 9% to 10% annualized, including a 9% increase in 2011. The 2012 increase was 6.3%, marking the 40th consecutive year of dividend increases but the lowest percentage increase since 2005 and the fourth-lowest since at least 1979.Here is what I said about the dividend last October:I have examined several articles and analyst reports on Abbott. Opinions vary on the overall goodness of the split, but I found very little that addressed the dividend. Here are some samples.ConclusionsIn researching this article, I gained a little more confidence that the split-up of Abbott is well conceived, and that it is probably being well executed. I take with a grain of salt the company's statement that they are already operating as if they were two separate companies. If that were true, it would not take 12 months to split them up. The fact is that a lot of work needs to be done to effect the split for a company of this size and the apparent care they are taking in doing it right.I also became more convinced that the split is more likely than not to ""unlock value"" not only in the sense of freeing both companies to pursue their separate businesses vigorously, but also in the sense of stockholders potentially valuing one or the other new company more highly as separate entities.But my focus is on the dividend and dividend growth. Other than the company's reiteration that the combined dividend of the two new companies will be similar to Abbott's current dividend and its historically low 6.3% increase earlier in 2012, I found nothing to move the needle on the uncertainty question. So on that issue, I haven't changed my Rats! point of view of last year.Therefore for June, I will move my sell-stop another 1% closer to actual price (to 5%). The company has not yet convinced me that the two new companies will be the dividend stalwarts going forward that the single Abbott Laboratories has been for many years.Disclosure: I am long ABT, JNJ."

She was not the millionaire you will hear buying out companies. In fact, she was a secretary of a pharmaceutical company. She bought her clothes at rummage sales, lived in a tiny, one bedroom house and was an employee for most of her life.Her secret was that she invested her income in one single investment. This one single investment paid her handsomely. In 1935, she bought 3 issued shares for $180. Since then, she held on to the stock and kept reinvesting the dividends she received. At the time of her death, she owned more than 100,000 shares valued at $7 million.What was the single investment she bought? It was the company she served for the last 43 years. The name of the company is Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). Financial advisors would not agree with over concentration but Grace thought it was worth the risk. She was probably familiar with the company relative to other stocks. On hindsight, she was right about how the stock has maximized shareholder's value through capital appreciation and 39 years of consistent dividend payment.Will Abbott deliver the same shareholder returns for the next 30 years?In my view, there is a big possibility that it won't deliver the same investment returns that Ms. Groner had when she bought it. However, it would be a good addition to the list of dividend stocks that one should include in his or her portfolio.Here are some reasons why Abbott will not produce massive gains over the next 30 years:Depressing Outlook for Pharmaceuticals over the Next Few YearsAccording to the Data Monitor data, the growth for pharmaceutical companies will slow to 1.3% to 2015. This is significantly slower than the historical growth of 7% from 2003 to 2009. It said that the sharp declines in branded sales with the loss of patent exclusivity will drive the decline in growth of pharmaceutical companies.The growing number of major drugs losing patent protection will force these major pharmaceutical companies to compete with cheaper generic makers. Over the last year, these companies have invested in generics, vaccines and biological drugs. The result is that major pharmaceutical companies will have to cut down drug prices, which would eventually put pressure on margins and profitability.Looking at different major pharmaceuticals, this seems to be already happening. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) sales have declined slightly by 0.98% compared to its 5-year growth of 6.80%. Its operating margins are also down slightly at 18%. Another big pharmaceutical company Merck (NYSE:MRK) has sales growth falling to 4% from as high as 16% over the last 5 years. Its operating margins have also contracted to 16% compared to the average 5-year operating margins of 22%.Given the uncertainties surrounding Europe, countries have introduced austerity measures. Bailed-out countries like Greece and Spain have decreased healthcare spending significantly. Even European drug maker Sanofi SA (NASDAQ:SNY) has experienced the same decline. Sales growth rates declined to 3% compared to the 4% growth it posted over the last 5 years. Its margins have also decreased 16% from average margins of 18%.The report mentioned only a few pharmaceutical companies that will post better than expected growth rates. These companies are able to offset European woes through revenue growth from high biologics or targeting smaller niches. These includes Bayer, Novartis (NYSE:NVS) and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK).Abbott appears fairly valued at current levelsOne of the reasons why the stock will not outperform the market is due to its valuation relative to its future growth. The current price implies a 12 times 2012 earnings and carries a dividend yield of 3.28%. This is based on expectations that earnings will grow by 8% this year. On a trailing price earnings ratio, the stock trades at 20 times earnings. This is in line with its 5-year historical average.In contrast, other pharmaceuticals are currently trading at more attractive multiples. Investors will pick up shares that are trading at single digit valuations to give them a cushion if earnings will contract further. Pfizer is valued at 9 times 2012 earnings and has a dividend yield of 4%. Merck is trading is 10 times 2012 earnings and carries a dividend yield of 4.50%. On the other hand, Sanofi is also trading at 8 times earnings and has a dividend yield of 4.9%.Best way to play Abbott is to buy AbbvieLast year Abbott Labs announced that it will split into two companies amid pressures on patent expirations and the threat of lower pricing. The split is expected to be completed by the end of this year. The spin-off company will be a smaller company named Abbvie.Abbott institutional holders are expected to sell off shares after its listing. The reason is that big funds do not want smaller companies in their portfolio as it does not impact their returns. This creates a compelling opportunity for small investors to pick up beaten shares that were sold off for no fundamental reason.Abbvie's drivers will be the sales of rheumatoid arthritis therapy Humira, which accounted for one-fifth of the company's sales. After the spin-off this will account for 40% of Abbvie's sales. It is expected to earn $8 billion in net income this year. It still faces competition from cheaper biosimilar versions of the drug by 2016.However, management said that Abbott will diversify its revenue sources for the new company to drive better future profitability. Over the long run, this will yield to more stability in free cash flow and dividend payments.Given the immediate sell-off from the spin-off, Abbvie's stock price will trade at single multiple valuations with a higher dividend payment compared to its parent, Abbott Laboratories. This is definitely a better deal than buying Abbott at current levels.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
612221,25651,2012-05-23T12:35:31-04:00,,"The pharmaceuticals industry is a defense play, just like the food and beverages industry, in terms of sensitivity and market beta. Abbott Laboratories (ABT) is uniquely situated in the industry because of its growth prospects and because it still has a reduced valuation due to lawsuit-related uncertainty. The month of May brought the end to a lawsuit filed against the company for marketing Depakote, a drug for schizophrenia, for off-label use. The company actually pleaded guilty to a criminal misdemeanor for its actions. The total settlement amount is $1.6 billion. A multi-year cloud that hung over Abbott has been lifted. Although the company will be under government compliance review, management can now refocus on growth initiatives and overall financial performance.Chief among Abbott's positives is its favorable dividend policy. Abbott's forward annual dividend yield is at 3.40% with a forward annual dividend rate of $2.04 per share. The dividend yield is not the highest in the industry, but the dividend rate is remains impressive. Close investment competitors such as Merck (MRK) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) yield 4.40% and 3.60%, respectively. Other competitors, which include Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY), had a forward annual dividend yield of 4.90%, the highest reported in this industry. The various dividend rates are not equal, however. Merck has the highest payout ratio of 77%, while Abbott pays at ratio of 62% of earnings. Johnson & Johnson pays at a ratio of 64% while Sanofi's payout is the lowest at only 48%. This gives you a clear picture of how much room each company has to raise its dividend rate. Overall, the sector has some room for dividend growth.Many companies, more often than not, struggle to run at the optimal cost of capital. This simply means attaining a balance between the amount of debt used and the amount invested inform of equity. First and foremost, it is of great importance to note that either extreme is considered unhealthy for the company and hence the need to strike a balance. There are several theories that suggest certain levels of debt and equity but in my own understanding, it all depends on the type of industry the company operates. For instance, the level of debt considered safe for financial institutions is lower than that for pharmaceuticals industry. With this in mind, the debt to equity ratio of 62.85 ensures that the company capitalizes on the tax allowable cost of debt in the form of interest expense while at the same time making sure that the stockholders do not lose control to the creditors.Sanofi, on the other hand, showed some shrewdness in its acquisition of debt by keeping it 27.43, while Merck feels 30.76 is a good level to work with. Johnson & Johnson on the other hand had 34.49 while Roche holdings AG had the highest of levels with 185.42.Abbott's profit margin is not the best when compared to majority of its competitors. Roche Holdings has a very impressive figure of 21.8% profit margin and 32.92% operating margin as compared to that of Abbott at 12.17% profit margin and 20.90% operating margin. Sanofi and Merck are not really far off from Abbott, as they reported profitability margins of 16.24% profit margin with an operating margin of 21.73% and profit margin of 13.05% and an operating margin of 21.99% respectively. Johnson & Johnson managed to record a profit margin of 14.87%, which is still better than Abbott and an even better operating margin of 24.97%.All investors are always on the lookout for news impacting on the status of the prospective stock and even the stock they have in their portfolio. While it is not good to focus on the negative aspects only, it is good for precautionary purposes. A lot has been said about Abbott in recent past due to its issues with marketing drugs for off-label use. Nevertheless, it is always good to also look at the positives in order to make the right judgment. Abbott has plenty of positives. The signing of the deal with Galapagos for development of a next generation JAK (Janus kinase) inhibitor for arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, after which the marketability could be a real catalyst for the stock. Abbott's Humira is already on its way to being an $8 billion per year in sales drug in the autoimmune space. The drug is currently in its second phase II study.Thus, the pieces Abbott needs to reassert itself as a growth story are already in place. In my view, much of Abbott's marketing-related troubles are behind it with the settlement. A stock that boasts strong fundamentals such as the ones depicted by Abbott can perform well without overhanging uncertainty.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

This is because it produces products for human consumption, which makes it the main source of income. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one major beneficiary of this kind of income and so is a victim of the dangers associated with the business. In November 2011, a law suit was filed against the company with regard to the Depakote drug, which is viewed to have caused various side effects. In February, the drug was in the mix again as yet a new law suit was filed with relation to its effects on human consumption. The pharmaceuticals industry is quite a lucrative one in the U.S as you will learn through several press releases from various news media. Some claim that sales are recorded to the tune of $300 billion annually, a figure that should entice investors to buy Abbott stock.An Analytical Overview of AbbottAbbott's forward annual dividend yield is rated at 3.40% as reported in the last financial year results with a forward annual dividend rate of $2.04 per share. The dividend yield is not the highest in the industry but the dividend rate is very impressive as it is way above the rest in the industry. This means that the stock is fairly priced and therefore less prone to speculation. Close competitors such as Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) had a dividend yield of 4.40% and 3.60% with dividend rate of $1.68 and $2.28 per share, respectively. Sanofi, (NASDAQ:SNY), another competitor, had a forward annual dividend yield of 4.90%, the highest reported in this industry, and a forward annual dividend rate of $1.76 per share. The various dividend rates are a subject of a certain level of payout from the reported earnings per share. Merck has the highest payout ratio of 77% while my focus stock Abbott pays at a payout ratio of 62%. Johnson & Johnson on the other hand pays at a ratio of 64% while Sanofi is the lowest at only 48%. This gives you a clear picture of how much I should expect upon prospecting the future earnings per share.Abbott is one of the few companies with a consistent payment of dividends. I cannot perceive a single period the company failed to pay dividends over the last couple of decades. To make matters even more interesting, the company has been paying the dividends on a certain incremental sequence almost unbeatable given the turbulent business environment that includes challenges as the ones it is currently facing. This should give the investors the confidence that even despite the current law suits, dividends are guaranteed and so are capital gains in the long run. The growth in dividend suggests a growth in the company as a whole and this should trickle down to growth in your return on the stock.Many companies more than often struggle to run at the optimal cost of capital.

While it is not good to focus on the negative aspects only, it is good for precautionary purposes. A lot has been said about Abbott in recent past and toward the close of 2011. The cases to do with drug side effects made the headlines late last year the same came to light again in February, something that could deter some investors from purchasing the stock or lead to panic selling. But as I have always emphasized, law suits are always contingent liabilities until the final ruling and even after this, the risk of any material direct financial loss is never automatic.Nevertheless, it is always good to also look at the positives toward a stock in order to make the right judgment and Abbott has plenty of those in relation to recent news and events. The signing of the deal with Galapagos to for development of an oral next generation inhibitor after which the drug becomes ready for sale and distribution on the market should be a real catalyst for you to own the stock. In addition to this the pharmaceuticals industry recently won the long-fought battle that ended up with FDA allowing Pharmaceuticals companies to continue study on painkillers to enable them to try and test different alternatives.My Recommendation on AbbottI recommend buying Abbott now. Some people will advise you to short the stock, while others will opt against any involvement with Abbott. However, a stock that boasts strong fundamentals like Abbott will do well going forward.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
570441,29491,2012-05-08T14:56:24-04:00,,"Abbott (NYSE:ABT) is one of the movers and shakers in America's mainstream drug manufacturing industry. Nested on a market cap of $97 billion, it is submerged in highly competitive waters. It has to compete with aggressive competitors like Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) and Merck (NYSE:MRK). The latter, however, forms the inner circle of core competitors and extends more threat. Its $119 billion market cap gives it the financial edge over a smaller Abbott. All the same, there is one key competitor forever lurking in the shadows. This is the competitor that arguably dominates the space: Roche Holding (OTCQX:RHHBF). Its $155 billion market cap gleans $10 in net income. This incredibly solid financial footing gives it the leverage to widen the gap and maintain top position.I believe, however, that Abbott (being the weakest financially) is the stock to buy. The critical outlook is that my standpoint is biased and lacks reasonable footing. In as much as this viewpoint bears a shred of logical sense, it tends to lean on one side: financial capabilities. I do acknowledge that most of Abbott's competitors exhibit favorable financial qualities; nonetheless, Abbott parades its ability to grow. This is clearly evident in its 4.6% quarterly revenue growth - coming second to none except Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY), which enjoys an unmatched 9.1%. All in all, my inclination toward Abbott is primarily centered on the fact that it extends the highest earnings per share ($3.24) among its peers.News on Abbott's split strategy has gone viral and almost every investment website on the internet is rambling about the split. Although the news came in late last year, October to be precise, it seems as if its reeling effects are already starting to kick in. According to James Shell, the author of the blog, the split reflects the management's dissatisfaction with regards to the stock price. He goes on to state that the management feels that the stock price fails to highlight the true value of Abbott. Shell further accents that two separate units will be able to secure individual nesting in the market space and bring in better profits. In my opinion, I believe that Shell's standpoint is but a representation of the general outlook. Investors are bullish about the split strategy. Late last year, Chief executive officer Miles White commented that the two units would pass out a clearer message for investors. With a split and spin-off, the stakes are higher as each unit will have the drive to pursue its primary goals.The $11.9 billion that Nestle (OTCPK:NSRGY) forked out in the Pfizer deal has also been making rounds in the headlines. This high priority deal ultimately developed into a run down between Nestle and Danone (DANOY. PK). In a last ditch attempt, Nestle raised its bid and managed to beat Danone's $11 billion. The effect of this news has been felt throughout the industry as both big wigs are expected to swell. Investors on the other hand are welling with prospects. Pfizer, which apparently happens to be the world's biggest drug maker, has caught the attention of many investors. By adding $12 billion into its portfolio, it has fortified confidence levels in shareholders and prospective investors. To further cement the high confidence levels, it has revealed its plans to drive the money into share buybacks. In my opinion this move is tactful and strategic. Similarly, the deal has shifted attention from smaller competitors like Abbott. In as much as this sounds ironical, the shifted attention involuntarily acts in the best interests of Abbott. Why is this so? Abbott needs the peace of mind to effectively make a breakthrough in its split strategy. Attention is sometimes known to stir up controversy and unnecessary hype. Such distractions can deter progress and generate a lot of confusion within. My bet is that Abbott is doubling its efforts at such a time when most of the attention has shifted to Nestle and Pfizer.Abbott is a good choice for a long-term investor with an eye for success. Given its financial powerhouse, it is an over performer. Similarly, its fundamentals are impressive and domineering.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
550531,24610,2012-05-02T08:52:05-04:00,,"When talking about the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the few big names that will always attract a lot of attention. Abbott is one of the largest manufacturers of pharmaceutical products, and is one of the most popular stock options available in the market. But why is this so? The basic reason for its popularity stems from the manner in which the stock has grown over the years. Revenues and profits have increased over time, and the stock has offered steady earnings and returns for its investors.Abbott has managed to maintain its wide competitive moat in the pharmaceutical industry with the introduction of new innovative products and the establishment of new strategic alliances. The company has recently announced the development of a range of new products under the EAS Sports Nutrition Brand. These new drugs will enhance the post-workout recovery of athletes, increasing overall muscle efficiency and allowing them to meet their fitness goals more effectively.Furthermore, in collaboration with Eisai, Abbott Japan has recently cleared the preconditions that were necessary to acquire the approval of Humira, a completely human Anti-TNF-Alpha Monoclonal Antibody. This is a significant positive development for Abbott as it will allow the company to strengthen its position in integrative neuroscience and neurological and psychiatric medicines.Abbott has also broadened its alliance with St. Jude Medical (NYSE:STJ) for the development of a new range of cardiovascular products. The two companies have announced 'Choice Alliance', a multi-year joint initiative aimed at providing U.S. citizens access to a robust portfolio of interventional cardiology, cardiac rhythm management, electrophysiology and intravascular imaging and diagnostic technologies. This strategic move is a positive development that will surely help the company in strengthening its presence in U.S. markets.Another positive development that is expected to help the stock in its upward run is the recent clearance that Abbott received from the FDA. This gives the company the much-awaited go ahead to use its iFS Advanced Femtosecond Laser in order to facilitate the creation of bow-shaped or curved arcuate incisions in corneal surgeries. Although Abbott already has a comprehensive portfolio of cataract, refractive and eye care products, the recent clearance should help the company in widening its competitive moat in the pharmaceutical industry.Abbott also has a range of important research projects in the pipeline that are sure to give the company a strategic advantage if they are successful. One of the most important projects among these is the ""Pilot"" project which iterates Abbott's commitment and aggressive resolve in pursuing a breakthrough in the treatment of Hepatitis C. Abbott has reported positive data from Phase 2 of its ""Pilot"" study and the possible success of this research could redefine Abbott's position in the global pharmaceutical industry.Another significant breakthrough for Abbott is the positive result of phase 3 of investigational treatment for advanced Parkinson's disease. Abbott's Neuroscience and Pain Research Division is conducting innovative research in neuroscience. The department is developing compounds that can target neuroreceptors, the regulators of neurological functions. The final results of these studies could pave the way for exponential growth in market share and could subsequently grant the stock the impetus to boost revenues.Abbott is a massive stock with a market capitalization of more than $97 billion, and trading volume of nearly 7.5 million. In the first fiscal quarter of 2012, the stock has reported a staggering rise in profit of 44% year-on-year, which has largely been the result of strong drug sales. Looking at the stock's financial performance in the current year, I believe that Abbott is poised for higher revenues and greater cash flows in the current financial year.Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is one of the largest direct competitors of Abbott and has grown exponentially over the years, establishing a strong reputation in the global pharmaceutical market. However, the stock is currently facing an array of problems that have impeded its upward growth in the market. The biggest problem among these is the lawsuit filed against the company over an antipsychotic drug called Risperdal. Legal problems and lawsuits seldom go well with investors who are inclined to believe that the indicted business is involved in unethical and immoral behavior. As a result, the stock's performance has recorded a noticeable slowdown in the last few days and this strongly reflects weak investor sentiment for the stock. Potential investors as well as existing stockholders eagerly await to see how the stock responds to these legal challenges. Recently, Abbott has reported a much impressive performance and I believe that it is a safer and profitable investment option under the current circumstances.Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) is another global pharmaceutical business that is considered by many investors as an alternative investment option against Abbott. It is true that the company has grown steadily over the years, catering to an international market with a diversified product portfolio. However, a series of recent legal pitfalls have encouraged investors to believe that the stock will inevitably undergo a radical revision in the current financial year that will set it much lower than its current position.Eli Lily (NYSE:LLY) is a good alternative for investors considering the best investment options in the industry. The stock has managed to stage a strong recovery amidst predominantly favorable market conditions and strong investor sentiment. Leading financial highlights for the current fiscal quarter suggest that the stock is strong and is poised for growth.However, the fact that Abbott offers greater returns on investment simply cannot be sidelined. Therefore, I believe that Abbott is still the best option right now because it has much more to offer than any of its competitors. Investors should hold this stock for higher earnings and returns, while those considering it should jump in as this is the perfect opportunity to maximize returns on investment. The stock is showing strong signs of growth and the company is generating higher revenues. Compared to its industry as a whole, I believe Abbott is the safest and most viable investment option.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
544061,23704,2012-04-30T19:23:57-04:00,,"I was asked by one of my followers to take a look at the imminent split of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) a highly respected $68B Pharmaceutical company.To summarize, the company has recently announced that it will split into two parts, of roughly equal revenues. The details of the split, including the exact detail on what the ABT shareholders can expect to get out of the deal are still forthcoming. The announcement was made last October, and is discussed in some detail in ABT's 2011 Annual Report.This kind of split happens fairly routinely, and it is always for the same reason: The management feels that the stock price does not reflect the value of the company, and by splitting the company into more than one part, each part can find its own level in the marketplace based on its earnings, growth, and strategic mix.Here is a stock screener of very elite companies in the Pharmaceutical industry: Market capitalization of over $10B and Operating Margin of greater than 20%, which means these companies are big, and participate in non-commodity markets.You can see what Abbott's management is thinking: You feel that your stock should be worth just as much as Bristol Myers-Squibb at 16.9 times this year's earnings, or at the very least as much as the average in this group, 13.6 times earnings.So, from their point of view, the value of ABT in the marketplace should be at least 10% higher than it currently is, if not considerably higher.So the project of the day is to try to figure out what the pieces of ABT are worth, based on limited information.The most useful source of information is the table on Page 52 of the ABT annual report, which gives the segment sales and growth rates for the past three years. We also have a little operating income data which allows us to understand a little about segment profitability on Page 40.Click to enlarge.A good summary of the split was presented at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in January. A ""Research-Based Pharmaceutical"" company will be spun off, and renamed AbbVie. This will include a line of proprietary drugs, anchored by the product Humira, sales of which are growing at a rate in excess of 20% per year, and also a portfolio of new drugs which are now in the R&D pipeline.Here is a summary of the businesses by segment:The ""Proprietary Pharmaceutical"" business, renamed AbbVie, should be an extremely attractive company. Here you have a $17B company, with a 40% profit margin, growing in excess of 11% per year.Here is some detail of the potential product line of AbbVie, which shows that most of the growth in this business between 2010 and 2011 was outside the US:One of the details that we are missing is the allocation of R and D expense between the two companies, as well as the substantial Sales, General and Administrative expense. We do not know exactly how much of this 40% operating margin will make it to the bottom line.If you do a stock screener for $17B Pharmaceutical companies with greater than 40% operating margin, and 11% 2010-2011 revenue growth, you get zero results: The spun-off AbbVie will be the leader in the industry.In the absence of better data, I am using Price/Sales ratio as a way to get an idea of the value of AbbVie. The danger in this is that no two companies' product lines are exactly alike, the product development processes, markets, liability issues, and everything else may be completely different. The price/sales ratio also is a measurement of how the stock prices of the companies are regarded in the marketplace, and also may be different.However, if you are the management of AbbVie, you have to be confident that you are at least as proficient as your rivals in the marketplace BristolMyersSquibb and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), both of which are trading at slightly higher Price to Sales ratios than ABT right now. On the high end, the management may aspire to be as good as Allergan (NYSE:ALG) which is a $5B leader in the field of making people beautiful, with products such as botox, lap bands, and various implantables, with a 20:1 PE and a Price to Sales of 5.41.The current ABT is selling at 2.46 times sales. Valuing them at BMY's price/sales of 2.66, or JNJ's price/sales of 2.76 give a value for just the AbbVie portion of ABT of the low-to-mid $50B's and using Allergan's industry leading 5.43 times sales, considerably higher.The remaining business, which will retain the Abbott name, will consist of the ""established pharmaceuticals,"" which do not require the same level of nurturing, and are stronger internationally. The Nutrition business is anchored by the company's two brands Similac and Ensure. These products are basically food items, are not complicated from a product development standpoint, and have some direct competitors. This segment has the lowest margin, but is the fastest growing internationally. There are two specialty businesses, ""Diagnostics"", featuring a line of products in the laser eye surgery industry. and ""Vascular"" which includes the company's stent products. Both of these products are mainly focused on US markets, are more slowly growing, and are in the middle as far as operating margin is concerned.Here is some detail on the Established Pharmaceuticals.You can further see the rationale in splitting the Proprietary segment off from the rest of the company based on the operating margins, per the table on Page 40. These products, which have been around for awhile, are growing at 20% per year.We should be able to conservatively deduce the market cap of the ABT part of the ""Established Pharmaceuticals"" business by the same method.Adding the ""proprietary"" to the ""established"" hypothetical market capitalization gives a market capitalization low $70B range.We do not have to use guesswork to estimate the value of the nutrition business. Recently there was a transaction in which Pfizer's nutrition business was sold to Nestle. Nestle paid $12B for a business with $2.5B in sales, a price to sales ratio of 4.8.Here is ABT's current segment sales data:Allowing for similar 2012-2013 growth, and making the assumption that the value of this business can be extrapolated from the Nestle transaction, you get a potential market capitalization for this piece of over $31B. Plus there is some additional opportunity for low-cost overseas manufacturing and additional growth in developing nations.So, adding the $50-55B ""Proprietary business,"" the $17-20B ""Established"" business, and the $31B ""Nutrition"" business gives roughly $100B which is the current market capitalization. The remaining two businesses are essentially valued at ""zero"" in the eyes of the market.There is a par company for ABT's vascular segment. Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) is a $36B market cap company with revenues of $16B selling similar vascular products, with a price/sales ratio of 2.34.A stock screen of 23 companies in the ""Medical Equipment"" sector of greater than $1B market capitalization gave an average price/sales ratio of 2.5So to summarize: The sum of the individual parts of ABT as it currently stands, given a reasonable growth assumption, and given similar price/sales ratios of comparable companies in each segment is as follows:In the low case, we're looking at a 12-15% upside, in the high case, we're looking at a nearly doubling of the current stock price. These results are consistent with the ones we did above using comparable market PE ratios.Needless to say, everywhere there is an ""if"", ""Estimate"", or other assumption above, there is a chance for error. The managers of ABT have the added benefit of knowing the cost structure and more importantly, the allocation of debt, overhead, R&D expense and other factors across these segments, so their numbers will be considerably different, and in some cases may be much better.Also we do not know exactly how the shares of the new company will be distributed among the existing ABT shareholders. We will have to review our calculations in light of new information as it arises.But, you have to say on the surface of it, we have an already well respected company at the very top of their industry, engaged in growing and highly profitable markets, and with an opportunity to capture additional value by splitting strategically. There is an opportunity for an investor if he or she wishes to take it.Naturally our information is incomplete. We will have to get a more detailed picture later.The world is full of chaos, and there are no guarantees on anything.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

One half will be a diversified medical products company, while the other will be a research-based pharmaceutical companies. Are the two halves worth more than the whole to investors? And if you buy the company, what is the strategy after the division? Do you keep one half and sell the other?When a company spins off one of its parts, it is sometimes to capture a perceived market value in the spin-out that was not being realized when it was part of the whole, for example, when some pearl of a high-tech company is locked into a stodgy oyster of a consumer products company. Other times, it is because management has decided that one part of the company no longer fits into the company's overall strategic direction. Or maybe it's because one half of the management can't get along with the other. In the case of Abbott, the reason for the schism is not all that clear, but it is going be a pretty even split. One of the two will be a diversified medical products company that will keep the Abbott name and about $22 in annual revenue ,and the other will be $18 billion pharmaceutical business, to be called Abbvie. Hopefully the company will think of a better name before the final separation.The split will take place via a tax-free distribution to Abbott shareholders of publicly-tradable stock in the new company. The combined dividends of the two companies will approximate the dividend (over 3%) currently paid by Abbott.Abbott LabsAbbott Labs, the medical products company, will keep the nutritional products, the vascular products business, the laboratory diagnostic products, the diabetes and vision care products, and the branded generics pharmaceuticals outside the U.S. The company will have about 40% of its sales in emerging markets.The branded generics business is included under the Established Pharmaceuticals division, and includes drugs like the seasonal flu vaccine Influvac, a hypothyroid treatment called Synthroid, cholesterol drugS Lypanthyl and Tricor, and Teveten, for hypertension.The diagnostic division includes an instrument that extracts DNA and RNA and tests for viruses, like HIV and the various hepatitis viruses. It also includes various assay systems used in diagnostic blood tests.Nutritional products includes well-known brands like Similac formulas for infants, Ensure for adults, and products used for enteral feeding in hospitals.The vascular products vision includes stents and vascular scaffolds, sold under brand names like Xience, Acculink, and Absorb. Competitors include companies like Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX), Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), and St. Jude Medical (NYSE:STJ).AbbvieAbbvie, the pharmaceutical business, will have the high profile drugs like Humira, Kaletra, Lupron, Synagis, Androgel and others, along with a substantial pipeline of drugs in development, of which 20 are in Phase II or Phase III trials. Humira is used to treat auto-immune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and psoriasis. Kaletra is a protease inhibitor used to treat HIV infection. Lupron is a palliative treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Synagis is a treatment for respiratory syncytial virus, which usually infects newborns. Androgel is a treatment used to treat low testosterone.Humira is the largest selling product with sales of $1.9 billion in the last quarter alone, with sales growth of 17.4% from the year ago quarter. Fenofibrate, sold as Trilipix and Tricor, is the next biggest product, with sales of $329 million, but sales have fallen by 11%, year over year. Androgel is the newest high flyer, with ""low-T"" being the latest over-hyped bugaboo to bedevil aging baby boomers. Sales of Androgel are up 24%.Abbvie's major drug, Humira is a monoclonal antibody to an inflammatory cytokine called tumor necrosis factor. Similar, competitive drugs are Remicade and Symponi, marketed by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Cimzia, developed and sold by UCB SA (OTCPK:UCBJF), a Belgian pharmaceutical company. In the future, all of these expensive protein drugs will face competition from small molecule inhibitors of TNF. For instance, 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine, which is actually a recreational psychedelic drug, has TNF inhibitory activity at doses an order of magnitude below its activity as a hallucinogen.Does the break-up make sense?The pharmaceutical business is high risk and high reward. Corporate evolution is punctuated by FDA approvals and patent expirations, which have large and fairly immediate effects on revenues and stock prices. Large companies, like Johnson & Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) are able to spread out the risk over time by having large pipelines and by having the financial wherewithal to buy out an occasional biotech. They also have stable consumer products divisions that smooth out revenues over time. With $18 billion in revenue, Abbvie will be a medium sized pharmaceutical company on revenues, but 40% of that comes from one drug, Humira, which has lots of competition, plus the patent will expire in 2016.The medical products company, Abbott, will have a mixture of businesses that are rather stable, like infant formula, and businesses that share some of the properties of proprietary pharmaceuticals. Drug eluting stents, for example, require clinical trials and approval before they can be sold to the public.When one company acquires another, the management touts synergies that are supposed to arise from the combination. Generally this means that redundant employees will be laid off. You only need one accounting department, one IT department, etc. When a company splits in two, it follows that there are dis-synergies from the breakup. There will be some unrecoverable expenses. Some will be one-off charges, but some will be ongoing.Frankly, the break-up does not make sense to me. The two halves work well together. For instance, this year's blockbuster will be a branded generic at some time in the future. But branded generics will be the province of Abbott, not Abbvie. On the other hand, a drug-eluting stent, sold by Abbott, usually requires a proprietary drug, which could come from Abbvie.Most analysts rate the company as a hold. The company's stock price has increased about 20% since the break-up was announced, so maybe the market is applauding the idea. I say take the money and run. I would sell the company now.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
532591,28411,2012-04-26T15:35:51-04:00,,"Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) plans to split into two companies by the end of 2012. There will be the proprietary pharmaceutical business with $17.4 billion in annual revenue and the other businesses of nutritional products, diagnostics established pharmaceuticals, medical devices (vascular care, diabetes care, medical optics and animal health) with $21.5 billion of annual revenue. The revenue figures are for the year-ended December 31, 2011. The nutritionals business had 2011 revenue of approximately $6 billion. This business was buried within the $38.8 billion company and only represented 15% of revenue and 7.2% of operating profit. If the separation had occurred in 2011, the nutritionals business would have represented 28% of revenue and 21% of operating profit in the new company. This is based on the segment reporting information in the  company's 2011 annual report (see link). In other words, the nutritional business is a much larger piece of the pie when one eliminates the proprietary pharmaceutical business.The nutritional business consists of pediatric and adult nutritional products, which are sold throughout the world. The infant formula brands include Similac and the adult brands include Ensure. Pediatric nutritional sales as disclosed in the 10-K were $3.2 billion in 2011 and include more than $1.9 billion of international sales. The international business more than doubled since 2006 when sales were $0.9 million. The company does not disclose operating profit for the pediatric nutritional business, but the overall nutritionals division had operating margins of 13.3% in 2011, which have been trending lower in recent years from as high as 28% in 2006. The margin declined to 19.5% in 2007 and has steadily declined to 13.3% in 2011. This includes the adult nutritional business, therefore, it is not possible to determine the exact margin of the pediatric nutrition business.Abbott's nutritional business is currently hidden inside a medical conglomerate with a market capitalization of $96 billion. Investors can assess the value of this business by reviewing Mead Johnson Nutrition which is a publicly traded pediatric nutrition company. Investors can also review the recent sale of Pfizer's pediatric nutrition business to Nestle. These businesses are comparable in size to Abbott's pediatric business, however, they don't have the added bonus of the adult product lines.Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) announced the divestiture of its nutrition business this week to Nestle (OTCPK:NSRGY) for $11.85 billion (see press release). This business represents a full line of infant and toddler nutritional products as well as formula for infants with special nutritional needs. The division had 2011 revenue of $2.1 billion which was entirely derived from outside the United States. Operating profit was not separately stated in the Company's 10-K filing. Bloomberg quoted the purchase price at 19.8 times 2012 EBITDA (Bloomberg article). The same article also noted that the business derives 85% of revenue from emerging markets. The Nestle purchase price equates to approximately 4.95 times revenue.Mead Johnson Nutrition (NYSE:MJN) had revenue of $3.7 billion in 2011 with an operating profit of $0.8 billion (operating margin of 21%). The business is mostly international with $2.4 billion in 2011 revenue or 65% of the total. The company had a market capitalization of approximately $16.9 billion on April 25, 2012. This is 7% less than 4.95 times revenue which is consistent with the valuation of the Pfizer transaction described above.If one were to value Abbott's pediatric business at 4 times revenue, it would be worth approximately $12.8 billion. The adult business with revenue of $2.8 billion would also add value to the transaction and likely push the total nutritional business north of $15 billion. This would include a nutritional business with excellent emerging market growth prospects and a solid profile for adult nutritionals given the aging population of developed markets. I used a lower revenue multiple than Pfizer and Mead Johnson due to the apparently lower operating margin of Abbott's division. As mentioned before, it is not possible to determine the pediatric nutritional margin given the fact that the division also includes adult nutritional products. I am assuming that the adult business has a lower profit margin than the pediatric business. Of course, investors will need to scrutinize the margin deterioration for Abbott nutritionals during the past several years. This will likely be more apparent once financials become available for the new company.While the nutritional business may get lost within the company's current portfolio of businesses, it will have an opportunity to shine after the split. A $1.9 billion international pediatric business that doubled in the past 6 years may get much more respect in a $21.5 billion company than a $38.8 billion company. Of course, investors must also analyze the other divisions within the new Abbott (non-proprietary pharmaceuticals).Disclosure: I am long ABT.Disclaimer: This article provides opinions and information, but does not contain recommendations or personal investment advice to any specific person for any particular purpose.

602151,29611,2012-05-19T13:06:39-04:00,,"Background: I bought my first shares of Abbott (NYSE:ABT) on April 13, 2010 at $52.44/share. As of Friday's close the total return of ABT thus far has beaten the S&P Total Return Index, 26.5% to 13.02%. I added to my ABT holding once, on weakness, at $47.93/share on January 3, 2011, as my analysis at the time showed it was more than 20% undervalued. That portion of the investment has even more thoroughly trounced the S&P Total Return Index, thus far, returning a total return of 35.9% to 4.86%. This is primarily because in October 2011 Abbott announced it would spin off its pharmaceutical business, which investors (or more accurately, given their entry timing, speculators) appear to have cheered. This new company will be called AbbVie.The question now is, what is ABT/AbbVie worth, and what are its business prospects? My conclusions are 1) Humira is the key to valuing ABT/AbbVie; 2) the combined company is still cheap, but not as it was in 2011 when I added; 3) AbbVie is likely to get dumped post spin-off, and may prove a truly compelling buy at that time.It's All About Humira: In 2011 Humira generated over 20% of ABT's total revenues. If you look at the pharmaceutical company, AbbVie, which ABT is about to spin off, Humira will easily be over 40% of AbbVie's total revenues. And after the spin-off, Humira will constitute 80% of the profits of AbbVie. Thus, the patent expiration of Humira is the single most important thing that any investor in ABT or in AbbVie needs to think about. (That and what will replace it!) As you can see here and here, the Humira patent expires in December 2016. Four and a half years, ladies and gentlemen. I submit to you that is not a lot of time.Valuation Analysis: I focus on Humira above because it feeds into the valuation analysis. As hard as discounted free cash flow analysis is for any stock, and as prone to exaggeration and misinterpretation and risky assumptions, I think that is even more true with regard to a pharmaceutical company. There is a gambling aspect to saying whether a company can replace drugs or devices that go off patent. Nonetheless, let us see where the analysis leads us.I use a 10% discount rate for ABT/AbbVie, which is my best calculation of its WACC, after consulting Morningstar's report, Wikiwealth, and Dr. Google. But mainly I have considered Morningstar, though notably Morningstar uses a lower WACC of 9.3%, which would raise ABT's valuation. (For some reason, my calculated WACCs are always higher than Morningstar's, and until I figure out why that is, I prefer to err on the side of being conservative.)Looking at the recent past, ABT has actually experienced very significant (for a company its size) free cash flow growth in the last nine years -- on the order of 11.59% annualized, with most of this growth coming in the last five years to boot! Sadly, you cannot, as a conservative analyst, credit ABT/AbbVie with this kind of growth going forward, because the growth is in large part Humira-derived, and the non-pharmaceutical components of the legacy ABT business have not been growing nearly as quickly. Accordingly, I set my annualized growth assumption at a much lower rate for the next ten years, of 4%. This is intended to be a blend incorporating 10%+ annualized growth through 2016, followed by assumed stagnation and perhaps even some annualized free cash flow diminution as Humira is lost. Incorporated in this assumption is another one: that the two separated companies will grow at about the same cumulative rate as ABT would have grown as one company. (I think that's a fair assumption: see my ""Random Thoughts"" section below.) The only thing that will change is investor perception.Using these assumptions, I derive a value per share of a bit more than $69.50. As of this writing, that means the stock is more than 11% undervalued. That is not quite enough tempt me into adding at this time. I would like to see the price at approximately $55.50/share before I add any more, in order to derive my 20% margin of safety.Random Thoughts on M&A and Spin-offs:Let me just say I am not an ardent fan of mergers & acquisitions, and likewise I am not a fan of most divestitures and spin-offs. There is no inconsistency in those positions. Both are based in the idea that I like to see a company with strong organic growth, where management does not pay much attention at all to the stock price, figuring the market will take care of that eventually if management does its job. M&A is typically the strategy of a company that lacks sufficient internal growth opportunities, and it often results in overpayment for earnings streams, and what Peter Lynch famously called ""diworsification."" (Though note that ABT acquired Humira in an acquisition ... .)Spin-offs, by contrast, are virtually always a strategy designed to ""unlock value,"" and seeking to ""unlock value"" in this manner is a really good sign of a management that is paying altogether too much attention to stock price! Execute, people, and let the market eventually figure out how awesome or crappy you are. This spin-off is no exception, and page 3 of the 2011 annual report explicitly states this is the primary rationale for the split, along with a supposed divergence in the priorities and regulatory structures of the businesses (as if that hasn't always been the case!). Don't buy that bologna, this split-up is about quickly ""unlocking"" a bunch of shareholder value.Warren Buffett on page 9 of the 2011 Berkshire annual report explained why a long-term investor should welcome years of a languishing stock price, as long as the company buys back tons of shares. (Notably, Abbott has not had a share repurchase program running over the past five years, though it wisely repurchased some in 2009.) Buffett even goes through the math. I highly recommend his letter, as I recommend all of his letters.But, c'est la vie. I am terribly not pessimistic about this split because I agree the branded pharmaceutical business has nothing inherently to do with the other businesses. There is no logical reason why they need to be together, they aren't even in most cases sold through the same sales channels. They only reason they have all been under one roof in the past is because of prior empire-building and attempts to diversify. So while I don't think this spin-off will add anything substantive, I don't see it taking away much either.AbbVie is the Most Likely Source of Opportunity: I think the spin-off is about one thing: Humira. The importance of that drug to this company likely already has investors worrying about what happens when it starts to fade away in 2016. Thus, one can expect shareholders to dump AbbVie shares after they are spun-off, and to cling to their Old ABT shares.I am hopeful that enough people will jettison AbbVie to create a stronger buying opportunity there. Though Humira will go off-patent in 2016, it will likely lose sales more slowly than normal drugs because it is a harder-to-make biologic. And moreover, every stock has its price. I think the likelihood of ""undershoot"" when shareholders dump AbbVie is high. This would likely be a short-term opportunity. I, like most investors, think the medical devices/generics/nutritional company is a better long-term hold. Other things to watch for: 1) how the split allocates Old ABT's debt; and 2) what sorts of management incentives management takes with regard to each separate company. These decisions may provide important clues to discerning investors.Disclosure: I am long ABT.Additional disclosure: I have owned shares of ABT since Spring 2010 and I added in January 2011.  I have no plans to sell or add to my positions at this time."
518461,25953,2012-04-23T12:49:15-04:00,,"When a company like Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) frequently makes the news, it is not necessarily a good thing. Breakthrough pharmaceuticals take a long time to develop, so it is not uncommon to have long periods without any news. Abbott Laboratories is not in this rut currently, as it is making a lot of news thanks to a streak of breakthrough developments. This should be welcomed news for both investors and patients alike.First and foremost, Abbott Laboratories just unveiled the results of a trial evaluating a treatment in development for advanced Parkinson's disease and the results were positive. This drug lowers the ""off"" time of those suffering from Parkinson's, which means that they experience fewer periods of poor mobility, slowness and stiffness. This is a great breakthrough for those who suffer from Parkinson's and it will solidify Abbott's spot among the pharmaceutical elite. Expect its stock price to respond accordingly.In fact, its stock price is about $1 higher since the news of this trial broke, now hovering around $60. Being that the news broke very recently, I doubt that we have seen the total effect of this trial and announcement. I expect more information to come on in the upcoming weeks, and if the news is positive, stock holders will notice the difference.I'm happy to say there is more good news, as recently Abbott also announced it received approval for its coronary artery disease drug XIENCE PRIME in Japan. With this approval, XIENCE PRIME is now available in all major international markets. In essence, this drug is part of one of the thinnest stent systems that will make vessels stronger. It is a step forward in treating coronary artery disease.Once more it is good to report a breakthrough that will help both patients and investors. With the inclusion in the Japanese market, XIENCE PRIME is now a worldwide treatment. An increase in adoption of this new drug can only strengthen Abbott's position in the market.But Abbott has had an even busier month, and perhaps the most important news is the breakthrough new Hepatitis-C treatment. This drug is so much more effective than those of its competitors that after Abbott announced the reports, each competitor's stock price dropped at least 1% with Idenix Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:IDIX) being the worst loser, dropping over 14%. As if this were not enough, this highly effective treatment is one of two highly effective Hepatitis-C treatments currently in development by Abbott.I believe that Abbott is a smart long term investment. Its first quarter profits beat estimates and it has now raised its forecast for 2012 earnings. This is without either the Hepatitis-C drugs or the Parkinson's treatment on the market. Adding these treatments to its business will strengthen the growth trajectory that Abbott is currently on.Of course, being part of the pharmaceutical industry means Abbott is subject to a lot of criticism and bad press, some of which is deserved. One of the biggest threats to Abbott Laboratories is Abbott itself. There is talk about tweaking FDA rules to prevent anti-competitive behavior by pharmaceutical companies. Notably, Abbott repeatedly tweaked its drug formulas so no competitors would be able to enter the market, and if any did, Abbott could sue for patent infringement. These acts cost the United States health care system huge amounts of money. Congress was not happy, to say the least.Also, the pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated, and there is talk of more regulation. The FDA is considering forcing pharmaceutical companies to develop diagnostics for drugs which would indicate exactly who could benefit from taking them. This would benefit patients greatly, as they would not have to waste their time and body on a drug that has very little chance of affecting them.However, diagnostics are very costly to develop. If Abbott is forced to develop these diagnostic tests, you can expect its bottom line to be hurt. Drugs already take a long time to develop and test before being allowed on the market. Adding more diagnostics would bring this already slow process to a crawl. Luckily for Abbott, there will a tremendous amount of discussion before a regulation this size would be implemented.Of course, these regulations would affect Abbott's competitors as well. And the sunken costs that diagnostics would bring on would hurt struggling companies more than profiting ones. Competitors like Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), a company closer to the brink of collapse, would have a harder time coughing up the extra capital than Abbott.On the other end of the performance spectrum we have Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). Recently, analysts lowered Pfizer's earning per share estimates and downgraded its stock. It's easy to see why. Pfizer was just hit with news regarding the wrongdoing of a bankrupt company it acquired. This company is being sued due to asbestos, and Pfizer recently learned that it is not shielded from all asbestos claims brought the former company. These claims could go as high as $4.45 billion dollars. I expect this case will take a toll on Pfizer's reputation. I would be very surprised if Pfizer's investors don't start fleeing once this case gets fully underway. Conversely, watch for Pfizer to make a big move to counteract this case.Another competitor, GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) is somewhere between Pfizer and Abbott. So in between, in fact, that there is not much I can even say about GlaxoSmithKline. I think investors agree, as its stock price has been very erratic of the post three to four months. It is currently trading at about $46. Other than signing a strategic drug discovery alliance with biotech company Five Prime Therapeutics, GlaxoSmithKline is nonexistent. I would be very cautious about buying its stock, especially since other pharmaceutical companies like Abbott are churning out relevant new drugs at a breakneck pace.Abbott may have found itself a high road to success already in 2012. My advice is to jump on board and enjoy the ride.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
527171,29491,2012-04-25T13:02:12-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) is the world's largest company in the nutrition products market and the second largest in the field of diagnostic products. The company has a worldwide customer base, because it not only sells nutritional products but also medical equipment and pharmaceutical supplies. 56.6% of Abbott Laboratories' entire revenue is generated by its pharmaceutical sector.In 2010, Abbott Laboratories generated about $34 billion in revenue and has shown remarkable growth in the financial sector. Its laboratories operate in more than 130 countries. Abbott Laboratories has completely eclipsed its competitors with a market capitalization of $97 billion and a trading volume of $7.5 million, while immunizing its business against false market forces.Since last week, the company trades its stock at around $61 and if we compare this price with recent figures, it shows that in the last year stock trading was at $48, and at the beginning of 2012 it traded at $56.As of last month, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Abbott's biggest competitor, has shown an increase of 0.42% in its stock and traded at $65. Abbott Laboratories is currently trading at $61. tJohnson & Johnson has a wide diversification in more than 170 countries. Since Johnson & Johnson is facing several legal situations, its reputation and dependable name are keeping it afloat in the market.Merck (MRK) which is the second biggest growing competitor of Abbott Laboratories, has traded its stock at $39, showing a 0.36% increase in its stock in the last three days. But, due to its patents expiring this year, it may face some troubles.Abbott has recently sued Watson Pharmaceuticals (WPI) for copying one of its leading products. It is not yet known who will suffer in this current situation, Abbott or Watson.Since January, some of its other competitors, like Pfizer (PFE) and Roche Holding Ltd. (OTCQX:RHHBY), have seen an increase from $21 to $23 and $42 to around $45, respectively. GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has also shown a good increase in stock from $39 to $46 over the last year, while AstraZeneca (AZN) has shown a decrease from $49 to around $45 in stock. This indicates that it's not an easy task competing in the medical market.Abbott Laboratories has recently announced a development of self-expanding stent, which has portrayed this company as one with humanitarian, rather than motivational, goals. This stent will be developed to minimize friction in helping patients suffering from peripheral artery disease. This disease not only affects the lower limbs and other body parts, but it can also leave a patient disabled permanently. This is one of the main reasons Abbott Laboratories continues to be a market leader worldwide. Abbott Laboratories has undertaken medical research with Merck to revolutionize cancer treatments. It has also collaborated with a genetics laboratory to develop a diagnostic test to identify the early stages of disease within bones and joints.By the look of its stock performance during the last three years, it is quite evident that the company will soon bear some fruitful results from decisions made in the past. Acquisition of Advanced Media Optics, STARLIMS and Solvay Pharmaceuticals has not only made its market position stronger than ever, but also given it a wide range of pharmaceutical products which allow it to drive toward the strong operating cash flows.By the end of the current year, this company will split its research-related business into a research-based company named Abbvie. The company is doing this to separate its medical products business from the research-based business to capitalize on growth. Abbott's medical device division manufactures blood analyzers and glucose reading devices for diabetics, and also produces PediaSure and Ensure, nutritional supplements for children and adults.The split in its businesses will do great work for the investors and shareholders, because when the company splits, the shareholders will receive shares in both of its medical products and research-based business. We are seeing a run on the stock these days. It is quite certain that these two new stocks will collectively be given a trade price which will be the same as that of single stock, and the old stock shareholders will receive shares in new stock too.Abbott Laboratories will work in two ways: the research based unit, Abbvie, will focus on its growth in the states by projecting at a rate of 3-4% a year and Abbott, on the other hand, will be focusing globally on its faster growth rate in the emerging medical devices market.It is certain that Abbott's major medical breakthroughs and humanitarian image have played an important role in making it a market leader. Abbott Laboratories has gained an impression as a dynamic company after its acquisitions in Europe and the Middle East. If it shows no signs of letting up its hold on the market in future and balances a pleasing and reassuring relationship between people and its shareholders, then there will not be any medical company in the world that can challenge its market leadership.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

In the Q4 earnings conference call, it said it was on track to separate into two health care companies by the end of 2012. Investors will look to hear for an update on the planned split. In the previous quarter, Abbott announced FDA approval for its Absolute Pro and its FreeStyle InsuLinx Blood monitoring system, while receiving approval in Japan for its Xience Prime drug eluting stent.

While there are still solid reasons for this split, recent clinical data releases may mean that investors should pause before making any quick assumptions on which half is going to be the ""better"" company.A Solid Quarter With Plenty Of Moving PartsAbbott reported about 5% revenue growth for the first quarter, or closer to 6% if currency impacts are neutralized. Growth was led by nutrition (up 10%) and diagnostics (up 6%), while pharma rose 5% and vascular declined 5%.Abbott also did fairly well on its margins, though necessary adjustments muddy the water a bit. Gross margin got a nice push with a better product and the benefits of ongoing efficiency efforts. That helped offset somewhat higher-than-expected SG&A and R&D expenses and led to a 13% improvement in adjusted operating income.Drugs Led By Surprising Strength In HumiraHumira sales dominated the scene once again, as sales rose 17%. Given the high single-digit prescription growth seen throughout the quarter, Abbott is clearly seeing some favorable pricing developments. The much smaller Tricor also did well (up 14%), while Kaletra sales declined 11%.Mixed Results OtherwiseAbbott's quarter was a little more muddled outside of the clearly strong Humira numbers. The nutritional business was strong with 10% revenue growth and the interest in Pfizer's (PFE) nutrition business (with Danone, Mead Johnson, and Nestle all reportedly showing solid interest and willing to pay over 4x trailing revenue) is a good reminder of the value of businesses in this market.Vascular was down 5%, though, as single-digit pricing declines hit drug-coated stent revenue. That's actual better than fears of double-digit pricing declines, but it's pretty clear that competition from newer stents from Boston Scientific (BSX) and Medtronic (MDT) is impacting the market. That said, revenue here was positive if you factor out the royalties that Boston Scientific used to be obligated to pay.Diagnostics was a mixed bag. Up 6% overall, the company showed good results in point-of-care and molecular diagnostics, easily beating Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) and Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) overall, though Roche did match them in MDx. Interestingly, Abbott's diabetes business was also down (as was Roche's), further highlighting just how strong Johnson & Johnson has become in that market.Are You Sure You Want To Part With Pharma?There are a lot of solid reasons for Abbott to continue with its plan to split the company (alas, there were no additional details with this quarter's report), including more focused management teams and more appropriate capital allocation processes. There's also the risks to the Humira franchise to consider, including the expiration of patents in 2016 and the possible introduction of oral competitors by Pfizer and AstraZeneca (AZN).That said, the Abbott drug business has been showing some flair of late. Not only is Humira quite strong, but this is an interesting pipeline. Abbott has two drugs in development for kidney disease that could be surprising winners and I still believe the Street is asleep as to the value of its drug Elagolix (partnered from Neurocrine Biosciences (NBIX).Better than all of this, though, may be the buzz that's building around Abbott's Hep C franchise. Recent data releases are only a tease of the full results, but the efficacy numbers look impressive and Abbott could be first into Phase 3 with an interferon-free regimen.While this is a multi-billion dollar opportunity, please do remember that the leader in this race changes almost daily - with Gilead (GILD), Bristol-Myers (BMY), and Boehringer all enjoying some time in the sunshine recently. Also keep in mind that Abbott's relative complex regimen may be a marketing /prescription obstacle.The Bottom LineI like the businesses at Abbott, but the interest in the stock has taken out some of the undervaluation. Nevertheless, if the company can ultimately replace Humira with new products like the Hep-C regimen, Elagolix, and other pipeline candidates and deliver between 5% and 6% cash flow growth, these shares could yet be undervalued by 20% or more.As that is about my margin of safety for a stock like this, Abbott is still a buy, although discriminating value shoppers may want to consider other names like Johnson & Johnson, Sanofi (SNY), Merck (MRK), and Stryker (SYK) as well.Disclosure: I am long OTCQX:RHHBY."
532021,25953,2012-04-26T14:31:01-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a key player in America's mainstream drug manufacturing industry. Its market space is, however, plagued by an unforgiving breed of competition. Belligerent competitors like Merck (NYSE:MRK), Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY), Biogen Idec (NASDAQ:BIIB) and Roche (OTCQX:RHHBF) are wedged in an unending battle for the biggest piece of pie.As an investor, I am drawn in by Abbott's swelling potential, solid fundamentals and unrivaled peculiarities. Although it is not a niche market leader, it exhibits the highest quarterly growth figures of 4%. This hammers down industry big wigs like Roche and Merck. The Former is cuddled on a record $607 billion, and there is some reasonable daylight between it and other players in the industry.Why am I inclined towards Abbott while competitors like Roche have a stronger financial backing and seemingly offer a better deal? Being a long-term investor, I am more focused on potential and growth. Abbott manages to integrate these two vital lineaments in a single bundle. On the flip side, supposedly bigger players are too predictable and pretty much stagnant.Marketing Controversies surround MerckMerck has been in the center of a heated legal debate over improper marketing techniques with regards to its Vioxx painkiller. This April, a federal judge in Boston passed a heavy sentence on Merck's unethical techniques, and the industry heavyweight was compelled to fork up $321 million as a criminal fine. Hopefully, this big amount will patch up the shreds that Vioxx created. This pain killer was stamped out of the market in 2004 after analysts linked it to stroke and heart attack. An adamant Merck, however, chose to carry on with marketing the drug.According to the legal report, Merck consciously gave misleading information about the drug's effect on the heart. Personally, I believe that these profound allegations greatly taint Merck's image. It shows that the behemoth is not willing to compete on a level ground --a display of fear and uncertainty. Such a demeanor will gnaw out confidence levels in shareholders and push away prospective investors.Depending on the degree of damage that this news will inflict on Merck, there is a growing possibility of its stock sailing into the dreaded oversold territory. For me, this possibility is drawing closer and closer, as many of its shareholders want to cut existing ties. If this foresight materializes, investors will look for entry points into better markets like Abbott.The drug manufacturing industry was literally rattled with excitement when Roche's imminent plans to acquire Illumina came to light early this year. This acquisition reportedly has an estimated $5.7 billion price tag and is part of Roche's bigger plan to establish a stronghold in the genetic solutions niche. Personally, I am pulled towards the edge of my seat as I am eager to know the complexities that this acquisition may attract.As it is, the ongoing deal is on the rocks, and Illumina is not willing to accept the $51 per share price. I think that this deal may work in the advantage of smaller players like Abbott. I know that critics may be quick to argue that this is farfetched and downright biased; I honestly understand their inclination on this point.Nonetheless, I am surefooted in my speculation, and I have compelling reasons as to why it holds water. Even without a crystal ball, any investor can tell that the Illumnia deal won't pick up. This failure will be a leaden blow to a towering Roche, which currently treads in the shadow of mishaps; a negative quarterly revenue growth and tapering net incomes couldn't say less. In my opinion, this failure will further aggravate the already dented faith in Roche shareholders.In the event that this occurs, investors of a bullish disposition (who happen to be very many today) will sell and move to shares that exude prosperity. Abbott would definitely be a prioritized option. It bears desirable traits and arguably extends the best deal in the drug industry. This is chiefly because it gives the impression that it is dynamic and future-oriented.Another prevalent factor that seems to be working in favor of Abbott is the fact that it knows how to carefully juggle its legal issues. Late last year, it was pulled into the courtroom after a disappointed investor filed a lawsuit over the alleged breaching of fiduciary duties. The aggrieved shareholder was exclamatory on the idea that the directors at Abbott were responsible for the breach. Although this happened towards the end of the previous fiscal year, Abbott is still reeling from its effect. This is chiefly because of the magnitude that this news had on Abbott's image.Interestingly, a relentless Abbott has managed to plough through the deluging adversities. I believe that this speaks volumes about Abbott. It instills an innate sense of security in Abbott. It knows how to dodge the bullets and adhere to a calculated and tactful approach. This gives it the upper hand and allows it to survive in the current dynamic stock market.In conclusion, I would say that Abbott has the much-needed potential to edge out formidable competition in the industry. All the same, Roche and Merck cannot be overlooked. That said, the main contributory factor towards my firm advocacy for Abbott is the fact that it manages to put up fight on unlevel ground. As an investor, aggressiveness and determination tap my attention. Abbott is the ideal stock for a smart, long-term investor.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

I discussed how AT&T (NYSE:T) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) appeared cheaper than usual. Today, I will discuss another example of a situation, where I had to dig deeper, before obtaining the full picture behind Abbott Lab’s valuation.I have been a shareholder of Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) for many years. Just like many other investors, I am cheerful about the announced split in two separate publicly traded companies, which will unlock shareholder value. I am also optimistic about the prospects of each of the separate divisions to continue increasing shareholder wealth by continuing the culture of boosting dividends. Abbott Labs is a dividend aristocrat, and has managed to boost distributions every year for 40 years in a row.As I discussed earlier, I initiate or add to my positions in two or three dividend stocks every month. As part of my process of screening for attractively valued stocks each month, I noticed that a few good companies were not part of my buy listing. I was expecting to add to my existing position in Abbott within a few months. This inconsistency startled me, since in my recent analysis of the stock, I had concluded that it was still a great buy. I glanced at the company’s profile in Yahoo Finance and Google Finance, only to see that it was trading at 20 times earnings. Yahoo and Google Finance sites are currently showing $3 in earnings per share for the company. Given the current dividend payout of $2.04/share, this makes the payout ratio to be a very high at 68%. This is consistent with a public utility, but not with a dividend growth company such as Abbott Laboratories.This made me further investigate the trends in quarterly earnings per share over the past year. I noticed that over the past five quarters, the trend in EPS looks something like this:From the company’s press release: In my analysis of earnings and dividend payout ratios, I tend to focus on income from continuing operations. I exclude one-time events, in order to focus on recurring profits and normalize earnings per share. After reading this news release, investors would notice that these one time non cash charges accounted for 99 cents/share. By adding them to EPS from continuing operations of 19 cents/share, we come up with $1.18/share in actual earnings. This brings the total earnings per share for the past four quarters to $3.99/share. As a result of this adjustment, the price earnings multiple decreases from 20 to 15.Disclosure: Long ABT"
481751,25651,2012-04-05T15:59:50-04:00,,"When it comes to medical technologies and practices, the majority of people will only encounter any developments if they're unfortunate enough to have to go to the hospital. They might see the occasional medical breakthrough on the news. However, behind the scenes, companies like Abbott Laboratories (ABT) are constantly working to ensure that both the medical technology that is available for use, and the techniques for using it, are as effective as possible. There's no doubt that Abbott Laboratories and its competitors are responsible for some of the most important medical developments of our times. However, is the importance of Abbott Laboratories in the modern world reflected by its stock value? And how does Abbott Laboratories compete with similar companies?Currently, Abbott Laboratories' stock is trading at around $61. Compared with recent figures, this price demonstrates a considerable and steady growth: this time last year (April 2011), its stock was trading at $49; at the start of 2012 it was valued at $56. The price of Abbott Laboratories' stock has seen a considerable increase even since this time last month, when it was valued at over $57. Unfortunately for Abbott Laboratories' stockholders, many of its competitors are seeing an increase in stock value, too.Pfizer (PFE) has seen an increase from $21 to around $23 since January, while Roche Holding Ltd. (OTCQX:RHHBY) has seen an increase from $42 to around $45 over the same period. Another competitor, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has seen its stock increase in value from $39 to around $46 over the last year. However, not all medical development companies are seeing such good fortune. Competitor AstraZeneca (AZN) has seen a decrease in its stock value from nearly $49 to around $45 over the last year, demonstrating that it's not all plain sailing in the medical market. So, how is Abbott Laboratories managing to keep its share price so high when other competitors are seeing their stock fall? And will it be able to maintain this trend?One reason why Abbott Laboratories continues to be a market leader is that it persists in pushing the boundaries of medical technology developments. In fact, Abbott Laboratories recently made headlines for developing a state of the art self-expanding stent. The stent has been developed in order to minimize friction and potential damage when inserting the stent, in order to help patients suffering from peripheral artery disease. This disease affects the lower limbs and body parts, can not only cause extreme pain and reduce patients' mobility, but can leave patients permanently disabled. This stent will therefore be invaluable in ensuring that blood can flow easily through the lower parts of the body, and it's uniquely designed and flexible form will make insertion easier and less intrusive than ever before. This development not only portrays Abbott Laboratories as a company at the forefront of medical breakthroughs, but the humanitarian element of the development, in that it has the potential to considerably improve patients' quality of life, causes Abbott Laboratories to appear a sympathetic company.Abbott Laboratories is also conducting a great deal of research into drugs and their administration, alongside its work on medical technology. A groundbreaking study it carried out recently has the potential to revolutionize the way that patients undergoing dialysis kidney treatments are medicated. Conventionally, these patients are treated with a combination of cinacalcet and vitamin D; however, Abbott Laboratories' research has suggested that a more effective way to treat these patients is with a drug known as Zemplar, and this research once again has the potential to improve the of the quality of life of millions of dialysis patients. In combination with the above research on stents, Abbott Laboratories appears to have both the drugs side and the technologies side of the medical research field covered.Recent work by Abbott Laboratories in collaboration with other medical research companies has portrayed the company as one with humanitarian, rather than economic, motivations and goals. Abbott Laboratories has been working on research with two of its competitors. It has undertaken research and tests with the medical company Merck (MRK) to investigate developments into a diagnostic test which could revolutionize cancer treatments. It has also committed to a collaboration with Genetics Laboratory, which will work to develop a diagnostic test - this test will be used to identify the early stages of infection within bone and joints. The fact that Abbott has been so openly ready to collaborate with its competitors in the pursuit of medical developments portrays it as an incredibly dedicated medical company which is concerned with people and health rather than wealth - a brilliant marketing technique which will, somewhat ironically, benefit its shareholders.As well as expanding its research and developments, Abbott Laboratories is also physically expanding as a company. Last month, Abbott Laboratories' company STARLIMS Technology obtained French and Israeli distribution companies, and companies in Spain, the Netherlands and Sweden. This was an intelligent move on Abbott Laboratories' part which proved that, despite all the medical research which was hitting the news, the company was still concerned with its economic position and expansion.Overall, with its genuine medical breakthroughs and the humanitarian image that these perpetuate, it's really no surprise that Abbott Laboratories is a market leader. This, teamed with its recent acquisitions in Europe and the Middle East, create the impression that Abbott Laboratories is a dynamic and forward-moving company. Certainly, in the foreseeable future, Abbott Laboratories shows no signs of letting up its hold on the market, and if it continues to strike a perfect balance between pleasing the public and reassuring its shareholders, it will remain a market leader for a long time to come.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
642201,23704,2012-06-06T17:55:06-04:00,,"I appreciated the comments in this article about the safety of the Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) dividend after the impending stock split.Instead of trying to decipher the management presentations, I've gone through the most recent 10Q to try to get some numbers on this important topic to understand the situation more fully.GrowthAbbott Laboratories had 4.5% sales growth compared to the first quarter last year, in an environment of a possible recession in Europe and not the greatest economy in North America.In the table on Page 9 the company has listed the segment sales and operating income results for the first quarter, and we can derive from this the growth rates of each of the soon-to-be-spun-off segments. This company split will take place sometime at the end of the year, with the Proprietary Pharmaceuticals business taking the name AbbVie, and the remaining businesses retaining the Abbott name.(All values in $ thousands)A couple of points of interest on this table: Note that the profit margin of the Abbott portion, which consists of the Nutritionals, Diagnostics, Vascular and ""Established Pharmaceuticals"" was lower, and the growth rate was lower. But, according to the information in the table on Page 9, the Nutritionals business grew at 10% year on year:So you can see a highly profitable Abbott business spinning off and becoming extremely successful, with 3% growth and a 21% profit margin, and annual sales of a bit under $20B. For those interested in running a stock screener, using this set of conditions, you end up with a very elite group of companies, including Bristol Myers-Squibb (NYSE:BMY), Teva Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:TEVA), Merck (NYSE:MRK), Novartis (NYSE:NVS), and Johnson and Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).CashThe Cash Flow statement is on Page 4. In the first quarter this year, ABT managed to generate just more than $2.2B in positive cash flow due to operations, compared to $2.0B last year, nearly a 10% improvement. Also note that the company is generating cash at the rate of roughly 23% of their sales. At an annualized rate of $8.8B the company will be far in excess of the $3.2B they will need to pay the current dividend over the next 4 quarters. There are a couple of other bright spots: The company currently has on the balance sheet (Page 5) $9.9B in cash and short term investments, and also, the ""Trade Receivables"" exceeds the ""Trade Payables"" by nearly an additional $6B. There are a few contingent liabilities, which are discussed in the explanatory notes on Page 6, and in each of the cases the company has already established reserve funds to take these off of the books.So the company's cash position is strong, they are still generating cash at high rates, and there would be enough cash around to allow increase the dividend between the first and second quarter of next year if the company were to remain in one piece, which is their tradition based on their dividend history.Risks: Split PerilThe company has previously indicated that the bulk of the R and D will be allocated to AbbVie. The big unknown that is floating around is how the costs such as the substantial $3B SG and A expense will be allocated across the two businesses. Also what is not known is the tax rate for each of the two entities. ABT paid $270M in taxes on $1.5B in profits, a tax rate of 18%. Compare this to other companies per their recent 10Q:The relative tax level of the two entities may be an important factor in the ultimate ability of either to continue to pay those dividends. If the slower growing, more capital intense, nutritional-driven Abbott ends up with a higher tax rate compared to the R and D driven AbbVie, there will be an effect on earnings that might not be made up for by the higher growth, potentially lower taxed AbbVie.A report on these allocations is expected to be issued between now and the end of the quarter.SummaryAlthough the world is chaotic and there are no guarantees on anything, it is clear that the company's business is strong, and the dividend is safe up until the time of the split. In fact, it would not be completely out of the question for there to be excess cash which might be put to use in a productive way (Possibilities: share buyback, distribution, strategic acquisitions, or debt reduction).The cash inflows will not stop when the two entities split; however, they may well not be equally distributed depending on the allocation of the substantial costs. Stay tuned. There is more information forthcoming.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
451581,25381,2012-03-22T12:43:54-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) had a strong year in 2011. The company made advancements in its pipeline, launched new products, increased its earnings, dividends, and announced splitting up into 2 companies by the end of 2012. In the last year, the company's revenues increased by 10.50% and in the last 3 years, the revenue increase was 31.86%. The company's EPS grew at a faster rate of 11.8% in the last year.Splitting UpBy the end of 2012, the company will split into two companies in order to become more functional and more profitable. One of these companies will keep the Abbott name and it will focus on a large variety of medical products. The company's current CEO, Miles White will lead this company. The second company is yet to be named, however its structure and leaders are already picked. This second company will focus on heavy research and produce pharmaceutical products. Richard Gonzalez, who has been with Abbott for 30 years, will lead this company.Mr. Gonzalez has been leading the company's global pharmaceuticals business sector for a couple years after serving as the company's president and CEO. The reason of the split up is due to the two business segments of the company starting to have different pipelines, investment priorities, and operating models as a part of the evolution company has been going through. The split will allow each company to focus better on their own priorities and any issues that may arise. This should benefit the stockholders greatly as they will be able to examine value of each company and elect to invest in one, both or neither.Growth OpportunitiesThere are two options in front of the company. First, it can find a few really successful products and become a huge expert in those products by focusing on them. Second, the company can diversify its portfolio of products as much as it can in order to have a stable income. It looks like Abbott's pharmaceutical business will take the first route and the medical devices business will take the second route. Both of the company's business segments saw a global revenue growth of 10% in the last year, and this trend is expected to continue moving forward.In the medical devices business segment, emerging markets account for 40% of all the revenues. In the following years, this percentage is expected to rise near or above 50% as the company invests more into these markets. As the world population becomes more health conscious, the company will see strong growth in sale of its nutritional products which also include baby formulas. The company's baby brand formula Similac, pediatric nutrition brand PediaSure and milk-for-babies brand Gain have the top market share in US and strong demand overseas. These products will continue to drive the company's growth in the near future.Abbott's diagnostic products also face a lot of strong demand as they help doctors all around the world to make decisions regarding their patients. The company's huge diversity of products are able to help diagnose a large number of conditions including cancer, diabetes, heart disease and a range of infections.The company provides more than 500 pharmaceutical products all over the world. Many of these products are well-established. While some of these products are generic drugs, many are unique to the company. Currently, most of the growth regarding these products comes from emerging markets. In developed nations, most of the growth will probably come from launching new products. The company plans to launch more than 1,000 products around the world in the next 5-10 years, which will effectively triple the company's portfolio.If we look at the company's pipeline of products, we see a lot of activity. Absorb gained approval in Europe and is seeking approvals in US, Japan, India and Brazil. This is a very promising product that acts as a vascular scaffold and dissolves itself after the job is done. The company is also working on developing targeted treatments that will limit or stop growth of tumors in the body. Abbott is in the third phase of testing effectiveness of Daclizumab, a drug for treating multiple sclerosis. The company is also in the same stage of testing for an intestinal gel used to treat advanced levels of Parkinson's Disease.DividendsThe company returned $3 billion to its shareholders in shape of dividends in 2011. This represents one third of the company's operating cash flow in the year, corresponding to a payout ratio of 33%. At this rate, the company's dividend rate is pretty safe. Abbott has been raising its dividend rate for 39 straight years and this tradition is likely to continue for years to come. Currently Abbott's dividend yield is 3.38%.Share Price MovementsCurrently Abbott's share price is $60.40, which is all-time high for the company. Previously, the company reached similar share price in late 1990s, early 2000s, and 2008. Historically, every time Abbott's share price neared or passed $60, it did not go further up. So the company's current share price might scare some investors off, however, in a bull market, it shouldn't be much of a worry. I believe that Abbott can trade for well above $60 if the bull market continues on. In the last decade, the highest P/E ratio for the company was 55.25 whereas the lowest was 13.44. Currently the company's P/E ratio is 20.Analyst RatingsOf the 21 analyst covering the stock, 7 rate it as ""strong buy"" 4 rate it as ""buy"" and 10 rate it as ""hold."" The average target price on the stock is $60 which is its current price. In 2012, the company is expected to grow its earnings by 7%.ConclusionAbbott is a decent company with growth opportunities. Given the stock's current share price, its price history, P/E ratio and dividend rate, I would only recommend it to dividend/income investors at the moment. The stock is too stable for growth investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
478921,24610,2012-04-04T13:11:30-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (ABT) is an American-based healthcare and pharmaceuticals company that is ranked among the leaders of the global pharmaceutical market. The main strengths of the company are its diverse product portfolio and massive shares in global markets. However, in recent years, the company has shifted its strategic emphasis to well-planned acquisitions and product launches. Moreover, the company has announced strategic decisions to divest some of its less profitable ventures through spinoffs and sales. These factors have mainly aided the business in maintaining a high dividend yield and impressive cash flows in the past few fiscal quarters.Abbott has recorded impressive financial indicators in recent fiscal years, generating nearly $35 billion in revenue in 2010. Last year, the company earned a place among the Top 20 Biopharma employers by Science Magazine. Abbott is an enormous business with operations comprehensively spread across more than 130 countries. With a massive market capitalization of more than $96 billion and an average trading volume of nearly $7.5 million, the stock easily overshadows all of its major competitors. This has greatly immunized the business against predominantly unfavorable market forces and negative investor sentiment.The stock closed the previous financial year fairly well, trading around $57 after recovering from a brief period of faltering investor trust that saw shares plummet as low as $46. However, with the start of the new financial year, the stock was seen gaining in the first fiscal quarter largely due to renewed investor sentiment. Currently, the stock is poised at around $61, which is impressive as that is the highest price in the past 52 weeks.When I look back at the stock's performance in the past three years, it is evident that the company has made some very wise decisions that are expected to soon bear fruitful results for the business. One such strategic decision was the acquisition of Advanced Media Optics in 2009. The acquisitions of STARLIMS and Solvay Pharmaceuticals in the following year are also wise decisions that gave Abbott Laboratories a diverse range of pharmaceutical products. This has provided the company with a strong market position, allowing it to drive toward higher returns on equity and strong operating cash flows.Competitive AnalysisMerck (MRK) has enjoyed the reputation of being the traditional rival of Abbott Laboratories. It has a massive market capitalization of more than $117 billion, and average trading volume exceeds $14.5 million. Merck has a current trading price of $38 and price-to-earnings ratio of 19. The stock pays around $0.42 per share in dividends on earnings per share of $2. With such impressive financial indicators, Merck is expected to give its traditional rival Abbott Laboratories some tough competition this year.GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), with a market capitalization of nearly $116 billion and average trading volume of $2.15 million, has traditionally had what it takes to be a world leading pharmaceutical company. However, the stock has shown high susceptibility to negative market forces and unfavorable investor sentiment, which has largely robbed the stock of the impetus needed to drive growth. The company had an inauspicious end to the past financial year, recording a 2% decline in sales levels as compared to the previous year's figures. The stock is also plagued by U.S.-led investigations into the company's marketing and sales practices. This has been met with skepticism by investors.Sanofi (SNY) enjoys tremendous exposure to the European market, with sales in the region accounting for more than 30% of its total sales. The total market capitalization of Sanofi exceeds $105 billion, and the average trading volume is poised at an impressive $2.5 million. The stock is currently trading at around $39 after recovering from a collapse that sent it plummeting to as low as $30. However, most of the stock's performance in the past financial year was wayward and sluggish compared to that of Abbott Laboratories. This was largely due to a sharp plunge of 40% in publicly traded value rights and a series of patent losses last year. Therefore, I believe that Abbott Laboratories is a viable investment option that is more likely to promise higher returns on investment than Sanofi.Abbott Laboratories reported earnings growth of almost 12% in 2011 compared to the financial figures for the previous year. Moreover, the company generated annual revenue of nearly $39 billion last year, which comprehensively overshadowed the annual revenue figures of all of its major competitors. To top it all off, Abbott Laboratories has the industry-highest price-to-earnings ratio of 19, which dwarfs that of its leading competitors, with Sanofi at 13.31, Roche Holdings (OTCQX:RHHBY) at 14.35, and Merck at 18.78. Earnings per share of $3 is almost as impressive when set against Roche's $3, Merck's $2, and Sanofi's $2.84.Final VerdictAbbott Laboratories is currently facing a lot of pressing issues that demand immediate resolution, the most critical being large-scale employee layoffs and an array of legal challenges. However, the company has a beta of 0.31, which is a testament to its resilience against predominantly unfavorable factors and negative market trends. This has mainly rescued the business from unfavorable market conditions during testing times. More recently, the business has made important announcements regarding investing in strategic ventures such as the construction of LIMS. This is expected to facilitate the business in narrowing down its strategic emphasis to core global operations and key market segments. Studying the recent decisions by Abbott Laboratories to invest in strategic projects and acquisitions, I believe that the company is poised for higher growth, increased market share, and greater operating cash flows.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

As noted in ZLCS's Q4 press release, ""Hydra's leadership in Ion channel discovery, preclinical drug development, and strong position in this area was recently solidified with the progression into the clinic of its novel TRPA1 modulator"".Abbott Laboratories, NYSE: ABT is an Abbott Park, Illinois biopharmaceutical company taking a very pro-active role in the development and distribution of various Rheumatoid Arthritis medications. During Q4 2011, ABT demonstrated major strides in its drug HUMIRA® especially in patients with severe cases of Rheumatoid Arthritis. One of the major components driving the advancements of HUMIRA®, is the amount of time it has spent in clinical development. ""The ability to inhibit the progression of the disease and improve physical function is the current benchmark for RA treatment,"" said John Leonard, M.D., senior vice president, Pharmaceuticals Research and Development, Abbott.Drugs in Development - Zalicus: Currently, ZLCS is working on Synavive®. SYNERGY rheumatoid arthritis Phase 2b trials are currently under way and they look to report the data in the latter part of Q3 in 2012. If the top-line data exceeds developmental expectations various strategic channels could open up, and FDA approval could mean a very attractive bottom line for FY 2012.Synavive® can mean some very significant steps forward for Zalicus. It makes Zalicus a great acquisition target by someone like Abbott Laboratories, who is a major pharmaceutical player in the Rheumatoid Arthritis arena.Drugs in Development - Abbott Laboratories: Currently, ABT is working with Galapagos to develop yet another Rheumatoid Arthritis solution. This solution, entitled GLPG0634, is an orally administered JAK (Janus Kinases) inhibitor that is used primarily for patients that have severe Rheumatoid Arthritis. The expectations for this solution are interesting, because unlike the decade long trials of HUMIRA®, complete phase II approval could be seen as early as 2014.Company Guidance - ZLCS: From Zalicus.com: ""In 2011, we made significant progress in advancing our product candidates in clinical development, including Synavive, Z160 and Z944,"" commented Mark H.N. Corrigan, MD, President and CEO of Zalicus. ""During 2012, we will see the results of those studies and make important decisions on next steps. This is evident with the successful reformulation of Z160, in which we have achieved the consistent exposure levels necessary to evaluate its efficacy in a Phase 2 clinical study for neuropathic pain later this year.""Company Guidance - ABT: From Abbott.com: ""The addition of this novel, oral compound offers patients the potential for advanced treatment options and an improved patient experience to address RA and other autoimmune diseases,"" said John Leonard, M.D., senior vice president, global research and development, Abbott. ""Abbott's expertise in immunology, combined with a robust portfolio of investigational treatments represents promising innovation across several areas of medical need.""Disclosure: I am long ZLCS."
465021,24492,2012-03-29T05:27:20-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a blue chip health care stock offering income investors a 3.3% dividend yield. This is an attractive yield when compared to current Treasury Bond yields. As of Wednesday, March 28, a 30 year Treasury Bond yields 3.31%. Abbott management has taken positive action to unlock shareholder value. The planned spin off of AbbVie. AbbVie will represent the company's research based pharmaceutical company. The potential net dividend yield could increase due to the synergies created through the corporate spin off restructuring.DividendsOn December 9, 2011, Abbott declared a quarterly dividend of 48 cents per share, its 352nd consecutive dividend since 1924. With a full year dividend of $2.04 and with shares trading at $61.12 (as on March 28, 2012), Abbott offers a dividend yield of 3.3%, just about in line with inflation. With 2011 full year earnings of $3.01 per share, its dividend payout ratio is about 68%. The company's 2012 earnings per share are expected to be $5.01. The dividend will equate to about 40% of the total earnings.There will be one time expenses for the break up into two separate companies. Investors should anticipate these costs each quarter as the break up becomes closer and closer to completion.OverviewAbbott is one of the world's leading pharmaceutical and health care products and services providers. Abbott's headquarters are in Chicago, IL and it has two primary research centers in Worcester, Massachusetts and Ludwigshafen, Germany. Abbott was founded in 1888, more than 120 years, ago by Dr. Wallace C. Abbott in Chicago and has since grown into the global leader that it is today.Abbott provides a select range of pharmaceutical products, nutritional products, diagnostic instruments and tests, medical and surgical devices, animal health products and vision technologies. Its pharmaceutical products cover anesthesia, anti-infectives, cardiovascular, immunology, metabolics, neuroscience, oncology, pain care, renal care and virology. Its medical products cover animal health, diabetes, diagnostics, hematology, molecular, point of care and vascular, and its nutritional products cover pediatric nutrition, healthy living and medical nutrition.Some of Abbott's brands include drugs such as Brufen, Prevacid and Vicodin, nutrition products such as Ensure, Pedialyte and Similac, diagnostic instruments such as AneuVysion, RealTime HIV-1 and UroVysion, medical and surgical devices such as RX Acculink Carotid Stents and Veripath Catheter and vision technologies such as ILasik and RevitaLens.Over the years, Abbott has won multiple awards for corporate social responsibility, innovation, diversity and management quality. The company employs 91,000 employees worldwide and has annual revenue of over $38 billion.Business StrategyOver the years, Abbott has grown its business into multiple categories. However, management now plans to split the company into two, with one part focused on research based pharmaceuticals and the other focused on diversified medical products. This breakup is expected by the end of 2012.The research focused company will be called AbbVie. It will focus on Abbott's portfolio of proprietary pharmaceuticals and biologics and expand on its $18 billion revenue base and pipeline of innovative research and development.The diversified medical products company will continue to be called Abbott and will include Abbott's branded generic pharmaceuticals, devices, diagnostics and nutrition businesses, with a revenue base of roughly $20 billion.At both companies, Abbott will continue to focus on research and development, clinical trials and FDA approval for its various products, selective collaborations to jointly develop and commercialize drugs and products with other healthcare companies, and the launching of new products.FinancialsFor its fourth quarter ended December 31, 2011, Abbott reported total sales of $10.4 billion, 4.1% more than the $10 billion reported in 4Q 2010. 43% of its sales were from the U.S. while 67% were international. 46% of its total quarterly sales were from proprietary pharmaceuticals, 15% from nutritionals, 13.4% from established pharmaceuticals and its other products made up the balance. For the quarter, Abbott reported operating earnings of $2.1 billion, a 13.8% year over year increase, and net earnings of $1.6 billion, 12.3% higher than 4Q 2010. Earnings per share were $1.02, a 10.9% increase over the 92 cents earned in fourth quarter 2010.For the full year, Abbott reported total sales of $38.9 billion, a 10.5% increase over 2010. Operating earnings were $5.8 billion, 5.5% less than 2010 primarily due to increases in cost of sales, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses in 2011. Net earnings for the full year were $4.7 billion, 2.2% higher than 2010, and full year earnings per share was $3.01. Abbott generated $9 billion in net cash from operations in 2011.As on December 31, 2011, Abbott held cash and cash equivalents of $6.8 billion, total assets of $60.3 billion, debt of $15.4 billion and shareholders' equity of $24.5 billion. Debt was roughly 25% of total assets.Looking ahead, Abbott expects 2012 full year earnings per share of $5.00, well above 2011 earnings of $3.01.Earnings Estimates for 2012 - 2021SharesAs of March 27, 2012, Abbott shares traded at $61.33 with a market capitalization of $96.4 billion (3.9x book value) and a price to earnings ratio of 20.4x. Shares are at an all-time high and at the top of their 52 week range of $46.29-$61.49, likely due to an overall bull market compounded by Abbott's pending plans to divest itself into two companies that could enhance shareholder value.Peer GroupAbbott's peers and competitors include larger pharmaceuticals and medical products providers.Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Johnson & Johnson is a major global health care business. Core business segments include baby care, skin care, and wound care. The company offers a 3.5% dividend yield. The company has returned an average annualized rate of return of 3.4% over the past 4 years.The CEO, William Weldon, will step down in April. Alex Gorsky will become CEO. His prior background has focused upon the company's Medical Device & Diagnostics unit.Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)Pfizer is a biopharmaceutical company focused upon developing new products for global sale. Core products include Celebrex, Lyrica, Premarin, and Pristiq. Lipitor is now available as a generic, Pfizer has lost the growth status it once held a decade ago. The 4.00% dividend yield is a positive aspect.Merck (NYSE:MRK)Merck and Schering-Plough merged in November 2009l. Presently Merck is the second largest global health care company. The company is facing Singulair having generic alternatives this year. The company has a wide product line including vaccines. The company raised the 1st quarter dividend to 42 cents. The current annual yield is 4.3%, a high yield for the large health care sector.Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY)Bristol Myers Squibb apparently offered $22 per share for Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (AMLN). Amylin was up 54% today, March 28th, due to the offer. The company lost Plavix to generics in 2011. In 2012, Bristol Myers will lose key product Avapro. Avapro goes off patent this year. It appears Bristol Myers wants to use their $9 billion cash balance to acquire new products to replace the products lost to generics.All of these peers provide a dividend yield that is marginally higher than Abbott with a peer median of 4% and sport price to earnings multiples that range between 10.2x (NYSE:LLY) and 18.7x , slightly less than Abbott. As mentioned earlier, Abbott's shares have likely received a boost from the company's impending split.ActionI own shares in Abbott. The company is trading at an 11-13x 2012 price to earnings multiple. The spin off should create shareholder value. I would wait for a share pullback to accumulate shares. The stock is at a 52 week high. An appropriate entry price would be $55 - $56. Allow the stock to back down before accumulating a position.Disclosure: I am long ABT."
420251,25159,2012-03-08T11:01:12-05:00,,"The recent stagnation in global economic activity has played a pivotal role in determining the approach of prudent investors who have sought smarter, safer investments in attractive, large-cap, high-yield stocks that promise to offer higher returns on investment.In this article, I have selected Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), which is a major player in the global pharmaceutical market. With an enormous share in global markets, a diverse product portfolio, planned product launches in the coming months, a range of profitable acquisitions, a high dividend yield and favorable market sentiment in recent quarters, Abbott shows a lot of investment promise for stock traders in the current year.Abbott Laboratories is an international pharmaceuticals and health care products company having an enormous global market share. With a diverse product portfolio, the company has managed to maintain a wide competitive moat in a predominantly volatile and highly competitive market. As a result, the company has remained largely immune to unfavorable investor sentiment that has haunted multinational companies operating in other markets segments. At $57 a share, the current trading price of the stock is at its highest in the last 52 weeks, although a brief period of increased market instability saw the stock shortly plummet to as low as $46. Abbott has a massive market capitalization of more than $90 billion with an average trading volume of nearly $7 million.The company's performance in the last 3 years has been promising, with a range of lucrative investments and smart acquisitions that have allowed it to enjoy a strong market position while also spearheading high returns on equity, consistent dividends, and strong operating cash flows. In 2009, the company established its very own Vision Eye Care division after completing the acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics. Consequently, in the first quarter of 2010, Abbott completed the planned EUR 4.5 billion acquisition of Solvay Pharmaceuticals and STARLIMS. This provided the company with an assortment of diverse pharmaceutical products allowing Abbott to expand its hold on existing market segments and penetrate into other key market segments.In 2011, Abbott enjoyed a favorable run in the market, reporting earnings growth of nearly 12% compared to previous year's figures. The overall revenue generated throughout 2011 was nearly $39 billion with an impressive run in the third quarter returning nearly $9 billion. Owing to favorable investor sentiment and positive market trends in recent months, Abbott has started the current year with impressive financial indicators that suggest that the company is poised to achieve greater market growth and announce higher earnings per share.Abbott currently has price to earnings ratio of more than 19, which is the highest in the industry compared to other leading pharmaceutical giants such as Merck & Co. (NYSE:MRK) at 18.78, ROCHE Holdings (OTCQX:RHHBY) at 14.35, and Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) at 13.31. Additionally, the company's earnings per share of more than $3 match or exceed those of Merck ($2), ROCHE ($3) and Sanofi ($2.84). Abbott has traditionally enjoyed a good dividend history in the market; the company recently declared its 352nd consecutive quarterly dividend, and this has in turn attracted favorable investor sentiment for the business over a long history of trading. On its earnings per share of almost $3, the company offers investors more than 50c in dividends. This has allowed the company to enjoy favorable investor sentiment in recent fiscal quarters, and this has largely helped the business achieve higher levels of quarterly growth (4.1%) than enjoyed by competitors (1.7% and -8.5%). Furthermore, a Beta of 0.31 means that the company has a higher resilience to predominantly negative factors and volatile market conditions. This has allowed the business to perform well in the last two quarters of 2011 amidst sluggish trading and unfavorable investor sentiment.Abbott has started the new year well, with aggressive trading of stock. The stock has continued its momentum from its high performance levels of the previous year. Despite the company's recent announcement to lay off 700 employees in a bid to narrow the focus of its global operations, favorable investor sentiment is at an all-time high, and profit levels of the business have increased by almost 12% since the start of 2012.Abbott has recently been in the middle of fresh legal challenges for marketing and sale of its market-leading anti-seizure drug Depakote. The company arranged nearly $1.5 billion in settlement fee after Justice Department-led investigations revealed that the company may have been involved in illegal promotion and marketing campaigns encouraging Depakote for unauthorized uses. However, trading has still been largely favorable for the company, and investor sentiment is at an all-time high despite the fact that a legal settlement to pressing legal challenges has still not been struck.My analysis of latest financial indicators, prevailing market conditions and recent developments suggest that Abbott enjoys favorable market sentiment largely because of its recent announcement to invest in a series of strategic moves. The company has announced acquisition plans to build a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) in emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Africa. This will help the company narrow down the focus of its global operations on key market segments while also allowing the company greater flexibility to penetrate emerging market in Latin America, Asia and Africa. Among the acquisitions are Varilab (STARLIM's distributors in France), Iberica (for managing operations in Spain) and a privately-held Dutch company. Abbott also plans to invest nearly $270 million in the development of a nutrition manufacturing facility in Ohio. The facility, once completed and in operation, is expected to cater to an increasing local demand for adult liquid nutrition products. With a range of new acquisitions and smart investments that are expected to bear good fruit, I believe that current financial indicators and market conditions are favorable to the business. I believe Abbott is poised for higher growth levels this year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
465941,24610,2012-03-29T11:23:58-04:00,,"With the blatantly obvious fact that the people of the world are aging, contracting or developing new diseases, and generally more concerned with their health and well being, it's apparent that the demand for quality pharmaceutical companies is on the rise. Not only do these companies provide the vaccines, medications, and medical tools that are needed on a daily basis, but also conduct medical research that has proven vital to breakthroughs in cures and treatments.One of the top healthcare and drug manufacture companies is Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), which is responsible for the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of health care products worldwide. According to its company profile, it is most known for its adult and pediatric pharmaceuticals for rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthrisis, and Crohns disease; dyslipidemia; HIV infections; prostate cancer, endometriosis and central precocious puberty.Recently, Abbott announced a split of the company, which will be sectioned off into a research-based pharmaceutical company named Abbvie, expected to launch by the end of 2012. The other part of the company will remain named Abbott, which currently has an $18 billion annual revenue and is expected to climb after the split. Abbott already has a strong portfolio of market-leading brand names such as Humira, Lupron, Synagis, Kaletra, Creon, and Synthroid.Abbott's split is expected to separate its research related business from its medical products business, to better focus individually on both and capitalize on growth. With new high trading values of around $61 and a 0.77% increase Wednesday, the proposed split has enforced approval and optimism in investors of the company.Abbott's biggest competitor right now is Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), currently trading at around $65 with a 0.42% increase Wednesday. Although Abbott is international, Johnson & Johnson benefits largely from its wide geographic diversification in over 170 countries. However, considering that Johnson & Johnson has found itself in several legal situations and product recalls, I would infer that it's their strong, dependable name and reputation that keeps them afloat but not necessarily progressing.Another rival sneaking up is Merck (NYSE:MRK), trading at a lower cost of about $39 and a 0.36% increase yesterday. Merk is said to be a good investment due to its heavy investors and also low costs. However, the company may be facing some troubles with expiring patents this year.Similarly, it has been reported that Abbott may be facing the same issue. It recently sued Watson Pharmaceuticals (WPI) for an alleged patent infringements on one of its top products, Niaspan. There is much debate in this debacle over who is really hurting in this situation, Abbott for suing, or Watson, for trying to copy.Another legal situation that may still have an affect on Abbott, is an incident with one of its infant formula products that failed to reach China national safety standards, hurting them significantly in sales. Not only did Abbott's Similac Stage 1 milk powder product test worst out of six samples provided, but tested below international and Chinese standards, a shock considering it was initially being tested as a benchmark for quality.To further worsen the incident in China, media reports exploded last Wednesday with the news of a father in China in the city of Hangzhou who claimed he found half of a condom inside the milk powder package that he bought for his daughter.With a scandal like that in the news, it's going to make it hard for Abbott to recover in China, and will probably lead to companies like Johnson & Johnson benefiting in international sales, however Abbott still seems to have a fighting chance with the splitting and expansion of the company this year.It seems that even though there's trouble overseas for Abbott, the excitement of the splitting into its two new companies may keep it from stumbling. I believe the increased focus on one company making nutritional formula, generic drugs, and medical devices, and the other making branded drugs will result in positive product results.Similarly, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) the biggest drug company in the world revenue wise, is also said to be following in the shoes of Abbott, and may be selling or splitting off its animal health and nutrition business. This clearly is a decision that will benefit Pfizer by allowing it room to restructure and bring in additional acquisition and investment flexibility.Additionally, Abbott may need to watch out for other competing companies who may very well out shine them in the breakthrough drug development category; Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) have had several mentions in the news regarding an experimental drug that lowers bad cholesterol by as much at 70%. In Abbotts direct competitor comparison chart, it has a market cap of $96.43 billion while Sanofi has a market cap of $102.72 billion and Merck topping both with $118.11 billion.Another boost the recent news is giving to Abbott's competitors Johnson & Johnson, and Sanofi, is the hint at buying Oculus Innovative Sciences (OCLS) products, which apparently are too affective and too large of a market for the big pharmaceutical companies to ignore. Oculus' prized product, Microcyn is said to eradicate difficult to treat infections, reduce inflammation, pain and itch, and may often eliminate the need for topical and systematic antibiotics and steroids. This product would be fast and easy for any of the pharmaceutical companies to buy, and will most likely benefit them in the long one with its break-through capabilities.One reason why Abbott may not directly benefit from the purchase of Microcyn is because its whole purpose is to develop and produce medical treatments and products, however, with Microcyn's high popularity and success rate, they may want to reconsider.Microcyn is actually preferred over other products for wound care by physicians because of its superior antimicrobial properties and ability to leave healthy cells undamaged, an important factor in the healing process. Aside from its speedy affect on the healing process, it is also one of the most cost effective products on the market for all levels of wound treatment.I predict that Abbott is going to be stepping up its game immensely, not just due to its international fallout with China, but also because of its rising competition with other pharmaceutical companies, especially in a time when new discoveries and improved products are constantly being produced. Either way, I believe Abbott will see strong gains and increase its dividends this year, and even more so after it splits next year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
429011,24866,2012-03-13T03:08:38-04:00,,"With the planned split into two companies nearing, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is looking like an attractive healthcare play. The strategic action will result in one diversified medical products company and a research-based pharmaceutical company. Perhaps most importantly, this will divorce struggling Humira from profitable lines and allow investors to better allocate risk.In this article, I will run you through my DCF model on Abbott and then triangulate the result with an exit multiple calculation and a review of the fundamentals compared to Merck (NYSE:MRK) and Pfizer (NYSE:PFE). As an investor relations consultant, I also recommend considering companies that can explode in value from greater news flow. GeoVax Labs (NASDAQ:GOVX) and Pharma-Bio Serv (OTCQB:PBSV), in particular, are looking attractive.First, let's begin with an assumption about revenues. Abbott finished FY2011 with $38.9B in revenue, which represented a 10.5% gain off the preceding year. Analysts model a 8.3% per annum growth rate over the next five years, and I view this as conservative, given that it is about 300 bps below that expected for the S&P 500. However, for the sake of staying safe, I accept the projections.Moving onto the cost-side, there are several items to address: operating expenses, capital expenditures, and taxes. I expect cost of goods sold to eat 40% of revenue versus 28% and 10% for SG&A and R&D, respectively. These figures are roughly in-line with historical 3-year average levels. Capex is estimated the same way, so I assume 3% of revenue. Taxes are factored in at 20%.We then need to subtract out net increases in working capital. I model accounts receivable as 20% of revenue; inventories as 22% of COGS; prepaid expenses as 15% of SG&A; accounts payable as 5.3% of OPEX; and accrued expenses as 70% of SG&A.Taking a perpetual growth rate of 2.5% and discounting backwards by a WACC of 8%, yields a fair value figure of $80.36, implying 38.7% upside. Even if the perpetual growth rate is just 1% and the WACC is 9%, the company is still fairly valued. Abbott merits a higher-than-average perpetual growth rate and a lower WACC because of its 0.31 beta and business model.All of this falls under the context of strong recent results:From a multiples perspective, Abbott is also attractive. It trades at 19.3x past earnings, but only 10.8x forward earnings. Pfizer, also attractive, trades at corresponding figures of 19.5x and 9.1x. Merck, another attractive pick, trades at corresponding figures of 18.5x and 10.1x. Assuming a multiple of 15x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $5.31, the rough intrinsic value of Abbott's stock is $79.65 - basically in-line with my DCF result.Despite being known for having weak pipeline, Merck has more than a dozen potential launches under development. The company is also well positioned, due to its much lower exposure to generic competition relative to peers. Much of the reason why investors are staying on the sidelines is due to the $50B worth of patent expirations; however, value drivers have been overly discounted as a result.Pfizer, despite facing $1.3B worth of exclusivity losses, had meaningful momentum in the fourth quarter. Top-line growth was actually strong across the board and, in my view, Eliquis, tofacitinib, and Xalkori will keep the momentum going.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: We seek IR business from all of the firms in our coverage, but research covered in this note is independent and for prospective clients.

411171,23209,2012-03-05T08:42:20-05:00,,"Here we model the evolution of Abbott Laboratories' (NYSE:ABT) stock price since July 2003. Abbott is a company from healthcare sector of the S&P 500 index. We model a share price decomposing it into a weighted sum of two consumer price indices. Our concept presumes that there exist a trade-off between a given share price and goods and services the relevant company produces and/or provides. Obviously, the defining consumer price (or CPI) has to rely to some independent and dynamic reference, which can also be a consumer price index. The pricing power is related to the difference between the defining and reference CPIs.We have borrowed the time series of monthly closing prices of ABT from Yahoo.com and the relevant (seasonally not adjusted) CPI estimates through January 2012 are published by the BLS. Instructively, the evolution of ABT share price is defined by the consumer price index of medical care commodities and the index of transportation services (NYSE:TS). The defining time lags are as follows: the MCC index leads the share price by 9(!) months and the TS index leads by 8 (!) months. The relevant best-fit model for ABT(t) is as follows:ABT(t) = 0.93MCC(t-9) - 1.00TS(t-8) + 1.92(t-1990) - 22.62, February 2012where ABT(t) is the ABT share price in U.S. dollars, t is calendar time. Figure 1 displays the evolution of both defining indices since 2002. Figure 2 depicts the high and low monthly prices for an ABT share together with the predicted and measured monthly closing prices (adjusted for dividends and splits). The predicted prices are well within the bounds of the share price uncertainty and lead by 8 months. However, the price has not been changing much since 2010 and the knowledge of the lead cannot bring high return.The model residual error is shown in Figure 3 with the standard deviation between July 2003 and January 2012 of $2.38. Currently, the price is overestimated relative to its expected value and one can foresee a negative correction (~$3) in the first half of 2012. From Figure 2, the uncertainty of $5 (between the low and high monthly prices) is applicable to our prediction. It means that one may act on the price when it is beyond the $5 range relative to the expected level.(Click to enlarge)Figure 1. The evolution of MCC and TS indices(Click to enlarge)Figure 2.

394641,24196,2012-02-27T11:49:16-05:00,,"The stock market continues to rally, which is lowering dividend yields and making it harder to find good value. But there are still stocks out there that sport not only a solid dividend yield, but a history of consistent dividend growth over time.One such company is Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT). With a dividend yield of 3.4% and a history of increasing dividends over time, Abbott Labs is one of my favorite dividend paying stocks.ABT Profile:Abbott Laboratories engages in the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of health care products worldwide. The company offers adult and pediatric pharmaceuticals for rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, and Crohn's disease; dyslipidemia; HIV infection; prostate cancer, endometriosis and central precocious puberty, and anemia caused by uterine fibroids; respiratory syncytial virus; adult males who have low testosterone; secondary hyperparathyroidism; hypothyroidism; and pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, as well as anesthesia products.*Profile taken from Yahoo Finance.Abbott Labs has a solid dividend yield of 3.4% and has a solid history of growing dividends over time. They have never failed to increase their dividends in any year since starting their dividend payments in 1983. The one year dividend growth rate is fairly strong at 9.1% while the five year dividend growth rate is more impressive, coming in at 14.9%. They payout ratio of 62% is higher than I normally like, but it is still reasonable and allows them to increase dividends even if earnings don't budge, at least for a few years.It is not necessarily obvious how investors will fare if they hold onto Abbott Labs for the next 10 years, receiving not only the dividend, but a growing dividend over time. It's important to analyze scenarios for such a company where we look at the dividend yield and growing dividends. I ran the following scenario on our publicly available calculator called Total Returns- Dividends Vs. Price Appreciation. If we buy 1,000 shares today, apply a dividend growth rate of 6% over the next 10 years, reinvest dividends, and assume the price of the stock does not change, we get the following:The annual return in this case is 4.4%. I've also included the future value of the dividend income stream compared to the future value of the initial investment. The dividends accumulated to more than $29,000 over the 10 year period. Looked at another way, the price of this stock could fall by almost 45% during this period and the investor would still break even. Now let's take a look at what happens over 20 years:The annual return jumps to 5.4% even with no growth in the stock price. Also notice that the total dollar value of the dividend payments is nearly 100% higher than the value of the initial investment. That is the beauty of high dividend paying stocks over time. The initial investment becomes less and less important.Dividend paying stocks can also help a retirement plan immensely, especially vs. low-yielding treasury bonds. I plugged in the 4.4% total return figure for a portfolio into our retirement planner in place of the treasury bonds that were there before.I found that if a typical 55 year old couple with $400,000 in assets moves 50% of their funds from treasuries to dividend payers that give them a 4.4% return, over ten years they will have increased the time that their funds last in retirement by ten years.Scenarios such as the ones I've run here can help investors understand the power of dividends over time, especially when those dividends are growing.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Analysts are looking for EPS of $1.44 on revenue of $10.63B. The consensus range is $1.37-$1.45 for EPS, and $10.39B-$10.87B for revenue, according to First Call. In Q3, the company reported slight better-than-expected EPS and revenue, saying that it expects to have ongoing double-digit EPS growth and high single-digits sales growth. Specifically, Abbott expects Q4 EPS of $1.43-$1.45 and FY11 EPS of $4.64-$4.66. Looking ahead, the company said it's well positioned in emerging markets and sees Nutritionals as its strongest business. It also sees its global vascular business to grow in the mid-to-high single digits, and it expects a very promising market for Hepatitis C. Investors will be looking to hear the latest update and any additional details on the Abbott's expected split into two publicly traded companies. It had said the split will be completed by the end of the year, and it wouldn't hamper any M&A opportunities. Abbott should also give an update on Humira, its arthritis drug the company had previously said would be a strong sustainable growth product for a long time. In the past quarter, Abbott received FDA approval for Xience Prime drug eluting stent, a vitro diagnostic test for leukemia, a test for Chagas disease, and a test to detect vitamin D levels. Meanwhile, the company also announced positive results from its ATLAS study and its ABSORB trial. Abbott was downgraded to Equal Weight at Barclays and Morgan Stanley. Its price was also lowered to $46 from $49 at Citigroup. Despite the negative analyst commentary, Barron's says the company still looks robust, with the expected breakup to serve as a catalyst for the company."

Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is a dividend champion that has raised its dividend every year for 39 consecutive years. The complete Dividend Champions list is compiled courtesy of David Fish. (Open as an excel spreadsheet and look at the tabs on the bottom to find the Dividend Champions list).About Abbott Laboratories : from their website""Abbott is a global, broad-based health care company devoted to the discovery, development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceuticals and medical products, including nutritionals, devices and diagnostics. The company employs approximately 91,000 people and markets its products in more than 130 countries.""Abbott Laboratories : A Dividend Champion with 39 Consecutive Years of Dividend IncreasesSince dividends are paid out of earnings, a clear perspective of a company's historical earnings growth record is a vital component of a dividend investor's prudent due diligence process. The following graph plots Abbott Laboratories' earnings per share since 1993. A quick glance to the right of the graph shows that Abbott Laboratories has increased earnings at a compounded rate of 10.2% (see purple circle on graph) per annum.Dividend Champions Gave Shareholders a Raise in Income 25 Years Straight or LongerWith interest rates hovering near all-time lows, investors seeking income are faced with very limited choices. The traditional high yield available from bonds and other fixed income vehicles are no longer available to meet the goals of retirees needing income to live off of. Moreover, it is almost a certainty that today's low yields are not adequate enough to fight inflation. Consequently, there is a growing investor interest in dividend-paying common stocks, especially those that have a long record of increasing their dividends every year.Earnings Determine Market Price and Dividend Income: The following earnings and price correlated F.A.S.T. Graphs™ clearly illustrate the importance of earnings to both price movement and dividend income. The earnings growth rate line or True Worth ™ line (orange line with white triangles) is correlated with the historical stock price line. On graph after graph, the lines will move in tandem. If the stock price strays away from the earnings line (over or under), inevitably it will come back to earnings.Since dividends are paid out of earnings, and therefore, represent additional return on top of what the market capitalizes earnings at, they are depicted by the light blue shaded area and stacked on top of the earnings line. Therefore, a quick visual of these two important components is simultaneously revealed: The additional return that dividend paying stocks provide, plus the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders as dividends (payout ratio).Performance Table: Capital Appreciation and Dividend Income Abbott LaboratoriesThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph, validates the above discussion regarding the two components of total return: Capital appreciation and dividend income. Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid, but not reinvested.When presented separately like this, the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident. In addition to the 7.1% capital appreciation (Closing Annualized ROR), long-term shareholders of Abbott Laboratories would have received an additional $117,820.68 in dividends that increased their total return from 7.1% to 8.7%% per annum.(Note: Since this is a Dividend Champion, it has raised its dividend every year for at least 25 years, therefore, negative dividend growth rates shown, if any, will be attributed to special additional dividends paid in excess of the company's regularly reported dividend rate)The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio (the dark blue line) correlated with 10-year Treasury note interest. Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as low as it has been since 1993.A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company's current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio. The current price to sales ratio for Abbott Laboratories is 2.31, which is historically low.Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long-term returns, and the dividend and its growth rate are a function of two critical determinants:1. The rate of change (growth rate) of the company's earnings2. The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsTherefore, forecasting future earnings growth, bought at sound valuations, is the key to safe, sound and profitable performance.Therefore, it logically follows that measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done. At its current price, which is attractively aligned with its True Worth™ valuation, Abbott Laboratories represents a potential opportunity to invest in a Dividend Champion at a reasonable price. The important factor is that Abbott Laboratories has real assets and cash flow underpinning its stock price. This solid economic foundation offers shareholders the potential for both a strong margin of safety and an opportunity for an increasing dividend income stream and potentially attractive future returns.The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities. Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions.The consensus of 21 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Abbott Laboratories long-term earnings growth at 8%. Abbott Laboratories has medium long-term debt at 33% of capital. Abbott Laboratories is currently trading at a P/E of 12, which is inside the value corridor (defined by the five orange lines) of a maximum P/E of 18. If the earnings materialize as forecast, Abbott Laboratories' True Worth valuation would be $109.18 at the end of 2017, which would be a 14.2% annual rate of return from the current price, including assumed dividends.Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows: All companies derive their value from the future cash flows (earnings) they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time. Therefore, because Earnings Determine Market Price and dividend income in the long run, we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay.Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments, it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds. Comparing an investment in Abbott Laboratories to an equal investment in 10-year Treasury bonds illustrates that Abbott Laboratories' expected earnings would be 6.3 times that of the 10-Year T-Bond Interest. (See EYE chart below). This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component.Summary & ConclusionsThis report presents essential ""fundamentals at a glance"" on Dividend Champion Abbott Laboratories, illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported. Future forecasts for earnings growth are based on the consensus of leading analysts. Although with just a quick glance you can know a lot about the company, it's imperative that the reader conduct his or her own due diligence in order to validate whether the consensus estimates seem reasonable or not.Disclosure: I am long (ABT).Disclaimer: The opinions in this document are for informational and educational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell the stocks mentioned or to solicit transactions or clients.

It operates in four segments: Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Vascular Products. The company is a dividend aristocrat which has increased distributions for 39 years in a row. The most recent dividend increase was in February 2011, when the Board of Directors approved a 9.10% increase in the quarterly dividend to 48 cents/share. Abbott’s largest competitors include Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) and Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY).Over the past decade this dividend growth stock has delivered an annualized total return of 3.50% to its loyal shareholders.The company has managed to deliver an average increase in EPS of 12.90% per year since 2001. Analysts expect Abbott Laboratories to earn $4.65 per share in 2011 and $5.03 per share in 2012. This would be a nice increase from the $2.96/share the company earned in 2010.The growth would come from increase in sales in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis drug Humira and the Xience drug eluting stent. The company’s growth is also dependent on the successful integration of the pharmaceuticals unit that it purchased from Solvay for $6.2 billion in 2010, which included Abbott with the cholesterol drugs Tricor and Trilipix. New launches, and overseas market expansion should add in to Abbott's bottom line as well. Threats include generic competition to some of its cholesterol drugs. Abbott announced its intent to split in two companies in October 2011.The first one will be a research-based pharmaceuticals company, which will own Abbott’s premier drug names such as Humira, Lupron, Synagis to name a few. It would be basically a drug company, which focuses on keeping its pipeline of new drugs coming to the market, through constant investment in research and development. Drug companies have faced steep patent cliffs over the past several years, which has intensified mergers in the sector. The second company will be a diversified medical products company, and its name would remain Abbott. It would own established nutritional products, medical devices and diagnostics products as well as generic drugs outside of the US.The company has a high return on equity, which has remained above 20%, with the exception of a brief decrease in 2001 and 2006. Rather than focus on absolute values for this indicator, I generally want to see at least a stable return on equity over time.The annual dividend payment has increased by 8.60% per year since 2001. A 9% growth in distributions translates into the dividend payment doubling every eight years. If we look at historical data, going as far back as 1986, we see that Abbott Laboratories has actually managed to double its dividend every six years on average.Over the past decade the dividend payout ratio has largely remained above 50%. This indicator has been closer to 50% over the past few years. A lower payout is always a plus, since it leaves room for consistent dividend growth minimizing the impact of short-term fluctuations in earnings.Currently, Abbott Laboratories is attractively valued at 18.30 times earnings, yields 3.50% and has a sustainable dividend payout. In comparison Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) yields 3.50% and trades at a P/E of 14.50. I would continue monitoring Abbott Labs and will consider adding to a position in the stock on dips.Disclosure: Long ABT"

It has four segments: Pharmaceutical Products, which include a line of adult and pediatric pharmaceuticals manufactured, marketed, and sold directly to wholesalers and healthcare facilities; Diagnostic Products, which include a line of diagnostic systems and tests manufactured, marketed, and sold to hospitals and commercial laboratories; Nutritional Products, which include a line of pediatric and adult nutritional products, and Vascular Products, which include a line of coronary, endovascular, and vessel closure devices for the treatment of vascular disease. Abbott Laboratories is a dividend aristocrat that has raised its dividend for 39 consecutive years.A 10-year summary of Sales, Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT), Earnings per share (EPS), yearly high and low stock price, corresponding high and low P/E (calculated by dividing the high and low price by the EPS for the year), and average P/E (average of high and low P/E) is shown below.Key 10-year data for Abbott LaboratoriesFrom these data, we can plot Sales, EBIT, and EPS versus Year, as shown in the chart below.Sales (in Millions), EBIT (in Millions), and EPS versus Year for Abbott Laboratories, 2001-2010As evident from the above chart, ABT has demonstrated reasonably predictable sales and earnings over the past 10 years, allowing us to predict EPS in the near future, say in five years (i.e. Year 2016), using the linear regression equation for EPS = 0.2384 (2016) - 476.01 = 4.6044.A conservative average P/E estimate for the stock can be obtained as follows:Signature P/E: A well-established stock has a signature P/E, an average P/E it commands in the market based on its business. We calculate this by averaging the Average P/E over the past 10 years, excluding any outliers (data points that fall significantly beyond the other data points). The high P/Es in Year 2001 and 2006 are outliers, so we average the Average P/Es from the other 8 years to arrive at a signature P/E of 20.9.High P/E estimate: a conservative high P/E estimate can be calculated by averaging the five lowest High P/Es of the 10 High P/Es from the past 10 years. The 5 lowest High P/Es from the past 10 years are 15.5, 18.7, 19.7, 23.1, and 23.3, which average 20.1.Low P/E estimate: a conservative low P/E estimate can be calculated by averaging the five lowest Low P/Es of the 10 High P/Es from the past 10 years. The 5 lowest Low P/Es from the past 10 years are 11.2, 15.8, 16.3, 17.9, and 19.1, which average 16.1.Average P/E estimate: this takes the average of the High P/E estimate and the Low P/E estimate, as calculated above, to give a conservative estimate of an average P/E for the stock we can expect. Averaging 20.1 and 16.1 gives us 18.05.Target PriceMultiplying our EPS projection for 5 years hence by the average P/E estimate gives us a projected average price for the stock: $4.6044 * 18.05 = $83.13. Compared with the current price of $55.43, this represents an annual stock price return = 10.66%. When we add in the 3.46% dividend yield, the total return expected is an annualized 14.1%, which means an investment in ABT today is expected to double in a little over 5 years.Given a beta = 0.32 for ABT, a risk-free rate = 3% (using the yield on 30-year Treasury bond as a benchmark), and estimated risk premium of about 5% for the general stock market, we have a discount rate = 3% + 0.32*(5%) = 4.6%. Applying this discount rate of 4.6%, our projected price of $83.13 in 5 years translates to a target price of $66 in today's dollars, which is 20% below the current price of $55.43 for the stock. For a good margin of safety, investors are well advised to buy only if the current price is at least 20% below the target price, which means a price of $53.Market ExpectationWhat is the market's expectation of ABT's growth rate given its current market price of $55.43? Since stock price = dividend * (1 + growth rate) / (discount rate - growth rate), we have growth rate = ((stock price) * (discount rate) - dividend) / (stock price + dividend). Plugging in stock price of $55.43, dividend rate of $1.92, and discount rate of 4.6%, we get a growth rate of 1.1%. This seems low, given that ABT has grown its revenue by 9.5%, its earnings by 6.5%, and its dividend by 9.9% annually over the past 5 years. While the growth rate is supposed to slow down a bit as a company matures, a market expected growth rate of 1.1% suggests that the stock is currently undervalued. This may be due to the low discount rate used. As interest rates go up, the discount rate would increase accordingly.Current P/E Compared With Signature P/EAs an additional consideration, we should also determine how the stock's current P/E compares with its signature P/E, since established stocks tend to revert back to their respective signature P/Es over the long term. Current EPS = 2.9, giving us a current P/E = 19. This is 91% of the stock's signature P/E of 21, which suggests the stock is currently slightly undervalued. In general, we should look to buy when the current P/E is 80% or less of the stock's signature P/E, which means a price of $48.47.Risk IndexLastly, we calculate the Risk Index, calculated as (Current Price - Forecast Low Price)/ (Potential High Price - Forecast Low Price) to give an estimate of the risk: reward ratio. Risk index less than 20% is desired, which gives us +200% potential returns for every risk of 50% loss we assume.The Forecast Low Price is calculated by multiplying the Low P/E estimate by the Forecast Low EPS, to give a conservative estimate of low price for the stock in 5 years, assuming zero EPS growth and low valuation. Forecast Low EPS is estimated by averaging the EPS over the past 5 years. For growth stocks with predictable earnings growth, EPS in 5 years should not be any lower than this conservative estimate. For ABT, the forecast low EPS is equal to 2.624, so the Forecast Low Price = 16.1 * 2.624 = $42.13.The Potential High Price is calculated by multiplying the High P/E estimate by the projected EPS in 5 years, giving us a price target in 5 years should the stock command a high P/E. For ABT, this equals 20.1 * 4.6044 = $92.33.Thus, the Risk Index = ($55.43 - $42.13) / ($92.33 - $42.13) = 26%. Since this is greater than 20%, the stock has an unfavorable reward to risk ratio at the current price. A pullback to $52 would give a risk index below 20%.ConclusionAbbott Laboratories, currently selling at $55.43, has a target price of $66. While the stock currently offers good expected returns and is selling at a discount to its historic valuation, there is not enough margin of safety to buy at the current price, which is near the stock's 52-week high. I therefore rate the stock a Hold at the current price, but recommend buying on a pullback to $48-52 as a long-term investment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Disclaimer: Use this information as a starting point for your own due diligence, before buying any stock.

317965,22561,2012-01-06T15:21:10-05:00,,"Many companies offer quarterly (or more often) dividends to shareholders. This can be a great source of income and with each dividend payment received; investors are able to lower their risk in an investment. Many investors will buy a stock in part because of the dividend and the current yield. The one basic requirement to receive a dividend from a company is to be a shareholder on the day of record for the dividend.Because stock transactions do not happen in real time and are settled three business days after an order is filled (It used to be five days), there is also a term called ""ex-dividend date."" The ex-dividend date is the first day that the stock is trading after eligibility for a shareholder to receive an announced dividend is past.With the only requirement of owning shares for one overnight period it would seem pretty simple to just buy a dividend paying stock the day before it trades ex-dividend, sell the next day when it trades ex-dividend, and sit back and collect the ""free"" dividend from the company. The problem with a simple buy and hold overnight is the market is efficient enough to factor in the dividend. As a result a stock will often open up the next day near the previous day's close less the dividend paid.You would be forgiven for thinking there is nothing to see and it is time to move on to the next idea. What changes the outlook is the ability to offset the change in stock price through the use of stock options. By selling an in the money call option on the stock it is possible to get past the price drop barrier. In order to use in the money options as a hedge there must be enough time premium in the option so that if you get exercised the day before the ex-dividend date you are still making enough money to make it worth your while.Finding a needle in a stock option haystack; every week I go through upcoming ex-dividend dates and compare the dividend, yield, strike prices, trading volume, relative stock risk, and option premium to find stocks that may be good candidates for a dividend capture strategy.I generally hold any given position for about three weeks. Now I use a few methods that produce consistent results. With the gains made, I am able to stop out and take a loss with the few that do not work out as planned. When learning a new trading strategy it is better to use a simulated trading account first.Before entering into a dividend capture trade I check to see if any news may be upcoming during the holding period. Events like earnings, government approval results, and other potentially large share price impacting events are reasons to avoid a company. If everything is in order my first step of entering the position is to sell at or near the asking price of the hedging call option. The next step is to buy the shares of stock. I have this process automated including the asking price of the option, but this step can easily be completed manually with many stocks.Generally after writing the covered call I just sit and wait it out. The day before a stock trades ex-dividend is a busy time for stock options to get exercised. Often the premium on options falls in front of an ex-dividend date so much that it is in the option holders financial best interest to exercise the option and collect the dividend compared to selling the option. When exercised early from the option owner I don't make as much as possible if the stock is held into the ex-dividend date, but I also free up the capital quicker and remove the risk of loss much quicker. When this happens my profit is the premium over the intrinsic value of the option (the time premium). Otherwise, I collect the dividend and put on the market the stock and option with a target profit.As long as the stock is trading above the strike price on option expiration day, the stock gets called away and the trade is finished. In these cases I get to collect the time premium of the option on top of the dividend amount collected. If the stock is trading below the strike price I will usually exit at a loss and call it good unless I am willing to own the shares. If I am willing to own the shares I write another call option for the next front month.Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) engages in the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of health care products worldwide.

Strategy:In combination with my buying Abbott Laboratories stock and after checking company updates, offer to sell the January $50.00 strike call for $0.13 over the intrinsic value. The option may get exercised early for a gain. In almost all cases I will sell the call option first to ensure the stock option leg is complete first. If not, after qualifying for the dividend, I will attempt to close out the trade with a gain of near $0.07.Remember, you must buy a stock at least three business days before the record date (at least one business day before the ex-dividend date) to qualify for a dividend.I use a proprietary blend of technical analysis, financial crowd behavior, and fundamentals in my short-term trades, and while not totally the same in longer swing trades to investments, the concepts used are similar.

318815,25159,2012-01-11T08:48:03-05:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) stock has been on a roll, just off 52-week highs and now approaching all-time highs. I decided to take a closer look in the stock and see if it is worth pursuing at these prices. Here are the 6 points I looked at:Valuation: Abbott’s five-year trailing valuation metrics suggest that the stock is slightly undervalued. Abbott’s current P/B ratio is 3.5 and it has averaged 4.1 over the past five years with a high of 6.0 and a low of 3.1. Abbott’s P/S ratio is 2.3 and it has averaged 2.7 over the past five years with a high of 3.6 and a low of 2.1. Abbott’s current P/E ratio is 19.3 and it has averaged 21.7 over the past five years with a high of 55.3 and a low of 13.4.Price Target: The consensus price target for the analysts who follow Abbott is $58. That is upside of 2% from ABT’s current stock price. That is very limited upside.Forward Valuation: Analysts forecast that Abbott will earn $5.03 per share next year. With a current stock price of $55.86, that is a forward P/E multiple of 11.1. Although there are no direct comps because of patents and proprietary products involved, it makes sense to look at what other large drug stocks are trading at. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is trading 11.7 times next year’s earnings. Merck (NYSE:MRK) is trading 10.0 times next year’s earnings. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is trading 9.3 times next year’s earnings. Abbott is trading just above the mean forward P/E for the four large-cap drug stocks.Earnings Estimates: Abbott beat EPS estimates the last four quarters, each time by one penny. This suggests there won’t be any upside earnings surprises any time soon for the company as analysts have a good idea of where earnings will be for the company.Free Cash Flow: Abbott generates significant free cash flow and has averaged $6.6 billion in free cash over its past three fully reported fiscal years. Some of that cash has gone to business expansion and some of it has been returned to shareholders through dividends. Abbott has paid out over $2 billion in dividends in each of its last three fully reported fiscal years. In the first nine months of 2011, the company generated free cash flow of over $6 billion and has paid out more than $2 billion in dividends.Abbott’s current quarterly dividend is 48 cents a share, which is a yield of over 3%. The company has paid a dividend since 1990 and the payout has doubled in the past eight years, making it a worthwhile Dividend Aristocrat.Price Action: Abbott’s stock has been on a roll this year, up more than 15% over the past year. The stock did run into some trouble in August when there was some weakness in the broader market, but quickly recovered and set new highs. The stock is about 2% above its 50-day moving average right now and just off 52-week highs. Short-term support sits at $55 followed by $53.(Click chart to expand)Conclusion: Abbott generates very strong and stable cash flows and pays a nice dividend. However, at this point, the stock is fairly valued and not worth an investment. It is not trading at a significant discount relative to peers and analysts do not expect much upside from the stock. The estimates will change however if the company adds another product to its portfolio that opens up a new cash flow stream.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Additionally, 25% of 2010 worldwide sales were from emerging markets giving the company a strong foothold in countries expected to provide 70% of the growth in the healthcare market in the next 5 years.Abbott is the leader in treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, psoriasis, cholesterol management, HIV, and testosterone replacement. Growing at a 20% annual rate, HUMIRA, the company’s largest prescription drug, has over 500,000 patients in 83 countries. Abbott is the fastest-growing international nutritional company with double-digit international sales growth. Market leading nutrition brands include the number one infant formula, Similac, and the number one hospital product, Ensure.In vascular products, Abbott’s XIENCE line is the number one drug-eluting stent, and the company is also the leader in bare metal stents, carotid stents and guide wires. Abbott is a leader in research with over 30 new medical devices in development and a pharmaceutical pipeline that has tripled new molecular entities in development over the last four years. STRONG THIRD QUARTER Abbott reported double-digit revenue growth in the third quarter with sales of $9.8 billion. This is the 17th quarter out of the last 18 with double-digit growth despite the worldwide recession. Emerging market sales grew 21% and now represent 26% of worldwide sales. HUMIRA continued to grow over 20% annually. Abbott reaffirmed its 2011 EPS projection in the range of $3.10-$3.12. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of $.48 per share, the 351st consecutive quarterly dividend paid since 1924. Abbott’s dividend currently yields a healthy 3.7%.CORPORATE SPIN-OFFAbbott recently announced a tax-free distribution to shareholders realigning its business into two entities. One entity retaining the Abbott name will be a diversified medical products company including branded generic pharmaceuticals, medical devices, diagnostics and nutrition. With $22 billion in sales, Abbott will focus on diversified products with most of its sales generated outside the U.S. and in fast growing emerging markets. This entity should produce high single-digit sales growth and double-digit EPS growth.The second business will focus on proprietary pharmaceuticals and biologics with a sustainable portfolio of market leading brands, including HUMIRA, Creon and Synthroid. Additionally, the business will have a strong pipeline of innovative R&D assets with more than 20 new compounds or indications in phase 2 and 3 development and $18 billion in sales. It will focus on developed markets for the sale of select specialty products and breakthrough innovations.Although the details of the transaction, which is expected to close by year-end 2012, are still being worked out, both firms are projected to have strong balance sheets and cash flows with dividends equal to the current combined entity. While we like the economies of scale and diversified business base of the current company, the realignment appears to be based on a sound business strategy which should provide for the long-term growth of the separate entities.

312614,22810,2011-12-08T08:44:23-05:00,,"On Monday morning, Reuters published an article about Abbott (NYSE:ABT) CEO Miles White denouncing a possible sale of the pharmaceutic division at a conference in London. Is this news: hardly, what should we expect him to say? If he’s selling it, he’s probably going to continue the line: “It’s a great company, why would we sell it,” not wanting to lose any leverage in possible negotiations. If he’s not selling, well he’s going to say he’s not selling it.Back in October I mentioned selling the pharmaceutical divisions as one probable motivation for the split. But I wasn’t alone, a few other analysts also believed the pharmaceutical division was up for sell including an analyst from Jefferies.On the day of the announcement 37 million shares change hands representing about 4.5x the average daily volume. Of course this should not be a surprise that the largest share volume spike in Abbott history happens when it makes the biggest announcement in modern history. I’m willing to bet a large number of funds were placing bets on M&A activity associate with the split.Over the last 3 days after the conference where CEO White and CFO Gonzalez denied that the pharmaceutical company was up for sale, we have seen below-average volume, Implying minimal market impacted from this recent conference.This shouldn’t surprise us? Maybe not, I mentioned earlier, whether he’s selling it or not, he’s going to give the same line.But maybe we should be surprised, given some new information. Namely this quote from the CEO:""You're probably going to end up with two companies that are in the $40-45 billion range on day one.”Why is that interesting? Well most analysts have the Pharma business valued much higher around the time of the split in October. Here’s some of the more reputable banks where I was able to find sum-of-the-parts valuation numbers. Figure 1: Average of a range was used for Leerink Swann’s price target. If he was going to sell the pharmaceutical company, I don’t believe he would have mentioned the companies as having about equal value, especially since the majority of the analyst believe the pharmaceutical company has a higher value. This means that either this company is not for sale, or Miles Whites is the absolute worst negotiator of all time.Change in ValuationWhen I valued the company in October I had the Pharmaceutical company at 28.50 with a probably of a buyout at 40 percent at about 35 dollars a share giving it a total value of $31 dollars a share. I valued the diversified health care company at $28-30 dollars a share. Given the recent announcement I now believe the additional buyout premium cannot be added to the total value of the company. This gives the total company valuation at $56.5-58.5 a share. With an equity risk premium of 5.2 percent, this company is about fairly valued.RecommendationI believe the street has priced in a possible sell of the pharmaceutical division. I believe this means there is some small immediate term downside risk, probably of about 2 percent as it becomes more apparent to the market the sale will not happen.This company is still a buy for the most conservative and dividend seeking investors. It does however lose its luster for most capital appreciation portfolios and those looking to profit on potential M&A activity. Disclosure: I am currently long ABT but I will be selling in the next couple weeks."

In Abbott Laboratories' (NYSE:ABT) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $65 per share, slightly higher than where it is currently trading.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Abbott Laboratories posts a VBI score of 6 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment, its neutral relative valuation versus peers, and bullish techinicals. Abbott Laboratories is competitive with Merck (NYSE:MRK) (based on our VBI score), and both outperform Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), and Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY). However, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) has the best VBI score within the peer group, coming in at 9 (10 is best).Our Report on Abbott Laboratories imagesInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsAbbott Laboratories earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track recordwe view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 27.4% during the past three years.The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. If the firm's share price fell below $49, we'd take a closer look.Abbott Laboratories has a good combination of strong free cash flow generation and manageable financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 20.5% in coming years. Totaldebt-to-EBITDA was 2.1 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 45.8%.The firm's share price performance has trailed that of the market during the past quarter. However, it is trading within our fair value estimate range, so we don't view such activity as alarming.The firm sports a very nice dividend yield of 3.6%. We expect the firm to pay out about 44% of next year's earnings to shareholders as dividends. We are considering the firm for addition to the portfolio in our Dividend Growth Newsletter.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Abbott Laboratories' 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 27.4%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.9%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead (for the combined entity) based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Abbott To Split Into TwoAbbott announced plans to split its existing business into two distinct publicly-traded entities. According to its recent press release: ""The diversified medical products company will consist of Abbott's existing diversified medical products portfolio, including its branded generic pharmaceutical, devices, diagnostic and nutritional businesses, and will retain the Abbott name...The research-based pharmaceutical company will include Abbott's current portfolio of proprietary pharmaceuticals and biologics and will be named later…The research-based pharmaceutical company has nearly $18 billion in annual revenue today and will have a sustainable portfolio of market-leading brands, including Humira, Lupron, Synagis, Kaletra, Creon and Synthroid…The diversified medical products company has approximately $22 billion in annual revenue today and a durable mix of products balanced across four major businesses.""In all, we think such a split will allow two separate management teams to improve operations, implement cost savings, and allocate capital better than they could do as one entity. Further, we like the research-based pharma company's attractive pipeline, and the diversified medical products company's emerging market potential. CEO Miles White will head the diversified medical products company, while Richard A. Gonzalez, executive vice president (Global Pharma) will become chairman and CEO of the research-based pharma company. The transaction is intended to be a tax-free stock distribution to Abbott shareholders, and management expects that both companies' dividends, when combined, will equal the current Abbott dividend at the time of separation, which is expected to be completed by the end of 2012. We are anxiously awaiting the split to better analyze the economic characteristics of each entity.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Abbott Laboratories' free cash flow margin has averaged about 21.3% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Abbott Laboratories, cash flow from operations increased about 24% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 21% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Abbott Laboratories' shares (for the combined entity and at this time) are worth between $49 and $81 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $65 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 20.5 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 12.6 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 4.5% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 10.7%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 25.5%, which is above Abbott Laboratories' trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.1% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Abbott Laboratories, we use a 9.9% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $65 per share at this time (for the combined entity), every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Abbott Laboratories. We think the firm is attractive below $49 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $81 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Abbott Laboratories' fair value at this point in time to be about $65 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Abbott Laboratories' expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $80 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $65 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

311894,21835,2011-12-05T15:07:14-05:00,,"Linked here is a detailed quantitative analysis of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). Below are some highlights from the above linked analysis:Company Description: Abbott Laboratories is a diversified life science company that is a leading maker of drugs, nutritional products, diabetes monitoring devices, and diagnostics. In mid-October 2011, Abbott announced plans to split the company.Fair Value: In calculating fair value, I consider the NPV MMA Differential Fair Value along with these four calculations of fair value, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description: Abbott is trading at a discount to 1.) and 3.) above. Since Abbott's tangible book value is not meaningful, a Graham number can not be calculated. The stock is trading at a 19.8% discount to its calculated fair value of $67.95. Abbott earned a star in this section since it is trading at a fair value.  Dividend Analytical Data: In this section there are three possible stars and three key metrics, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:Abbott earned three stars in this section for 1.), 2.) and 3.) above. A star was earned since the Free Cash Flow payout ratio was less than 60% and there were no negative Free Cash Flows over the last 10 years. The stock earned a star as a result of its most recent Debt to Total Capital being less than 45%. Abbott earned a star for having an acceptable score in at least two of the four Key Metrics measured. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1926 and has increased its dividend payments for 39 consecutive years.   Dividend Income vs. MMA: Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account (MMA) or Treasury bond? This section compares the earning ability of this stock with a high yield MMA. Two items are considered in this section, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:Abbott earned a star in this section for its NPV MMA Diff. of the $1,576. This amount is in excess of the $500 target I look for in a stock that has increased dividends as long as Abbott has. If Abbott grows its dividend at 8.4% per year, it will take one year to equal a MMA yielding an estimated 20-year average rate of 3.6%. Abbott earned a check for the Key Metric 'Years to >MMA' since its one year is less than the 5 year target.   Memberships and Peers: Abbott is a member of the S&P 500, a Dividend Aristocrat and a member of the Broad Dividend Achievers™ Index and a Dividend Champion. The company's peer group includes: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) with a 4.2% yield, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) with a 3.6% yield, and Eli Lilly & Co. (NYSE:LLY) with a 5.3% yield.  Conclusion: Abbott earned one star in the Fair Value section, earned three stars in the Dividend Analytical Data section and earned one star in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a total of five stars. This quantitatively ranks Abbott as a 5 star-very strong stock.  Using my D4L-PreScreen.xls model, I determined the share price would need to increase to $80.07 before Abbott's NPV MMA Differential decreased to the $500 minimum that I look for in a stock with 39 years of consecutive dividend increases. At that price the stock would yield 2.6%.  Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the target $500 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 4.6%. This dividend growth rate is lower than the 8.4% used in this analysis, thus providing a margin of safety. Abbott has a risk rating of 1.25 which classifies it as a Low risk stock.  All pharmaceutical companies face the inevitable patent expirations and the ensuing generic competition. However, Abbott has a strong product pipeline including potential significant launches in the medical device and pharmaceutical areas. The company's decision in mid-October to split itself into a drug company and a diversified health-care company should result in two well-positioned companies. The spin off should be completed by the end of 2012.   With its strong financials and excellent management team, Abbott is in a position to continue its growth (internal, acquisitions and through strategic partnerships) and to generate strong returns. I am currently over-allocated in Abbott, and will continue to add to my position while it is trading below my buy price of $68.81 and as my allocation allows.  Full Disclosure: At the time of this writing, I was long Abbott (5.3% of my Dividend Growth Portfolio) and also held positions in JNJ.

312120,21877,2011-12-06T09:26:54-05:00,,"Miles White, chief executive of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), Monday poured cold water on the suggestion that the group is splitting itself up in the hope of attracting a buyer for one or both of its newly created businesses. Speaking at the FT Pharmaceutical & Biotechnology Conference, Mr White said either business was most probably too big for any other company to comfortably swallow. “To the question whether the pharma business is an acquisition candidate, the answer is 'no',” he said. “The company today has a market cap of around $80bn-$85bn, which means the two companies would have a market cap of $40bn-$45bn.” Underlining his point, Mr White said that the group was not seeking to sell the businesses or “merge them away” and that any potential acquirer would have to have a lot of cash to secure the businesses and the agreement of senior management, a situation that was unlikely to occur. “You would have to get the agreement of the CFO and that would be a tough 'yes',” he said.  Low value proposition Talking about the decision to split the company, a move that was announced in October, Mr White said it had been partly driven by the changes in the investment landscape, that had seen investors expect returns in the form of dividends and cash, and place little or no value on pipeline products (Abbott spin off will test market's appetite for R&D, October 20, 2011). “Investors want more of their return in cash and won't value the pipeline until it is phase III and they can see the whites of its eyes,” he said. This strategy takes the company in a polar opposite direction to the likes of GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK) and  Novartis (NYSE:NVS). Abbott is creating a diversified medical products group – containing its faster growing and emerging market-focused branded generic pharmaceuticals, devices, diagnostic and  nutritional businesses - and a research-based pharmaceutical group.  As part of the shake up, Mr White will run the diversified medical products group.  From generics to innovation As well as quashing the hopes of investment bankers by ruling out a sale of either business, Mr White also predicted the rise of original research out of countries that have traditionally been associated with generics. “Countries like India and China are moving into much more sophisticated research and I think European and US companies are making a mistake in underestimating that,” he said (Vantage Point – Indian scientists on quest for country’s first novel molecule, November 2, 2010)."
302432,22810,2011-10-26T15:59:56-04:00,,"While some industry experts and analysts were advocating a breakup in Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) the timing and decision seems interesting. What really is to gain by the breakup?Many analysts and industry experts believe the market was undervaluing the company based on the different investment profiles and failure to capture synergies across very different divisions. But why now and why choose to keep the diversified healthcare company, which has lower earnings and is valued significantly lower by most analyst using sum-of-the-parts valuations?While I was not one for advocating the split between divisions at Abbott Laboratories, looking backwards, it does seem to make sense. Looking forward I don’t believe the market has fully appreciated the gains on the separation of the entities and the real reason for the breakup. I believe we will see a 8-15 percent stock appreciation in the year until the split and still receive the nice 3.5 percent dividend in the meantime.Looking at the parts  Pharma  The overall pharma industry from a macro standpoint has a lot of headwinds. Particularly we see a lot of uncertainty in the regulation of the industry, uncertainty in FDA approvals, and pressures on reimbursements. The well-known patent cliff may be over blown, however we still lack the vision to accurately forecast the future of the blockbuster. The brute force method of creating compounds is still widely used by the pharmaceutical with little adaptation.Here’s a look at its proprietary drugs on the marketHumira by all accounts is a Blockbuster but it may face competition in the next few years and it comes off patent in 2016/2017. Humira IS the pharmaceutical portfolio. Its sales may hit 8 billion this year and 9 billion next year.The pipeline is not terrible but nothing gets the street too excited right now. There are 20 compounds in Phase 2 or higher. My belief is that the company trades at a multiple consistent with the market expecting almost nothing in the pipeline. Bardoxolone, for chronic kidney disease (CKD), has blockbuster potential because of the huge growing market and the recurring sales but it lacks the rights in the US market where CKD growth and market size is the highest. There are a few compounds with promise that can be multibillion dollar drugs, but still lots of uncertainty.Though this company has some promise in its pipeline, underlining risk and uncertainty prevent me from believing in the value proposition promised by most of big pharma and in the overall promise of the business model. Using a risk adjusted DCF with a discount rate of 14 percent and terminal growth rate of 4 percent I value the company at about $28.50 dollars a share.Diverse healthcare(Click charts to enlarge)  The diverse healthcare consists of 4 segments growing with high single to double digit growth. Growth is extremely consistent and global. US markets and EU markets are penetrated and growing at a slow but stable rate in most industries. Emerging markets are underpenetrated and growing rapidly. This company has many different growing segments, huge geographic sales dispersions, and diversity of payers.  Nutritionals  This segment has the brands we all know a little about: Ensure, Pedisure, Pedialyte. They also have sports nutrient products such as EAS and In Zone Percent. Abbott is uniquely positioned in these areas because of its great reputation with healthcare professionals. Therefore its products have a consumer psychological advance over other nutritionals.These products contribute 25 to 30 percent of company total revenue. Given their low risk, I don’t see any catalyst in this particular area; it is looking at medium and consistent growth. The growth will touch all markets with most in the emerging markets, making it a safe product line in almost all market conditions. This market is expected to grow to 40 billion dollars by 2015. Abbott should be positioned well with demographic trends, serving both aging populations in the developed world and high birthrates in the developing world. Expect low double digit growth going forward and for it to be Abbott’s number one source of revenue.Diagnostics  This consists of core diagnostics, molecular diagnostics, and point of care.Core: Comprising the largest amount of Abbott’s diagnostic revenue. Consistent revenue and low risk business.Molecular: It is experiencing double digit growth and will continue to see double digit growth in the long run. We expect this to be a very large and very profitable area in 10 years. Abbott dominates areas such as PCR and FISH.Point of Care: Includes products such as the i-STAT. Nothing interesting and lacks any downside or upside catalyst, just high single digit year-on-year consistent growth. Expect a continued push oversea with the bedside testing.Molecular diagnostics will have huge double digit growth and point of care and core will see single digit growth.Abbott Medical Devices  Vascular Devices: Includes Absorb Drug eluting stents and core coronary. It has huge product portfolio and dominates the market in many areas. Sales growth overseas is playing the largest role in its growth and we can expect that going forward. Looking forward MitraClip is under FDA review and could be a nice contributor.Vision: Eye care solution, LASIK, and cataracts. All growing product lines in multiple areas of the world.Diabetes: Monitoring systems and Insulin pumps. These play to demographic trends since diabetes affects 220 million people worldwide in 2010 and is growing.Generic Pharma  Represented by more than 500 generic drugs, this business is truly global. Its characteristics are similar across the globe with out-of-pocket payers. Recent acquisitions make the company now the number one drug company in India. Making drugs has been a part of Abbott’s strengths for years, don’t expect that to change. Look for continued growth globally especially in emerging markets.Value of diversified health company  Although the Diversified healthcare company represents over 50 percent of sales, it only contributes 35-40 percent of earnings. Revenue will increase in the high single digits for the next few years. I suspect margin expansion will continue and we should see double digit bottom line growth. I believe Abbott will surprise to the upside with earnings for ABT diversified healthcare at around $2 per share. This estimate excludes restructuring costs. This estimate may change very quickly as more information about the new company split continues. Using a combination of multiple comps and adjustments I believe ABT should be valued between 14-15X 2012 earnings. This brings the company to a value of $28 to $30 dollars per share.What’s to Gain in the break-up?  Complete change in investment profile  The pharma business and health/Device business have completely different risk profiles and completely different drivers for investors. Its previous model made it unattractive for investors looking for a pharmaceutical company (40 percent of the revenue in other products) and unattractive for companies that wanted diversified medical products with exposure to international markets. Overall most experts would agree with this view, but how much stock appreciation does this bring and is it worth the additional cost of the break-up?Costs of the breakup  The highest cost comes in the form of restructuring debt. The new proprietary pharmaceutical company will need to build new teams in various other areas of the business. In all I believe the company's leaders when they say the additional cost and additional expenses of the split should even out. Operations and acquisitions may also be affected; now extra cash from highly performing units can no longer be used to invest in pipelines.Divisional Cross Divisional partnerships  As the paradigm for personalized medicine continues on its path, we are likely to see partnerships between pharma and diagnostics firms. Though Abbott was unsuccessful in using the two businesses synergistically in order to build the pharmacogenomics relationship, it seems strange to close that door before any real efforts were under way.Investors finally having a solid choice. But what is that choice?  Before the split the main problems of the company were overreliance on Humira and lack of major opportunity in the pipeline. After the split one company will have even more overreliance on Humira and a lack of proven or solid prospects in the pipeline. Before about 20 percent of the company’s revenue came from Humira, now the pharmaceutical company will have almost 50 percent of sales coming from one drug that’s facing competition in the next few years. Not to mention close to 80 percent of the earnings by the time it is a separate entity. All the problems were just shifted to one company.While I believe the pharma business has assets in the pipeline, including a few multibillion dollar prospects, the headwinds in the pharmaceutical industry just do not give the risk reward proposition most analyst have modeled for the proprietary pharma business. While I believe the market exaggerates the patent cliff, it is present. Future success of pharma will be contingent on personalized medicine and pharmacogenomics. Increasingly we will be seeing a reimbursement money shifting from therapy to diagnostics. But only one of these two companies will benefit.Chance of buyout  I believe the proprietary pharmaceutical company may be unofficially now up for sale. I give the deal a 40 percent chance. I believe the sale could happen before the spin-off actually happens or in about 2 years when pharmaceutical companies are more likely to consolidate. If the business is sold, we will most likely see only a slight premium given to its valuation. There are a few factors that play a role in this estimation: Abbott lacks leverage since its threat to run independently is somewhat shaky. Large pharma knows about the complications and possible diseconomies of scale in trying to combined two large pharmaceutical companies. There is however value in the pipeline for companies willing to bare the risk and Humira will offer some very nice cash flows over the next 4 to 5 years. This will be quiet tempting for a buyer. Some possible bidders might be Bayer AG (OTCPK:BAYZF) or AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN). I wouldn’t count out Roche (OTC:RCHBF) or Merck & Co (NYSE:MRK) even though they both have RA therapies. Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) has already said it is not interested, and Johnson and Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) will mostly likely be a seller on the M&A front.Why buy the stock now?  I don’t believe the market fully understands the angle and appreciates the promise of the split. From Wednesday's stock price to today’s market open we have only seen a change from $52.44 to $52.99. While I believe the market overvalues the proprietary pharma division, I believe this increases the likelihood that it gets bought at a premium to its real value.The total value of the company is as follows: With a valuation of pharma at ~$28.50 based on a DCF analysis and a ~40 percent chance of getting bought out at $35 per share we get a total of ~$31 per share. The diversified healthcare company is worth ~$28-$30, bringing the total value of the company to ~$59-$61 dollars or 10-14 percent undervalued.I believe the real reasoning for this split is that Abbott and Miles White believe the strength of Abbott is the nutritionals, generics, diagnostics, and stents, and the proprietary pharmaceutical division has a risk profile that drags the entire company down. Miles White had a choice of which company to run and he chose the part of the company with a lower valuation according to most of the street. Some analysts even mentioned only 25 percent of the presplit equity value. I believe internally they believe the street overvalues the proprietary pharmaceutical business and are looking to sell. This new company does not have a name and I believe Mr. White would like to sell it before it gets one.So how do you play this:  Most of the street/analysts value the pharmaceutical division too high. This will probably work in ABT’s favor as it may be looking for buyers over the next year and a half. Most analysts undervalue the diversified medical company. Although I’m not totally sold on the long-term prospects of the pharma company, I think you can hold this company through the split, since most of the upside/downside catalysts are a couple years away. Then you wait, see a little bit of appreciation as the value of the split is realized, get a nice dividend, and sell the shares of the proprietary pharmaceutical company if it is not sold off by Abbott.Disclosure: I am long ABT."

Abbott recently announced that it will split into two companies: One of the new companies will specialize in diversified medical products; the other will specialize in research-based pharmaceuticals. Seeking Alpha contributor Analytical Chemist expects both companies to be highly profitable with a strong growth rate of 13%.As of October 26, Abbott stock was trading at $53, with a 52-week range of $43.84 - $55.61. It has a market cap of $82.5 billion. Trailing twelve month (ttm) P/E ratio is 18.27, and forward P/E ratio is 10.56. P/B, P/S, and P/CF ratios stand at 3.1, 2.2, and 8.7, respectively. The 3-year annualized revenue and EPS growth stand at 10.7% and 8.6%, respectively. Operating margin is 16.3%, and net profit margin is 13.8%. The company has some debt issues. Debt-to-equity ratio is 0.5. Abbott pays nifty dividends. The stock has been able to raise its dividends for 39 consecutive years. Current yield is 3.62%.Abbott has a 5-star rating from Morningstar. It is categorized as a large-core company. While its trailing P/E ratio is 18.27, it has a 5-year average P/E ratio of 23.2. Thus, Abbott is trading below its historical P/E ratio. Out of 24 analysts covering the company, 7 have buy, 5 have outperform, 11 have hold, and 1 has sell ratings. Wall Street has diverse opinions on Abbott’s future. The bottom line is 0.6% growth, whereas the top-line growth estimate is 13.5% for the next year. Average five-year annualized growth forecast estimate is 10%.What is the fair value of Abbott, given the forecast estimates? We can estimate Abbott’s fair value using discounted earnings plus equity model as follows.Discounted Earnings Plus Equity ModelThis model is primarily used for estimating the returns from long-term projects. It is also frequently used to price fair-valued IPOs. The methodology is based on discounting the present value of the future earnings to the current period:V = E0 + E1 /(1+r) + E2 /(1+r)2 + E3/(1+r)3 + E4/(1+r)4 + E5/(1+r)5 + Disposal ValueV = E0 + E0 (1+g)/(1+r) + E0(1+g)2/(1+r)2 + … + E0(1+g)5/(1+r)5 + E0(1+g)5/[r(1+r)5]The earnings after the last period act as a perpetuity that creates regular earnings:Disposal Value = D = E0(1+g)5/[r(1+r)5] = E5 / rWhile this formula might look scary, it easily calculates the fair value of a stock. All we need is the current-period earnings, earnings growth estimate, and the discount rate. To be as objective as possible, I use Morningstar data for my growth estimates. You can set these parameters as you wish, according to your own diligence.ValuationHistorically, the average return of the Dow Jones industrials has been around 11% (including dividends). Therefore, I will use 11% as my discount rate. In order to smooth the results, I will also take the average of ttm EPS of $2.90 along with the mean EPS estimate of $5.02 for the next year (Finviz).E0 = EPS = ($2.90 + $5.02) / 2 = $3.96Wall Street holds diversified opinions on the company’s future. While analysts tend to impose subjective opinions on their estimates, the average analyst estimate is a good starting point. Average five-year growth forecast is 10% (Morningstar). Book value per share is $16.95.The rest is as follows:You can download FED+ Fair Value Estimator here.I decided to add the book value per share so that we can distinguish between a low-debt and debt-loaded company. The lower boundary does not include the book value. According to my 5-year discounted-earnings-plus-book-value model, the fair-value range for Abbott is between $57.64 and $74.59 per share. While Abbott returned 15% since the last month, it still has at least 8% upside potential to reach its fair value range. Moreover, the stock has up to 41% upside potential to reach the upper boundary of its fair-value range.SummaryIllinois-based Abbott is one of the largest pharmaceuticals in the world. In an industry where takeovers and acquisitions are common, Abbott decided to separate itself into two companies. Chemical Analyst suggests the new Abbott is more likely to concentrate on its core business. It is also expected to have significant international exposure, where two-thirds of its revenue will come from international sales.In the last 5 years, Abbott was able to increase its earnings per share at annual rate of 6.64%. The company is highly profitable with a gross margin of 59%, and net profit margin of 11.84%. Abbott’s O-Metrix score of 4.72 is in line with the market average.Similar to what FED+ model suggests, analysts also agree with me. Their mean target price of $58.60 implies almost 11% upside potential. Abbott has a very low Beta of 0.31. The company has more than doubled its dividend in the last decade. In 2001 the quarterly dividend was $0.21 cents; it was raised to $0.48 by 2011. In its most recent earnings report, Abbott confirmed its double-digit growth outlook, and has beaten the analyst estimates. With a payout ratio of 64%, dividends have plenty of room for growth. That is why I think Abbott is a dividend stock pick for the next 5 years. Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
302206,23727,2011-10-26T06:19:20-04:00,,"I recently had a discussion with a financial advisor/investor about using cash flow to value a company. He brought up as an example Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT), saying he was investing based upon a perceived high free cash flow yield; greater than 10%, which was estimated from a computer scan. The discussion led me to more closely look at the reported annual cash flow from 2000-2010.I began to compare the changes on the balance sheet of ABT to the changes reported on the statement of cash flows. The data was downloaded from SEC fillings and advfn.com.The way that one prepares the statement of cash flows using the indirect method is that any increase in a non-cash asset on the balance sheet is a subtraction to cash flows. A reduction in a non-cash asset on the balance sheet is an addition to cash flows. As an example, if accounts receivable (AR) increased from 100 to 150, over the course of a year, then -50 would be recorded under the line item AR on the statement of cash flows. If AR decreased from 100 to 50 then +50 would be recorded. If one still does not understand this process, I would hope this link would help or you can google ""indirect method statement of cash flows"".Let's look at trade receivables as reported by the change in cash flows verses changes on the balance sheet ( all data in thousands). Click to enlarge:The change using the figure derived from the balance sheet would be reported as -642,093 for 2010. I did not make this figure negative on the spreadsheet since the absolute difference of 642,093 + (-394,665) is the same as -642,093 - (-394,665).Under the line item Trade Receivable, ABT showed an outflow of $3.46 Billion over 10 years on its cash flow statement vs. $5 Billion as shown on the balance sheet. The difference between the two was over $1.5 Billion dollars.Next, look at inventories. Click to enlarge:One can see again that the difference over 10 years adds up to over $1.1BillionOne sees similar patterns when looking at prepaid expenses. I tried to match up as closely as possible the line items from the balance sheet and statement of cash flows, any difference of title is found in the original filing. Click to enlarge:The difference over 10 years is over $1.7 Billion. But most of this outflow happened in early in the 10 year period. From 2007-2010 the Cash Flow Statement showed a cash contribution of +$184 million, while the Balance Sheet increased $390 million, which would be a cash outflow of -$390 million. This creates a difference of $574 million, with cash flowing away from the company instead of towards it from 2007-2010.Where did positive cash contributions come from? It appears from increases in liabilities. Look at the line item ""Trade accounts payable and other liabilities"". An increase in this line item is a straightforward increase in cash and vice versa.It is hard to know for sure what is in the ""other liabilities"". So I included both 'Salaries' and the line item 'Other Assets' in the analysis. Click to enlarge:We can see that ABT has increased its Liabilities by $3.5 Billion more than was reported on the cash flow statement. This is a cash inflow to the company and increases the financial leverage of ABT.One might object that the fluctuations in the Balance Sheet are a result of foreign operations that ABT has. However, I do not find this argument very convincing since the net effect of foreign currency adjustments on the statement of cash flows from 2001-2010 is only -$178 Million. Foreign operations do impact the Balance Sheet but can they account for billions in differences over 10 years? I do not believe so. If anyone wants to do all the foreign currency translations for 10 years, and prove the above analysis materially wrong, please provide an article and a link to it in the comments below. Click to enlarge:Why is ABT allowed to have its cash flow from operations not match changes in the Balance Sheet? The answer: ABT has been on an acquisition binge over the last 10 years, spending over $31 Billion dollars to acquire other companies. Click to enlarge:We still see large differences in the data in 2008 and 2009, when there were no acquisitions made in 2007 and ""only"" $250 Million in 2008. Below is the best description I found for what happens to the cash flow statement when a purchase of another company is made :Knowing that CFO may be inflated by business acquisitions, let's examine the working captial of ABT since 2000 to get an idea if the distortion would be mitigated. Click to enlarge:We can see that the working capital of ABT has not been stable at all over this whole period. It has varied immensely--nominally, as a percentage of sales, and percentage of total assets in the capital structure of the company.Now, we'll look at the performance of ABT, by breaking down its Return on Equity (ROE) using DuPont analysis, over its decade-long buying binge. I will use the basic version:orABT has increased its financial leverage in order to keep its ROE higher than it would have been with constant leverage. If ABT had the same leverage in 2010 that it had in 2000, then its 2010 ROE would have been 14.7% verses 22%. One can see the steady decline in asset use efficiency, as shown by ABT's Asset Turnover (Sales/Assets) ratio dropping over time. Products which ABT has developed or acquired, have not produced the same or greater amount of sales compared to the capital spent to develop/acquire said products.ABT's SG&A expense as a percentage of sales went from 21.1% in 2000 up to 29.5% in 2010 (not shown in graph). The net profit margin has been down to flat. Hence, mathematically, the only way to keep stable or increase ROE is to increase ABT's leverage.Now, after a decade of combining companies, ABT announced that it will split into two different companies. It seems management has decided to try something different after a decade of a lethargic stock price. Click to enlarge:One can look at various other articles on Seeking Alpha about the pros and cons of this decision. I have not done any research into ABT's product pipeline, patent expirations, potential competitors, and regulatory environment. All very important items when valuing a pharmaceutical and medical devices company.The above analysis shows the pitfalls of using cash flow metrics to value a company which has continual acquisitions. I would imagine that the operating cash flows will become even more opaque for the entities proceeding from the split. You can learn more about how to analyze and adjust the balance sheet and cash flows from acquisitions in the book referenced in the quotation above.One needs to do more research than just filtering the highest ""Free Cash Flow"" yields off of a computer screen; it is a start but not an end for the investment decision making process. I passed on the opportunity to invest in ABT. An investor should look for companies with better reconciled Cash Flow & Balance Sheet statements, stable to increasing Asset Turnover and Net Profit Margins with a high ROE -- that does not require increased leverage.Maybe ABT will develop the next ""wonder"" drug or medical device and I will miss out, but over the last decade Abbott Labs has not delivered.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
301435,23087,2011-10-23T09:39:48-04:00,,"By Marie DaghlianAbbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) says it plans to separate into two separate publicly traded  companies, a diversified medical products group and a research focused  pharmaceutical company. Investors reacted positively, sending shares up 4  percent on the news. Abbott Laboratories has embraced diversification  over its 123-year history. Indeed it has worked hard to build up its various  businesses in medical devices, diagnostics, nutritionals, generics, and  proprietary pharmaceuticals. But its branded drug business has become so  successful—mostly due to sales of its flagship rheumatoid arthritis drug  Humira—that the company has been increasingly thought of as a pharmaceutical  company. This has held back its shares, as investors have tied the  company’s value to its branded drugs business, primarily the $8 billion in  expected sales to be generated by Humira this year. And the pharma division’s  investment and business opportunities differ from those of the medical products  divisions. However, less than half of Abbott’s $40 billion annual  revenue comes from pharmaceuticals, and although the company has always believed  in a diversified model, management sees a separation of the businesses as a way  to increase shareholder value for all of its divisions. “We’ve always  pursued a diverse model and we have been very successful in our proprietary  pharmaceutical business over time—it’s grown quite large,” Abbott CEO Miles  White told analysts in a conference call. He expects the pharma division, with  $18 billion in annual sales, to be successful going forward, but it had become  too dominant in the portfolio and overshadowed the company’s other divisions,  which have different risk and growth profiles, he said. Another driver  for the split is the increase in the international portion of Abbott’s revenues,  which have grown to 60 percent of total revenue. White noted that international  sales have doubled, especially with its rapid expansion in emerging markets  through the acquisitions of Solvay and Piramal Healthcare Solutions and the  creation of its Established Pharmaceutical Products division. The acquisition of  Piramal in May 2010 for $3.7 billion made Abbott the largest drugmaker in India,  one of the fastest growing markets. Abbott will retain its name for the  diversified medical products company, which has approximately $22 billion in  annual revenue and a mix of products across four major businesses. Abbott  expects double-digit growth in earnings per share, driven by continued expansion  in emerging markets that already contribute 40 percent of total sales. White  will remain the chairman and CEO of the new Abbott. Richard A. Gonzalez,  currently executive vice president, global pharmaceuticals, will become chairman  and CEO of the research-based pharmaceutical company, which currently has $18  billion in annual sales and will focus on critical unmet needs in developed  markets. Besides a strong portfolio of marketed drugs including Humira, it has a  pipeline of more than 20 new compounds or indications in mid- and late-stage  development. Abbott’s split in two will take the form of a tax-free  distribution to shareholders of a new publicly traded stock for the new pharma  company and is expected to be completed by the end of next year. White said both  companies are large enough to be successful on their own, with good cash flows  and strong pipelines. The new Abbott, the diverse products group, will be  successful in emerging markets, while the yet-to-be-named pharmaceutical company  is a developed market game, he said."
302198,22116,2011-10-26T05:52:46-04:00,,"Last week Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) announced that it plans to separate into two publicly traded companies around the end of 2012. One, retaining the Abbott name, will focus on diversified medical products. The other, “New Pharmaceutical Company,” will focus on research-based drugs. Both companies will be global leaders in their respective industries on the day they begin.In the announcement, Abbott stated that the “two publicly traded companies will offer shareholders distinct opportunities given unique investment identities, business profiles and attributes,” and that the decision “builds on a decade of strategic and operational advancements.” Miles White, chairman and chief executive officer, stated:An 81-slide presentation about the split-up is available here (pdf).The split itself is intended to take the form of a tax-free distribution to Abbott shareholders of a new publicly traded stock for the New Pharmaceutical Company. The stock distribution ratio will be determined at a future date.Rats!As a dividend growth investor with a large position in Abbott, my first reaction was, “Rats!” Abbott has been a dividend-growth stalwart since I have been following the strategy. The company has been in my Top 40 Dividend Growth Stocks publication every year that I have produced it (2008-2011), and it was sure to make it again in 2012.The company has offered terrific dividend characteristics, yet it seemed to be perpetually undervalued, thus always being prominent as a potential purchase candidate. In public and private portfolios, I have made 10 separate purchases of Abbott since 2008 and never sold a share. In my public Dividend Growth Portfolio, created in 2008, Abbott was a charter member and comprises about 9% of the portfolio’s value. Both of my dividend reinvestments in 2011 went to purchase more shares of Abbott.The company’s 1, 3, 5, and 10-year dividend growth rates all stand at 9% to 10% annualized. It raised its dividend 9% in 2011. The stock yields about 3.6% and has raised its dividends for 39 consecutive years. This is a classically beautiful dividend-growth stock.But dividend-growth investing is buy-and-monitor, and you can’t ignore a strategic left-turn like this when it apears on your radar screen. We need to understand what this does to Abbott as a dividend-growth stock. Sometimes the interests of dividend-growth investors diverge from the interests of investors who are following other strategies. This may be one of those times. The common wisdom about the split is that it is being done to “maximize shareholder value.” Theoretically, this can be done by getting the stock’s price up, raising dividends, or both. Usually, however, when that phrase pops up, the focus is on the stock’s price.And Abbott’s price jumped about 6% on the news, as you can see in the chart. The announcement day is the thick black bar towards the right edge of the chart, which also shows a big jump in trading volume that day. Since then the euphoria has died down a little and the stock has slid back.Let’s look at the split, first the official version and then again by applying some educated guesswork as to what might happen to the dividend.New Abbott: Diversified Medical Products CompanyThis company will have about 56% of the annual revenues of the old Abbott, or about $22 billion. The major business lines consist of Abbott’s existing diversified medical products portfolio:About 2/3 of revenues of the New Abbott will come from overseas, including about 40% from emerging markets. Abbott is the leading pharmaceutical company in India, and it has a growing presence in many other emerging markets. The combined businesses of the New Abbott are growing at about 13% per year. Abbott expects to deliver sustainable double-digit ongoing EPS growth from this company. That said, these businesses generate only about 40% of Abbott’s profits currently.Mr. White will remain chairman and CEO of the New Abbott. He said the expected: New Pharmaceutical CompanyThe new company, with about 45% of Abbott’s revenues ($18 billion), but 60% of its profits, will include Abbott's current portfolio of proprietary pharmaceuticals and biologics. It will focus on select specialty products developed via breakthrough innovations. The principal current businesses are:Abbott is generally considered to have a good R&D pipeline of future branded drug prospects. Areas of development include oncology, Hepatitis C, MS, immunology, chronic kidney disease, women's health, and neuroscience. More than 20 compounds or indications are currently in Phase II or Phase III trials, including four new indications for Humira. Abbott has had a strong commitment to research and the development of new pharmaceuticals. The combined businesses of New Pharmaceutical Company are also growing at about 13% per year.Richard A. Gonzalez, currently executive vice president, Global Pharmaceuticals of the existing Abbott, will become chairman and CEO of New Pharmaceutical Company. He is a 30+ year Abbott veteran and was previously president and chief operating officer of Abbott. He is coming out of retirement. He also said the expected:What About the Dividend?Abbott addressed the dividend in the announcement. “It is expected that the two companies will each pay a dividend that, when combined, will equal the current Abbott dividend at the time of separation.” Not unexpectedly, they said nothing about growth in subsequent years.When I evaluate dividend-growth companies, I place significant emphasis on the stock’s Story. In the Story, I try to understand what the company does, how it makes money, and why it is likely to experience continuing success. Specifically as to dividends, I want to see evidence of a strong dividend-raising culture combined with the wherewithal to carry it out for the foreseeable future. The wherewithal comes not only from great financials, but also from attributes like industry dominance, strong management, coherent strategies, great brands, and sustainable competitive advantages. If I can’t find or understand those things, I won’t invest in the company. When I last analyzed Abbott in January, I gave it high marks for its Story. As I review that analysis today, this sentence jumps out at me: “Non-drug businesses (like nutritionals) help shield [the company] from effects of periodic loss of patents on branded drugs.” In other words, Abbott is a diversified, multi-line healthcare conglomerate, not just a drug company. I saw that diversification as a strength, just as I see it as a strength for Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).Now they are splitting it up. There will be duplicate boards, executives, departments, managers, employees, and cost structures. Both new companies will lose the protection from cyclical revenue changes that came when all the business units operated under the same umbrella.When companies make significant, transformative strategic shifts, my experience is that everything comes up for reconsideration. Consultants swarm, transition committees are formed. Hundreds of PowerPoint presentations are created. Ideas come out of the woodwork, and it is not unknown for strange ideas to get traction that they would never have received in the old company. The neat, clean original vision gets worked over. Executives jockey for position. Ego often wins over logic. Original intentions can get run over by the momentum of “change is good.” Former statements can become inoperative.In a reorganization, former cultural imperatives get re-examined. That’s what worries me here, because it is a source of risk to continued dividend growth. Abbott has a strong culture and practice of raising its dividend annually (currently at 39 years and counting). Will that culture survive? Will it survive in both new companies? In just one? Which one?Who can tell? I can’t. I think I know where this is going. Absent more information leading to an ability to predict with confidence that both new companies will adopt the dividend practices of their parent, I will sell Abbott, in all or in part. I will have a tear in my eye if it happens.There’s no sense of urgency to sell. I believe that current dividend practices will remain in place until the actual split at the end of next year. An important test will come next April, when Abbott’s usual dividend increase would normally occur. If the increase drops to 2%-3%, I would probably consider that a signal to get out right away. By the way, Abbott will probably incur considerable “one-time” charges between now and the split-up date, and after the split-up, it is likely that former cost-saving synergies will be destroyed as each new company wants to go its own way. What Abbott is doing on the cost side is the opposite of what most companies try to accomplish when they merge.But who knows? Between now and then, some important information might come out:If I end up selling Abbott, I will probably do it by sticking a sell-stop a small distance under its price, hoping to milk any additional price gains out of the stock before I let it go. In any event, I presently do not consider Abbott a candidate for further purchase, and I doubt it will show up on 2012’s Top 40 list. If it does, it will have a special red flag beside its name.Disclosure: I am long ABT, JNJ."
301357,24379,2011-10-23T04:15:12-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) announced on Wednesday that it plans to split into two separate companies.  The first company, retaining the Abbott name, will be a diversified medical products company.  The second will focus on research-based pharmaceuticals.  Wall Street clearly liked the move as evidenced by the roughly 6% jump in Abbott stock between the close on Tuesday and open on Wednesday.  But will this move unlock shareholder value and be profitable for individual holders of Abbott stock?Pharmaceutical companies have faced declining P/Es for years as excitement for new products has waned and the looming threat of patent expirations has neared.  Companies have responded in one of two ways.  First, companies like Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) have sought to diversify their businesses to mitigate the loss of revenues due to a single product.  Second, companies like Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) have sought to shed off business units to refocus the company one what it perceives as its core strength.  Abbott follows this second model, and the fact that the name will remain with the medical products company suggests that it sees its strength there.Diversified Medical ProductsThe new Abbott will have about $22 billion in annual revenue, or about 56% of the pre-split amount.  About 28% of this revenue will come from nutritional products such as Similac and Isomil infant formulae, the fiber supplement Ensure, and Prosure, a nutritional supplement designed to reverse weight loss associated with cancer.  A fourth of the revenue is from Abbott's ""Established Pharmaceuticals"" division, which markets generic pharmaceutical products internationally.  About 19% of revenue will come from a diversified diagnostics product line.  Another 16% of the new Abbott will come from Abbott Vascular, which manufacturers or markets coronary stents and catheters.  The remainder of revenue comes from Medical Optics Devices (5% of revenue) and Diabetes products (7% of revenue).The new Abbott is primarily an international company, with about two-thirds of revenues coming from international markets, and 40% from emerging markets.  This leads to a high growth profile.  Each segment described above had double-digit international revenue growth compared to the third quarter of 2010, and a blended year over year growth rate of 13%.These divisions also have promising products in the pipeline.  The Nutrition division is currently conducting 30 clinical trials across the areas of immunity, cognition, inflammation, lean body mass, metabolism, and tolerances.  Recent new products in this division include Ensure® with Revigor, PediaSure SideKicks, ZonePerfect® Sweet & Salty nutrition bars and Glucerna® Hunger Smart shakes and bars.  New diagnostic products introduced in 2011 include tests for leukemia, hepatitis C, cytomegalovirus, ovarian cancer, and HIV.  Abbott plans to release 20 new vascular products over the next 5 years with a mix of incremental upgrades and brand-new technologies.  Recently released or about to be released products include the ABSORB Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold, MitraClip, and several products in the XIENCE drug-eluting stent line.  Abbott's other divisions have similar strong innovation records and growth prospects.Research-Based PharmaceuticalsWhat about Abbott's research-based pharmaceuticals spinoff?  This company will have about 45% of the pre-split revenues, but perhaps 60% of profits.  About half of the sales of this spinoff will be due to Humira, Abbott's drug to relieve the symptoms (generally pain and swelling) of various autoimmune disorders including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.  Abbott has been successful in expanding the number of indications that Humira has been approved for, leading to a high growth rate (23% over the past year).  Other major products in this new company will be the anti-HIV treatment Kaletra with about 7% of sales and the cholesterol treatments TriCor and Trilipix responsible for a combined 10% of sales.Analysts differ on the quality and depth of Abbott's pharmaceutical pipeline, but there are a number of treatments currently in Phase 3 clinical trials.  Elotuzumab is a monoclonal antibody treatment for multiple myeloma.  Bardoxolone is being investigated for treatment of chronic kidney disease.  Daclizumab, previously approved in Europe to prevent rejection of organ transplants, is in a Phase 3 trial to examine its efficacy as a multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment.  Abbott has three compounds in Phase 2 trials for the treatment of hepatitis C, as well as 11 compounds in clinical trials for cancer and more than a dozen compounds in clinical trials for neurscience and pain indications.  The market potential of these compounds is beyond the scope of this article, but Abbott's commitment to research and many compounds in clinical trials suggest continued growth in research-based pharmaceuticals.Valuing Each Spinoff CompanyThe diversified medical products company will have a product profile similar to companies such as Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), and Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX).  These companies trade at P/Es of 13, 10, and 12, giving us a nice range of P/Es for the new Abbott labs of 10-13, or a stock price range of perhaps $19 - 24 per share.  The new Abbott should have significantly stronger growth prospects than any of these competitors, however, and so may have P/E expansion potential.  Applying a PEG ratio of 1.5 to this segment would give a stock price of $37.The drug spinoff will derive nearly half of its revenues from the single product Humira.  Although Humira maintains its patent through 2016, the focus on a single product has been a concern for analysts and investors.  A worst-case valuation would rank it with other pharmaceutical companies who have steep patent cliffs, such as Pfizer (PFE) and Eli Lilly (LLY), which have recently been trading at P/Es of 8-9.  This would suggest a valuation of perhaps $22 - 25.  An aggressive valuation would take into account the 26% year over year sales growth of Humira, and 13% of the Proprietary Pharmaceuticals division overall, as well as a promising pipeline, and assign a PEG ratio of 1.5 to give a stock price of $55 per share.  A more conservative valuation would assign a PEG ratio of 1.0, for a PE ratio of 13, to give a stock price of $36.Combining the valuation estimates for the two segments suggest a conservative valuation of $60 per pre-split share, which is a modest increase from the current stock price that shows Abbott stock is already undervalued.  The upside potential of each segment is significant, with a long-term 13% growth rate giving a potential near term value of perhaps $90.  The downside would be to apply the low P/Es of companies facing severe patent cliffs to Abbott (which does not face a near-term patent cliff) giving a combined valuation of $45.  With a current stock price of ~$54, the upside/downside ratio of 4:1, combined with a 13% growth rate and 3.6% yield, makes Abbott a very attractive investment - whether one company or two.Frankly, the two companies will not appear much different from the parent company.  Both spinoffs will be nicely profitable, with significant sales in international markets including emerging markets.  Both companies have strong growth rates (including identical 13% year over year revenue growth) with promising products in the pipeline.  And Abbott has committed to the total dividend of the two companies equaling the current dividend.  Abbott's best hope for this split unlocking shareholder value is changing investor psychology, but both halves are attractive long-term investments.Disclosure: I am long ABT, PFE."
302604,22603,2011-10-27T03:02:18-04:00,,"Abbott (NYSE:ABT) recently announced they would split the company into two separate, publicly traded businesses, effective January, 2013.    The “new” company will be dedicated to “research-based pharmaceuticals”.   The existing diversified medical products company will keep the Abbott name and the current Abbott CEO, Miles White.   Richard Gonzalez, the current head of Abbott pharmaceuticals will become the Chairman and CEO of the new, as yet unnamed, pharmaceutical  company.  The split will be accomplished through a tax-free distribution to ABT shareholders of a new, publicly-traded stock in the pharmaceutical business.The pharmaceutical  business will have sales of about $18 billion, about half of which will come from Humira, a drug for inflammatory auto-immune diseases such as Crohn’s disease and rheumatoid arthritis.  The Humira patent expires in 2016.The medical products company will have sales of about $22 billion, consisting of four large divisions – nutritionals, diagnostics, devices (stents), and generic drugs.  Higher profits come from the pharmaceutical piece.  Higher growth from the medical products piece.  About 2/3 of the sales of the medical products company will come from outside the U.S., and 2/3 of that will be in fast-growing emerging markets.   Those businesses have been growing at a 13% rate.Abbott has said that the total, combined dividend from the two companies at the time of separation will equal the current dividend.  We won’t know for a while what the different dividend yields will be, nor their future growth rates.The market has been very enthusiastic about the split up.   Abbott’s stock rose on the news, and has stayed higher than before the announcement.    Most of the nearly 30 analysts who follow ABT have updated their ratings and outlook since the announcement, and all have either maintained a positive rating, or improved it.  We are also very positive on the split.The pharmaceutical industry is undergoing a very difficult strategic transition from selling (relatively) inexpensive pills to millions of patients for the rest of their lives to treat chronic diseases like hypertension and diabetes, to selling incredibly expensive treatments (e.g. Humira therapy costs about $20,000/year, and that’s a relatively cheap biologic drug!) to only a few thousand patients, often for six months or so.   Pharmaceutical companies also have a big challenge from the increasing pressure governments and insurance companies are putting on the industry to lower prices.The diversified medical company has products that are much less regulated and have fewer pricing problems.   Further, those products are often each used for a larger number of patients, diminishing the per patient costs.   With lower annual costs of therapy, these products also can often sell more in developing economies like China, Brazil, and India than high-priced prescription drugs.Abbott’s Board apparently decided that the two separate pieces of their business would do better if they stood on their own and could focus exclusively on their very different market and business dynamics.   The success of both Bristol-Myers (NYSE:BMY) and Mead Johnson Nutrition (NYSE:MJN) after a similar split a few years ago no doubt also influenced Abbott.   Significant additional shareholder value was created by the BMY/MJN split.We feel very good about the prospects of both parts of Abbott.   Although, as you have no doubt picked up, we favor the medical products piece over the long term.  The big unknowns for us, however, are what dividend each company will pay and what policy they will adopt for annual dividend increases.   Abbott has long been one of our Rising Dividend stars, offering a 3.6% yield, paying an annual dividend without a break for roughly 100 years, and increasing  their dividend every year for the past 40 years.    We hope the new Abbott will carry on this enviable track record, in addition to the Abbott name and management team.   But of course, no one knows.So, this is a bit of a bet for us…at least as close to a stock market bet as we conservative types get.   However, the market’s reaction, the example of BMY and MJN, and Abbott’s very long history of business success and rising dividends caused us to decide to increase our position in ABT in anticipation of the split.

300929,24361,2011-10-20T15:19:07-04:00,,"Health care conglomerate Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) certainly knows how to bury a lede. With the tumult in the wake of the company's announced split in two, the company's quarterly earnings went by almost unnoticed. Perhaps that's just as well – too much is made of quarter-by-quarter performance, anyway. When it comes to this transformative move, though, investors might want to ask if this is really the right strategic move at this point in time.Abbott To Humira – Thanks For The Cash, Now Get OutAbbott will be splitting into two companies in a tax-free spin-off transaction. One company will continue Abbott's branded pharmaceutical business, while the other company (the one that will continue on as “Abbott”) will take everything else, including the branded generics business.The branded drug business currently represents about 45% of the company's total sales, but over 60% of pre-tax profits. Of that, Humira (Abbott's incredibly successful monoclonal antibody for autoimmune diseases) is fully half. Unfortunately, Humira is getting a little long in the tooth and analysts have been incessantly worried about its future growth in the face of potential competition from compounds from Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY), as well as threat of biosimilars (basically generic forms of biologic drugs).There's almost no doubt that Abbott has enjoyed the many years of rich cash flow from Humira and used that to invest in other areas of its business. Now with Humira more at risk, and a fairly weak pipeline behind it, Abbott is looking to ring-fence that risk and jettison it, lest the value of the whole company get marked down as happened with Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), or even Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN).Meet The New AbbottThe non-drug Abbott will have a lot going for it, even absent the exceptional profitability of Humira. Abbott has a leading stent franchise, a strong (and surprisingly large) nutrition business, a respected diabetes franchise, and a large diagnostics business. Although there are some threats to the stent business from Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) and Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), Abbott has a good pipeline of its own and likely has more to fear from a general market slowdown than any particular competitor. Likewise in diabetes, where JNJ and Roche are formidable competitors but where Abbott has solid technology of its own.The bigger risk to the new Abbott may be one of focus. For instance, what logic is there in keeping the branded generics business with “old Abbott” when rivals like Novartis (NYSE:NVS) and Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) find synergy in running them together. Abbott may also have to contend with less reinvestable capital – the drug business may be slowing, but it produced a lot of cash flow and now management may have to make harder choices when it comes to feeding rival R&D projects in diagnostics, vascular, or diabetes.Can “Abbott Drugs” Make Its Own Way?It is hard to argue that the Abbott drug business is not facing some challenging times. Eventually a real threat to Humira will arise and that will sap sales. What's more, with Tricor and Niaspan going off patent fairly soon and a weak pipeline behind them, there is the risk that this business falls into the same valuation funk as Forest Labs (NYSE:FRX).Speaking of that pipeline, it's hard to get excited. Management is optimistic about its European rights to bardoxolone in chronic kidney disease, but Abbott will be paying high royalty rate. Beyond that is a joint venture with Biogen Idec (NASDAQ:BIIB) for daclizumab in the increasingly-crowded next-gen multiple sclerosis space and a slate of Hep C drugs that don't seem so obviously better than those at Roche, Bristol-Myers, GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), Pharmasset (OTCPK:VRUS), or Vertex (NASDAQ:VRTX).All in all, the most promising drug may be one that's further under the radar – elagolix, a drug that the company is developing with Neurocrine Biosciences (NASDAQ:NBIX) for endometriois and uterine fibroids. At a minimum, then, expect Abbott management to really focus on the branded drug pipeline, likely in pretty glowing terms, at the upcoming analyst meeting on Friday.A Questionable MoveThere are at least two good reasons for Abbott management to launch this separation. First, it is fairly likely that the branded drug business is closer to being a drag on performance than a boost – particularly if any of these so-called “Humira-killers” get traction. Second, there is the valuation consideration – device and diagnostics companies get better multiples these days than drug companies or even drug-device combos.That said, Abbott may be making a mistake. One of the virtues of the conglomerate model is that savvy managers can reap cash from one area and reinvest it in another. Along similar lines, outperformance in one area can cushion and counter-balance underperformance in another – a “smoothing” effect that makes overall performance more consistent. Last and not least, pharmaceutical businesses can turn around fairly quickly – it wasn't so long ago that analysts were very down on JNJ and Roche's drug operations, but those pipelines now look much more interesting and drugs could be the source of renewed growth in each case.The Bottom LineAbbott has long been a good value among health care stocks, largely because of overheated worries that any slowdown in Humira would gut overall growth. Now a plan is in place that will see that risk contained and resected. To be sure, the Street reacted to this with initial enthusiasm as the hope is that the valuation increase on the non-drug business outstrips the multiple contraction for the branded drug business.Longer term, though, I'm not sure this is a sound move. Shuffling the deck chairs rarely produces real value and Abbott may rue letting go of the reinvestable cash flow that a pharmaceutical business can produce. Then again, management knows better than anyone just what is happening in the field and in the lab, and perhaps this is a sign that the future for the Abbott drug business really is grim. Abbott shares are still certainly more than cheap enough to be worth buying, but the risk here is incrementally higher than before and Abbott will have to prove that this was a sound decision for the long haul.Disclosure: I am long OTCQX:RHHBY."
300892,24615,2011-10-20T14:05:34-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) reported quarterly earnings Wednesday, announcing that revenue rose 13 % to $9.8 billion and that earnings increased to $1.85 billion, or $1.18 per share, from $1.63 billion, or $1.05 per share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts had predicted expected earnings of $1.17 per share on revenue of $9.64 billion. Abbott confirmed its forecast for double-digit earnings-per-share growth and provided guidance for 2011 of $4.64 to $4.66. See the Full ABT Earnings Call TranscriptIn a surprise move, Abbott announced plans to split into two publicly traded companies, one in diversified medical products and the other in research-based pharmaceuticals, on Tuesday. ""Today's news is a significant event for Abbott, and reflects another dynamic change in our company's 123-year history, strengthening our outlook for strong and sustainable growth and shareholder returns,"" said Miles White, chairman and chief executive officer of Abbott. The research-based pharmaceutical company has nearly $18 billion in annual revenue and the medical products company has nearly $22 billion in annual revenue. Abbott’s internal restructuring and inorganic growth strategies have been paying off well. A planned reduction in the workforce of 5%, as a part of ongoing restructuring plan is likely to accelerate the bottom-line growth in excess of revenue. In addition, the newly formed Established Pharmaceutical Products segment will market branded generics, ensuring better management, revenue generation and lesser generic attrition. Acquisitions of Solvay Pharmaceuticals (complimentary portfolio of pharmaceuticals and expansion in Belgium), Pirimal Healthcare (market leadership in India), Advanced Medical Optics or AMO (diverse range of medical devices and leadership position in the upcoming eye care market), and Facet Biotech (biologics for oncology drugs) are some of the latest initiatives toward strengthening Abbott’s strong competitive position. The emerging markets revenue has increased by 13.2% over last three years and 38.4% (20% organic) year-over-year in Q1 FY 2011. AMO’s LASIK procedure, which puts Abbott in the top position in laser surgical devices, is less sensitive to reimbursement policies. AMO also pushed Abbott to second position in cataract surgical device market and third position in the contact lens care products market. Abbott has secured an strong competitive position as a diversified healthcare company by taking steps to maintain the long-term viability of competitive advantages. Strong market leadership across the four operating segments, a diverse product portfolio, strong intellectual property protection and limited patent cliff-exposure for its core pharmaceutical segment, high switching costs for its vascular segment, solid emerging market growth, and its proven track-record of supplementing organic growth through strategic acquisitions puts Abbott in a strong position to achieve above-average returns. The 10-year average ROIC of 15.2% exceeds the cost of capital and at a compounded adjusted growth rate of 6%, Abbott has delivered best-in-industry top-line growth over the last 3 years. The question is, why does the company want to destroy one of the core strengths, diversification? This appears to be an attempt to fix something that is not broken. Here are some key weaknesses and threats that Margin of Safety Equity Research has identified for Abbott:Key Weaknesses:Key ThreatsStrong cross-segment diversification was a key strength and a stand-alone research-based pharmaceutical operation may be in a weaker position to address weaknesses and face external threats. We are not convinced that this move unlocks any value.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
300777,20694,2011-10-20T09:09:40-04:00,,"So Abbott (NYSE:ABT) is  spinning off the pharma business into a separate company - did anyone  see that coming? (I take a day away from the computer, attending a  meeting, and this happens). Let's look at this plan and try to figure it  out.First off, this is obviously a reaction to worries about prospects  for the pharma side of Abbott's business. The medical devices side is  doing fine; it's not like the high-flying pharma organization is trying  to toss out a sandbag or something. A lot of that worry is probably  centered around the long-term prospects for Humira, which is operating  in an increasingly crowded space and accounts for a rather large share  of revenues all by itself.So in that sense, this is a move peculiar to Abbott. But the thinking  behind it is common to all the large drug companies, as this Wall Street Journal  story details. It's just that various companies are running off in  various directions in response. You have some saying ""Gosh, we've just  got to get back to our core business and do pharma better"", while others  say ""Gosh, we've got to diversify - let's get some consumer products in  here, some medical devices, animal health, anything less crazy than  drug discovery"". And even allowing for the fact that these companies are  starting off from different places, with different levels of  difficulty, it seems clear that no one really has a strategy that's  convincing enough even to themselves. Something Has to Be Done, so  everyone's doing Something, and hoping for the best.But in this case, you have to worry that the (so far unnamed) drug  company that Abbott's spinning off will have its work cut out for it.  The new company will be getting, what, three quarters of its revenue  from Humira? That's a rough situation for any company with any drug,  much less a drug that's heading into white water. And how much of the  rest of the revenues are from TriCor and Niaspan, both of which face  patent expirations? I know that they have things in the clinic, sure,  but it's hard to see how this new company doesn't shed jobs at some  point. I had a series of worried e-mails waiting for me last night from  Abbott pharma people, and I think that they're right to be worried. I'd  be very glad to hear counterarguments, let me tell you.No, when you look at it, the company seems to have decided that  amputation is just the cure that they needed. The fact that the Abbott  name is staying with the medical devices company is all you need to  know."
300748,24276,2011-10-20T00:25:24-04:00,,"News that Abbott Labs (ABT) will divide itself into separate drug and medical device companies  follows a familiar pattern that has proven highly profitable in the past.A similar break-up came in 1994 when Eli Lilly (LLY) spun-out its medical device business as Guidant.  Guidant later became part of Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) in a $24.2 billion deal. The deal didn't work out for BSX, but Lilly shareholders who kept both stocks did very well.In the Lilly case it was the devices business that was spun-out, while in Abbott's case it will be the drugs business that is seeking a new name. This means Abbott is keeping its own consumer products, including diagnostic kits and baby formula, creating a pure-play drug company that itself might be available to be taken-out.The unit may be attractive for its patents on such drugs as Humira, Tricor and Zemplar, although its Niaspan time-release niacin product was hit hard recently by research indicating it does not prevent death. Abbott also has an HIV drug, Keletra, whose patent has been rejected in India. Our Todd Campbell notes, however, that Abbott's pipeline is on a hot streak, with Bardoxolone for kidney disease, ABT-450, and Duodopa for Parkinson's all making steady progress.What history says is hanging on to ABT to see what happens with the drug unit could prove highly profitable.The Abbott decision leaves one gigantic drug-pharma-devices company still struggling for synergy. I would be remiss in not mentioning it.Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) lists a half-dozen pure device companies among its device & diagnostics holdings, and the fact that the stock is trading little-changed from 10 years ago could prompt a move of some kind.   The company's April acquisition of Synthes for $21.3 billion helped drag down third quarter earnings, its top medical device executive has gone to rival Boston Scientific and shareholders have a right to be impatient.    I want to emphasize that there is no evidence JNJ is interested in breaking up. But my guess is executives, and shareholders, there will be watching closely to see what happens with ABT's total valuation.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

For years, investors have conservatively valued Abbott. Despite a steady stream of positive pipeline data, investors are paying only about 10 times next year earnings, which is at the low end of its 5-year historical PE range.The move to split in half is a smart one and is likely to pay off for investors who hold both the legacy devices company and the soon-to-be created drug player. There is a rich history of investors paying up for robust pipelines, and with Abbott's drug business firing on all cylinders, the timing is right to spin the segment out.As I wrote previously in ""A Hot Streak for Abbott Labs Drug Pipeline"", Abbott's drug development team has had a slate of recent victories. While some competitors have struggled to carve out an identity amid patent expiration, Abbott has built a solid drug pipeline to drive future growth.One such drug is Daclizumab. Abbott just reported positive Phase 2b trial results for the drug in treating multiple sclerosis. Patients enrolled in the study saw up to a 54% reduction in annualized relapse. This is impressive given it’s a once a month treatment, which is a significant competitive advantage. This was the first of two registered studies evaluating the drug in relapsing patients. The drug, currently in Phase III, has blockbuster potential given 2.5 million people suffer with MS and current treatments are raking in some $14 billion a year.Another drug, Bardoxolone, will be used in the treatment of chronic kidney disease (""CKD"") in type 2 diabetes patients. The drug could hit the market as early as 2014 and is enrolling 1600 patients in a Phase III trial. If the drug is successful in delaying dialysis, the drug could generate over $2 billion in annual sales. So far, the results are promising. 90% of patients have improved and the diseases progression slowed in some instances during a Phase 2b study.Just last week, Abbott also updated data on its hepatitis C drug, ABT-450. Hep C has garnered a lot of investor interest following the FDA approval of Vertex's Incivek and Merck's Victrelis, both of which carry a price tag around ~50k.    The interim data from its ongoing mid stage trial suggested the drug could cure the disease absent Interferon, a drug with many side-affects. Further, the trial suggests a faster treatment time at 12 weeks instead of 24 for competing treatments. Currently, the drug has a chance of approval around 2015.In addition, the new drug company has Duodopa in Phase III for Parkinson's, Elotuzumab for multiple myeloma and Elagolix for endometriosis in the pipeline. And, the company is targeting label expansion for its widely successful Humira.Pre-split, the slower growing device and nutritional business has had to fuel a lot of the drug pipelines R&D. In spinning the company off, the legacy company will see improving cash flow and dividend opportunity. The drug unit, with robust sales from Humira, will also have the ability to return money to shareholders and tap equity markets, which typically reward development companies with higher growth multiples.Given the company has reported double digit earnings growth in 17 of the past 18 quarters, investors have had a lot to feel good about. With the upcoming split they may just find themselves even happier as the street more appropriately values the growth opportunity.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in ABT, VRTX over the next 72 hours."

Investors could be accumulating shares, as the stock continues to trade at bargain-basement levels.The firm sports a very nice dividend yield of 3.8%. We expect the firm to pay out about 40% of next year's earnings to shareholders as dividends. Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (NASDAQ:ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Abbott's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 27.4%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation rating of ""excellent."" In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate. Cash Flow AnalysisValuation Analysis We think Abbott is worth $68 per share, which represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 22.9 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 13.1 times last year's EBITDA. We've raised our fair value estimate from $63 per share previously due to higher emerging-market growth assumptions. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 5.4% during the next five years, a pace that is still lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 10.7%.Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 24.1%, which is above Abbott's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, our valuation model assumes free cash flow will grow at a modest annual rate (1%) for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. We employ a 9.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety Analysis Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $68 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created bythe uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock.In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Abbott Laboratories. We think the firm is attractive below $51 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $85 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion. Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Abbott's fair value at this point in time to be about $68 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Abbott Laboratories's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence.This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $84 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $68 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The  analysts had upped their estimates in accordance with the bright outlook  provided by the company. As the estimates have already been revised,  the stock has not seen significant estimate revisions thereafter.We believe that, although concerns like the impact of US health care  reform, product recalls, foreign exchange headwinds and EU pricing  austerity and generic competition will continue to hurt Abbott Labs, its  pharmaceutical products should continue driving growth led by key drug  Humira, an anti-inflammatory product.Humira is quickly becoming the anti-tumor necrosis factor drug of choice, gaining sizable market share from Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN)/Pfizer’s (NYSE:PFE) Enbrel and Johnson & Johnson’s (NYSE:JNJ) Remicade.Growing awareness, favorable clinical data, additional indications and  expansion into new markets like China and Japan should help the product  to continue contributing significantly to the top-line.

However, I still remain cautious; there are still many shoes to drop in Europe, and domestic economic growth seems like it will be tepid at best through the rest of 2011.

One stock I like here with an almost 4% dividend yield is Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT).“Abbott Laboratories engages in the discovery, development, manufacture, and sale of health care products worldwide.

291068,24433,2011-09-01T06:10:22-04:00,,"Abbott Labs Inc. (NYSE:ABT) is a diversified pharmaceutical corporation that has had somewhat recent analyst activity. Morgan Keegan downgraded the stock from “Outperform” to “Market Perform” on August 24th and lowered the price target from $60 to $57 a share. About a month before, on July 12th UBS upgraded the stock, boosting EPS estimates and the target price to $59/share. Citigroup issued a ""sell"" rating on the stock for some reason on August 30th, and lowered the target price.After Abbott's Q2 earnings report on July 20th, 2011 the higher-than-expected EPS wasn’t reflected in the stock’s price action, which took it from its highs of about $53 a share close to $47 a share in the depths of the latest stock market crash following the S&P downgrade of US debt. The shares have recovered from their lows in August, and assuming no horrific news about the economy, Abbott shareholders should expect relatively little turbulence in the coming months as the market gets back on track.Abbott earnings have reached a new high as of 2011, hitting an EPS of 1.23. This is fed by a steadily increasing revenue stream which has shown relatively steady growth over the last 10 quarters. Dividends have been increased over the years as well, and have just been boosted again earlier this summer. In general, financial data for Abbott implies that the company is continuing to grow its product line in slow but predictable ways which suits investors focused on reducing volatility and collecting dividends. While this is true of most large-cap pharmaceutical companies, Abbott has extra-strong presence in diagnostics and other side-branches, which makes it great for diversification in a healthcare portfolio and has much more stable trends than certain pharmaceutical giants like Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) who have scary events occurring in the future (generic Lipitor being one of the most significant).On August 22, ABT received FDA clearance for its new prognostic test which is used to detect Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL), the most common type of Leukemia in the US and Europe. The FISH genetic panel contains probes which search for genetic variations that are known to affect the progression of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia. The market for this should be quite significant, as oncologists around the globe often lack ample evidence for a clear prognosis. This FISH panel should make it very quick and easy to acquire genetic information about patients that may have been less efficient prior to the introduction of Abbott’s product.Another new FDA product approval came on August 26. A molecular diagnostic test called the ""ALK Gene Test"" is an efficient way for doctors to examine cases of non-small-cell lung cancer, another very prevalent disease especially in the United States. Not too dissimilar from the FISH probe for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, this product will have ample market share to boost Abbott's revenue in the coming years.Abbott has moved back to its position from before the market crash in August. While this may irk some value investors, the P/E is only a mildly expensive 16 and the yield is large at 3.66%. In addition, the company has had double digit revenue growth in many key niche and competitive markets in the last year including molecular diagnostics and emerging markets pharmaceuticals.Considering the growth prospects of the firm and the dividend yield, the risk-to-reward ratio for shares of ABT is very favorable for any investor looking to establish positions in healthcare equities. It is similar to other safe haven healthcare giants like Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), but I'd argue that it's an even better bet. Johnson & Johnson has a great dividend and will not be decreasing it, but it's being crushed by its own weight. Revenue growth isn't there, and the equity very unlikely to appreciate unless there is a significant change in the company's performance.Abbott on the other hand has a clear uptrend, and may have some noticeable appreciation in stock value on top of its larger dividend. If you are looking to invest in a healthcare company, ABT is one of the most assured bets you can make in this market.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

We think the best opportunities arise from a complete understanding of all investing disciplines in order to identify the most attractive stocks at any given time. We therefore analyze each stock across a wide spectrum of philosophies, from deep value through momentum investing.This involves performing significant valuation analysis, both on a DCF and relative value basis, as well as a strong consideration of the firm's fundamentals (cash flow, risk, etc.), technicals and momentum indicators. The best stocks, we believe, will be attractive from a number of investment perspectives -- from value through momentum (hence our name, Valuentum). On the other hand, the worst stocks will be shunned by most investment disciplines and display expensive valuations and poor technicals and momentum indicators.As part of our process, we employ a discounted cash-flow model to arrive at a fair value estimate for every company within our equity coverage universe. In Abbott's (NYSE:ABT) case case, we think the shares look undervaled at today’s prices. Our fair value estimate for Abbott is $63 per share, over 25% higher than where it is currently trading.

272228,23993,2011-05-27T11:21:00-04:00,,"A study by the National Institutes of Health was ended 18 months  early after finding that adding Niaspan to a statin in people with heart  disease did not reduce the risk of cardiovascular events, including  heart attacks and strokes. Moreover, Niaspan may have boosted the risk  of ischemic events, raising questions about the benefit of raising HDL,  or so-called good cholesterol, to fight heart disease.The 3,414-person study, which added the Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) pill to  Merck’s (NYSE:MRK) Zocor, found the combination was linked to stroke in 1.6 percent  of patients, compared with 0.7 percent among those given a placebo. The  combo failed to reduce heart attacks, heart-related hospitalizations  and the need for procedures to reduce chest pain and restore strong  blood flow to the heart.The results of the study, which was dubbed AIM-HIGH, are a blow to  Abbott, which paid $3.4 billion for Kos Pharmaceuticals in 2006 in order  to gain the rights to Niaspan. The outcome will also likely raise  questions about other meds that are being developed to raise HDL by  Merck and Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY).According to Jeff Probstfield, the AIM-HIGH co-principal investigator and  professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of Washington,  Seattle:The study followed patients with a history of heart disease and low  levels of good cholesterol for 32 months, instead of the planned 50  months. The purpose was to test the theory that giving Niaspan to  patients with HDL levels that were under control would experience an  added benefit. The NIH noted that small clinical studies showed that  relatively high residual cardiovascular risk exists among patients with  cardiovascular disease, low HDL cholesterol, and high triglycerides  despite managing LDL levels. But finding treatments to raise HDL while  lowering the risk have proved disappointing.In a statement the FDA says:This is yet another cloud over the Abbott cardiovascular franchise.  Last week, an FDA advisory panel recommended that the drugmaker, which  sells a combination of Niaspan and simvastatin called Simcor, conduct a  new trial of Trilipix after a government study failed to show heart  benefits. “Given the benefits seen in earlier but smaller studies with  Niaspan, today’s news is a major surprise to us and another setback for  ABT’s cholesterol franchise (ACCORD with TriCor/TriLipix was a setback  in 2010),” writes Wells Fargo Securities analyst Larry Biegelsen in an  investor note.For its part, Abbott maintains the study population didn’t include  everyone who may benefit from Niaspan. “Abbott will reflect the relevant  study findings in the label after finalization of the AIM-HIGH study  results and appropriate review,” the drugmakers says in a statement. “There are a number of unanswered questions that remain, based on these interim study results.”Disclosure: None"

But in the big  picture, this is an important step forward in the long and excruciating  process of sorting out fact from fiction.  It fits in with the stream of  stories like this one, which finds yet another biochemical mechanism that people had not suspected.When pharma companies embraced genomics, they thought they had a  faster path to finding new drugs that would treat well-known and  well-understood problems.  Unfortunately, the deeper they got in, the  more they discovered was that the problems were actually not  well-understood – that conventional medical understanding was simply not  correct much of the time.

Fenofibrate, as I've mentioned here before, is an oddity among drugs. It  was discovered way before anyone had a mechanism of action, and even  now, while it's supposed to be a PPAR-alpha ligand, no one's completely  happy with that explanation. (For one thing, it's not very potent at  that nuclear receptor, while other PPAR-alpha compounds have crashed in  clinical trials for various reasons). But it can lower triglycerides and  raise HDL, which should both (in theory) be beneficial effects, and  it's been a big seller over the years.But how much good does it do? That's always the big, important, slow  question in the cardiovascular field. The data for fenofibrate have  always been somewhat messy (although probably positive overall), but a  new study has muddied things up. As the FDA puts it, in the documents for an advisory committee meeting tomorrow (PDF):The new data, from a trial called ACCORD-Lipid, is another one  looking at fenofibrate plus a statin, which is the usual combination  (that way, at least in theory, you go after triglycerides, low HDL, and  high LDL simultaneously). But this trial, in a large population of  diabetic patients, showed that overall, the rate of major adverse  cardiovascular events was statistically identical between the  statin/fenofibrate and statin/placebo groups. No advantage! It gets  trickier with a bit of subgroup analysis: women showed some evidence of  worse outcomes with fenofibrate as opposed to statin alone. The group  that seemed to benefit, on the other hand, were the patients who started  out with the highest triglycerides and the lowest HDL. (See that FDA  file above for all the numbers and more).That's disconcerting. Is fenofibrate only helping the worst-off  patients, and doing nothing (or worse) for the others? That a question  worth wrestling with for a drug that sold well over a billion dollars  last year. And beyond that is the same sort of question that came up  when all the ezetimibe data hit:  how much do we really know about blood markers versus real  cardiovascular outcomes? Can you hit the various numbers by different  routes, some of which are beneficial and some of which aren't? What is  it that we're not understanding?Disclosure: None"

Examples include companies such as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), McDonalds (NYSE:MCD), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT). Disruptions in those earning trend lines are rare and often of little consequence, and if you exclude extraneous charge-off’s, they are virtually non-existent. The Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) Tylenol poisoning scare in the 1980's is one such example of an unusual occurrence. The scare jarred the company's earnings picture, but absent that event, normal operating earnings were maintained. These types of stocks, the best of the best, are and can be pure buy and hold securities for many investors. Opportunities to buy them at excellent valuations are rare.   My three primary pillars of investing utilize the facts and estimates of fundamentals, the art of technical analysis, and the measures of various valuation standards. Any one of these tools can be used to uncover a security for further analysis. However, all three are considered of utmost importance in the final selection of a security. Often the hunt is conducted using a single tool of one method, which in this case, was to seek a stock with a current yield at or above the yield levels of the past 25-30 years. Realizing that Abbott Labs meets the yield criteria, the company became the target of additional investigation.FundamentalsAbbott Labs, from its profile in Yahoo, Earnings grew over 100% from $1.78 to $4.17 between the years 2000 to 2010. Estimates for 2011 are for a further increase to the $4.60 area. Dividends during this same time frame grew from $0.17 a quarter to the current $0.48. The table below highlights the dividend increases and annual dividend payments on the ownership of 100 shares since 1983. The table below extrapolates a 6% annual dividend increase, which is less than Abbott’s historical increase of 8.5%, out to 2040. In addition, the table uses the current market price to show the yield on cost over this time frame.Valuation The price earnings ratio (PE) of the shares has declined from over 30 in 2000 to the current level of 17.5, which places it in the lower range of the historical levels. This further signals good valuation. Over the last 30 years the dividend yield on Abbott has held in a range from as low as 1.5% to a high of 3%. Recently the yield spiked to a rare 4% level after a 9% dividend increase in April. A recent rally in the shares has reduced the yield down to 3.7%. A dividend increase next year identical to 2011 indicates a yield of 4% based on current prices. A price decline to $48 gives the shares a 4% yield. An opportunity to buy Abbott at these yield levels is very rare.Technical analysisThe shares are currently correcting an overbought condition. Initial support should be in the $50-$51 price area where short term indicators will likely indicate an oversold level. Strong support rests in the $45-$47 zones.  Click to enlarge:    ConclusionAs mentioned earlier, my methods are simple. The chart above illustrates the keys to this analysis.An investor without a position in Abbott can begin buying initial positions at current prices. In addition, shares should be bought down to the $45 to $47 level if given the opportunity. It is my strong belief that a pullback back to the $48 price, coupled with a corresponding 4% yield, will induce strong buying support from income investors.Disclosure: I am long JNJ, ABT, MCD."
270431,23993,2011-05-17T15:14:27-04:00,,"Will Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) lose what was to have been a big money  maker? The answer should be known on Thursday, when an FDA advisory  committee meets to decide the fate of Trilipix, a so-called fenofibrate  pill that was approved in 2008 for lowering cholesterol but, more  recently, was linked to a higher rate of heart problems among women who  combined the drug with a statin.However, the clinical significance of the finding, which was  disclosed in a study known as ACCORD, is not entirely certain, which is  why the FDA panel is meeting. However, one question to be addressed is  whether the FDA should withdraw approval for using the med in  conjunction with a statin or, instead, revise the labeling and possibly  include study results. Another option is to require another study (see this).The ACCORD study found that combining a similar and older Abbott drug  called TriCor with a statin failed to reduce heart attacks and other  cardiac problems (read here). But an analysis of a so-called gender subgroup suggested the  possibility of heart problems increased for women in the trial (you can  read more in the FDA briefing materials here).The possibility that the FDA would yank the indication for using the  Abbott drug with a statin has been anticipated ever since the ACCORD  results became known. Consequently, Wall Street lowered expectations.  Earlier this year, for instance, Wells Fargo Securities analyst Larry  Biegelsen forecast U.S. sales would decline 3% this year to $1.3  billion and drop to $990 million in 2012, especially as generic TriCor  pills become next year. Last year, combined sales were $1.5 billion.Update: In an investor note today, Biegelsen offers  an update: “We are lowering our 2013-2015 TriLipix/Tricor franchise  sales to $244 million, $219 million and $197 million, respectively, from  $447 million, $402 million and $382 million, respectively, to better  reflect anticipated generic Tricor erosion of the entire franchise.  TriCor/Trilipix total prescriptions are currently declining 10% to 15% year-over-year in the U.S. It is our understanding that  Abbott has pulled back promotion of TriCor/TriLipix.”He also points out that Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Steve Nissen,  who he says has been a “vocal critic” of fibrates, will not be on the  panel this time, which he views “as a positive.”Trilipix, which is also approved as a monotherapy, and TriCor are  designed to lower triglycerides and raise HDL. But the government-funded  ACCORD study examined whether adding a fenofibrate with a statin could  reduce heart problems in diabetics. Patients were given Abbott’s TriCor  and Merck’s Zocor, or the statin plus a placebo.

The quarterly dividend goes to 48 cents, from 44, funded by Abbott’s steadily rising profit.Investor neglect of the shares has pushed the dividend yield past 4%.Abbott 2010 sales rose 14.3% to $35.2 billion, and Humira, with a 19.3% jump to $6.5 billion, was pushing the growth.The company has also boosted R&D spending, and made acquisitions financed by borrowings, to keep the growth going. That has raised its debt-to-equity ratio.But Humira, as YCharts wrote last fall, is Abbott’s crown jewel, competing against two other similar medicines. The three meds could reach combined annual sales of $33 billion by 2015, and as biotech drugs are less susceptible to generic knockoffs than plain chemical compounds.Abbott shares rose, but barely, on the litigation news.Perhaps investors figure $1.67 billion is chump change to Abbott, but anything questioning the legitimacy of its Humira patent protection could have hurt Abbott further. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) was the plaintiff – it makes Humira competitor Remicade – and it could still appeal the latest ruling. [A separate battle has raged over Remicade between J&J (JNJ) and Merck (NYSE:MRK)].Abbott carries a relatively low PE ratio and a robust earnings yield – a handy way to compare corporate earnings to, say, a bond yield.And with the latest ruling, there is one fewer reason not to own Abbott."

The bullish call for Abbott is based upon thorough analysis of the company's fundamentals and can be summarized with a simple message: The stock is ""unloved and undervalued.""  In our opinion, the case to own ABT is even stronger. Three main factors affect a stock's market price: Fundamentals, technicals, and sentiment. All three factors are improving for Abbott, providing a tail wind to the stock for the rest of the year. Let's review each factor separately.Abbott, with a market cap of $76 billion, is a well-run large cap pharmaceutical company and its CEO, Miles White 51, has made Barron's annual list of the top 30 most respected CEOs for the past three years.(Click chart to enlarge) We downloaded weekly prices from Seeking Alpha's database between January 1st, 1991 and April 4th, 2011 to build the 20-year stock chart above.  The line that trends up (the support line) is drawn by connecting the higher lows made by the stock between 1991 and 2011. The stock has been and remains in an upward trend for 20 consecutive years. As long as the support line is not violated, the upward momentum is intact. In fact, the longer the support line remains intact (and 20 years is quite a long time), the more confident we are in validating the upward momentum.   The line that trends down (the resistance line) is drawn by connecting the stock's lower highs in the last three years. Abbott's stock made an all-time high of $61.09 three years ago on January 10, 2008 and is down 18% since then.   A triangle pattern is starting to emerge when looking at the support and resistance lines together. Although we can not say for sure which line will be broken first, two factors favor the stock breaking up to the upside. The support line has remained intact for a much longer time than the resistance line. The stock was rising when it entered the triangle. Once the support/resistance line gets broken, the downward/upward movement is likely to continue for a prolonged time.Click to enlarge:  The stock made a a 52-week high of $53.75 on October 18th, 2010. It then started a three month long decline to reach a 52-week low of $44.59 on January 31st, 2011. ABT is on an uptrend since then, closing at $50.25 on April 4th, 2011.  The 20-day moving average (green line) is trending upward since the end of February 2011 and the 200-day moving average (red line) has flattened and is turning positive, two bullish events. The uptrend is confirmed by the rising Money Flow Indicator Index (MFI), implying that the stock is under accumulation.   Finally, the stock closed at $50.25 on April 4th 2011, well above the 200-day moving average of $48.91 which is very bullish and indicates that the stock should perform well in the coming weeks. A bullish cross-over between the 20-day moving average and the 200-day moving average would confirm the upward trend.Elsewhere we analyzed the causes for the lack of performance of large cap pharmaceutical stocks in the last decade (see ""Big Pharma's Next Decade Won't Be Lost""). The inability of senior management to clearly articulate a strategy to right the ship has resulted in rock bottom valuations with single-digit P/E ratio for many large cap pharmaceuticals; ABT trades at a P/E ratio of 10.7.  As investors warm up to ABT's strong fundamentals and bullish technicals, we believe that valuations will improve throughout 2011. In addition, management has started to address shareholders' concerns for the stock's lack of performance. During Abbott's last conference call, Jami Rubin, a drug analyst at Goldman Sachs suggested that Abbott's stock is currently undervalued and could surge by 30% should management decide to break up the company. Management does not seem to favor the break-up strategy at this junction. Abbott's chairman and CEO Miles D. White acknowledged that there is no current plan for a breakup; rather the company's strategy is to bring valuation at par with S&P's multiple.  Disclosure: I am long ABT."

Only two of the 22 analysts  following Abbott Labs for 2011 have revised their estimates upward.There are a number of reasons for the downward bias regarding Abbott  Labs for the first quarter of 2011. Concerns like the impact of  the US  healthcare reform, product recalls, foreign exchange headwinds and EU  pricing austerity continue to hurt Abbott Labs. Moreover, several  products in Abbott Labs’ portfolio like Omnicef and clarithromycin are  facing declining sales due to increased generic competition.Although sales of Abbott Labs’ lead drug Humira (anti-inflammatory)  continue to be impressive, we are concerned about new competition in the  market in the form of Johnson and Johnson’s (NYSE:JNJ)  Simponi and UCB Pharma’s (UCBJF.PK) Cimzia. The newly invigorated competition could lead to a slowdown in Humira’s market share gains.Meanwhile, Abbott’s Kaletra faces intense competition in the HIV market from players like Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ:GILD), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), and Johnson and Johnson. Abbott’s lipid franchise also faces stiff competition in the highly crowded fenofibrate market.Moreover, Abbott Labs  faced a regulatory setback when the development of Certriad, co-developed with AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN),   was scrapped following the receipt of a complete response letter.

Such  setbacks will weigh heavily on the stock.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsEstimates for the first quarter of 2011 have gone down by only $0.01 in  the last 30 days due to a lack of significant estimate revisions by the  analysts following the stock. Estimates for 2010 also are static at  $4.60 over a similar time period.Neutral on Abbott LabsWe currently have a Neutral recommendation on Abbott Labs, which is  supported by a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term “Hold” rating). Despite  lingering challenges like the impact of the US healthcare reform,  foreign exchange headwinds and EU pricing austerity, we believe Abbott  Labs’ strong business segments, contributions from acquisitions and  late-stage pipeline should help the company deliver strong earnings  growth."

Analysts are looking for EPS of 90c on revenue of $8.81B. The consensus range is 89c-91c for EPS, and $8.67B-$8.93B for revenue, according to First Call. Abbott may see positive catalysts this quarter from sales of Humira and Niaspan. Also seen as possible positive catalyst are contributions from the Solvay Group acquisition, which is generally seen as positive for Abbott. Negative catalysts may be seen coming from costs associated with U.S health-care reform and the negative impact of European austerity measures. On its Q4 earnings conference call in late January, Abbott guided for Q1 EPS of 88c-90c and Q1 revenue growth in the mid-teens with a Q1 gross margin ratio of 60%. On April 7, Deutsche Bank initiated Abbott with a hold and $53 target. On April 4, Barron's said Abbott Labs is unloved and undervalued. Barron's expanded on this by saying that concern about key drug Humira losing patent protection in 2016 have held down Abbott Labs’ shares. Abbott's pipeline has mostly been in early stages in recent years, but several oncology, kidney treatments and others are rounding into shape. An almost 4% dividend yield and proven ability to steadily boost earnings could lead to a 25% rise in Abbott’s stock price over the next two years, said Barron's."

However, including one-time items, EPS declined 40%  to $0.57.Although revenues grew 11.8% to $8.7 billion, they fell short of the  Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.9 billion.

Strong Humira and lipid franchise sales were  offset by the weak performance of Kaletra, which declined 7.2% to $328  million.

Full year  revenues increased 14.3% to $35.2 billion, just above the Zacks  Consensus Estimate of $35.1 billion.The Quarter in DetailFourth quarter revenues were mainly driven by the strong performance of  the company’s pharmaceutical division and vascular products. Foreign  exchange (Fx) fluctuations negatively impacted revenues by 0.4%.Pharmaceutical division sales were $5,939 million, up 22.5% (including a  0.9% negative Fx impact).

Pharmaceutical revenues included sales from the Solvay and  Piramal deals.The lipid franchise posted sales of $785 million during the quarter  with TriCor/TriLipix sales increasing 19.2%. Meanwhile, Humira recorded  sales growth in both the US (13.2%) and international markets (12.9%)  during the quarter. Fourth quarter Humira sales increased 13% to $1.9  billion.The Nutritional business remained flat at $1,433 million. Sales were  impacted by the September 2010 recall of an infant formula product.  Pediatric nutritional sales were down 5.6% during the quarter. With  production of the infant formula product resuming from October 2010,  Nutritional business sales should pick up.Abbott Diagnostics posted sales of $1,015 million in the quarter,  representing an increase of 4.1%. Meanwhile, the Vascular division  continued to perform well, with sales increasing 13.7% to $822 million,  thanks to strong growth in international markets.

The company expects earnings per share in  the range of $4.54 to $4.64. The guidance includes the impact of US  health care reform and EU austerity measures. We note that the Zacks  Consensus Estimate is currently towards the higher end of this guidance  range at $4.63 per share.Abbott Labs also announced a restructuring program for its US pharma  business given the impact of the US health care reform and the  challenging regulatory environment. As part of the initiative, Abbott  Labs intends to streamline operations to reduce costs and improve  efficiencies.Abbott Labs also provided an update on its pipeline. The company stated  that it expects to gain approval for 75 new products or additional  indications in the next five years. The company expects to have about 20  new compounds in phase II/III development by year end.Abbott Labs is working on boosting its vascular products portfolio and  expects to launch more than 10 technologies in the next five years.  These include the potential US launches of MitraClip, XIENCE PRIME and  XIENCE Nano. Abbott Labs expects to launch TREK, its next-generation  balloon dilatation catheter, in the US and Japan in early 2011.Meanwhile, the acquisition of Facet Biotech has helped strengthen  Abbott Labs' early- and mid-stage oncology portfolio. The company is  looking to move elotuzumab, which is being developed with Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY), into phase III studies in 2011 for multiple myeloma.Abbott Labs is also working on strengthening its neuroscience portfolio  and has several candidates in different stages of development for the  treatment of diseases like schizophrenia, pain, Alzheimer’s and multiple  sclerosis. Abbott Labs, along with partner Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB), moved daclizumab into a phase III study for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).Another promising pipeline candidate in the company’s pipeline is  bardoxolone, which is scheduled to enter into phase III studies in early  2011 for chronic kidney disease.Neutral on Abbott LabsWe currently have a Neutral recommendation on Abbott Labs, which is  supported by a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term “Hold” rating).

It operates in four segments: Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Vascular Products. The company is a dividend aristocrat which has increased distributions for 38 years in a row.Over the past decade this dividend stock has delivered an annualized total return of 3.10% to its loyal shareholders.The company has managed to deliver an average increase in EPS of 8.40% per year since 2000. Analysts expect Abbott Laboratories to earn $4.17 per share in 2010 and $4.66 per share in 2011. This would be a nice increase from the $3.69/share the company earned in 2009. The growth would come from increase in sales in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis drug Humira, cholesterol treatment drug Niaspan and the Xience drug eluting stent. The company’s growth is also dependent on the successful integration of the pharmaceuticals unit that it purchased from Solvay for $6.2 billion in 2010, which included Abbott with the cholesterol drugs Tricor and Trilipix.The company has a high return on equity, which has remained above 20%, with the exception of a brief decrease in 2001 and 2006. Rather than focus on absolute values for this indicator, I generally want to see at least a stable return on equity over time.The annual dividend payment in US dollars has increased by 8.60% per year since 2000. A 9% growth in distributions translates into the dividend payment doubling every eight years. If we look at historical data, going as far back as 1986, we see that Abbott Laboratories has actually managed to double its dividend every six years on average."
243430,23993,2010-12-23T13:10:28-05:00,,"Normally, glucose test strips don’t land on many radar screens in a  big way, but when a company recalls 359 million of them -- that’s right,  359 million -- it’s hard not to notice. But that’s exactly what Abbott  Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) has done, because its strips may give false low blood-glucose readings.This, of course, can have serious implications, because false results  may lead patients to try to raise their blood glucose unnecessarily, or  fail to treat elevated blood glucose. The strips are marketed under  such brand names as Precision Xceed Pro, Precision Xtra, Medisense  Optium, Optium, OptiumEZ and ReliOn Ultima, which were distributed in  the U.S. and Puerto Rico.How much this will cost Abbott is not yet clear. But the drug and  device maker is still suffering from the fallout of a decision just three months ago to begin recalling five million units of Similac powdered infant  formula, after beetles were discovered in a plant and consumers  complained of contamination. At the time, the move was expected to cost  about $100 million in lost sales.Other products from the Abbott Diabetes Care unit are not affected by  this latest recall. Nonetheless, this is the same unit that received an  interesting warning letter  last July, in which the FDA noted some failings at the Alameda, CA  plant. Specifically, the director of quality systems did not have the  required Bachelor of Science/Technical/or Engineering degree, but  instead held a Business Administration degree. And the person who was  regulatory affairs manager lacked the minimum of five years of  regulatory experience required in the job description. Hmmm.Abbott, of course, is not the only company observing the holiday  season with a recall. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has outdone everyone else  with an impressive effort that seems to involve a recall of one  over-the-counter med or another nearly every week. And just the other day, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) yet again withdrew a batch of 40mg Lipitor cholesterol pills. At this rate, pharmacies will soon begin running out of products on their shelves.Disclosure: None"
238818,23895,2010-11-26T13:51:50-05:00,,"Over several decades a fixture in both its Industry and the larger market/economy, Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) has been tagged with a share price markdown in recent weeks. From the low-mid 50's of not long ago it now struggles to hold onto $47, slightly over 5% atop its 52 week closing low but fully 17% beneath its 52 week best. Similarly as with both 50 and 200 day moving averages north of 50, the stock is now offered at noticeable discounts. What has brought this about, and what should the savvy investor do about it?Among the pharmaceutical entrants ABT has stood aside with a fairly low --- either side of 60% --- revenue component derived from prescription compounds, the remainder faithfully arriving through nutritional supplements and an assortment of diagnostic and testing devices aimed at vascular and other health shortcomings. Put another way, its product slate is comparatively diversified. It has nonetheless been widely noticed and documented that the company's pipeline of life-supporting medications had become weak, or, as one commentator cleverly put it, ABT was not delivering enough ""shots on goal"" toward the Food and Drug Administration's net minders, who in the meantime have grown more demanding and selective before escorting a new member through Phase III clinical trials. In addition to bolstering research and development outlays, Abbott's management elected to mobilize its fortress balance sheet, sporting $12.68 net current assets per share at year end 2009, toward buying its way to a prosperous future.Beginning last year and continuing in earnest throughout 2010 the company executed some high profile purchase acquisitions. In sequence this year have come a $6 billion outlay for the pharmaceutical unit of a privately held Belgian conglomerate Solvay, followed up with --- presumably while the corporate checkbook had yet to be returned to the safe --- another $2.2 billion in exchange for India-based Piramal Healthcare Ltd. A few others of lesser dimension bring this year's cash outlays to the area of $9 billion, enough to rearrange balance sheet entries in ways not altogether welcome to some. Nothing truly threatening or that cannot be reversed with astute management in coming periods, but it remains true that for the time being common equity has slipped to below 40% of footings. Debt ratios however measured have risen, and interest coverage multiples have softened, from over 12 times to under 8. The nature of the acquisitions --- in formal accounting parlance the purchase method ---- further gives rise to such balance sheet ""assets"" as goodwill and other intangibles, neither of which produce anything, but each of which must be expensed against revenue. So burdened, the June and September Quarters (ABT keeps a December Fiscal Year) struggled to meet prior earning estimates, leaving the path of least share price resistance down. Consensus postings of $4.15 or so for this year and $4.65 for 2011 will be met, if at all, only by excluding the effects of presumably one-off accounting charges.Atop the foregoing is Humira, long an autoimmune all-star performer but estimated by some as by itself representing 20% of the firm's $72 billion total market value. It seems that the folks over at Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) detected patent infringement and whose attorneys prevailed in the opening round, prompting Abbott to set aside --- in plain view on its own balance sheet --- $1.8 billion in escrow toward an eventual adverse legal outcome. Needless to say the competing arguments rest now in an appellate jurisdiction, with each side doubtless prepared to introduce them before the Supreme Court of the United States. Predicting outcomes in matters of this nature lies outside the pale of orthdox financial analysis and accordingly none is ventured here. A veteran and skilled management team reports for duty each working day to the Abbott's Northern Illinois headquarters, a group having a demonstrated history -- most recently with the assimilation of Guidant's stent portfolio --- of success in weaving the new entrants smoothly and economically into the Corporate dynamic. Investors are advised to continue votes of confidence in ABT's resumption of robust health and prosperity, especially as such elections can now be cast at less than 11.5 times this year's number and with close to a 10 P/E ratio on the next. Although recent reports are of a slight decline in the short interest, marshalling a variety of other metrics points in the direction of a low-mid 60's share price over the next 12-18 months could be enough to serve up a 30-33% capital gain escorted by the current 3.70% cash dividend yield. A computed Beta of less than 0.50 rounds out the frame in ways that should incline the prudent investor to take a long stand at current prices. Disclosure: No positions"
235763,23061,2010-11-09T10:53:11-05:00,,"In an article dated October 18, 2010, I compared and performed relative valuation of 6 major drug companies.  In this article, I will focus on Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) and present my discounted cash flow analysis results for the company.  ABT is primarily divided into 4 operating segments namely Pharmaceuticals, Nutritional Products, Diagnostics, and Medical Services.  Although commonly seen as a pharmaceutical company, this segment contributed only about 55% of the total company revenues during the first nine months of this year.  Nutritional Products accounted for approximately 16% of total sales.  International sales were responsible for 57% of total revenues.  Abbott has a diverse product offering which it markets in 130 countries.  Its blockbuster drug HUMIRA (used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis) accounted for 33% of the company’s global pharmaceutical sales.  Other major products include TRILIPIX, TriCor and Kaletra which together contributed $2 billion in global sales.  The US patent for HUMIRA will expire in December 2016.  Several other patents expire during this decade.To make up for the impending patent expirations, ABT has been investing significant amounts of money to develop new products. For example, in fiscal year 2009, ABT invested approximately $2.7 billion into R&D.  The company expects to introduce 75 new products and indications (including non pharma) during the next 5 years.  Still, several analysts believe that ABT’s pipeline lags its peers like Merck (NYSE:MRK).    Abbott is known for its aggressive acquisitions having closed three major deals this year.  These acquisitions provide an attractive opportunity for growth.  The company bought Solvay Pharmaceuticals early this year as part of its strategy to gain a foothold in emerging markets.  Emerging markets, the company reports, are growing at three times the rate of developed markets.  In September, the company announced the acquisition of Piramal’s Healthcare Solutions Business in India. This acquisition catapulted ABT into a leadership position in the generic pharmaceutical business in India.  India is the 2nd fastest growing emerging market and the $8 billion pharmaceutical market is predicted to double by 2015.  ABT expects to generate about $2.5 billion in sales from India by 2020.  Nutritional Products segment is another growth driver for ABT.  The company reports that it is the fastest growing nutritional company in international markets and expects to maintain its double digit growth.  It continues to gain market share in infant nutritionals and is a leader in adult and therapeutic nutritional products.  As is the case with the pharmaceuticals segment, emerging markets should provide significant opportunities for growth in the nutritional segment.Discounted Cash Flow ValuationDCF valuation was performed by employing a two-stage model with a high growth period of 10 years.  The major inputs and the valuation results are presented below.  As shown above, my DCF analysis yields a fair value of $66 a share.  My relative valuation analysis indicated a fair value of $60 a share.  Combining the two values, my price target for ABT is $63 a share.  As of November 8, 2010, ABT was trading at $50.45 a share implying a discount of approximately 20%.  Additionally, the stock currently yields a healthy 3.5% compared to the 2.55% yield of the 10-year Treasury note.  At these levels, ABT makes a compelling investment opportunity with a total return potential of about 25 to 30% in 12-months.  (Kindly use this article for information purposes only.

The decision is expected to give a  significant boost to domestic generic drugmakers that are willing to  make and sell lower-cost versions of the Kaletra protease inhibitor,  which combines lopinavir and ritonavir, in India and developing  countries.“The impact of the case is tremendous,” writes Tahir Amin, co-founder  and director of the Intellectual Property Initiative for Medicines,  Access & Knowledge in a note to us. His group fought to reject the  Indian patent and he complained that Abbott has been “gaming the patent  system” with various applications. Meanwhile, he also maintains Abbott  was charging higher prices in many countries, including in India - about  $1,000 per patient per year - than what generic makers charge. By  contrast, the Clinton Health Access Initiative recently negotiated $440  per patient per year for generics from four suppliers.Kaletra, which is also known as Aluvia in some countries, is an  important second-line AIDS med, and the ritonavir component is also  widely used as a stand-alone protease booster that can be combined with  other unpatented protease inhibitors. Amin posits that cost savings  generated over a three-year period by introducing generic Kaletra to 43  low- and middle-income countries would be sufficient to start 130,000  new patients on HIV treatment who currently lack access.“That is 130,000 lives that could be saved from opening up the market  for this drug alone,” he writes us. Kaletra, by the way, is one of the  meds that Doctors Without Borders wants licensed to the new Medicine  Patents Pool (look here). So far, though, Abbott and other drugmakers have yet to embrace the initiative.This is not the first time that Abbott has run into a roadblock over  Kaletra. The drugmaker engaged in a long-running battle with Thai  authorities after they issued a compulsory license (background). Abbott subsequently retaliated by withdrawing all of its unregistered new drugs from the Thai patent application process (see here).  This is why “tweaking Abbott’s nose is a pretty big deal,” Brook Baker  of Health GAP and a professor at the Northeastern University School of  Law.A spokesman for Abbott, which can appeal the decision, writes us to  say that “new formulations of Kaletra have provided physicians and  patients with real improvements in its use, dosing and convenience …The heat stable tablet solves specific convenience limitations of  Abbott’s earlier version, which required refrigeration and had to be  taken with food. These challenges have been resolved with the new  tablet, and there is significant benefit for patients in developing  countries and resource limited settings. Abbott is reviewing this  decision and determining its next steps.”Disclosure: No position"

Earnings increased 14.1% from the year-earlier  period. However, including one-time items, EPS declined 40% to 57 cents.Although revenues grew 11.8% to $8.7 billion, they fell short of the  Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.9 billion. Revenues were negatively  impacted by foreign exchange (Fx) fluctuations (1.0%) as well as the  recall of the infant product Similac in September.Performance by SegmentPharmaceutical division sales were $4,937 million, up 21.7% (including a  1.6% negative Fx impact). Strong Humira and lipid franchise sales were  offset by the weak performance of Kaletra, which declined 7.2% to $328  million. Pharmaceutical revenues included sales from the Solvay  acquisition that closed in mid-February 2010.The lipid franchise posted sales of $629 million during the quarter  with TriCor/TriLipix sales increasing 22.1%. Meanwhile, Humira recorded  sales growth in both the US (8.1%) and international markets (16.6%)  during the quarter. The company reported that growth trends in the  international anti-TNF market remained strong, with Humira maintaining a  leading share in several markets. Third quarter Humira sales increased 12.6% to $1.7 billion. Abbott Labs  is working on expanding Humira’s label and is also seeking US and  European approval of ABT-874 for the treatment of psoriasis.The Nutritional business posted third quarter sales of $1,365 million,  down 1.5%. Sales were impacted by the September 2010 recall of infant  formula product Similac. Pediatric nutritional sales were down 9.3%  during the quarter. Results were also impacted by tough year-over-year  comparisons in international markets due to new product launches that  occurred in the third quarter of 2009.Abbott Diagnostics posted sales of $916 million in the quarter,  representing an increase of just 0.8%. Meanwhile, the Vascular division  continued to perform well, with sales increasing 18.6% to $790 million,  thanks to strong growth in international markets. XIENCE V and XIENCE  PRIME should continue performing well in Japan and Europe. Other  division sales totaled $667 million, down 10.6%.Abbott Labs Narrows EPS Guidance RangeFollowing the release of third quarter results, management raised the  lower end of their previously issued 2010 earnings guidance by 3 cents.  Abbott Labs now expects to deliver earnings in the range of $4.16 -  $4.18 per share, representing double-digit growth. The Zacks Consensus  Estimate currently stands at $4.16.Abbott Labs also provided an update on its pipeline. The company stated  that it expects to gain approval for 75 new products or additional  indications in the next five years. Abbott Labs is working on boosting  its vascular products portfolio and expects to launch several products  in the next five years. These include the potential US launches of  MitraClip, XIENCE PRIME and XIENCE Nano.Meanwhile, the recent acquisition of Facet Biotech has helped  strengthen Abbott Labs' early- and mid-stage oncology portfolio. Abbott  Labs is also working on strengthening its neuroscience portfolio and has  several candidates in different stages of development for the treatment  of diseases like schizophrenia, Alzheimer’s and multiple sclerosis.  Abbott Labs, along with partner Biogen (BIIB), recently moved daclizumab into a phase III study for the treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).Neutral on Abbott LabsWe currently have a Neutral recommendation on Abbott Labs, which is  supported by a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Hold rating). Abbott Labs'  strong business segments, contributions from recent acquisitions and  impressive late-stage pipeline should help fortify long-term earnings  growth.

Jobs will be cut from commercial, R&D, manufacturing and staff operations, primarily at Solvay locations in Europe, such as The Netherlands and Germany. As part of the cuts, the Solvay US headquarters in Marietta, Georgia, will be shuttered.The move comes roughly one year after Abbott purchased Solvay’s drug business for $6.2 billion, but failed last month to find a buyer for the Solvay vaccine business, a deal that some believed could fetch $600 million or more. An Abbott spokeswoman says certain R&D programs will be discontinued, such as traumatic brain injury, cardio/metabolic indications, and diabetes, but the drugmaker is not exiting work from specific therapeutic categories. For those curious about the fate of the Solvay vaccine biz, the cell-based vaccine program will be among the programs to be ended, but egg-based vaccine research will continue.Abbott currently employs about 90,000 people worldwide. The cuts are expected to result in pre-tax charges of approximately $810 to $970 million over the next 2 years, and the majority of unspecified savings are expected to take place by 2012, according to a filing Tuesday morning with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

Page after page describes  litigation: shareholder lawsuits; claims by consumers that they were  injured by drugs; and lawsuits between the drug makers themselves  squabbling over patent rights.If you’re a lawyer, those passages may warm your heart. But for the  rest of us, the lawsuit disclosures add another layer of maddening  uncertainty in choosing stocks. Which claims are B.S., likely to be  settled for nuisance money, and where lurks the next Fen-phen debacle?ABT Stock ChartAbbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT),  a company with very attractive financials and a relatively cheap share  price, has a doozy of a lawsuit on its hands, one that attacks its most  important product, Humira. The drug, which treats rheumatoid arthritis  and other immune-system ailments, had 2009 sales of $5.5 billion, and is  still growing rapidly. First-half 2010 Humira sales rose 28.1%, to $3.0  billion (somewhat inflated by foreign exchange rates).The drug is part of an industry triumvirate, along with Enbrel and  Remicade, that, along with some follow-on drugs, combined could bring in  $33 billion by 2015. The stuff ain’t cheap. With 425,000 worldwide  users as of early this year, it appears each person’s Humira habit  brings Abbott about $13,000 a year. Enbrel and Remicade are similarly  priced.Abbott actually already lost the lawsuit. A federal court jury in the  Eastern District of Texas in June 2009 found that Abbott infringed a  patent held by a Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)  unit, Centocor, which sells Remicade, and ordered Abbott to pay $1.67  billion. The award was called the largest ever in a U.S. patent  infringement case at the time. (New York University, which helped  develop Remicade, is also a plaintiff in the case.) Then, earlier this  year, Abbott had to deposit $1.87 billion (the award plus interest) into  an escrow account, pending Abbott’s appeals of the award. Those could  take years to resolve.J&J, of course, is seeking additional damages since Abbott continues to sell Humira.Even before the jury award, Abbott’s p/e ratio  was in the mid teens. And this is a company, unlike others in Pharma,  that isn’t facing patent expirations on its best medicines (unless it  somehow loses the right to sell Humira).ABT Stock ChartAbbott’s dividend is solid and ever-rising.ABT Stock ChartAnd the payout provides a nice yield at the current stock price.ABT Stock ChartAbbott has produced nice revenue growth.ABT Stock ChartIf Abbott wins the Humira case on appeal, or even if it limits the  damages it has to pay to something close to the $1.87 billion and is  allowed to keep selling Humira, the stock looks attractive. If its  ability to continue selling Humira is compromised, Abbott will become a  very different company.Disclosure: No Positions"
225348,23993,2010-09-15T05:59:42-04:00,,"In response to US pricing of the Norvir AIDS drug sold by Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), an advocacy group plans to petition the National Institutes of Health this month to break several patents on the drug. The forthcoming move by Knowledge Ecology International comes six years after the group failed at a similar attempt to convince the agency to override patents held by the drugmaker on the grounds that a recent 400 percent price hike was unreasonable, anticompetitive and threatened the health and safety of people with AIDS (here is the 2004 petition and the NIH denial [pdf files]).In a recent report, however, KEI notes that for patients without some form of government assistance or insurance, Norvir continues to cost much more than in other countries, both those are that considered developed and less-developed nations. Last month, for instance, Norvir cost more than $10 a pill, or more than $7,800 annually, compared with prices in other high-income countries, ranging from $1.04 in New Zealand to $2.63 in Denmark, or $759 to $1,919, respectively, a year. Patients covered by US government programs would have paid $876, according to the report. Similarly, KEI notes that a 100mg dose of the oral solution in the US cost $9.36 versus $1.41 in Australia.As KEI attempts to build its case, its report goes on to point out that Norvir was invented by Abbott with support from the US government under a contract awarded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and that a recent search of the NIH database identifed 1,230 NIH grants and 58 patents that cited support from these grants. KEI argues, by the way, that the Bayh-Dole Act authorizes the government to take steps to ensure that inventions are licensed to the public on reasonable terms.And in an effort to underscore the federal government continues to invest in Norvir, a recent search of ClinicalTrials.gov found 130 trials that were funded by the NIH or other US federal agencies. A total of 181 trials were identified as funded by a university or other non-profit entity and 289 trials were identified as funded by industry. There were also 77 instances in which trials were jointly funded.This would be the second recent instance in which a march-in petition is filed against a large drugmaker. Frustrated by the ongoing shortage of Genzyme’s (GENZ) Fabrazyme medication for Fabry’s disease, three patients last month petitioned the US Department of Health and Human Services to override the use patents held by the troubled biotech.Disclosure: None"
225067,23993,2010-09-14T07:29:55-04:00,,"Since then, the FDA has been criticized for not moving faster, although the agency had preferred to wait for full results to be issued. And so the advisory committee can now choose among four options: besides recommending withdrawal, the experts can urge continued marketing with the same labeling; continued marketing with revised labeling, such as a black box warning; allow continued marketing, revise the labeling with boxed warnings and limit use; or simply withdraw Meridia from the US market. A recent editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine pushed for withdrawal.“While (Meridia) may improve some cardiac risk factors (e.g. increasing HDL cholesterol), it may have detrimental effect on others (e.g. increasing in blood pressure and pulse rate). No direct evidence supporting that moderate weight loss with (Meridia) reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality was found in the published literature. The lack of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality endpoints in obesity trials represents a major gap in knowledge. However, given the modest decrease in body weight associated with sibutramine and the potentially substantial weight regain with discontinuation of therapy, even a small increase in cardiovascular risk seems unwarranted,” writes FDA staffers in briefing documents (pdf).Another FDA memo states that “reports submitted by the sponsor suggested low number of cardiovascular events among on-label patients. Additionally, no major cardiovascular adverse events were identified thorough a literature search of published reports of trials that examined the effects of sibutramine on weight loss or weight maintenance. However, several important limitations, including failure to use validated outcomes and potential failure to capture outcomes from patients who discontinue trial, combined with a low number of events, precludes drawing of definitive conclusions. Due to their limitations, these studies may not provide convincing evidence to support a low or lack of cardiovascular risk associated with"" Meridia.Want to read what Abbott has to say about its pill? Read the briefing documents here (pdf).Disclosure: None"
223707,23993,2010-09-03T05:54:58-04:00,,"After months of waiting, the final and complete results from a study about the Meridia diet pill are now available in The New England Journal of Medicine and the findings are as bad as what was suggested by the preliminary data released last November. The SCOUT study, which was financed by Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT), the company that sells the pill, shows Meridia raised heart attack and stroke risk in patients with pre-existing heart disease (read the abstract).The study examined nearly 10,000 people 55 and older with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes or both, who were given Meridia or a placebo. They also participated in a diet and exercise program. On average, Meridia was taken for more than three years and the risk of a heart attack or stroke was 16 percent higher. Those taking the diet pill, which has been on the US market since 1997, were not more likely to die of cardiovascular disease, although it’s worth noting the drug is known to increase blood pressure and heart rates.When preliminary results were released, European regulators quickly told docs to stop prescribing Meridia, because the risks outweigh the benefits, and decided Abbott’s license to market the pill should be suspended. By contrast, the FDA added new warnings highlighting increased risks for patients with heart problems, but reserved further action until full results were released and an advisory committee meeting is held this month.An editorial in the New England Journal, however, points out some shortcomings with the FDA approach. The Meridia label, for instance, includes a warning that the drug should not be used in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease, but does not state that the pill is contraindicated in patients with cardiovascular disease. Moreover, the editorial also notes that 13 years have passed before a large clinical trial was completed to offer “an accurate assessment of cardiovascular risk.”They also underscored that, in exchange for a net weight loss of about 8 pounds, there was a 1 in 70 chance of having a myocardial infarction or stroke (and a 1 in 52 chance for those with cardiovascular disease). Given that diet pills are presumed to be taken for a long period of time by those who are struggling to keep off weight - and heavier people are likely to have an increased risk of cardiovascular problems - those odds do not look so good.And so the editorialists, who included New England Journal editor Jeff Drazen, conclude Meridia should go. “Given that (Meridia) has minimal efficacy for weight loss, no apparent benefit for clinical outcomes, a worrisome cardiovascular risk profile, and a plausible mechanism to explain the cardiovascular risk, it is difficult to discern a credible rationale for keeping this medication on the market,” they write. Meridia is actually not widely used in this country, but is likely viewed as helpful by some docs and patients. And for its part, the FDA can argue that issuing sterner warnings while waiting for complete results is prudent. Then again, months have passed while an untold number of people were at risk, unlike in Europe."

Below are some highlights from the above linked analysis:Company Description: Abbott Laboratories is a diversified life science company and is a leading maker of drugs, nutritional products, diabetes monitoring devices, and diagnostics.  Fair Value: I consider four calculations of fair value, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:ABT is trading at a discount to only 1.) above. The stock is trading at a 7.4% discount to its calculated fair value of $55.42. ABT earned a Star in this section since it is trading at a fair value.Dividend Analytical Data: In this section there are three possible Stars and three key metrics, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:ABT earned two Stars in this section for 1.) and 3.) above. A Star was earned since the Free Cash Flow payout ratio was less than 60% and there were no negative Free Cash Flows over the last 10 years. ABT earned a Star for having an acceptable score in at least two of the four Key Metrics measured. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1926 and has increased its dividend payments for 38 consecutive years.Dividend Income vs. MMA: Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account (MMA)? This section compares the earning ability of this stock with a high yield MMA. Two items are considered in this section, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:ABT earned a Star in this section for its NPV MMA Diff. of the $1,500. This amount is in excess of the $500 target I look for in a stock that has increased dividends as long as ABT has. If ABT grows its dividend at 8.3% per year, it will take 1 year to equal a MMA yielding an estimated 20-year average rate of 3.4%. ABT earned a check for the Key Metric ‘Years to >MMA’ since its 1 years is less than the 5 year target.Memberships and Peers: ABT is a member of the S&P 500, a Dividend Aristocrat and a member of the Broad Dividend Achievers™ Index. The company’s peer group includes: Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE:BMY) with a 4.8% yield, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) with a 3.4% yield, and Eli Lilly & Co. (NYSE:LLY) with a 5.6% yield.Conclusion: ABT earned one Star in the Fair Value section, earned two Stars in the Dividend Analytical Data section and earned one Star in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a total of four Stars. This quantitatively ranks ABT as a 4 Star-Buy.Using my D4L-PreScreen.xls model, I determined the share price would need to increase to $74.95 before ABT’s NPV MMA Differential decreased to the $500 minimum that I look for in a stock with 38 years of consecutive dividend increases. At that price the stock would yield 2.29%.Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the target $500 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 4.5%. This dividend growth rate is well below the 8.3% used in this analysis, thus providing a margin of safety. ABT has a risk rating of 1.25 which classifies it as a low risk stock.All pharmaceutical companies face the inevitable patent expirations and the ensuing generic competition. However, ABT has a strong product pipeline including potential significant launches in the medical device and pharmaceutical areas. In addition to pharmaceutical, ABT will also rely on its diagnostics business, nutritional division, and an emerging vascular group to generate future earnings. With its strong financials and excellent management team, ABT is in a position to continue its growth and to generate strong returns. I will continue to add to my position while it is trading below my buy price of $55.42 and as my allocation allows.

Friday it closed at $46.46 with a yield of 3.8%. However, that performance is not so bad when compared with Dow Jones Industrials and S&P 500 which are lower. ABT is a leading pharmaceutical company founded in 1888 and has a long track record of growth. From 2002 to 2009, sales doubled to $30 billion while basic EPS rose from $1.63 to $3.71. Dividends were increased from 94¢ to $1.60 and raised another 10% this year to an annual rate of $1.76.Abbott's revenues are primarily from the sales of 4 broad lines of health care products (percentages are from Q1 2010 sales):Pharmaceutical..57%Nutritional..........17%Diagnostics.......12%Vascular............10%About 55% of sales are outside the US and, like most Dividend Aristocrats, they are looking to sales in emerging markets as a major source of future growth.Last year Abbott added new businesses to help maintain its growing ways. Solvay Pharmaceuticals was purchased for expansion in Eastern Europe and emerging markets. They expect this acquisition to more than double their presence in emerging markets and should be accretive to EPS in 2010. ABT entered the vision care market with the purchase of Advanced Medical Optics and Visiogen. They also bought Evalve for its pioneering technology in minimally invasive treatment of mitral regurgitation (structural heart repair).In Q1 2010, sales increased 14.6% to $7.7 billion (4.1% of the gain was due to the effect of favorable exchange rates) as their 4 major global segments delivered 12-16% growth. Excluding non recurring items, EPS rose to 81¢ from 73¢ in the prior year. Their guidance for 2010 EPS is $4.13-4.18, excluding special items, giving it a P/E of 11X. Analysts are forecasting $4.64 for 2011 which would bring the P/E down to 10X. 2010 is their 38th consecutive year of higher dividends and the Q1 dividend was the 345th consecutive one since 1924.ABT has a long record of increasing annual dividends and its yield is attractive compared with other investments. In addition, ABT returns money to shareholders by purchasing roughly $1 billion in treasury stock annually. This adds a few pennies to EPS and represents another buyer for its stock. ABT is an excellent stock for value investors, especially if stock markets sell off further raising its yield above 4%.Disclosure: No positions"

At  that price the stock would yield 2.57%.Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls  model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the  target $500 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 5.6%.  This  dividend growth rate is less than the 8.3% used in this analysis, thus  providing a margin of safety. ABT has a risk rating of 1.25 which  classifies it as a low risk stock.All pharmaceutical companies face the inevitable patent expirations  and the ensuing generic competition. However, ABT’s product pipeline  includes potential significant launches in the medical device and  pharmaceutical areas. With its strong financials and excellent  management team, ABT is in a position to continue its growth and to  generate strong returns. I will continue to add to my position while it  is trading below my buy price of $61.24 and as my allocation allows.

200047,20568,2010-04-21T17:52:47-04:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) reported first quarter earnings of 81 cents per share, a penny above the Zacks Consensus Estimate and at the high end of the guidance provided by the company. First quarter 2010 earnings were negatively impacted by 3 cents due to US health care reform. Earnings increased 11% from the year-ago period (see conference call transcript here).Revenues grew 14.6% to $7.7 billion. Revenues were positively impacted by foreign exchange (Fx) fluctuations (4.1%). However, higher Medicaid rebates under the US health care reform reduced revenues by $60 million.Performance by SegmentsPharmaceutical division revenues were $4,103 million, up 12.9% and positively impacted by about 4.4% by Fx. Strong Humira and lipid franchise sales were offset by weak performance of Depakote, which is facing intense generic competition. Pharmaceutical revenues also included sales from the Solvay acquisition that was closed in mid-February 2010.The lipid franchise posted sales of $496 million during the quarter. Abbott reported a favorable impact on Niaspan prescription trends following the release of data from the Arbiter-6 HALTS at the American Heart Association in November 2009.Meanwhile, Humira recorded growth in both the US (32.4%) and international markets (39.2%) during the quarter. First quarter revenues increased 36.5% to $1.4 billion.The Nutritional business posted first quarter revenues of $1,320 million, up 11.8%. The segment is enjoying strong growth in key emerging markets, including Latin America and Asia. Abbott Diagnostics posted sales of $915 million in the quarter, representing an increase of 12.1%.The Vascular division continued to perform well, with revenues increasing 15.8% to $747 million. XIENCE V should continue performing well thanks to recent approvals in countries like Japan, China and Mexico. Meanwhile, other division sales totaled $613 million, representing growth of 39.2%.Guidance Lowered Due to Health Care ReformManagement reduced their earnings guidance for 2010 in order to include the impact of the US health care reform. Abbott now expects to deliver earnings in the range of $4.13 - $4.18 per share, down from the earlier guidance of $4.20 to $4.25. The new guidance still represents double-digit earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2010 currently stands at $4.23. Abbott also declared a quarterly dividend of 44 cents per share.Abbott provided an update on its pipeline. The company stated that it expects to gain approval for five new products or additional indications in 2010. The company is working on boosting its vascular products portfolio and expects to launch more than 10 new products over the next five years. We currently have a Neutral recommendation on Abbott. The company has some very strong business segments and a great late-stage pipeline. We believe Humira will continue to be a strong growth driver for years to come.Disclosure: No positions"
211357,23179,2010-06-22T17:19:36-04:00,,"Very few companies can match the consistent operating record of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). For more than 120 years, Abbott has demonstrated a durable and sustainable record as a growth company. As a broad-based healthcare company their diversified business strategy has enabled them to consistently generate top-tier performance versus their peers.For calendar 2009, Abbott was once again named to the Standard & Poor's 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, a feat only 10% of S&P 500 companies have achieved. In February of 2010 Abbott increased their dividend by 11%. This marked the 37th consecutive year of rising dividends, and the 344th consecutive quarterly dividend. On June 11, 2010 they announced another dividend of $0.44, marking the 38th year of increase and the 346 consecutive dividend since 1924. Abbott's current dividend yield is 3.6%.Figure 1 below plots Abbott’s earnings-per-share multiplied by their earnings growth rate (orange line with white triangles) since 1991. The light blue shaded area depicts the dividends paid out of earnings and are stacked on top of earnings (green shaded area) for visual perspective. Since Abbott has consistently paid out approximately 40% of earnings, their dividend has increased every year at approximately 10%, or by their earnings growth rate. (Click to enlarge)Figure 1 ABT 20yr EPS Growth with DividendsWith Figure 2A below we have added monthly closing stock prices (black line) to our 20-year EDMP, Inc. F.A.S.T. Graphs (19 years, plus the year we are in). As Figure 2A illustrates, Abbott’s stock price has mostly been above the earnings justified orange line with white triangles until October of 2008 (red arrow). Since the orange line with white triangles represents a fair value PE ratio of 17.5, Abbott is historically undervalued at today's abnormally low PE ratio just above 12. Since earnings have continued to grow at normal rates, we feel this low valuation is unjustified.Figure 2A ABT 20yr EPS Growth Correlated with PriceFigure 2B shows that even though Abbott's current valuation is both historically and abnormally low, it was still able to outperform the S&P 500 since 1991. Consistently growing earnings, coupled with a correlated increase in dividends, have allowed Abbott's long-term buy-and-hold shareholders to achieve above-average long-term returns.Figure 2B ABT 20yr Dividend and Price Performance HistoryAbout Abbott LabsHeadquartered in Abbott Park, Illinois, Abbott Laboratories is a broad-based healthcare company that manufactures, sells, develops and discovers a diversified line of healthcare products. There are many dimensions to Abbott's diversity.Its 12 divisions produce and/or market thousands of products in 130 countries worldwide. Abbott has a broad customer base with more than 50% of their business outside the United States and more than 20% from emerging markets. Their numerous growth franchises include vascular, nutritional, diagnostics, vision care and their largest division pharmaceuticals.Abbott reports four business segments and 12 divisions. These important segments and their divisions are summarized by Figures 3 through 7 from slides presented at the Sanford Bernstein’s Strategies and Decisions Conference on June 4, 2010.Figure 3 slide sixFigure 4 slide sevenFigure 5 slide eightFigure 6 slide nineFigure 7 slide tenAccording to Zacks Investment Research, Abbott operates five business segments. The pharmaceutical segment is their largest, contributing 53% of their revenue mix, nutritional contributes 17%, diagnostics 12% and vascular 9%. Zacks also lists a fifth segment labeled as other contributing 9% of revenues. According to Zacks: “This segment includes a broad line of pediatric and adult nutritional products which are manufactured, marketed and sold worldwide.”However, according to Abbott's own description they operate four major segments: 1. Pharmaceuticals. 2. Nutritional products. 3. Medical devices. 4. Diagnostics. Pharmaceuticals is the largest, and the smallest is diagnostics, with medical devices and nutritional products of about equal size.Growth DriversRegardless of how many business segments you categorize Abbott by, its future growth drivers are numerous and diverse. According to Abbott guidance, its pharmaceuticals segment has a new product pipeline for the next 5years which includes 75 new products and indications. Also, each of its other three segments are expected to prosper and grow with rich new offerings as well.Acquisitions and continued geographic penetration in emerging markets are also expected to contribute to Abbott's future growth. Several acquisitions were completed in 2009, and Abbott has continued making more acquisitions in 2010. In truth, the many drivers that should contribute to Abbott’s future growth are too numerous and beyond the scope of this article to list.Suffice it to say that Abbott’s numerous avenues for growth add up to a consensus forecast of 10.7% five-year future estimates for earnings growth as reported to FirstCall by 18 leading analysts. Figure 8 below offers an EDMP, Inc. F.A.S.T. Graphs forecast graph which calculates fair value based on EDMP’s modified formula for fair value marked in orange GDF–EDMP. The dark orange line with black triangles represents this fair value and shows Abbott Labs to be currently undervalued.Figure 8 Abbott 5yr Earnings ForecastSummary and ConclusionWe believe Abbott Laboratories is an extremely high-quality blue-chip healthcare company with an exceptional history and a very bright future. Its diversified product offerings are extremely well-positioned to serve the healthcare needs of a worldwide aging population.Over the past almost 2 decades, the stock market has typically valued Abbott’s stock in excess of 20 times earnings (see Figure 2 above). Today the same high-quality company can be purchased at a PE of just over 12 times earnings. Furthermore, this dividend aristocrat offers a starting current yield of 3.6%, which is expected to continue to increase at approximately 10% a year or better, as it has in the past.Figure 9 below looks at Abbott Laboratories since calendar year 2005, which clearly illustrates how consistent their business has performed. The past 20 years, the past 5 years, and the consensus forecast for the next 5 years all have averaged approximately 10% or better.Figure 9 ABT 6yr EPS Growth Correlated to PricePerhaps the most important take-away that can be gleaned from all the historical EDMP, Inc. F.A.S.T. Graphs above is how inexpensive this blue-chip’s stock price has become. With apparently nothing seemingly changed, except perhaps market sentiment, this blue-chip stalwart is currently on sale in our humble opinion. Therefore, the conservative investor seeking capital appreciation and a growing dividend income stream should look into this attractive opportunity.Disclosure: Long ABT at time of writing.The opinions in this document are for informational and educational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell the stocks mentioned or to solicit transactions or clients.

Analysts are looking for EPS of 80c on revenue of $7.73B. The consensus range is 79c-81c for EPS, and $7.46B-$7.99B for revenue. Positive catalysts for this quarters results should come from Humira sales, the Xience stent and cost cutting measures. Since Humira sales make up about 35% of Abbot's revenue, investors will be watching closely to see if the company is on track to meets its yearly Humira sales estimates of 20% growth. On April 6, J.P. Morgan said biotech is positioned for further outperformance relative to the broader market and mentioned Abbott as its number two pick."
188043,20568,2010-02-11T08:31:37-05:00,,"Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) recently announced that it is seeking US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for a new diagnostic tool which can be used to monitor patients for the detection of the most common form of ovarian cancer. The ARCHITECT human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) assay has been designed to help monitor the recurrence or progression of epithelial ovarian cancer.  The test, which has been developed under a partnership with Fujirebio Diagnostics, Inc., recently received approval in Europe. Abbott stated that FDA approval would make this the first automated HE4 test to be available in the US.  According to Abbott, ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecological cancers and the fifth-leading cause of cancer death in women. About 1 in 72 women is likely to develop ovarian cancer in her lifetime. Postmenopausal women are at the greatest risk to develop ovarian cancer.  The American Cancer Society estimates that the five-year survival rate of ovarian cancer patients is 46%. However, early diagnosis helps increase the survival rate to 93%.  This diagnostic test, once launched in the US, should see rapid adoption as it will help physicians determine the appropriate treatment option for their patients. In addition to Europe, the diagnostic test is approved in some countries of Asia Pacific and Latin America.  Abbott’s Diagnostic Products segment manufactures and markets diagnostic systems and tests which are sold worldwide to blood banks, hospitals, commercial laboratories, physicians' offices, alternate-care testing sites, and plasma protein therapeutic companies. Revenues from this segment came in at $3.6 billion, comprising 11.6% of total revenues in 2009. We currently have a Neutral recommendation on Abbott."
246521,24292,2011-01-13T17:50:17-05:00,,"Channing Smith is director of equity strategies for Capital Advisors, a wealth management firm based in Tulsa, Okla. A CFA charterholder, he earned an MBA from Southern Methodist University with a focus in finance and accounting.If you could only hold one stock position in your portfolio (long or short), what would it be? Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), a leading global healthcare company developing, manufacturing and marketing products in the following four areas: pharmaceuticals (estimated 57% of revenues), medical devices (estimated 11% of revenues), diagnostics (estimated 11% of revenues), and nutritional products (estimated 16% of revenues). The stock has trailed the overall market since the March 9 low, as evidenced by the 8.7% total return compared to the S&P 500 total return of close to 93% through Dec. 31. Yet, since 2008 the company has grown earnings at an average 12% clip, compared to approximately mid-to-high teens for the S&P 500. Management expects the recent trend in earnings growth to continue in the coming years, which should give investors comfort with regard to earnings visibility. Today, investors can pick up the stock at roughly 10.3 times 2011 consensus earnings ($4.66, according to Bloomberg) and receive a 3.6% dividend yield, which is twice the dividend yield of the S&P 500.With an estimated $7 billion in free cash flow likely this year, we expect the company to make it 38 consecutive years of a dividend increase this spring. At Capital Advisors, we believe this stock provides investors with limited downside from a valuation perspective relative to the overall market, and excellent upside at these levels.Tell us more about the company behind the stock.Abbott Labs is a sustainable growth company that - unlike its industry peers - is not plagued by patent expirations in its existing product lineup. The company has seen tremendous growth from two of its flagship products in Humira, which is a biologic treatment for autoimmune disease, and Xience, which is a drug-eluting stent.Humira generated $5.5 billion in worldwide sales in 2009 and management expects to see worldwide growth of Humira approaching 20% in 2010. We expect Humira to continue to see extremely robust growth in the next several years not only with its core indications in rheumatology, psoriasis and Crohn's Disease, but also in product extensions in other rheumatology therapies, dermatology and gastroenterology. Should the drug prove beneficial in these areas, the revenue and earnings growth will likely be underestimated. Investors should not overlook the success the company is having in its other business segments. Xience is currently the leading stent player in the US market, with sales of over $1.6 billion in 2009. Currently, the vascular business is supported by 100 brands across over a dozen segments. Abbott is the world’s leading manufacturer of coronary stents and guidewires. Additionally, the company’s medical devices focus on diabetes care and animal health, and Abbott Medical Optics is also among the best in the industry. Within Abbott Medical Optics, the company currently holds the No. 1 position in Lasik procedures and the No. 2 position in cataracts. The laboratory diagnostics division is also strong with the No. 1 position globally in blood screening and immunoassay diagnostics. What else is beyond the flagship products?In addition to existing product growth, the company’s future growth is broad-based and promising with more than 350 clinical trials underway and 75 new products and indications in the pipeline across its pharmaceutical, medical devices, diagnostic and nutritional products segments. The company also provides investors with a very balanced geographic mix with the majority of its sales coming from faster-growing overseas markets. Currently, Abbott Labs garners more than 20% of its revenues from emerging markets and management expects to see roughly one-third of its global pharmaceutical sales coming from those high-growth markets in five years.Over the last 18 months the company has strengthened its emerging-markets presence with two strategic acquisitions. Solvay Pharmaceuticals was acquired in September of 2009 which made Abbott a major player in branded generics, but, more important, expanded Abbott’s footprint in Eastern Europe, Russia, Brazil and India. This past August, management announced the acquisition of India’s Piramal healthcare solutions business, catapulting Abbott to the No. 1 pharmaceutical player in the $8 billion Indian pharmaceutical market, which many analysts expect to double in the next five years. How does your choice reflect your investment approach? Tell us more about your approach and goals.Handicapping the markets in the coming years seems particularly challenging because the outcome is heavily dependent on the path of government policy to unwind the massive stimulus programs that were enacted since the financial crisis. At Capital Advisors we continue to see a very uncertain world with numerous risks (sovereign debt issues, potential slowdown in China, rising interest rates, etc.) which could derail the current economic expansion, or at a minimum slow global growth going forward, as we look to “pay for” the stimulus through a combination of restrained government spending and or higher taxes in the coming years. Our macro view of the world directs us to “high-quality” large-cap stocks like Abbott Labs where the valuations are compelling. Going forward we expect high-quality global companies should be better positioned to outperform the overall market in what we expect to be a slower economic growth environment. Large-cap stocks are better positioned to grow in a slow-growth environment due to their economies of scale/operating leverage, ability to raise prices, strong balance sheets (self-funding), and exposure to faster-growing international markets (greater percentage of revenues from overseas). In this type of environment we would expect blue-chip companies to trade at least in line with the overall S&P 500 multiple and potentially at a premium, due to the excellent earnings visibility that companies like Abbott Labs offer investors.Investors worried about downside risks should take comfort in the below-average price-to-earnings ratio of this large-cap class due to the attractive dividend yield many of these high-quality names provide. Should downside risk materialize, the valuations of stocks like Abbott might have less downside because they might “already be there” if the aggregate valuation for the stock market drifts lower over time.How much is your selection based on Abbott Labs' industry, as opposed to a pure bottom-up pick? We screen a universe of about 1,000 stocks every week with two filters. One is a valuation filter based upon traditional fundamental analysis, where we are looking for markers of undervaluation for a given stock relative to its peer group or its own historical metrics. The second screen searches for markers of near-term positive change, using quantitative variables like relative stock price performance, trends in operating margins, and trends in insider trading and analyst sentiment, among others. We are looking for companies that rise to the top of both of these filters simultaneously. We run a relatively concentrated portfolio of about 40 stocks because stocks that meet both of these characteristics simultaneously are relatively rare. When we have a particular sector bet, it's usually because that sector is demonstrating the characteristics we are looking for rather than us having some sort of a macro vision for the future of the industry. Healthcare has become more prevalent in our portfolio lately for this reason. Many stocks in the healthcare sector look cheap after several years of underperformance, yet there are indicators of positive near-term change for many parts of this industry.We pay attention to the underlying business trends of our portfolio companies and when the trends are improving, the majority of the time the share price will rise to reflect the value the company is creating. How is Abbott Labs positioned with regard to competitors? The healthcare industry is extremely competitive. Most of the industry continues to face patent expirations of key drugs which support their valuation. Abbott Labs currently does not face the expiration pressures relative to its peers in the industry. Due to the long lead times of approval of pipeline drugs, investors are able to monitor competing therapies and react to the potential of competing drugs on a company’s existing therapies. Abbott’s key products do not face patent expirations and the product pipeline is robust. How does ABT's valuation compare to its competitors? Abbott Labs trades at a premium to its peers but at a discount to the overall market. Most of the premium can be explained by the fact Abbott has been able to continue to grow its earnings in the low double digits, compared to flattish to modestly positive earnings growth for the overall pharmaceutical industry. Looking ahead to consensus estimates, Wall Street analysts expect the S&P 500 Index earnings to grow from $82.32 in 2010 to $92.42 in 2011, which represents 12.3% earnings growth. On a Price-to-Earnings basis, using the current 1,285 level, the S&P 500 is trading at a 13.9 multiple.Wall Street analysts expect Abbott to grow earnings from $4.17 in 2010 to $4.66 in 2011, which represents 11.8% earnings growth. On a Price-to-Earnings basis using Tuesday's $48 price, shares of Abbott Labs are trading at a 10.3 multiple. We believe this discount is not warranted, considering Abbott has similar earnings growth and a dividend yield nearly twice that of the overall market. We are using a 12.5 multiple, which would result in a target price of $58 per share, or over 20% upside from these levels, excluding the dividend. Should the stock trade in line with the S&P 500, the share price would trade around $65 per share, which is 35% upside from current levels. Does your view differ from the consensus sentiment on Abbott?Capital Advisors combines quantitative disciplines with fundamental analysis. The overriding consensus view is that the valuation is attractive. Where we differ is the sustainability of the double-digit earnings growth trend due to growth of existing products; an enviable position in the emerging markets, where prescription growth should witness double-digit growth over the next decade; and the tremendous prospects of the deep product pipeline. Our quantitative indicators are mixed: We expect continued strong earnings results going into the fourth-quarter 2010 earnings, which could strengthen the current quantitative readings.Does the company's management play a role in your selection?Absolutely. The Abbott management team has shown excellent stewardship over the last decade. The company has balanced investment of capital, as evidenced by the execution of a number of value-enhancing acquisitions over the last decade, and returned capital to shareholders. For example, over the last year Abbott has returned more than $2.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. Lastly, the company has driven efficiency in the underlying business from both a cost perspective and an investment perspective which has driven top-line growth. What catalysts, near-term or long-term, could move ABT stock significantly? The key catalyst for a healthcare company like Abbott is the impact the pipeline drugs could have on future revenues, earnings and free cash flow the company will generate. In the end, drug development is a numbers game. With 75 internal drug candidates and resources to partner for and/or acquire dozens more, Abbott has a number of “shots-on-goal” that could drive future earnings much higher. Here's a handful of therapies that could result in product launches which have billion-plus peak revenue potential:Should even a fraction of these pipeline drugs prove successful, earnings and revenues should be set to move considerably higher in the coming years. What could go wrong with your pick?The industrywide threats will never go away, which include pipeline disappointments, competitive pressures to existing drugs, and unexpected side effects to existing drugs. In the near term, the single largest threat to the investment thesis would be a setback from the Humira franchise, which currently makes up a considerable chunk of the company’s profits. This could come in two forms. A deceleration in revenue growth would put pressure on both the Street's and management’s earnings expectations, as the drug is the key driver of earnings leverage in 2011.Secondly, Pfizer’s (NYSE:PFE) pipeline drug Tasocitinib is showing some promise, and if its safety profile were to improve could pressure Abbott’s dominance in the rheumatology end markets starting in 2013. We see both of these threats as remote at this point, but Pfizer’s next clinical report, due out in the second half of 2011, will be closely watched. Another potential disappointment could be if the recent acquisitions of Solvay or Piramaldo don't provide the earnings accretion investors are expecting. Lastly, although the demographics are favorable for the industry, there remains considerable uncertainty with regard to the potential healthcare changes which could be made by Congress in the coming years. Markets tend to discount the worst possible outcome until the uncertainty subsides. However, with uncertainty comes opportunity. Abbott Labs is currently one of those opportunities. Aside from competitive risks to Humira - Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ:AZN) are also working on similar arthritis drugs, like Pfizer is - there's the legal risk: ABT appealing the $1.7B case lost to Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) on patents, prevailing over Bayer (OTCPK:BAYRY) this week on a similar Humira patent issue, and a suit filed by a Humira user.Because in a way Humira is ""the franchise,"" what's the potential impact of these cases, especially Johnson & Johnson?One of the more frustrating aspects of investing in the biotechnology/pharmaceutical sector is the legal risk that comes from competitors and patients who have claimed a debilitating side-effect. Investors should not be surprised to see a higher incidence of litigation when investing in healthcare companies. However, any potential threats to existing product lines must be taken seriously, especially when there is legal risk to Abbott’s most profitable drug franchise. Specifically, the three cases you mentioned:Thanks, Channing, for sharing your thesis today.Disclosure: Long ABT in personal and client accounts.Read more Just One Stock interviews »If you are a fund manager and interested in doing an interview with us on just one stock or ETF position you'd hold, please email us at Just One Stock."

Earnings increased 11.3% from the year-ago period. For the full year, Abbott reported earnings of $3.72, up 12% from the year-ago period. Full year results were in-line with the company’s guidance of $3.70 - $3.72. Fourth quarter revenues grew 10.6% to $8,790 million. Revenues were positively impacted by foreign exchange (Fx) fluctuations (2.4%). Full-year revenues were $30.8 billion, up 4.2%. Pharmaceutical division revenues for the fourth quarter were $4,849 million, up 5.2% and positively impacted by about 2.5% by Fx. Strong Humira and lipid franchise sales were offset by a weak performance of Depakote, which is facing intense generic competition. The lipid franchise posted sales of $673 million during the quarter. Abbott reported a favorable impact on Niaspan prescription trends following the release of data from the Arbiter-6 HALTS at the American Heart Association in November 2009. Going forward, the approval of Certriad, potentially in the first half of 2010, should help drive lipid franchise sales. Certriad is a fixed-dose combination of TriLipix and Crestor which has been co-developed with AstraZeneca (AZN - Analyst Report). Full-year Pharmaceutical division revenues were $16.5 billion, down 1.3% mainly due to Fx headwinds. Meanwhile, Humira recorded growth in both U.S. (3%) and international markets (7.4%) during the fourth quarter. Humira exited 2009 with a 42% share of the US anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factors) market. Fourth quarter sales increased to 23% to $1.7 billion, with full year sales coming in at $5.5 billion, up 21%. The Nutritional business posted fourth quarter revenues of $1,433 million in the quarter, up 8.8%. The segment is enjoying strong growth in key emerging markets, including Latin America and Asia. Full year Nutritional revenues increased 7.3% to $5.3 billion. Abbott Diagnostics posted sales of $975 million in the quarter, representing an increase of 8.8%. Full year Diagnostics revenues increased 0.1% to $3.6 billion. The Vascular division continued to perform well, with fourth quarter revenues increasing 9.1% to $723 million. XIENCE V should continue performing well thanks to recent approvals in countries like Japan, China and Mexico. Full year Vascular division sales increased 20% to $2.7 billion. Meanwhile, other division sales totaled $810 million, representing growth of 74.6%. For the full year, other division sales increased 31.1% to $2.7 billion. Management provided better-than-expected guidance for 2010. The company expects earnings in the range of $4.20 to $4.25. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2010 is $4.19. The company also declared a quarterly dividend of 40 cents per share. We currently have a Neutral recommendation on Abbott. Abbott’s strong business segments, contributions from recent acquisitions and impressive late-stage pipeline should help fortify long-term earnings growth."

Positive drivers for this quarters results may come from strength in Humira and the new Xience stent. The drug giants global diagnostics business may also help drive revenues. Negatives for Abbot in Q4 continue to be generic erosion in drugs like Depakote.

Japan is the second-largest drug eluting stent market in the world after the United States. With the approval in Japan, XIENCE V will be available in every Asia-Pacific market.   We believe XIENCE V’s launch in Japan in early 2010 could potentially add another $500 million market opportunity. According to the company, about 200,000 stent procedures are performed every year in Japan.   Following the launch of XIENCE V, Abbott has become a major player in the drug-eluting stent (DES) market. XIENCE V has been taking significant domestic and international share from Boston Scientific’s (NYSE:BSX) Taxus (paclitaxel-eluting system), Medtronic’s (NYSE:MDT) Endeavor, and Johnson & Johnson’s (NYSE:JNJ) Cypher (sirolimus-eluting system) drug-eluting stents.   Data on XIENCE V compared to both Taxus and Cypher shows XIENCE V to be the best available product on the market with respect to reducing rates of target revascularization, reducing rates of stent thrombosis, and providing a reduction in risk of major cardiac events (MACE) and all-cause mortality.   Abbott is currently working on a next-generation drug coated stent called XIENCE PRIME. PRIME is already available in Europe and other countries throughout Asia-Pacific and Latin America, and is currently in a large scale clinical program called SPIRIT PRIME in the U.S. If approved, PRIME could hit the U.S. market in the first half of 2012.   Abbott’s Vascular Products segment should continue posting robust growth mainly due to the strong performance of XIENCE V. We have a Neutral recommendation on Abbott."

One way investors can identify over or undervalued stocks is by using AFG’s Intrinsic Value Chart, which displays a company’s intrinsic value relative to its trading range and helps entry/exit points.This easy to read chart identifies how far a stock’s trading range deviates from its intrinsic value (target price assuming immediate decay), which helps you recognize potentially mispriced stocks and pursue long and short opportunities. AFG’s Intrinsic Value Chart also contains a company’s Value Score (ranked valuation attractiveness), Economic Margin Change (expected improvement of economic profitability), and Accuracy (how well AFG’s default valuation has tracked the company) information. AFG’s valuation framework estimates a company’s equity value by subtracting debt and other liabilities from the total enterprise value. The total enterprise value is estimated by discounting projected future cash flows, utilizing analyst consensus, Economic Margin methodology, and the Decay concept which addresses the perpetuity bias in the traditional DCF model.The example we have provided is Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), a company that currently looks undervalued according to AFG’s default valuation model. An important fact to note is that AFG has shown it tracks Abbott Laboratories well (high accuracy score of 98). Also, Abbott Laboratories has a current AFG Value Score of 84, meaning the company ranks in the top 84th percentile of companies in the AFG universe in valuation attractiveness. ABT's expected acquisition of the pharmaceutical portion of Solvay S.A. in Q1 of 2010 will more than likely affect its valuation once completed, but currently, ABT looks attractive.AFG’s Intrinsic Value Chart:• Identifies entry/exit points• Shows how well AFG has tracked the company (accuracy)• Displays the trading range of the company each year through time (blue bars)• Displays the end of year closing price (dash on blue bar)• Displays AFG’s default intrinsic value (red dotted line)How to Read this chart:• The Blue Bars represent the high and low trading range for a stock for each calendar year.• The red dotted line represents Applied Finance Group’s (AFG’s) historical Intrinsic Value through time.• When the red line (Intrinsic Value) is above the blue bars (trading range) the company looks to be undervalued.• When the red line (Intrinsic Value) is below the blue bars (trading range) the company looks to be overvalued.Below is an example of AFG’s Intrinsic Value Chart and the important things to look for within the chart as well as two examples of undervalued companies according to AFG’s Intrinsic Value Chart as well as two overvalued and two fairly valued examples to provide a better understanding of what to look for when analyzing AFG’s Intrinsic Value Chart.To stay updated on companies AFG believes are attractive investment opportunities register here.Disclosure: none"

It operates in four segments: Pharmaceutical Products, Diagnostic Products, Nutritional Products, and Vascular Products. The company is a component of the S&P 500 and the dividend aristocrat indexes. Abbott Laboratories has increased dividends for 38 years in a row. Most recently Abbott raised its quarterly dividend payment by 10% to $0.44/share. Dividend author Dave Van Knapp has included the company in his most recent book ""The Top 40 Dividend Stocks for 2010"".For the past decade this dividend stock has delivered a total return of 7.3% annually.At the same time the company has managed to increase earnings per share by 8.40% on average since the year 2000. For fiscal years 2010 and 2011, analysts expect EPS to increase to $4.24 and $4.77. This would be a nice increase from the $3.69 in earnings per share that the company booked for FY 2009. Analysts also expect an over 7% increase in sales for FY 2010 to 33 billion dollars, excluding the recently completed acquisition of Belgium based Solvay’s pharmaceuticals unit. This deal would add $0.10/share in FY 2010 and $0.20/share in FY 2011. I like the strong product pipeline of Abbott, as well as the potential for new launches. There could be some generic competition for some of Abbott’s products but overall the forecast for future revenue increases is quite rosy. Last year’s acquisition of Advanced Medical Optics exposes the company in the rapidly growing market for LASIK and Cataract procedures.The company also delivers a little over half of its sales from international markets. Almost 18% of its sales come from the drug Humira, which treats rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis. This drug is expected to continue delivering strong sales growth in the next few years for Abbott Labs. In June 2009, a federal jury has returned a verdict of $1.67 billion against Abbott Laboratories in a patent infringement suit. The other party to the suit was Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). Abbott Labs (ABT) is currently appealing the verdict.The ROE has largely remained between 12% and 28% after falling from its 2000 highs over 34%.The company has managed to increase its annual dividend by 8.60% on average over the past decade. A 9% increase in dividends translates into the dividend payment doubling every 8 years. Since 1986 Abbott Laboratories has managed to double its dividend every 6 years on average.The dividend payout ratio has largely remained above 50% over the past decade, with spikes in 2001 and 2006 caused by lower earnings. A lower payout is always a plus, since it leaves room for consistent dividend growth minimizing the impact of short-term fluctuations in earnings. Currently the dividend payout ratio is below 50%.Overall Abbott Laboratories is attractively valued currently, trading at a P/E of 15, dividend yield of 3.20% and an adequately covered dividend. While I don't expect to earn as much as this early Abbott Labs investor, I still believe that there is room for substantial total returns in this position. I would consider be adding to this position.Full Disclosure: Long ABT"

Under the terms of the agreement, Abbott will acquire global rights to PG110 which is a novel biologic that targets Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) for the treatment of chronic pain.PanGenetics will receive an upfront payment of $170 million and $20 million in milestone payments. This agreement should allow Abbott to expand its pain product portfolio and leverage its expertise in biologics. The commercial opportunity in the pain market is significant. There is major demand for the development of a treatment that would provide relief from pain without the potential of addiction and abuse.It is estimated that there are about 72 million diagnosed chronic pain patients in the U.S. and EU, and up to 30% of chronic pain patients get inadequate relief. Current treatments include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), certain Cox-II inhibitors, opioids and other drugs that may have various tolerability and safety issues, including the potential for abuse and addiction.PG110 is currently in a phase I study in patients with osteoarthritis. The successful completion of this study would allow Abbott to explore the candidate’s potential in other pain indications like chronic lower back pain, cancer pain and diabetic neuropathic pain.The deal is scheduled to close by year end. Abbott maintained its previously announced guidance for 2009.We currently have a Neutral rating on Abbott.

In July, Abbott reported Q2 EPS in-line at 89c but a slightly lower revenue number. The lower revenue number for Q2 was attributed in part to lower Depakote sales. Positive catalysts for the company's Q3 report might come from vascular sales where the company has the best selling Xience stent.

Results were above the company’s guidance of 88 – 90 cents. Earnings increased 16.5% from the year-ago period. Total revenues grew 3.5% to $7,761 million. Revenues were negatively impacted by 4.9% due to foreign exchange (Fx) headwinds. Sales in the Pharmaceutical division totaled $4,055 million, down 1.6% and negatively impacted by about 5.5% due to Fx. Strong Humira and lipid franchise sales were offset by weak performance of Depakote, which is facing intense generic competition. The lipid franchise posted sales of $545 million. The recent launch of TriLipix, which will be co-promoted with AstraZeneca (AZN), should help drive lipid franchise sales. Meanwhile, we were pleased to see that Humira continued to perform well in both U.S. and international markets -- we expect the product to play an important role in Abbott’s growth story. Including the negative impact of Fx, Abbott expects Humira sales growth of 18-20%, up from the earlier guidance. We believe the product is gaining share from Amgen/Wyeth’s (NASDAQ:AMGN) Enbrel and Johnson & Johnson’s (JNJ) Remicade. Sales increased to $1.491 billion. The Nutritional business posted sales of $1,386 million in the quarter, up 9.8%. The segment is enjoying strong growth in key emerging markets, including Latin America and Asia. Abbott Diagnostics posted sales of $909 million in the quarter, representing a decrease of 0.3%. However, excluding the Fx impact of 6.1%, sales would have been up 5.8%. The Vascular division continued to perform well, with sales increasing 4.7% to $666 million. XIENCE V continues to gain market share. The company stated that the XIENCE platform, consisting of XIENCE V and Promus, accounts for more than half of the U.S. market. Meanwhile, other division sales totaled $745 million, representing growth of 31.4%. Based on the better-than-expected results, management increased earnings guidance for 2009. The company expects earnings in the range of $3.70 - $3.72 per share, up from the previous guidance of $3.65 - $3.70. Although economic weakness and Fx headwinds have slowed down top-line growth, we believe Abbott is weathering the storm relatively well.

The approval was based on two worldwide clinical trials that enrolled 1302 patients, including 60 patients from two sites in China. Abbott says it plans to launch the device in Q4. It first became available in western countries in 2006.In the clinical trial, Xience V was compared to the Taxus Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary Stent System, a Boston Scientific (NYSE: BSX) product. Xience V reduced the incidence of major adverse cardiac events by 45% (7.1% for Xience against 12.3% for the Taxus stent) over the first two years.

The Abbott stent demonstrated a low rate of repeat procedure and stent thrombosis in the trial’s diverse patient population.Xience V releases everolimus to prevent re-blockage of the artery after a stent procedure. Everolimus, developed by Novartis Pharma (NYSE: NVS), is a proliferation signal inhibitor, or mTOR inhibitor, licensed to Abbott for use on its drug eluting stents. Xience V is built upon Abbott's market-leading bare metal stent, the Multi-Link Vision Coronary Stent System.

143221,20568,2009-06-15T07:59:29-04:00,,"By Jason Napodano, CFA & Brian Marckx, CFAAbbott Laboratories, Inc. (NYSE:ABT) currently trades at 12.5x our 2009 EPS estimate of $3.66 -- slightly more ""expensive"" than the peer average of 11.1x, but we believe the premium is warranted. Abbott offers potentially the strongest combination of growth and relative risk in all of the large-cap pharma space.Abbott has some very strong business segments and a great late-stage pipeline. We expect operating margins to begin to widen in 2009 from a combination of expanding gross margins and leveraging the relatively large SG&A spend in 2008 in support of new indications and product launches including XIENCE V. This, coupled with strong revenue growth from every business segment and the recently announced $5 billion share repurchase program, should help EPS grow at a 5-year CAGR of over 9% through 2013.While sales were relatively flat in the first quarter and are only expected to grow about 2% for all of 2009, most of the slower growth is explained by foreign exchange and the weak economy. We expect both circumstances to be relatively short-term events. Management’s guidance for 2009 includes revenue growing in the low single digits and EPS of $3.65 - $3.70, growth of 9% - 11%. Revenue guidance assumes a foreign exchange headwind of about 6.5%, which implies operational growth of almost 10%. We look for sales of $30.2 billion and EPS of $3.66 in 2009.XIENCE V has exceeded all expectations and has claimed almost 30% U.S. market share after only nine months on the market. The recent growth in PCI procedure trends, further DES penetration and additional launches of the XIENCE V and newer stent products should be significant catalysts to continue to drive the vascular business.The recent acquisition of Kos Pharmaceuticals is a sign that Abbott is actively seeking to grow the pharmaceutical business, especially in the area of cardiovascular care. Although investors could argue that the company paid a heavy premium and lofty price tag of $3.7 billion to acquire Kos, we believe that Abbott will be able to significantly leverage the Niaspan and Simcor compounds with potential combinations with TriCor and AstraZeneca’s (NASDAQ:AZN) Crestor to help drive earnings accretion in 2009 and beyond.We expect the lipid franchise to be a major focus for Abbott going forward. Certriad, if approved, could launch as early as the second quarter 2010, and has the potential to be a significant contributor to growth of Abbott’s lipid business. The AMO transaction should help further diversify Abbott’s product suite and should add a solid growth opportunity, especially as the global economy recovers. Finally, the divestiture of the TAP joint venture sheds Prevacid, which will be faced with severe generic competition, and allows Abbott to focus on higher-growth businesses including its oncology and lipid platforms.Competitively speaking, Abbott is in a good position. Despite a few challenges ahead, including the influx of Depakote generics, we feel there’s significantly more to look forward to than there is to worry about. While economic weakness has slowed sales of a number of products in 2009, Abbott is weathering the storm relatively well. This was highlighted by first quarter EPS coming in $0.02 ahead of guidance and the company affirming previously issued full-year EPS guidance.Humira will continue to be a huge driver of growth for years to come. The late-stage line-up includes a number of initial approvals and additional indications which will help fortify strong long-term EPS growth. Abbott had nine major regulatory approvals in 2008 and expects several more in 2009. As such, we believe Abbott shares will continue to trade at a premium to the broader large-cap pharmaceutical market.Abbott also possesses a lower risk profile than smaller players in the industry. Although the stock remains one of the more expensive names in the large-cap pharma space, we feel it’s well deserved. We believe, based on Abbott’s very strong line-up of current products -- along with its formidable pipeline -- that there’s further room for the multiple to expand. We recommend investors purchase the name as a long-term holding.Our price target is $65, or 17.8x our 2009 EPS estimate of $3.66."

Revenue fell by almost 1% from the same period in 2008 but would have grown 5.4% if not for the negative affect of foreign exchange.Vascular division sales, led by the continued strong performance of coronary stents, increased by 42% in the quarter.

The self-injectable anti-TNF market did not grow as rapidly as expected in the quarter.  Total U.S. prescriptions for Humira grew 18% in the first quarter. Management expects Humira sales to grow 25% - 30% on an operational basis and 15% - 20% including foreign exchange.Vascular sales continue to be driven by the success of the XIENCE V stent and increased penetration of DES stents as well as PCI volumes. Nutritional sales were driven by international operational growth of 18%, lead by strong growth in emerging markets.EPS on an adjusted basis was $0.73 in the first quarter, compared to our estimate of $0.71 and the Street’s $0.70 estimate. EPS benefitted from a slightly stronger than anticipated gross margin and significantly lower than expected SG&A and R&D expenses.

Phase I and Phase II trials nearly doubled from 2007 to 2008.Here are the per share numbers for ABT as reported by Value Line:Year …... Sales ….... C/F ….. EPS ..….. Div ….. B/V ….. Avg.

The current yield of 3.63% is better than CD and Treasury yields and is the highest on ABT shares in decades.Abbott is a high-quality holding. Value Line assigns them their highest ‘A++’ financial strength rating and gives them 100th percentile rankings for both ‘stock price stability’ and ‘earnings predictability’ [on a 1 – 100 scale with 100 being best]. Value Line also rates them #1 for ‘safety’ (their best ranking). Morningstar gives ABT shares their highest (5-star) rating while carrying a $68.00 /share ‘fair value’ and an $85 target for their selling price.What’s amazing is that Abbott’s shares touched a multi-year low of $42.62 as recently as April 7th on nothing but good news. That’s the nature of today’s crazy market conditions. Great companies have been put ‘on sale’ for those intrepid investors who think for themselves instead of merely reacting to short-term charts movements.What can we conservatively expect from ABT shares? Based on consensus views of $3.67 and $4.11 for 2009 and 2010 and a return to a lower than typical 15 multiple I can see $55 by year-end 2009 and perhaps $61 over the next 24 months. Add in the generous and well-covered dividend and the total return potential looks quite attractive.Are those target prices reasonable? ABT shares hit highs of $59.50 and $61.10 in calendar 2007 and 2008 when sales, cash flow, earnings and yields were all less than they are presently.If you’re a believer and want a great medium-term play consider this:On expiration date in January 2011: If ABT shares are > $55 or up 25% from today’s quote:Your $55 calls will be exercised. You will sell your shares for $55,000. Your $55 puts will expire worthless (a good thing for you as a seller). You will have collected 6 or 7 quarterly dividends totaling at least $2400.(I’m assuming that the calls might be exercised prior to the last ex-dividend date in January 2011).You will have no further option obligations.You will own no shares but you’ll hold $57,400 cash for the original outlay of $25,000.That best-case scenario profit would be $32,400/$25,000 = 129.6% cash-on-cash over about 21 months from start to finish.That would occur if Abbott shares move up by 25% or more from inception of the trade through the third Friday in January, 2011. What’s the return if the shares are unchanged at $44.03 right through expiration date in January 2011?Your $55 calls will expire worthless. Your $55 puts would be exercised. You will be forced to buy another 1000 shares and to lay out an additional $55,000 cash. You will have no further option obligations. You will have collected at least $2,800 in dividends. You will now own 2000 shares of ABT worth $88,060. Your position will be worth $90,860 ($2,800 + $88,060).Your total cash outlay was the original $25,000 plus the later $55,000 when the puts were exercised = $80,000.Net profit on this trade = $90.860 - $80,000 = $10,860 = 13.57%.That is a worst-case return if the shares are unchanged as it assumes you were ‘put’ immediately which would almost never happen in real life.The 13.57% total return for the 21 month period = 7.7% annualized on shares that did not go up. What’s the break-even point from start to finish?On the original 1000 shares it’s the $44.03 cost less the $3.30 /share call premium = $40.73 /share.On the puts it’s the $55 strike price less the $16 /share ‘put’ premium = $39 /share.Thus your overall break-even is the average of:$40.73 + $39 = $39.87 /share.That means ABT shares could drop by as much as $4.16 /share or (-9.4%) without causing any losses on this trade.That $39.87 break-even price would be well under the absolute price lows of 2007 - 2008 and pretty much right back to the three-year nadir set in early 2006 when EPS were $2.50 versus the expected $3.67 and $4.11 for 2009 and 2010.Disclosure: Author is long ABT shares and short ABT options."
168880,21835,2009-10-26T11:49:03-04:00,,"Linked here is a detailed quantitative analysis of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT). Below are some highlights from the above linked analysis:Company Description: Abbott Laboratories is engaged in the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a diversified line of healthcare products including: drugs, nutritional products, diabetes monitoring devices and diagnostics.Fair Value: I consider four calculations of fair value, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:ABT is trading at a discount to 1.) and 3.) above. The stock is trading at a 21.9% premium to its calculated fair value of $42.18. ABT did not earn any Stars in this section.Dividend Analytical Data: In this section there are three possible Stars and three key metrics, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:ABT earned three Stars in this section for 1.), 2.) and 3.) above. A Star was earned since the Free Cash Flow payout ratio was less than 60% and there were no negative Free Cash Flows over the last 10 years and another Star was earned as a result of its most recent Debt to Total Capital being less than 45%. The stock earned a Star for having an acceptable score in at least two of the four Key Metrics measured. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1926 and has increased its dividend payments for 37 consecutive years.Dividend Income vs. MMA: Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account (MMA)? This section compares the earning ability of this stock with a high yield MMA. Two items are considered in this section, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:ABT earned a Star in this section for its NPV MMA Diff. of the $1,066. This amount is in excess of the $500 target I look for in a stock that has increased dividends as long as ABT has. If ABT grows its dividend at 8.4% per year, it will take 3 years to equal a MMA yielding an estimated 20-year average rate of 3.9%. ABT earned a check for the Key Metric ‘Years to >MMA’ since its 3 years is less than the 5 year target.Other: ABT is a member of the S&P 500, a Dividend Aristocrat and a member of the Broad Dividend Achievers™ Index.Conclusion: ABT did not earn any Stars in the Fair Value section, earned three Stars in the Dividend Analytical Data section and earned one Star in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a total of four Stars. This quantitatively ranks ABT as a 4 Star-Buy.Using my D4L-PreScreen.xls model, I determined the share price would need to increase to $64.54 before ABT’s NPV MMA Differential decreased to the $500 minimum that I like to see for a stock with 37 years of consecutive dividend increases. At that price the stock would yield 2.48%.Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the target $500 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 6.2%. This dividend growth rate is less than the 8.4% used in this analysis, thus providing a slight margin of safety. ABT has a risk rating of 1.50 which classifies it as a low risk stock.I consider ABT as one of the best pharmaceutical companies. The company has a relatively strong product pipeline, with potentially significant launches in both the medical device and pharmaceutical areas pending. The stock is trading at a 20%+ premium to its buy price of $42.18, so I will patiently wait for market pullbacks before adding to my position.

121949,22142,2009-02-22T12:46:13-05:00,,"2008 was quite an interesting and exciting year for the Healthcare sector. Each sub-sector was struck with their own disruptions and it caused industry wide job cuts and strategic maneuvers. The Obama administration  has come in and new legislation will be passed most likely hurting Biotechnology, Pharmaceuticals, and Managed Care. Only time will tell who stands on top after the talks of startling changes quickly dissipates. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)By reading any of my recent articles you can promptly say that I am not a proud supporter of the Pharmaceuticals sector with the many headwinds they have faced in 2008 and will continue to in 2009, especially the large-caps. Patent expirations, lackluster Blockbuster drug releases, weak pipelines, and the Obama administration coming into reign will only drive down the sector through the majority of this year. However, Abbott Laboratories is definitely an exception, where luckily, pharmaceuticals are not the only revenue- generating source.Abbott is strategically broken down into three major business segments depending on how you specifically dissect the firm: Medical, Pharmaceutical, and Nutritional. Within the Pharmaceutical segment, Abbott is most notably recognized for its blockbuster drug, HUMIRA, which in the most recent quarter showed sales increasing 50% to $1.2 billion including 67% international growth. HUMIRA is primarily used for psoriasis, where it is quickly approaching 30% total market share, but is also approved for five other uses: rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and Crohn’s disease. The company expects full year 2008 global sales for HUMIRA of more than $4.4 billion. The market for all HUMIRA indications is now estimated to exceed $20 billion by the year 2012. Within the Medical Products segment are Abbott Vascular, Diagnostics, and Diabetes Care.Abbott’s Diagnostics segment grew more than 15% in the most recent quarter led by strong growth in each of their three segments: core diagnostics, molecular diagnostics, and point of care diagnostics. I have always been a strong supporter of firms who invest heavily into R&D with diagnostics because I believe it is the future of healthcare. As we continue to face many difficulties with the FDA initiating additional warning labels on drugs, or “black-box,” due to serious adverse reactions, we must invest in personalized medicine, and that is exactly where diagnostics and ABT comes into play.When looking at the Nutritional segment many popular leading brands come into play like Ensure, Glucerna, and EAS. Ensure is for people who are unable to sufficiently construct a balanced diet and need additional nutrients to live a healthy life. Glucerna is used for patients who suffer from diabetes better manage abnormal glucose metabolism. EAS is a popular supplement brand for athletes looking for that extra edge in order to achieve their performance, fitness and nutrition goals. The strategic breakdown of Abbott Laboratories’ business segments make a powerful company with a bright future, in a challenging sector.If you want to read the rest of this article and research reports from other sectors you can download this for free at the following link.- Ryan SavitzDisclosure: None."

I cannot even remember the last time Merck (NYSE:MRK) got something approved or did not report poor results from a clinical trial. Does Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) have a strategy going forward to make up for the loss of Lipitor?The outlook for Big Pharma is very disheartening through 2012. Are there any companies that have slipped through the cracks and emerged as a great Large Cap Pharma player? I can say confidently that Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) [56.21, 0.00 (0.00%)] is a fundamentally sound company, strategically broken down into five segments, and has a bright future.Abbott is broken down into Five Segments:When brushing the surface of the Pharmaceutical division, immediately you key in on HUMIRA.It is hard to sum up the success and future potential that HUMIRA has in one article, but I will provide some insight on how one drug will be extremely beneficial towards revenue growth.Allow me to point out some key statistics:Diagnostics, the future of healthcare. As we push for more personalized medicine in order to avoid failed clinical trials and lawsuits coming from side-effects, diagnostics are in dire need. ABT’s Diagnostic division saw significant growth during the recent quarter in which sales grew more than 17% with increasing flows coming internationally. ABT saw 16% growth in the Core Diagnostic segment this quarter. This included double-digit growth in the U.S. and internationally. Important to note about the international break-up, the emerging markets represents a promising opportunity for future growth in the Core Diagnostic business, as double-digit growth was seen this quarter in both Latin America and China.Aside from Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics, ABT saw quite an increase in revenue coming from the Medical Products division where sales increased 14.7%. More notably the Vascular segment global sales were driven by 35% growth internationally with the immediate success of recently approved XIENCE V. Abbott and the whole healthcare market reacted extremely favorably to the recent approval of XIENCE, and it truly is a next generation drug-eluting stent showing superior performance and durable clinical benefits often spoken about by physicians and patients. On their conference call, ABT said demand is better then expected.By just examining the LT EPS Growth rate we will take a look at some other Big Pharma players and see how Abbott comes out on top.Long-Term EPS Growth Rates:It is very important you do not get caught into the “value trap” within Healthcare. Some of these core holdings have been trading at multi-year lows and attractive valuations, but with key patent expirations, historically weak pipelines, and more strict FDA regulations the educated investor will easily notice that Abbott Laboratories is the choice within Big Pharma.Disclaimer: The author does not have any positions in ABT"

Large, mature growth company. Business = Diversified healthcare, including drugs, medical devices, and nutritional products. Abbott manufactures and markets drugs, vascular products, diagnostics, and nutritional products worldwide. Its workhorse product is auto-immune agent Humira, for rheumatoid arthritis. Humira is a blockbuster whose sales have been growing at 50% annually, on pace for more than $4 B in 2008. It brings in 15% of Abbott’s total revenue.Other products include blood-glucose monitoring kits, stents (including the newly approved drug-eluting Xience V), nutritional liquids, and diagnostic devices. Abbott has compiled a good record with acquisitions, which were the source of both Humira and Xience. Abbott’s non-drug businesses help shield it from the effects of periodic loss of patents on its branded drugs. The company is riding Healthcare and Globalization megatrends.Abbott posted solid Q2 2008 results, with double-digit growth across all divisions (see conference call transcript). Future earnings growth is estimated at 12% annually, an improvement over its past three-year record.On my demanding Easy-Rate™ scoring system, Abbott scores “Good” for company quality. It has generated positive returns in four of the past five years, including +5% so far in 2008. It has raised dividends for 36 years, including an annualized 7% over the past three years and 11% this year. Its current yield is 2.4%.At a recent price of $57.31, I rate Abbott “Fair+” in valuation, meaning it is slightly undervalued. Its P/E ratio is a little high at 24, but its Forward P/E and P/CF (price to cashflow) ratios are both attractive at 16 and 17, respectively.Abbott appears to be a very solid classic growth company with an attractive long-term outlook. There are no major red flags in its financials, and its valuation is decent if not in “back up the truck” territory. It is an excellent dividend buy, with a good current yield and one of the best records in dividend increases.Disclosure: Author holds a long position in ABT"

For the most part, companies are generally priced right around their
intrinsic business value which makes finding steals a difficult and
often disappointing venture. In fact, it would make for a fairly boring
TV show—even if you had bells, whistles, and mooing toys.Such is the case with Abbott Laboratories.If you aren't familiar with Abbott (NYSE:ABT), it is a manufacturer of
pharmaceuticals, medical devices, etc. It is in the game with Johnson
& Johnson, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, and the other big, diversified
players. It has been around so long that Ben Graham used it in his book
The Intelligent Investor two generations ago.Price follows value. For the most part, the markets are generally
efficient—pricing companies right around their intrinsic business
value. From time to time, however, the markets give us an opportunity
to steal businesses for pennies on the dollar. Or, to put it the
popular way—to buy $1 worth of a business for $0.50.Abbott Laboratories is one of those boring, conservative, consistent
businesses that generally seems to grow at a boring, conservative,
consistent rate. For every dollar of invested capital, it generates
roughly $0.15 to $0.18 a year in excess cash. The cash tends to tick up
consistently each year at a predictable rate.Most people would consider Abbott Labs to be a blue chip, boring
stock—a conservative investment for the long term. The few that might
not? Those are the people that bought ABT without knowing (or
estimating) its intrinsic value—ultimately overpaying for the stock
when it was grossly overpriced over the past decade.Abbott Labs has been chugging along for more than a hundred years.
It's no surprise, then, that the past ten have seen just 9% (or so)
growth. Regardless of what the stock price has done, the business has
grown at a touch more than 9% a year.It hasn't really been a net buyer or seller of its stock, so we
can""t expect to get much growth in our ownership from that. When
valuing ABT, we have to make assumptions about the future. As such,
I'll assume that it will continue to grow at about 9% for the next
three years, then slow to just over 8% for three years, and then slow
to 7.5% for the next four. Beyond year 10, I'll assume ABT will grow at
just 5%.Like most companies—especially most large ones—the price of the
stock generally follows (and is often married to) the actual intrinsic
value of the company. Such has been the case with Abbott:Since 1997 (and long before that as well), the stock price has
danced around the value of the company—a value I estimate today to be
about $52 a share. At times, the price got out of control—sometimes
coming in 30% or more higher than the actual value of the company.Considering that prices are driven by supply and demand, that means
that speculators, institutions, and non-business investors were paying
30% or more too much to own a piece of ABT.Abbott is huge. Because of that, it would take a miracle to kick
this company in the butt and get more than 9% or so growth going
forward. That is a bad problem because you can't expect too much from
your company. It is a good problem because you need not expect too many
surprises either.Sure! You can own Abbott when it is fairly priced to its value and
reasonably expect your investment to grow at roughly the same rate as
the company. You can choose to overpay and expect a lesser return. Or,
you can wait for a deep discount and reasonably expect a much greater
return.If you look at the chart again, you""ll see that Abbott never really
gave us a chance to buy it at a deep discount. Will it ever? I don""t
know. And you know what that means: Keep an eye out for a 50% drop on
noise (not news) but move on in the interim.There's a whole world of investment opportunities out there just waiting for you to analyze."

Beating estimates amidst tough circumstances is a sign of solid management, which is always a positive for investors. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) announced an impressive second quarter earnings increase of 34%, which surprised Wall Street with strong growth for its blockbuster arthritis drug Humira. It produced sales of over $1 billion, up 48 percent from last year.Also impressive were the double digit gains in HIV treatment Kaletra and cholesterol drug Niaspan. The bulk (56.5%) of Abbott’s sales comes from prescription drugs such as these, and these results led the company to boost its full year guidance from $3.20- $3.25 up to $3.24- $3.28. As mentioned above, overall pharmaceutical sales were robust with a gain of 17%; however other segments also showed significant gains. Nutritional products—such as multivitamin drink Ensure—were up more than 21%. Of particular note is the coronary stent business, which grew 30% to $217 million. Abbott’s new drug-coated stent, Xience, received approval from the U.S. regulators in early July. It has been available in Europe for some time, although sales have cooled on drug coated stents, once a $6 billion a year industry. Vascular products are at this point only a small portion (6.5%) of ABT’s revenue in this quarter, but the company hopes that its new product will gain wide acceptance. Abbott sponsored a study that revealed Abbott’s Xience was safer and causes less scar tissue than Boston Scientifics’ (NYSE:BSX) Taxus device. Abbott is a fairly diversified conglomerate which allows it to be particularly resilient to strain from generics taking away market share. Generics have eroded revenues of many large drug companies and their stocks have borne the brunt of it. The Healthcare Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLV) is down more than 13% in the last year, but ABT has been resilient and is up about 7%. They have found a way to be successful in a truly difficult market. Abbott, headquartered outside of Chicago, has benefited from strong growth of international revenue of 24%, which outpaced domestic sales growth of just 5.7%.Clearly, we have been making the case for ABT based on improved fundamentals. We had ABT rated a Buy before these figures were released and this only strengthens that position. Over the course of Abbott's history, it has normally traded between 14.7 and 20.1 times cash flow, but the current level is only 12.7. Sales have increased substantially over the last year, continuing a trend of solid sales growth. Revenue per share has increased each of the last 10 years. Abbott would need to be trading near $62 per share in order for the stock to be at the low ends of its normal price-to-cash flow and price-to-sales ranges.We are reaffirming our Buy rating because of improved fundamentals, and we find it strange that ABT would be trading down nearly 2% Wednesday morning on the better than anticipated earnings in this market. Who is complaining though? - all the better for value investors looking to buy on the cheap."
49291,20215,2007-10-09T08:56:00-04:00,,"As generics transform from a nuisance to a notable problem, Abbott (NYSE:ABT) is successfully diversified enough to cushion itself from any single drug going awry.     ABT shares may be more volatile than usual over the next six to nine months as earnings figures come in and beat 2006 figures handsomely. It may take a while for investors to realize that 2006 was an exceptionally LOW year for EPS as ABT reported a $0.31 loss in Q4 2006. EPS for FY 2006 (ending 12/31/06) was $1.12. 2004 and 2005 were $2.02 and $2.16 respectively. We estimate 2007 to come in at $2.48. This is below the consensus.  2006 EPS was derived as follows:     Though ABT has steadily grown revenue over the past decade, earnings have been somewhat erratic. Last year was an example as how ABT plans for the future and doesn't mind taking a temporary set back in earnings. All in all, if you can't tell by now, we think management is doing a good job in a tough environment. The generics are becoming an ever growing threat to the industry at large. Until now, companies were able to squeeze out a few more years of patent protection. Lately this hasn't been happening and Biaxin margins could contract substantially.  As seen in the table above, though the reliance on pharmaceuticals has decreased to 57% for revenue, the segment still brings in about 75% of profits. In our opinion, ABT is headed towards reducing its reliance on this segment for profits as well. Not to say that there is a growth problem in pharmaceuticals, but rather a clever diversification plan to ensure a smoother revenue and earnings picture for the future. Diagnostics (in-vitro) is marked for reduction though in other areas, ABT seems keen on expanding.  The reasons for our below consensus earnings estimates and contrary to previous years, a less general bullish outlook for ABT over the next twelve months are somewhat complex.  First, we think that the KOS acquisition in 12/2006 increases revenues; however is still a drag on overall margin/earning ratios. Second, we think that investors will catch on fairly quickly that EPS comparisons for 2007 should be made with 2005 figures and not 2006. Third, we are not oblivious to the pipeline concerns. In Phase-II are; ABT-510 (cancer), ABT-874 (multiple sclerosis) and Vicodin (pain killer). Also in the works are the new and improved stents ZoMaxx and Xience. The most promising for now seems to be Xience. All it would take is for one out of four pipeline heavyweights to misfire and pipeline concerns would resurface. Investors look at this as a 25% chance of a problem developing, though this is statistical hogwash. Likewise, if all four were to go through Phase-III and be FDA approved by the end of 2008, then the stock should double. In reality, the statistical chances of both scenarios are about the same, yet investors worry about the former and discount the latter. Fourth, Zemplar may not live up to original pre-approval global sales projections. (From memory, was approved mid 2005.) In our opinion though, the expanded approval of Humira mitigates any Zemplar shortfall. Fifth, the failed attempt to sell the in-vitro diagnostics unit to General Electric (NYSE:GE) doesn't sit well with us. GE is known for smart acquisitions, but doesn't really have a name for buying bargains. GE usually offers full market price and bases their acquisition rationale on product enhancement, management and growth through synergy. We don't think that GE was looking for a bargain and if ABT and GE couldn't agree on terms, there may be some difficulty unloading the unit down the road. No sale means a further levy on margins and perhaps fewer buy-backs.  All in all, we peg ABT as a long term hold and rate 'accumulate' below the evaluation line. Substantial spikes after earnings releases using 2007 to 2006 comparisons may pose trading opportunities.    Disclosure: No conflicts (though we continue to have an above average regard for management)."

32912,20463,2007-04-20T02:28:31-04:00,,"This past Monday, Judge David H. Coar of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois granted Abbott's (NYSE:ABT) motion for a preliminary injunction to stop Sandoz [a Novartis Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:NVS) subsidiary] from selling a generic version of Biaxin XL (clarithromycin extended release tablets).  
Abbott earns about $300 million each year in the U.S. from sales of Biaxin XL, an antibiotic used primarily for the treatment of bacterial infections of the skin and upper respiratory system.
The preliminary injunction against Sandoz is a reversal of fortune for Abbott, considering that last December Judge Coar denied Abbott's motion for a temporary restraining order.  Now, in a 61-page opinion (pdf file), Judge Coar explained that ""after having the benefit of a full hearing, this Court is able to better decide the merits of enjoining Sandoz from further selling or marketing its extended release formulation of clarithromycin.""
Abbott alleged that Sandoz's generic version of Biaxin XL infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 6,010,718 and 6,551,616, which claim extended release formulations of clarithromycin.  Judge Coar found that Abbott demonstrated ""a substantial likelihood of proving Sandoz's product infringes upon claims 1 and 4 of the '718 patent.""  Moreover, he found that Sandoz's obviousness and inequitable conduct defenses lack substantial merit.
With regard to inequitable conduct, Judge Coar wrote that although Sandoz showed a substantial likelihood of proving materiality and intent to deceive with respect to the '616 patent, Abbott abandoned the '616 patent claim in question on its own volition and ""it seems wholly inequitable to hold a patent invalid for fraudulent conduct in the prosecution of a claim that was withdrawn before actual prosecution had even begun.""  Judge Coar further observed that ""[r]edemption is one of the core principles of the American ethos.""
Besides Sandoz, Abbott is fending off generic competition to Biaxin XL from Andrx, Ranbaxy, Roxane, and Teva (NYSE:TEVA).  In January, the Federal Circuit affirmed a preliminary injunction against Andrx.  Last August, Abbott and Teva settled their litigation, although on Tuesday Teva filed a complaint (pdf file) in the Southern District of New York to enforce the settlement."
24086,20463,2007-01-14T13:50:09-05:00,,"Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is currently fighting antitrust allegations relating to two of its best-selling drugs: Norvir, a protease inhibitor used in AIDS treatment, and Hytrin, a drug used to treat enlarged prostate and hypertension. Last week, the Wall Street Journal ran a cover story on the Norvir case entitled ""Inside Abbott's Tactics to Protect AIDS Drug."" According to the article, in December 2003 Abbott quintupled the price of Norvir in order to protect sales of Kaletra, its more profitable AIDS medication. Other options that Abbott considered but ultimately rejected included withdrawing Norvir from the market entirely and selling Norvir only in a liquid formulation, about which one Abbott executive said that it tastes ""like someone else's vomit.""    The article is based on previously undisclosed Abbott documents (available at www.wsj.com with a subscription). Abbott's price hike has sparked an investigation by the Illinois Attorney General's office, as well as federal antitrust lawsuits. At the same time, Abbott is fighting allegations of unlawful monopolization in connection with Hytrin. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, a health care provider, is the plaintiff in the case. According to Kaiser's appeal brief, filed with the 9th Circuit last November, ""Abbott extended its Hytrin monopoly by seeking objectively invalid new patents and gaming the regulatory system to delay generic competition for four additional years."" In addition, Kaiser alleged that Abbott paid Geneva Pharmaceuticals (now Sandoz) not to sell a generic version of Hytrin, ""thereby violating Section 1 of the Sherman Act."" Abbott successfully defended itself in the district court by invoking Noerr-Pennington immunity, which protects petitioning the government from antitrust liability.

Receive all our Barron's summaries by signing up here: A Troubling Lab Report by Jacqueline Doherty Summary: Shares of Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) closed Friday at $56.30. They're up 50% over the past 18 months, giving them a P/E multiple of 17.4x 2008e earnings -- well ahead Big Pharma's average of 15.1. Bulls are focused on the launch of a drug-coated cardiac stent, which they say will outdo similar products from competitors. Even so, if Abbott were to fetch an industry average 16.6x on its 2007e pharma profits, and a medical-device average 23x multiple on its stents and other assets -- shares are still only worth $51. There are also potential concerns over its #4-selling TriCor fat-reducing drug: A March study by Dr. Steven Nissen showed that 19 patients (38%) in a control group that took fenofibrate (its generic name) saw their creatinine levels rise above the upper limits of normal, which could reduce kidney function and increase cardiac events. Nissen, who previously raised concerns over Glaxo's (NYSE:GSK) Avandia Merck's (NYSE:MRK) painkiller Vioxx, says he will not prescribe the drug. The company says there's no indication adverse kidney events are being increased due to TriCor use. Considering the drug's 7% bottom-line contribution, shares could fall to $48 if they're wrong.

23724,20463,2007-01-09T02:33:46-05:00,,"Abbott Labs (NYSE:ABT) is fending off multiple generic challenges to Biaxin XL (clarithromycin extended-release tablets), an antibiotic with annual sales of over $300 million in the United States. Companies that have filed ANDAs for generic versions of Biaxin XL include Ranbaxy, Teva (NYSE:TEVA), Andrx, Roxane, and Sandoz. In Abbott's case against Teva, Abbott lost a motion for a preliminary injunction on grounds that its patents on Biaxin XL were likely invalid. Shortly after the Federal Circuit affirmed that decision, Abbott and Teva reached a settlement. In Abbott's case against Ranbaxy, the district court held that two of Abbott's patents were likely unenforceable. Now, in an unanimous opinion released last Friday, the Federal Circuit has affirmed a preliminary injunction that Abbott won against Andrx. On appeal, Andrx presented two main arguments: (1) based on the findings made in Abbott's cases against Teva and Ranbaxy, Abbott was collaterally estopped from asserting the patents in suit against Andrx; and (2) given the district court's construction of the claim term ""pharmaceutically acceptable polymer,"" Andrx's generic version of Biaxin XL does not infringe the claims under the doctrine of equivalents.    With regard to Andrx's first argument, the Federal Circuit found that in the Teva and Ranbaxy cases, ""the district court judge did not intend to 'firmly and finally resolve the issue' for which preclusion is asserted,"" as required by the Supreme Court's Blonder-Tongue decision. Furthermore, the court found that this case did not ""present the rare circumstance in which a determination made during a preliminary injunction is sufficiently final to be accorded preclusive effect."" Therefore, the court held that Abbott was not collaterally estopped from asserting the patents in suit against Andrx. In addressing Andrx's noninfringement argument, the Federal Circuit first reviewed the district court's construction of the claim term ""pharmaceutically acceptable polymer."" The court found that the district court construed this term too narrowly, in part because it read Markush group language from the specification into the claim. The term 'Markush group' does not have any meaning within the context of a written description of a patent and therefore, to the extent the district court relied on the Markush group language to limit its construction to the compounds listed in the written description, it erred. The court then proceeded to reject Andrx's noninfringement position, which was based on the ""specific exclusion principle"" and the ""doctrine of claim vitiation."" Accordingly, the court found that Andrx's generic Biaxin XL formulation could be shown to be equivalent to Abbott's claimed formulation. ABT 1-yr chart"

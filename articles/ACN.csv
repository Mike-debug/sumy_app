4376996,102404,2020-09-30T10:28:03-04:00,"Accenture reported solid fiscal 2020 results, but market participants were disappointed.Over the long run, Accenture is a resilient business due to its wide economic moat and great balance sheet.The stock still seems to be a little bit overvalued, although I might have used assumptions in my calculation, which are too cautious.","In December 2018, I published my first and only article about Accenture plc (ACN) as part of a series I called ""Preparing for the end of the cycle"". In this series, I covered several high-quality companies with a wide economic moat, which I considered still overvalued at that time. Last week, the company released its annual results for the full-year 2020 and it might be time for an update.(Source: Accenture Media)In the following article, I will start by looking at the business as well as the numbers Accenture reported last week. Following that, we will look at some of the company's strengths - mainly the balance sheet and wide economic moat. Finally, we look at the company's dividend, the growth potential and end with an intrinsic value calculation.Accenture missed analysts' expectations for revenue as well as earnings per share and obviously, investors were also not pleased with the guidance for 2021 and sent the stock about 7% down last Thursday. At the time of writing, Accenture is trading about 13% below its former all-time high.And while the full-year results were not great, they were not bad either. While revenue could increase only 2.6% for the full year, net income could increase 6.9% and diluted earnings per share could increase 7.2%. We have to keep in mind that we are in the middle of one of the worst pandemics in history and in a pretty severe recession. And considering the horrible second quarter (from April till June 2020) and the numbers many other companies had to report, a revenue decline of 2% for Accenture in the last quarter and 13.9% increase in net income are pretty solid.The biggest part of revenue (almost half) is generated in North America and Accenture could grow its sales still by 5% in the past year. While Europe stagnated, the ""growing markets"" could report 8% growth.(Source: Accenture Infographic)Accenture is reporting its revenue in five different industry groups ranging from ""Products"", which is responsible for almost 28% of revenue to ""Resources"", which is responsible for 15% of revenue. The highest growth rates came from ""Health & Public Services"", which grew 13% in the past year. Aside from industry groups, Accenture is also differentiating between two different ""types of work"". On the one side, we have consulting services, which cover areas like strategy and fields like blockchain, technology, and digital transformation and generated $24.2 billion in revenue. On the other side, we have outsourcing services, which include services as accounting, procurement services, and application services and generated $20.1 billion in revenue.(Source: Accenture Infographic)Accenture is also reporting part of its revenue as ""The New"". This is including services like digital, cloud, and security and is now responsible for approximately 70% of revenue. For fiscal 2021, Accenture will no longer report this as ""The New"" as digital is now embedded everywhere - according to the company's new growth model.Accenture is also growing by acquisitions. The acquisition strategy of Accenture not only seems to work very well in the past few years, but I also consider it a great strategy for the years to come. Accenture almost never makes huge acquisitions (as some other companies) but is mostly acquiring small businesses, for which it has to pay relatively small amounts. Even if Accenture should make mistakes in its acquisition strategy and acquire the ""wrong"" business or ""overpay"" for a business, it doesn't create huge problems. In August 2020, Accenture also announced it will cut about 25,000 jobs worldwide. The reason might be the pandemic, but it also seems quite natural that after dozens of acquisitions, the company will restructure in several ways and as part of this process, some jobs are not necessary any more.When a company is acquiring other businesses on a regular basis, there are different ways to finance the acquisitions. For example, by increasing the number of outstanding shares (Accenture is actually buying back shares on a regular basis - we get to that later) or by taking on debt. The company is using neither of those options and has only $54 million in long-term debt and about $8 billion in short-term debt on its balance sheet (and compared to $17.5 billion in shareholder's equity these amounts are neglectable). In the recent past, Accenture usually paid for the acquisitions in cash and with about $8.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, the company can continue to grow by acquisitions. This amount is also providing enough liquidity for Accenture to whether storms that might come in the next few quarters. The biggest problem regarding the balance sheet might be $7.7 billion in goodwill, but this is also no reason to be worried.Aside from the strong balance sheet, which gives Accenture enough margin for maneuver to make further acquisitions in the years to come, the company is also protected by a wide economic moat. This moat is based on several aspects. A first important aspect and source of wide economic moat would be the intangible assets for Accenture. This includes the intellectual property portfolio the company has established over the years and which now includes more than 7,400 patents and pending patent applications in areas like artificial intelligence, blockchain, cybersecurity, extended reality, and the Internet of Things. But aside from the patents, the brand name (reputation might even be a better term) seems to be the most valuable intangible asset the company has. When considering the differentiation between outsourcing and consulting business, the brand name is especially important for the consulting business as it can be very helpful to attract new customers. The brand name is especially important when many competitors enter an industry and try to attack and gain market shares by offering cheaper prices.The fact, that Accenture is currently working or has been working with so many big, respected international companies is leading to a reputation that will attract new customers. If respected international corporations hire Accenture to consult them, other companies will tend to hire Accenture themselves. By working with so many leading corporations all over the world, Accenture has also gained a huge knowledge base and information about new trends as well as typical problems companies all around the world might have.Aside from the intangible assets (patents and brand name), the high switching costs are also adding to the wide economic moat around the business. While the brand name is important for attracting new customers, the outsourcing business relies on switching costs, which will keep the customers from leaving. 99 of the company's top 100 clients have been with the firm for more than five years and 95 have been with the firm for more than 10 years. Accenture also ended FY 2020 with 216 Diamond clients, which is the company's category for the largest clients. This number has increased steadily in the past - in fiscal 2020, Accenture added 15 new Diamond clients and in 2014, the number of Diamond clients was only 140. On the one side, we might see personal relationship costs as the customers are forming a bond of trust with Accenture and especially if the customers are dealing with the same employees from Accenture again and again this relationship can be very strong. But the switching costs are rather resulting from learning costs, which are high as it takes quite some time for Accenture and its employees to understand the business and get the necessary knowledge in order to provide valuable consulting services. And especially after relationships have lasted for several years, Accenture has gained a lot of knowledge about the customers and often has a good understanding of the business. When switching to another consulting firm, this (steep) learning curve has to be duplicated, which is leading to high costs for the customer.The switching costs are especially high when the consulting services are embedded in a complex structure and the consulting service is interconnected with many processes in the company and important for many different departments and business units of the company. It is also increasing the switching costs if the consulting service is mission-critical for the company as the market environment often doesn't allow to take a lot of time for instructing a new consulting firm.(Source: Author's own work based on numbers from Morningstar)The wide economic moat is also visible in different numbers. In the chart above, we see the gross margin and operating margin, which were very stable during the past decade. This is indicating pricing power for the business and resilience against price pressures and low-price competitors. Accenture also has an extremely impressive return on invested capital, which was as high as 71.5% during the last decade (the lowest reported number was 38.1%). The average RoIC was 55% during the past decade and these numbers clearly show a wide economic moat.We mentioned above that Accenture is growing by acquisitions and probably will continue to grow by acquisitions in the years to come. Additionally, Accenture is protected by a wide economic moat, which gives the company pricing power. But it is also important that the overall market in which a company is operating can grow in the years to come.When looking at consulting services, the overall market is expected to grow with a CAGR of 3.8% in the years until 2025. Other studies are expecting growth rates between 4% and 5% - similar to the growth rates in the recent past. And not only consulting services will continue to grow, but outsourcing services are also expected to grow. When looking at IT outsourcing services - the main market of Accenture - we can expect a CAGR of 2.6% for this market segment in the next few years. Accenture is also present in the digital transformation market, which is expected to grow with a very high CAGR of 22.7% in the years until 2025. Digital transformation is the process of using digital technologies to change processes, models, businesses, and organizational activities to further improve the performance of businesses and this is certainly one of the core areas of Accenture's services.For Accenture, it will continue to pay off that the company has been focusing on digital services, cloud services, and security services. In 2020, these segments generated $30 billion in revenue (representing 70% of total revenue). Especially, with the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies need to accelerate their digital transformation and move to the cloud - and Accenture will profit from these trends in the years to come. The strong bookings in the fourth quarter (which were $14 billion and the second highest number on record reflecting 9% growth) are also a strong sign, that Accenture is profiting from this trend.I don't think many people are investing in Accenture for the dividend, but Accenture is paying a dividend nevertheless. Accenture started paying a dividend in 2005 and after starting with an annual dividend, then switching to a semi-annual dividend Accenture is now paying a quarterly dividend. After the most recent dividend raise, Accenture increased its dividend from $0.80 to $0.88 every quarter. This is resulting in a dividend yield of 1.5% and a payout ratio of 40% (when taking the fiscal 2020 earnings per share).Data by YChartsAside from paying out part of its generated free cash as dividend, Accenture is also buying back shares. Very recently, the company approved $5 billion in additional share repurchase authority and with the remaining ~$1.3 billion in share repurchase program, this brings the total amount to $6.3 billion and Accenture will continue to buy back shares. Since the early 2000s, Accenture decreased the number of outstanding shares by 36%.I already mentioned above, that investors seemed to be disappointed by the results and the company's guidance. But the guidance seems to be solid, considering we are in the middle of a severe recession. For the full year of 2021, management expects revenue to grow between 2% and 5% in local currency and GAAP diluted earnings per share to be in a range between $7.80 and $8.10.For our intrinsic value calculation, we are rather pessimistic (or: cautious) and assume, that Accenture won't be able to grow next year. For the years to come we are still conservative and assume 4% revenue growth in the years to come (combination of organic growth and acquisitions). Additionally, we can assume that Accenture might improve margins by cutting costs and by profiting from scale effects. We assume this will add another 1% to bottom line growth. And finally, Accenture will continue its share buyback program, which will add 1-2% growth to the bottom line. Overall, we can assume Accenture to grow between 6% and 7% in the years to come.As basis for our calculation and free cash flow in 2021, we assume the same free cash flow as in 2019 ($6,028 million). In 2020, the free cash flow was a record of $7.6 billion, but I am once again rather cautious. When using these numbers and 5% growth for perpetuity, we get an intrinsic value of $199.54 for Accenture making the stock a little overvalued at this point.I am always calculating rather cautious and try to make assumptions, that are realistic and consider also that things might go wrong or that we will face difficult times (recessions, pandemics, etc.). But when looking at the long-term performance since 2000, revenue could increase with a CAGR of 7.2% and net income increased even with a CAGR of 14.22% making our assumptions probably too pessimistic. Although growth slowed down a little bit in the past decade, revenue still grew 6.43% annually on average and net income increased 11.64% every year on average.Although the overall market in which Accenture is operating is highly fragmented, marked by competition and expected to grow ""only"" in the low-to-mid single digits, Accenture is a great business. Protected by the wide economic moat, Accenture will outperform the overall market and grow organically as well as by acquisitions. And Accenture is especially dominant in market segments where we can expect higher growth rates - digitalization, cloud or security. But Accenture still seems to be overvalued at this point - although I have to admit, that my assumptions for the years to come are rather cautious."
4351158,105400,2020-05-31T21:12:38-04:00,"Accenture has been investing heavily in its industry expertise, which has kept its relationships with core customers strong.The company faces a risk of declining demand during this period but has sufficient liquidity.Accenture appears to have limited upside compared to its peers based on consensus estimates.","Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) has steady revenue growth and operating margins going into the year due to its strong capabilities and deep relationships with its customers. Potential investors would have to pay forward 16.1x EV/EBITDA for a company with not much upside compared to its peers in terms of consensus financial performance. Despite some risks navigating through the current uncertainty, Accenture generated $5.4B of free cash flow last year to cushion the company against potential shocks.Accenture provides consulting and outsourcing services for companies. Its consulting projects, which make up 56% of revenues, cover areas like strategy and broad fields including blockchain, technology and digital transformation. The remaining revenue consists of outsourcing, which includes services such as accounting, procurement services, and application services. Accenture has been able to use its expertise to address a wide array of enterprise issues. Clients rely on Accenture to navigate an increasingly complex and disruptive environment. As such, Accenture's customers consist of more than 75% of Fortune Global 500 and 91 of the top 100. With this value proposition, Accenture's revenue has grown from $21.5B in 2010 to $44.6B in 2019 at an annual rate of 7.5%.Accenture also has partnerships with leading cloud platforms, which enable the company to help other companies looking to shift their business to the cloud:(Source: Annual Report)Many companies are still in the early stages of embarking on their digital transformation journey. The digital transformation market is also expected to grow at roughly 22% to reach $3.2T by 2025. At its current revenues of $44.6B, Accenture's penetration is still low and this creates a long runway for Accenture to grow.The company has been investing heavily in innovation over the years. Accenture's customers rely on the company to come up with fresh ideas for their business and strong execution. Accenture has to be the leader in innovation to continue to provide value for its clients. With more than $800M invested in R&D, Accenture now has over 7,400 patents in its global portfolio. The company also invested $1.2B across 33 acquisitions to acquire critical skills and capabilities in strategic, high-growth areas of the market.All these investments have strengthened Accenture's reputation as a reliable provider of industry expertise and experience. Out of 100 of Accenture's largest clients, 95 have been with the company for 10 years or more. This is due to the customised solutions provided by Accenture. For example, Accenture's partnerships with key cloud providers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and salesforce (NYSE:CRM) allows the company to build capabilities on top of the platforms to customize its solution for customers. This makes it difficult for companies to switch consultants once they integrate their operations into Accenture's solution due to the high level of customization.If Accenture's services do not add value to customers and switching is easy, we should see a gradual decline in operating margin due to price competition. However, Accenture's margins have remained relatively steady between 13% and 15% in the past 10 years.We expect that Accenture will grow its revenues by roughly 7% in the next 5 years. This is driven by its intelligent platform services that will cater to customers looking to embark on their digital transformation journey. Accenture's continued innovation should also allow the company to retain most of its largest customers.Accenture's strong industry relationships should allow the company to retain its pricing power. The company should also be able to derive some efficiencies from continued investments in areas like automation. Hence, we expect some expansion in Accenture's operating margins to roughly 15% over the next 5 years.Accenture's business depends on retaining demand for the company's services and solutions. With the current uncertainty surrounding the economy, some companies might reduce spending on Accenture's services to conserve cash flow. This could have some short-term impact on Accenture's results going forward.Accenture's success is also highly dependent on its ability to innovate rapidly and provide capabilities to its customers. This includes retaining talented employees with the knowledge and skills to provide value for its customers. Any slowdown in innovation and inability to retain its talented workforce could result in a decline in Accenture's capabilities.In order to navigate the uncertain landscape and continue to invest in its capabilities, Accenture should have a strong financial position in place. That appears to be the case as Accenture has $5.4B of cash and $20M of debt. The company also generated $5.4B of free cash flow last fiscal year. Accenture's strong cash flow generation ability puts the company in a strong position to manage its risks.(Source: 10Q)Based on relative valuation, Accenture appears to be overvalued based on consensus EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA and multiples. The company's consensus EV/Revenue of 2.9x is higher than the median figure of 2.6x. Accenture's EV/EBITDA of 16.1x is also higher than the median of 15.9x. Its P/E ratio of 26.5x is also higher than the median of 21.3x.However, Accenture has slightly worse consensus estimates than its peers. Its consensus EBITDA margin of 17.7% is worse than the median of 24%. The bright spot is that its consensus revenue growth of 2.7% is higher than the average of 2%. Hence, potential investors in Accenture do not appear to have a large margin of safety by investing in the company now.(Source: Atom Finance)Accenture has to ensure that it continues to invest heavily in improving its capabilities and maintaining its strong relationships with its top customers. This will help the company maintain steady revenue growth and operating margins in the future. Accenture also requires strong management execution to navigate through a more uncertain landscape and retain its talented workforce despite a potential drop in cash flow."
4350841,105055,2020-05-29T12:13:39-04:00,"Accenture is nearing 52-week highs, but there's still a little room to run until fair value.IT Spending is forecast to be on the rise in 2021, and COVID-19 will only accelerate that as digital transformations speed up.It's boring, but it's consistent. That's why I'm buying Accenture for my personal portfolio.","While big-name technology companies are already pushing to new 52-week highs, one name still has some space ahead of it. Accenture (ACN), the world's top consultancy firm, stands to benefit from an increase in technology spending, the corporate migration to the cloud, and the soaring remote work landscape.Image: Accenture LogoI want to dig into this 'A+' rated Hideaway stock to see if new 52-week highs are in its future.Accenture is a technology consulting firm with five distinct sectors, each serving companies that operate in those segments: Communications, Media & Technology, Financial Services, Health & Public Service, Products, and Resources.Across all segments, Accenture consults firms on moves to the cloud, outsourcing, and working with other large-scale providers, like Salesforce (CRM). In an ever-changing technological world, Accenture's services are generally always required; else, a firm would have to hire specialized staff.Image: Accenture 2019 revenue breakdown by geographyMore than three-quarters of the Fortune 500 can be called Accenture clients. Having this many clients across almost every quantifiable industry allows Accenture to see where the tech marketplace is going, thus allowing Accenture to help all customers get there.Today, 56% of Accenture's revenues are from consulting services, while the remaining 44% comes from outsourcing. The company is geographically diverse, with 46% of last year's revenues coming from North America, and 34% coming from Europe.Accenture has a history of consistent growth. The company attains this growth by being the largest and most trusted consulting firm in the market. Over time, it has built this position by hiring talented consultants and acquiring firms with specializations in the direction the market is heading.Image: Accenture's Annual RevenuesOver the last five years, Accenture's revenues grew 39.2% to $43.215B in 2019. This is a CAGR of 7.57% over that period. It's not phenomenal, but it's admirable from a $100B+ services firm that relies heavily on employees (i.e., not a SaaS).Image: Accenture's Annual Net IncomeNet margins have been quite stable over the same period allowing Accenture to grow net income from $3.05B in 2015 to $4.78B in 2019. That's 57% growth, or 10.2% CAGR. Over the trailing twelve months, net income is up further, and closing in on the $5B mark.Despite the pandemic and ensuing macro conditions, analysts do still have a positive outlook on the company for this year. Top-line growth is seen to grow conservatively, at 5%, while the bottom line will grow by roughly the same amount.Going forward into 2021 and beyond, I think the outlook becomes even more bullish than the 6.8% top-line growth we have seen over the last five years thanks, in part, to an increase in IT spending.Image: Gartner's expected IT Spending for 20/21 (Pre-COVID-19)Let's assume, just for a minute, that COVID-19 did not reveal its ugly head. When we were still in that pre-COVID-19 world, Gartner's research indicated that 2020 IT spending would grow 3.7% to $3.87T. The firm also expected that 2021 growth would accelerate a little further (by 3.8%) to $4.02T.Image: Gartner's expected IT Spending for '20Of course, we don't live in that world, which is why Gartner recently wrote about a potential 8% slowdown in spending for this calendar year. Even if that is the case, I don't think this is a negative for Accenture. It's quite the opposite.Accenture helps the brightest and best companies with their IT needs. If those companies are still spending, Accenture and its employees are still the ones helping. If we do see a slowdown this year, you can bet we will grow back faster next year. Tech isn't going away, the cloud is here to stay, and Accenture has the expertise to lead the way.Another potential tailwind is outsourcing. Accenture leads the way in IT outsourcing, and what the pandemic has shown many is that companies should not keep all their eggs in one basket (or in this case city). Again, Gartner's research shows that outsourcing will continue to grow, and those outsourcing budgets will get larger.One of the reasons that Accenture has been able to sit atop the tech consulting landscape is its acquisition strategy. In 2019 alone, Accenture acquired 33 businesses. The goal with the acquisitions, primarily, is to gain expertise in a segment that the overall company sees as necessary to future growth.Image: Symantec logoAccenture's most recent deal (of significant scale) was for Broadcom's (AVGO) Symantec Cyber Security Services business. This deal enhances Accenture's security offerings at a time when we're rapidly changing the workplace (office to remote).Many recent deals Accenture has completed have chosen to focus on security, a market that is expected to see significant growth going forward. According to Allied Market Research, the cybersecurity market will grow at 11.9% CAGR to reach $258.99B by 2025.I'm a little bit more bullish on that number. I think that as we continue to transition from large offices to home offices, more work will need to be done to ensure businesses are secure. Potential investors should see Accenture's deeper moves into cybersecurity as a big positive.However, it should be noted that acquiring a large number of companies over a short period can also pose significant risks. Frequent acquisitions are a distraction, and if improperly integrated, those distractions could grow.Consulting is labor-intensive, and consultants command high salaries. With tech firms (like Twitter (TWTR) and Shopify (SHOP)) recently announcing new remote policies, Accenture may find it has to pay more for top talent that could now work from home.To be able to retain top talent, Accenture may have to pay consultants more or modify a consultant's day-to-day work-life. Both of those options would, no doubt, be a hit to margins.Consulting also carries a low barrier to entry. A one-person shop could, if positioned correctly, come in and do the work of Accenture consultants for a fraction of the price. Unlikely, yes, especially when it comes to Fortune 500 firms. It's not quite as unlikely for other big consulting names to swoop up contracts, however. Names like Hitachi Consulting, Pariveda Solutions, or even Deloitte could compete with Accenture on a purely consulting level.Accenture keeps that competition at bay through the acquisitions mentioned above. In tech consulting, firms have to move forward and fast. Accenture has been moving forward at a faster pace than the rest of the industry. This faster pace has rewarded investors with many years of compounding growth.The risks above would present a significant challenge to Accenture. However, I think this company has demonstrated its adaptability and agility in moving forward with technology. I believe the firm will continue to buck the trend while leading enterprise tech forward.At the time of writing, Accenture is trading for roughly 8% off its all-time high. The company has gained some 40% since its March lows. As investors, our job is not to dwell on what could have been (getting in at the March lows) but assessing if there's still an opportunity to invest today. With Accenture, I believe there is, but I think that gap is getting quite narrow at current prices.Accenture is an incredibly stable firm that pays a growing dividend (9 years of growth). This is a buy-and-forget type of purchase thanks to that stability and the expected continuing growth of the tech industry. For those reasons, my DCF assumes a discount rate of 8.5%, and I have assumed that Accenture can also grow its earnings at that rate (8.5%) over the next five years.An 8.5% growth in earnings over the next five years will be a bit of a dropdown from the last five years, where the firm grew at 9.45% CAGR. After five years, my assumption is 4% growth in perpetuity. This gives us a fair value of $206.90, a price that I am willing to continue adding to my Accenture position below.Accenture has an 'A+' rating when it comes to Quality. It was one of the factors that first got me looking at this firm.'A+' rated Quality firms have led the market's recoveries from market lows. Over the last two weeks, while the S&P 500 has returned 7.6%, 'A+' rated companies have returned 12.1%.Here's the complete score rundown:Accenture also performs well on other quantitative measures that are available with a High-Quality Hideaway membership:High-Quality Hideaway is my new Seeking Alpha marketplace launching June 1st.

I expect we will continue to see the dividend growing and earnings compounding into the future on the back of significant growth in the wider technology space."
4346178,102101,2020-05-11T14:36:38-04:00,Accenture has been positioning to strengthen its cybersecurity capabilities given that its service-based business model means it doesn't create products that expose it to customer-generated content.The sum of its acquisitions will give Accenture the data analytics capabilities of a cybersecurity company.The recent acquisition of Symantec's security data is a great move and it solidifies Accenture's positioning in the cybersecurity space facing a talent shortage.Accenture remains one of the best ways to bet on the future of cybersecurity.,"Source: TDBNAccenture's (ACN) strategic acquisitions in cybersecurity will help drive the strong momentum of its cloud and cybersecurity bets. Accenture's cloud revenue is becoming a big growth driver for the global consulting firm. As it rolls up these capabilities, Accenture's growth factor will be boosted by its improved strengths in growing segments of the cybersecurity space. This makes Accenture an attractive way to bet on the growing cloud security and digital transformation trend.Consulting requires a lot of human input. Most consulting gigs are initiated on trust and sealed on a strong conviction between a consulting firm and its clients. For years, consultants have had an edge due to the uniqueness of their data (manual demand-side data aggregation). This was the era before enterprises got better at collecting, storing, migrating, and analyzing data at scale. True to most enterprises, the cost of data storage was expensive to justify, and cutting-edge networking standards like 4G, which accelerated the speed of global IoT connectivity, hadn't been born. This allowed a lot of human-intelligence-driven consulting firms to fly under the radar without being noticed.The past ten years have ushered in rapid growth in technological innovation. Moore's law continued its yearly gift-giving rite as the speed of computing improved drastically. The 4G networking standard made cloud computing a global reality as data loss (mitigated via backup and recovery solutions), and network service denial were no longer an issue due to the rapid improvements in telecommunication facilities. Also, the cost of storage and cloud solutions crashed and converged. Lastly, machine learning and AI capabilities evolved and solidified at scale. These changes all happened rapidly and sporadically that the biggest beneficiaries were big tech companies who had enough cash to acquire capabilities where needed.The rise of IBM (IBM), GCP, AWS, Azure, and other big data platforms equipped enterprises with the confidence to take data storage and acquisition seriously. However, consulting firms didn't feel the needle pricking them to wake up until the rise of four big firms. They are Alphabet (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Salesforce (CRM), and IBM (2.0). These companies all had the size, brand, and reach to acquire enough big data, cloud, and AI capabilities to compete with consulting firms in services that pay hefty fees for access to unique consulting data and insights.In marketing and advertising, Google and Facebook have more data than traditional consulting and services firms. They deploy data to develop recommendation systems for users to connect better with their friends and family. They also help brands connect with their audience. This nullified the need for human intelligence or consulting gigs across a lot of marketing and ad campaigns. Their ad engines are built to optimize for thousands of data points and signals that it's best to leave them to learn without any human input.In sales, Salesforce, Zendesk (ZEN), Twilio (TWLO), and other ML-driven marketing and sales solutions made it next to impossible to deploy humans to generate sales and marketing insights as fast as their recommendation, classification, and decision science models can process.In ride-sharing, flight booking, and hotel booking, the likes of Uber (UBER), Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG), and Airbnb have leveraged data to automate the process of matching users with the services that will generate the utmost satisfaction.In e-commerce, Amazon (AMZN) and Instagram have thrived on the same big data and decision science trend. Other sectors like healthcare, manufacturing, utilities are witnessing a similar trend.Technical areas like security look to be cut out of the picture; however, they are not. Security threats are created by humans, and it can be argued that they are best prevented by humans. However, consulting firms are facing a similar battle with cybersecurity consulting gigs. Cloud security platforms like Rapid7 (RPD), FireEye (FEYE), and CrowdStrike (CRWD) have emerged to automate and reduce the need for human intelligence in the cloud space. Unlike other industries, the security industry is still in the infancy of its cloud disruption phase. Most high growth plays have less than a billion in annual revenue, and big security firms are acquiring small startups to stay competitive. While this has informed the rationale behind Broadcom's (NASDAQ:AVGO) acquisition of Symantec's enterprise division, we realize that the security service industry, which mostly consists of system integrators and managed security service providers, will face intense competition from automated threat intelligence systems offered by cloud security companies. These companies are also setting up cybersecurity consulting teams. FireEye has Mandiant, and CrowdStrike recently introduced XElite.Acquiring capabilities in the areas of threat intelligence and monitoring is a game of necessity as MSSPs don't create products that parse data to build threat intelligence systems. This puts them one step behind network, endpoint, and cloud security companies whose platforms are made intelligent off the data generated by their clients at little to no cost. Just like Facebook, Twitter (TWTR), and other user-generated content companies have scaled immensely due to the zero cost of generating content, cloud security companies will benefit immensely from the new trend that is emerging in the security space. Unlike network security companies, they don't even need to make security boxes, which means they get to enjoy superior operating margins.Security service providers will have to continue to look into M&A to compete on data.The acquisition of the Symantec services business strengthens Accenture's capabilities in RPFs for security intelligence and management gigs. It also weakens the need for companies to hire internal cybersecurity experts with little to no years of security experience in a field with a shortage of security talents. The incentive to stick with seasoned and experienced players like Accenture to protect mission-critical infrastructure is strengthened.Just like no fast growth company is hoping to hire machine learning engineers to build an advertising platform to compete with Google or Facebook's SaaS offering due to talent shortage and the huge cost of competing with the data trove of these big tech companies, it becomes next to impossible to compete with big security firms with huge troves of data and threat intelligence after years of analyzing and reporting on the latest security threat vectors.This is about strengthening its positioning on the organic gap that has been created due to talent shortage and the huge cost of acquiring data. The network operating centers are a good fit for Accenture as it strengthens its capabilities in the cloud security space.Data by YChartsAccenture's strategy of growth by strategic acquisitions and share buyback is important to compete with other big data platforms. As a result, I find the current valuation attractive, given that it won't be looking to create internal products to drive organic growth. The acquisitions are about ensuring Accenture has access and insights into the latest technologies that product and platform owners have. Accenture can easily compete with these platform owners in the areas of actionable insights as the intelligence of experienced humans will always trounce algos in areas where speed and volume aren't expedient. Examples include the SIEM (security information and event management), and incident response segments of the cybersecurity space. Human intelligence is still required to configure alerts and optimize output to drive down false positives/negatives.I have a bullish rating on Accenture as its man/machine intelligence combo will continue to put it a step ahead where pure ML/AI algos churn out decisions that need some human inputs to be actionable. This will continue to drive its growth factor in the near term.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."

Click here to find out more »Accenture (NYSE:ACN) is an outstanding organization with great financials, well-diversified business model and growth opportunities. Although I strongly believe the company to become a long-term winner, I find the current valuation too high for my taste. First I'll support my argumentation as to why I consider Accenture a great long-term hold, after which I'll dive deeper into revealing why I think the company's current valuation is still relatively high.For those that don't know, Accenture is one of the world's largest and leading companies within IT services and consulting. Accenture derives most of its revenues from North America (46%), followed by Europe (34%) and Growth Markets (20%). Accenture operates through five segments, also known as operating groups:(Source: Data from company's 10-K filing)The table below highlights the development of the five segments over the last 15 fiscal years and their current positions. We can observe that the segments of Products and Health & Public Services have demonstrated the highest growth rates, whereas the latter industry sticks out with a notably lower operating margin. Furthermore, all segments currently possess nearly equal or better operating margin than their historical averages. I believe that the generation of income from these different sectors is crucial for Accenture's business model, as this provides more diversification and less dependency on certain industries.(Source: Data from Reuters Eikon, table made by author)Being active within the IT consulting industry, Accenture is expected to receive lots of tailwinds from the growing industries within it operates and the increased demand for digital solutions. Services related to digitalization, cloud, artificial intelligence and security will become the foremost growth drivers for the company. Accenture anticipates on these trends with their so-called rotation to the New, which guides companies with their digital transformation and represents 65% of revenues while continuing to show strong double-digit growth.Furthermore, the design and implementations of enterprise technologies have become more complex, which Accenture addresses with their double-digit growing Intelligent Platform Service. Hence, Accenture seems to well-positioned for future trends that can propel growth. I also believe that Accenture's current management, with an average of 27 years of experience at the company, will be able to successfully lead the company in the future.However, it should be noted that due to the recent Covid-19 pandemic, IT spending is expected to undergo serious cuts, which consequently hinders growth for Accenture. Specific industries, such as retail, automotive and aerospace, are taking significant hits which will obviously also impact Accenture's services. Nevertheless, the outlook remains firmly optimistic for the future of digitalization with strong expected growth in the aforementioned areas. Here is Accenture CEO Julie Sweet on the Q2 2020 results:Accenture operates in a highly competitive and fragmented market with a relatively low barrier to entry. Therefore, it becomes of utmost importance for the company to differentiate itself and offer superior services to its clients. I managed to identify the following advantages which I believe make the business a leader within its industry.Firstly, Accenture's Global Delivery Capability can be considered one of its key differentiators. This basically means that Accenture provides price-competitive services by benefiting from its global and local company structure. Through this, Accenture can deliver high-quality services with scalable innovations, cost-cutting advantages and specific industry expertise. Not only can Accenture deliver the consultancy expertise, but the company can also aid with the actual implementation through their outsourcing services.Secondly, Accenture enjoys a network of strong alliances, including large corporations with essential software systems, such as Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOGL), Salesforce (CRM), SAP (SAP), Oracle (ORCL) and AWS (AMZN). This helps Accenture with offering superior services to their clients and aid the growth of their Intelligent Platform Service.The third and last advantage is that of the brand. Over the years, the company has developed and strong brand and clientele, serving more than three-quarters of the Fortune Global 500, including 91 of the top 100. What is maybe even more impressive is of their 100 largest clients, 95 of them have been with Accenture for over 10 years. An important benefit of Accenture's strong brand is that it helps to attract talented human capital. Especially for consultancy firms like Accenture, human capital is probably the most important asset that drives growth and value. Additionally, unlike other consultancy firms, Accenture lives and breathes technology. This brand perception forms a crucial advantage for Accenture to gain clientele with IT demands when competing with other consultancy firms like the Big Four.I previously highlighted why I believe Accenture to be a well-diversified company with lots of opportunities. Now I'll go deeper into the financial performance and current valuation.From the figure below we can see the uptrend in revenues for Accenture over the last 15 fiscal years. Apart from the period around the global financial crisis, Accenture has managed to grow consistently over the years and is expected to continue to do so in the foreseeable future. Company guidance for fiscal 2020 has recently been adjusted due to macroeconomic concerns and of course the impact of Covid-19. The company expects revenues to grow between 3% and 6% (6%-8% previously) with an operating margin of 14.70%-14.80%.(Source: Data from Reuters Eikon, figure made by author)Besides the growth, Accenture has been able to maintain and improve its margins. This has consequently led to even more impressive growth in earnings. Apart from the years after the Global Financial Crisis, one can observe high-single to double-digit growth numbers in EPS.(Source: Data from Reuters Eikon, figure made by author)(Source: Data from Reuters Eikon, figure made by author)Nevertheless, Accenture's growth is expected to start cooling down, largely due to the Covid-19 pandemic. While this is not completely surprising for a company that has also grown significantly in size, it does bring up concern for the stock's future prospects and valuation. Even though Accenture's growth seems to be slowing down, the business fundamentals remain strong and the company is believed to accelerate growth again in the foreseeable future. Accenture currently has a strong balance sheet with negative net debt and high interest coverage (>150), as well as an Aa3 (AA-) credit rating. Therefore I highly doubt Accenture to run into serious financial/liquidity problems during economic downturns.(Source: Company's 10-K filing)Accenture's financial performance has not gone unnoticed by the market. The stock has grown tremendously over the last decade. The company's stock (Blue Line) has outperformed both close-peers, as well as the S&P 500 index (Orange Line).Data by YCharts(Source: YCharts)Due to strong financial performance, Accenture's stock has been trading at quite a premium compared to the market's average. The same applies if we compare Accenture to its relevant publicly listed peers. The table below gives a clearer picture of the premium Accenture is currently trading at, when looking at several valuation ratios based on trailing twelve months. While this at first may seem that Accenture is potentially overvalued, one has to take into account that Accenture has been performing stronger financially than many of its peers. This type of argumentation could be used as a justification for its price premium.(Source: Data from Reuters Eikon, table made by author)However, Accenture is also trading at a premium compared to historic ratios, while short-term growth outlook is lower than the company experienced in the past. Since the current economic environment and the company itself differ from what it was many years ago, I decided to make historic comparisons with average ratios from the last five and ten years. The results can be found in the table below. It stands out that current ratios basically exceed all historic ratios except for the 5-year average P/E. This can be explained by the rather high valuation of the stock at the end of 2017 and after Q1 2019, as well as the strong decline in stock price recently due to Covid-19. The stock was for example trading at a P/E of 28 only two months ago.(Source: Data from Reuters Eikon, table made by author)The still relatively high valuation becomes also transparent if we look at the graph comparing the P/E and EV/EBIT multiples to the past. In this figure, we can see that even though the multiples have dropped significantly from their highs, they still remain above their historical averages. With the uncertain times and higher likelihood of reduced earnings growth ahead, I would personally like to see these averages return towards their 10-year historic mean.Data by YCharts(Source: YCharts)Using the 10-year average P/E and forecasted EPS for FY 2020 and 2021 ($7.60 and $8.09, respectively), we can derive a fair value based on historic multiples. For FY 2020 this would give us a price of $154 and $164 for FY 2021. This would provide us with no upside to current prices if the P/E ratio would return to its 10-year mean. Using a 5-year average, prices would equal $176 and $187, also providing us with no or very little upside. I would argue that the growth in company earnings for the next two years will not equal to that of the past five. Therefore, I believe that the company for now should not be given similar multiples to that of the past five years during a very strong bull market.Compared to its peers and the company's historical averages, Accenture does not look particularly cheap as of right now. In order to obtain a more accurate fair value estimate, I constructed a DCF model for myself that uses average expectations of analysts for growth figures and margins. I also followed the company's guidance after Q2 2020 and their ambition to keep on expanding margins. Moreover, I used growth in revenues for the final years that align more with the historic averages I mentioned before.(Source: Data from Reuters Eikon, DCF and Assumptions made by author)The following assumptions have been used for further calculations: a beta of 1.04, risk-free rate of 0.73% (current 10-year treasury yield), expected market returns of 8%, a tax rate of 22.5%, WACC of 8.28% and a perpetuity growth rate of 2%. Both capex and depreciation figures have been forecasted with their 5-year averages compared to sales. The change in working capital has been conducted through the use of the DSO, DIO and DPO methods. As a result, I obtained a fair value estimate of $175 per share and $140 using a 20% margin of safety.(Source: Data from Reuters Eikon, DCF made by author)I have to note that this DCF obviously has used a lot of assumptions and does not represent a 100% accurate fair value estimate. Nevertheless, I have based my assumptions on both historic performances, forward guidance by the company and analyst coverage. As a consequence, I believe the fair value estimate gives a good indication of a fair price range in the current environment.Both Accenture and this thesis face numerous uncertainties that investors need to be aware of. Throughout the article I've already brought up the risk of macroeconomic developments. Especially in the current environment, I consider this to be the major risk the company faces right now. Major cuts in IT spending will strongly influence the company's results and we could see from the previous crisis in 2008 that this can lead to declines in both revenues and earnings.Accenture did state in their 2020 Q2 results that it gained a new all-time high in new bookings of 14.2 billion dollars. However, I believe it is important to note that consulting contracts (>50% of revenues) usually have less than 12 months duration and permit clients to terminate the contract with only 30 days notice. On the contrary, the majority of outsourcing contracts generally have longer notice periods and include early termination charges. Nonetheless, I would argue that Accenture deals with a serious risk of losing a significant part of their income if the economy turns further down south and clients pull out the plug on their projects.Other and more frequently mentioned risks for Accenture are M&A integration and their management of human capital. Accenture has made over 30 deals in both 2018 and 2019, as well as 13 deals so far in 2020 with many more on the horizon. Post-deal integration forms a considerable challenge in fully capturing the benefits of M&A activities. Furthermore, with a workforce that exceeds 500.000 people that is still growing, it is of utmost importance for Accenture to not only acquire the best talents in their highly competitive market, but also ensure internal employee satisfaction and personal growth opportunities.Accenture is a wonderful company with a well-diversified business model, strong historic growth and great financial stability. The company also operates under experienced management in an industry where demand for digitalization is expected to keep on consistently growing in the future. Although Accenture is not immune to the consequences of Covid-19, I believe its diversification in income will aid the company to soften the blow.Due to the aforementioned reasonings, I consider Accenture to be well-positioned to ride out an economic downturn and agree with CEO Sweet's statement that the company can emerge stronger than before. Nevertheless, I believe Accenture is currently still trading at a premium compared to both its peers and historic multiples. I also think this is partly due to the multiple expansion the stock has seen over the last three years. The DCF model confirms this line of thought by providing a fair value estimate that does not suggest significant upside at current prices. I therefore rate Accenture's stock, despite being an excellent business, as a hold for now and will personally consider adding to my position if the price drops to a $140-$150 price range."
4333585,79675,2020-03-23T08:55:02-04:00,"Accenture's stock is down big so far in 2020.However, the company recently reported solid Q2 2020 results that beat the top- and bottom-line estimates.I hold a position in Accenture, and I plan to add shares on any pullbacks. As such, I believe that investors should consider sticking with this winner.","Accenture's (ACN) stock has been pulled down by the COVID-19 related concerns, and rightfully so, as the impact on economic activity has already been significant. But, ACN shares are only slightly underperforming the broader market over the first 2+ months of 2020.Data by YChartsHowever, let's also remember that Accenture has outperformed the broader market over the last 1-, 3- and 5-year time periods. Simply put, this company is a winner. So yes, there are company-specific risk factors that need to be considered, especially given the broader market uncertainty, but I believe that Accenture's management team has this global IT consulting and outsourcing company well-positioned for the future. As such, I believe that investors should stick with this winner.The COVID-19 related concerns should not be taken lightly so, in my opinion, it makes sense that the market has been in a free fall since the global health scare reached the U.S. The IT industry, and more specifically the IT Services sector, has felt a tremendous amount of pain due to the concerns related to COVID-19.Source: FidelityThe sector has moved down in lockstep with the broader market and I believe that this poor performance will likely continue until sentiment (and actual economic activity) shows signs of improvement. To this point, Goldman Sachs expects major cutbacks in consumer activity almost across the board through at last April 2020.Source: Goldman SachsThis is not great news for the likes of Accenture, or most other companies for that matter. However, as I recently described, Accenture entered 2020 in a great position - both operationally and financially - the company is well-capitalized and has a balance sheet that will allow for it to weather this storm.Additionally, it is important to also note that U.S. economic activity is expected to pick back up after Q2 with a sharp 8% bounce-back in GDP predicted for Q3 2020.Source: JPMorganSo consider this, the current headwinds are predicted to eventually dissipate later in 2020. It's not a matter of if, but when. Therefore, I believe that investors with a long-term mindset should use this opportunity to add a unique company with great long-term business prospects to their portfolios.On March 20, 2020, Accenture reported Q2 2020 adjusted EPS of $1.91 (beat by $0.18) on revenue of $11.1B (beat by $40mm). These quarterly results also compare favorably to the year-ago quarter.Source: Q2 2020 Earnings SlidesOther highlights from the quarter:There was lot to like about Accenture's quarterly results but it should also be noted that management lowered their full-year 2020 guidance:The theme - down but not out. Accenture, as expected, will be negatively impacted by the macro turmoil. However, during the conference call, management went to great lengths describing how Accenture will be able to work through the current situation without materially impacting the long-term bullish thesis. Management mentioned these specific points/initiatives:Make no mistake about it, Accenture's management team will have to navigate this company through a very challenging environment. But, as described by management, they are prepared for the changing landscape. Moreover, I believe that Ms. Julie Sweet, CEO, is the right person for the job. And yes, it does help that she is leading a well-positioned company with promising long range business prospects in an industry that has tremendous growth prospects.Accenture's stock price is attractively valued at today's price.Data by YChartsAs shown, ACN shares are trading at the lower end of the range. Additionally, Accenture is trading well-below its fair value (per Morningstar).While ACN shares are definitely not cheap, but let's also remember that Accenture is a shareholder-friendly company (management continues to raise the dividend and buy back shares) that operates in high-growth industry. Therefore, I believe that Accenture will not only grow into its current valuation but also the growth potential is not yet fully baked into the stock.Accenture is highly levered to the digital space, so any major disruption to The New would significantly impact the company's business prospects. Additionally, reputation risk is an important consideration because Accenture is the go-to consultant in its industry. Specifically, ACN's shares are trading at a premium to its peers (and the market), so a negative shift in investor sentiment would materially impact the company's stock price.The major takeaway from Accenture's Q2 2020 results is the fact that it appears that management has this company well-positioned for the future, especially in the digital consulting space. The market conditions for Accenture will be tough (very tough) but I believe that the company will be able to weather the storm. As such, investors with a time horizon longer than two-to-three years should consider any significant pullbacks as buying opportunities.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

Overall, Accenture has showcased consistent top-line and bottom-line growth, outperforming its peers in growth and industry presenceQ2 2020 Earnings Call and COVID-19 ImpactThe explosive growth for cloud-based applications have created a growth space for the IT-services industry. With salesforce.com (CRM) leading the implementations, the industry is experiencing a greater need to deploy other Software-as-a-Service (SAAS) products (ie. Workday and ServiceNow). And as part of the process, system integrators such as Accenture helps in shifting data from legacy applications to newer products.Customers upgrading their older systems to the modernized IT-infrastructure have also created a greater demand for hybrid-cloud services, offered by IBM, Accenture, Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Cognizant and Capgemini. In addition, managed-cloud services have also been experiencing a larger demand as the IT-services companies help customers host their infrastructure on the public cloud, usually offered by Amazon.com, Microsoft and Google. Source: Image created by author with data from Bloomberg Intelligence, IDC CybersecurityAn increased growth in cybersecurity has been fueling strong revenues for the IT-services industry. A rise in global cyberattacks and changes in regulations are forcing companies to increase security spending. More dollar flows have been associated with advanced security utilizing analytics and IoT security (Source: Bloomberg Intelligence). Per Accenture’s business, cybersecurity within Accenture Consulting is now a $2 billion businessInternet of Things (IoT) and BlockchainAlthough Internet of Things (IoT), blockchain, AI and the integration of all three are still in the beginning stages, the blockchain platform with IoT will become the next big growth driver in the industry, along with cloud and security. IT service enterprises have been rapidly accelerating the investments related to IoT and blockchain, which has a potential economic impact of $3.9 trillion to $11.1 trillion by 2025 (Source: McKinsey & Company). According to Gartner, a global research and advisory firm for IT service leaders, 75% of organizations have integrated IoT with blockchain in 2017. Two years later, the number rose to 89%, which signals a continuous growth for a digital transformation and innovation. Customer RelationshipsAccenture possesses the most diversified business in the IT services industry. The firm also maintains around 70% of its head count in low-cost locations, which is the highest amongst the legacy IT services firms. In addition, Accenture’s customer relationships and industry expertise sets the company apart from its peers. The company’s strength in its “C-Suite relationships” is indicated through winning business on a sole-source basis. Current client list include 94 of the Fortune 100 companies and more than 80% of Fortune 500 companies. More than 200 “diamond” customers contribute about $100MM in annual revenue.Strong Pipeline for Bookings Growth Bookings strength has been driven by the demand for digital, cloud and security related services, which represents ~65% of the total. Bookings tend to start lower in the beginning of the year and build throughout the year. Nasdaq is expecting Accenture’s total bookings to grow at a CAGR of 4.7% (Consulting: 5%; Outsourcing: 4.4%) , surpassing $50 billion by 2022 and reaching $53.8 billion in 2023. Although Accenture competes against big names like IBM, McKinsey and Infosys, the company’s push into the “New” (digital, cloud, security) will be a growth advantage over companies tied to legacy IT outsourcing. Source: Image created by author with data from ACN 10k, NASDAQ, TreifsBusiness Model for Competitive EdgeAccenture’s culture is deeply embedded with reinventing and investing aggressively in emerging technologies to grow faster than its peers and the overall industry. The company will be investing about $2 billion in fiscal 2020, outpacing its competitors. This will also result in sustaining above-industry sales growth for the foreseeable future. For example, the entrepreneurial culture in expanding into low-cost regions in the early 2000s and transitioning early into cloud-related practices allowed the company to outpace its direct competitors. In addition, Accenture’s large operational network is another competitive advantage and allows the company to scale new practices. The company also spends about $700 million to train about 500,000 employees for high-value IT work –which is more than its peers. It is highly critical to maintain top skilled labor –especially in security, cloud and AI –so maintaining a large pool of trained employees will offer a competitive edge as well. Market Share GainIndia ties with China as second most disruptive tech market and is one of the largest IT services and outsourcing hubs in the world, as the country provides a breeding ground for IT consultancies. Several players have struggled to outperform Indian IT services firms since 1989. Indian Tier -1 giants include Infosys, Cognizant, Wipro and Tata Consultancy Services. However, Accenture has been expanding its market share within the industry (Source: Normura Financial Advisory & Securities). The market share of Tier-1 companies saw 0% growth while Accenture grew its market share by 0.6%. In addition, Accenture’s revenues experienced a growth rate of 13.5% throughout 2018 while other IT firms grew at a rate of about 8.5%. Analysts are attributing Tier-1’s slowing of growth to a lower digital exposure. Accenture has been active in developing its digital capabilities globally with about 65% of its sales generated from emerging technologies versus 30% of sales for other Tier-1 IT companies. Accenture’s attractive free cash flow profile offers a possible defensive opportunity. The company has a high-cash generating business model where it trades (FCF yield) at ~6% vs peers ~4% (Source: JP Morgan). ACN reported $1.9BN in FCF for 4Q19 and $6Bn in FCF for FY 19, and returned $4.6BN of cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, with about $1.9BN invested in 33 acquisitions. Accenture’s cash ability to invest will allow the company to focus on its acquisition strategy of using inorganic growth as an engine for organic growth. The company’s financial flexibility of no net debt, combined with buybacks and dividends, makes Accenture defensive in a deteriorating macro environment. In three of the past four major downturns IT spending in the United States fell twice as much as the GDP did and dipped increasingly in the fourth. However, other Info Tech subsectors such as hardware and semiconductor have been hit much harder than security software services (Source: McKinsey). In 2008, IT spending was projected to be -0.9%, a substantial decrease from pre-crisis forecast of 4.2% growth (Source: Forrester, Gartner, IDC).Source: Image created by author with data from Bureau of Economic Analysis, The Economist, IDC, McKinsey Analysis However, the economic recession has left room for IT spending priorities in software storage, business intelligence (analytics), virtualization, security and cloud computing. As it is uncertain when the next economic downturn will be, Accenture’s business model, again, in evolving along with the emerging technologies will be able to capture the continuing need and growth in the industry. In addition, despite the uncertainties in 2018 and 2019, IT budget increased significantly from 46% in 2017 to 55% in 2019 (Source: KPMG).AcquisitionsGiven the strong balance sheet, Accenture has great optionality to build and/or buy digital capabilities to drive future organic growth. The company typically allocates about 25% of its operating cash flow in acquiring smaller businesses to gain about 2-3% of inorganic annual revenue growth. In FY19, Accenture invested about $1.9BN in 33 acquisitions targeting high-growth segments. According to Accenture, the company analyzes three main areas for deals: where they need to scale, add new capabilities and/or add industry expertise. 20 out of the 33 were invested in new capabilities in digital and security; 4 out of the 33 consisted of deepening the expertise in the financial services industry. The company has already invested in at least 7 acquisitions in fiscal year 2020 and will continue to invest for future growth. With a strategic acquisition focus on the “New” (digital, cloud and security services), the inorganic growth will be a fuel for future organic growth and the excess capital will be provided as a return to the shareholders through dividends and repurchases.Source: FactSet Source: Image created by author with data from FactSet, FinvizAccenture plc’s debt is well covered by operating cash flow by 32,984.6%. The company’s debt is covered by short term assets, in which the assets are 774.9x debt. The company’s ROE of 34.30% is considered very high compared to the IT industry’s ROE of 16.9%. Source: Image created by author with data from FactSetAccenture is trading at a higher multiple against its peers and the IT services industry. We observed that relative valuation does not account for the fact that there was a plummet in price due to the COVID-19 fears despite the company beating estimates for 2Q earnings. As ACN has experienced a higher EPS growth YoY compared to its peers, we conclude that there are potential upsides to the stock price amid the market volatility. A Deteriorating IT Spending EnvironmentAlthough the drivers for the IT services industry will continue to be a catalyst, global macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions may affect the customers’ businesses and the levels of business activity. A deteriorating IT spending environment may reduce the demand for Accenture’s services and solutions.Lack of Strategic M&AAccenture plc typically acquires small companies to scale-up emerging technologies to boost its portfolio. If the company fails to invest in acquisitions, it may start losing its competitive advantage and lose out on growth opportunities. For instance, acquisitions in fiscal 2019 contributed approximately 2% to top-line gains, and 2.5% in 2018. Accenture’s strategy of acquiring next-generation enterprises and then scaling up (easier to complement with existing business offerings), has been a substantial driver of Accenture’s above-industry sales-growth rate (Source: Bloomberg Intelligence). Source: Image created by author with data from ACN 10k, Bloomberg IntelligenceThe Ability to Attract & Retain TalentAccenture’s business is largely dependent on the ability to supply market-leading skills with client demand and the ability to attract, retain and motivate talent. Failure to acquire and retrain hires to innovate and deliver new solutions in a rapid environment will adversely impact client demand. There is an intense competition for scarce talent who possess the knowledge and skills for emerging technologies, and Accenture’s competitors have directly targeted ACN’s employees with highly sought-after skills. In conclusion, I recommend a buy for Accenture plc. The shares are slightly undervalued due to the dip in the market with significant upside driver potential. The company's aggressive investments into emerging technology have resulted in market share gain, as the implementation of IoT, AI, blockchain and cloud have allowed ACN to capture opportunities. With today's uncertainty, Accenture is a good company because of its strong balance sheet (negative net debt) with massive cash flow that provides cushioning during economic downturns. During the Q2 2020 earnings, management stated that the firm still has about $500mm reserved specifically for potential acquisitions. Stats below show Accenture's strong position with its customers.

4327776,105409,2020-02-27T12:48:19-05:00,"Overall, investing in disruptive companies is risky: they have low visibility, have high earnings and stock volatility and are highly valued. But there is an exception: Accenture.Accenture has everything a conscious investor should look for: market leadership, consistent top- and bottomline growth, resilience to a recession and high cash flow generation.My DCF analysis shows that the company is undervalued by 46%. Moreover, my sensitivity analysis shows few downside risk.For investors who want be exposed to disruptive IT without taking high risks: buy Accenture on the Corona Virus dip.","This article is written at 02/21. All prices mentioned are from this date.I love disruptive IT companies because they will account for most of the future economic growth and I definitely encourage investors to include such stocks in their portfolio. However, most of these stocks include high risks based on their volatility, competition, valuation and low growth visibility. As we are currently undergoing the longest bull market ever and thus a recession could be around the corner, it is not advisable to invest in high risk stocks. In this article, I want to provide an alternative stock for risk averse investors to benefit from disruptive technologies. The stock is called Accenture (ACN), a multinational consultancy company which provides services in strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations. It has a huge client-base including 92 of Fortune's 100 companies and was named as world's most admired Information Technology Services company. In 2013, the company recognized the significant impact of disruption on companies and started to aggressively focus on the digital world. Now, their primary focus is capturing new growth opportunities for clients by rotating to the 'New' and to make them disrupt rather than getting disrupted. I will explain why this stock could be an amazing buying opportunity.I know, it is an amazing feeling to buy disruptors which eventually become multibaggers for your portfolio. However, investors need to be aware that buying such stocks in general increases your exposure to many risks. First, most of these companies have low growth visibility. Several times, high expectations are not met by these disruptors, which has drastical consequences for its stock price. Think about the 3D stocks such as 3D systems (DDD), who saw their valuation increase significantly as most investors expected them to disrupt many industries. Most of these investors will not be happy at all as 3D stocks lost more than 80% of their value. Another example is the cheered action camera producer Gopro (GPRO). Second, most of these disruptors have high earnings volatility and are significantly impacted by overall market corrections and recessions. The correction in December 2018 is a good example during which disruptors like Nvidia (NVDA), Stitch Fix (SFIX), Square (SQ) and Dropbox (DBX) lost an insane amount of value. Data by YChartsLast, most of these disruptors are valued to perfection, which make it very hard to determine a good entry point. Sometimes, investors buy these companies without caring about their valuation, which makes it extremely dangerous. Think about the head of disruptors Tesla (TSLA), which is now getting valued at 6x sales vs 0.26x for closest competitor Volkswagen (OTCPK:VLKAF). This high valuation makes the company very risky.Fortunately, today I present you a company which is active in the disruptive markets for the next decade such as SaaS, blockchain, internet of things and security, but much less subject to the above mentioned risks: Accenture. Accenture's competitive position and future growth prospectsAs previously mentioned, Accenture is a world-leading IT consultancy firm. Its extensive, long-lasting collaborations with leading companies such as Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN) and Mastercard (MA) improves Accenture's value-adding services. Moreover, it is one of the only consultancy companies with such a big focus on future disruptive technologies, improving its competitive position. This focus is paying off as Accenture is, among other things, ranked as n°1 service provider for the internet of things and named a Leader for Application and Digital Services. ""The New"", including digital- cloud- and security-related services, now accounts for more than 65% of revenues and experienced 25% revenue growth in 2018 (vs. 9% total growth). Astonishingly, this business has doubled its revenues in the past 3 years!(Source: Accenture's investor & analyst day 2018 presentation)Yes, there is some competition in the IT-consultancy industry from companies like cognizant (CTSH), Capgemini (OTCPK:CAPMF) and Tata Consultancy Services (OTCPK:TTNQY). However, their top and bottom-line growth is more limited and it looks like Accenture is better positioned to benefit from future IT developments. Moreover, Accenture's huge cash flow generation is a strong competitive factor as it leaves the company with plenty of cash each year to take over high-opportunity businesses.Accenture has been an industry leader for several years now and it looks to be very likely that they will be able to sustain this leadership.One of the things I like the most about Accenture is its very steady performance.Financial performanceAccenture has been able to double its revenues over the last 10 years, together with very solid free cash flow margins. More importantly their revenues sank by only 8% during the big financial crisis 10 years ago, while they were able to keep their cash flows steady. Since this crisis, revenues and cash flows have been rising sequentially and growth intensified as they started to focus on The New. I believe Accenture will deliver strong results during the next recession again, which is a very important factor for risk-averse investors.(Source: Robbe Delaet based on company disclosures; FCF margins in 2009-2012 are positively impacted by working capital changes, not operational superiority)Stock performanceAs you can see in the chart below, Accenture's strong financial performance during the crisis was reflected in a superior stock performance as well. The stock 'only' dropped by 35% vs more than 50% for the S&P500 and recovered very quickly. Moreover, investors enjoyed a total return of 543% over the last 10 years. I believe this could happen again in the future.Data by YChartsLet's talk about Accenture's valuation, which is another stumbling stone for many disruptive companies. Accenture is valued at a rather expensive P/E of 26 vs an average P/E of 23.7 for the S&P500. However, as Accenture generates very steady and reliable growth, generates very strong cash flows and is active in the growth markets of the future, this small premium is definitely justified. In fact, Accenture is valued at 22x FCF, as it generates higher cash flows than earnings, which is an important factor to bear in mind.I will perform a Discounted Cash Flow (""DCF"") valuation, which can be seen as one of the most reliable valuation methods. Moreover, I will perform a sensitivity analysis, taking into account possible future negatives such as a recession.WACC calculationFirst, we need to determine its Weighted Average Cost of Capital (""WACC""), which will be our discount factor for the DCF. The WACC is fairly low at 7.10% due to its beta of 1.02.Discounting cash flowsNow, I discount the cash flows to come to a ""fair value"". I start from the 2020 guidance of 7.50% revenue growth, 14.80% operating margins en some disimprovement in free cash flows due to working capital changes. For further years, the model includes a growth slowdown of 0.30% in the following 2 years (7.50% to 6.90%) and 0.60%/year in the following years. I find this very conservative given the fact that Accenture's revenue growth has actually increased over the past years due to its transition to ""the New"". Given economies of scale and past performance, the model also assumes operating margin improvements of 0.15% per year. Also, the long term growth rate is set at 2%, given its very strong competitive power and presence in a strongly growing market. This model shows that there is a very solid 46% upside for investors buying Accenture at $211.(Source: Robbe Delaet assumptions)Sensitivity analysisHowever, I believe it is important that investors always bear in mind possible negative/positive fluctuations for the company. It is important to understand the possible downside if things don't work out as your model predicted.Therefore, I always perform a sensitivity analysis, which includes assumptions for when a recession hits or the company doesn't deliver what you expected in the long term. If a recession hits in 2021, which I believe is probable, I expect its revenue growth to decline by 7% in 2021 and 7% in 2022 (0.5% growth in 2021 and -6.5% in 2022), similar to its performance during the last recession. In contrast, my bull case scenario includes an improvement in short term growth rates by 1.50%. Furthermore, I also included bear models with weaker long term growth rates and operating margin deleveraging. Astonishingly, the most negative model still gives investors 3% upside, which shows the low risk for Accenture buyers.(Source: Robbe Delaet assumptions)As explained above, buying Accenture could still yield very strong returns for investors. This is not only a consequence of strong growth rates, but also of possible multiple expansion. For me, there are several reasons why Accenture's multiple could grow to higher levels than its current P/E of 26 and P/FCF of 22. First, operating margins have increased sequentially in the past from 12.60% in 2010 to 14.60% last year. I believe that margins could keep expanding in the future given the fact that Accenture's services are increasingly adding value for customers due to their recent collaborations with Microsoft, Mastercard etc. Ceteris Paribus, businesses with higher margins deserve higher valuation multiples. (Source: Robbe Delaet based on company disclosures)Second, Accenture is getting more and more active in next decade's growth markets such as big data and internet of things. In general, the market loves to pay a premium for companies with such attractive profiles.Third, Accenture is proving that they are and will remain the dominant market leader in IT consulting. Due to its focus on new technologies, strong cash flow generation and many acquisitions, Accenture is coming closer and closer to become a monopolist/oligopolist. The market could possibly pay a higher premium if this gets acknowledged. Just look at Visa (V), Mastercard (MA), Intuit (INTU), Baxter (BAX) and other olipolists their multiple. This could ne a huge driver for Accenture as well.As thoroughly explained in this article, Accenture is a very strong cash flow generator with consistent revenue and margin growth. It is one of a few companies which is active in disruptive markets but has very low risks. Recently, I have been focussing on similar qualitative picks like Intuit, Ulta Beauty (ULTA) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ). I do this because I believe that this record bull market can't last much longer. However, timing the market can be a very poor strategy (ask investors who sold eveything in 2015 because of recession fears). Therefore, I want to provide readers interesting picks which should outperform significantly during a bear market, but could yield strong returns as well if the bull market extends its trajectory. Personally, I am looking to buy my first Accenture shares soon. However, I want to wait out the consequences of the Corona Virus. If this becomes a pandemic, it is possible that I will be able to pick up shares cheaper soon. Furthermore, it is possible that Accenture will need to lower its 2020 guidance soon due to these uncertainties, which would provide an interesting buying opportunity.In the coming period, I will write more on high-quality picks for my readers, which is especially important during these tough times.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."
4334818,105306,2020-03-29T13:40:35-04:00,Accenture lowered its guidance for 2020 in light of ongoing virus pandemic.This new environment should speed up customers' projects in the virtualization and digital transformation areas with participation of Accenture.Accenture is a quality stock and remains an interesting pick in the IT services industry and the broader technology sector.,"Accenture (NYSE:ACN) reported earnings and revenue above estimations but lowered the guidance for 2020, taking into consideration the impact of coronavirus pandemic. This review in the guidance was largely expected and just reinforces the devastating potential effect of ongoing virus pandemic in the coming months and also the uncertainties regarding the developments that lie ahead.On the bright side, I see that Accenture can benefit from the necessary changes in business operation toward a virtualized work environment. On top of that, based on Accenture’s solid financial figures, I remain confident to have this company as one of my core holdings in the technology sector.Accenture's revenue was $11.14 billion in the quarter, 0.4% above estimates and up 6.6% over a year ago in U.S dollars. This growth was led by high single-digit growth in strategy and consulting services and double-digit growth in operations, as well as broad-based strength across operating segments, especially Health & Public Service and Products, both with roughly 10% growth. North America and Growth Markets grew near 10% during the period, offsetting mute performance in Europe, primarily driven by a decline in the UK.Gross margin came in 30.2% in the quarter, compared to 29.2% over a year ago, and SG&A expenses was slight above last year. As a result, operating margin was up 10 bps at 13.4% and EPS were $1.91, 10% above expectations and also up 10% over a year ago.Looking ahead, new bookings still illustrate a positive picture, with record $14.2 billion in the quarter and book-to-bill of 1.3. Furthermore, Accenture continues to add new capabilities through new acquisitions, such as Mudano, a strategic data consultancy to U.K. financial services firms, Symantec's Cyber Security Services business and VanBerlo, a product design and innovation agency. Plus, besides nearly $600 million spent over the last 6 months, Accenture intends to invest up to $1.6 billion in further transactions still in this fiscal year.Accenture has demonstrated business strength, with solid top line growth in recent years. While new bookings suggest this momentum could persist, we all know that recent coronavirus outbreak poses a huge challenge for the whole economy, hence affecting the company as well.While temporary lockdowns can cause a deep impact in the economic activity and corporations normal operations, Accenture is also expected to be able to mitigate it to some extent as a significant portion of Accenture’s staffs are already experienced in working virtually, as the company has deployed at scale remote collaboration technologies. Besides, this new environment should also speed up customers' projects in the virtualization and digital transformation areas with participation of Accenture.Based on this new scenario, Accenture's management team has pointed out potential impacts for the company during 2020 fiscal year, such as the decline of the travel reimbursement revenue and the repercussion in some particular customers from most affected industries, like travel and automotive, for example.While the magnitude of these headwinds are of course difficult to predict at this point in time, Accenture expects that it will cause the revenue growth for fiscal year 2020 to be in the range of 3% to 6% in local currency, against 6% to 8% originally forecast. In addition, operation margin is expected to be in the range of 14.7% to 14.8%, which is still an expansion of 10 to 20 bps over last year, but lower than the original forecast of 10 to 30 bps.I am going to compare Accenture's financial data and valuation with companies in the IT services industry, according to Finviz classification. In addition, in order to have a relative evaluation with the broader technology sector, I will also compare Accenture with companies belonging to the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF (NYSEARCA:XLK).From the earnings quality perspective, we see on the table below that Accenture shows higher EBITDA margin than most of its IT services peers, but considerably lower gross profit and EBITDA margin than most companies in the technology sector, especially those in the software, semiconductor and financial services industries.On the other hand, Accenture scores in the first quintile in both groups regarding the return on invested capital, staying ahead of most peers, except few names such as Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Paycom (NYSE:PAYC).Source: Data from Finbox, consolidated by the authorTurning to the financial health, as illustrated below, Accenture remains as one of the best debt profile in the sector, scoring first or second quintile among IT services and technology companies.Source: Data from Finbox, consolidated by the authorMoving to the valuation analysis, looking at the table below, we see Accenture trading at higher P/E, EV/EBITDA and PEG compared to IT services peers. Meanwhile, we have a mixed picture when comparing to the technology sector, as Accenture has higher P/E and PEG ratios, but a lower EV/EBITDA.It is worth mentioning that our bench market for the technology sector, XLK, has nearly 20% of its holdings composed by software companies, many of them with high valuation multiples, given their historical above average revenue and earnings growth rates. On the other hand, while the software group can distort a little bit our analysis, it is reasonable to argue that Accenture’s multiples are largely in line with the broader technology sector.Furthermore, its premium relative to IT services can be arguably attributed to Accenture's earnings quality advantage, as illustrated before. Therefore, I see Accenture trading near fair value compared to its peers.Source: Data from Finbox, consolidated by the authorAccenture's shares have dropped alongside the broader market since the peak on Feb 19th. Although its decline of nearly 30% during the period outpaced the average drop of 25% in the technology sector, we can see that the damage caused in momentum indicators of Accenture's shares have been relatively similar to what occurred in the technology sector. In both cases, indicators like 1 year / 6 months performance, last 52 weeks high / low, moving averages and RSI have also been hammered.On the other hand, Accenture has fared generally better than its IT services peers during this period, as showed below. That said, there is no denying that the selloff has been quite hard and current momentum is weak, as prices are below 50 and 200-day moving averages and volatility remains very high.Source: Data from Finbox, consolidated by the authorDespite current headwinds due to the coronavirus outbreak, I think Accenture can withstand this moment, even with an impact in the next two quarters, but keeping unchanged the long-term prospect for the company.Accenture is a quality stock, with growing earnings, low debt and fair valuation, and remains an interesting pick in the IT services industry and the broader technology sector."
4319252,105197,2020-01-27T11:26:06-05:00,"Accenture’s strategy has been predicated on creating a technology platform to supplement and further the delivery of its services.
        Accenture has been steadily acquiring to build its digital transformation and security offerings. The latest in the line of M&A has been Broadcom’s security business, which was acquired from Symantec.
        Given the history of this asset and the fact Accenture recently got a new CEO, we are slightly uneasy about this deal.
        While we still like Accenture, until Accenture can demonstrate that this asset has been suitably integrated, we have changed our view on Accenture to neutral.","The importance of Accenture’s (ACN) platform can be understood in the context of the management strategy of moving away from commodity services; since these services still make a considerable portion of Accenture’s market, platform-based automation was the obvious solution to address the challenge of shrinking margins.One of Accenture's recent buys has a rather complicated history and below we detail out the specifics that could lead to potential issues for even the mighty Accenture.While we still like the company, we will be waiting to for Accenture to show progress and report some strength in its security business and hope this unit doesn’t jinx Accenture’s track record of turning around and absorbing businesses. In the interim, we have changed our stance to neutral on Accenture.Accenture has had an impeccable track record of M&ASource: Accenture Investor Relations, Seeking Alpha, Author analysisSource: Accenture Investor Relations, Seeking Alpha, Author analysisAccenture has been slowly growing the contribution from its inorganic initiatives, which is evident in the sustained margins and the company's ability to maintain 5-8% growth over the years.The acquisition that has intrigued us is Accenture buying Symantec’s (NLOK) cyber security services (NYSE:CSS) business from Broadcom.Source: Accenture Press ReleaseOur intrigue stems from the origins of this particular piece of business. Before selling part of Symantec’s enterprise security business (ESB), Broadcom had recently (Nov 2019) acquired it from Symantec for $10.7 billion.Broadcom’s purchase was at a little over 5x the annual run rate of $2 billion in revenues for ESB. Previously Symantec had purchased Blue Coat from Bain for $4.7 billion in 2016 to create ESB by clubbing Symantec’s existing enterprise security business with Blue Coat.Blue Coat, in turn, had been sold to Bain by Thoma Bravo for $2.4 billion in 2015, when Bain had bought Blue Coat to increase its focus on the growing cybersecurity market.Thoma Bravo had acquired/taken private Blue Coat in 2011 for $1.3 billion (or a ~50% premium to its last closing market cap).Although Thoma Bravo had paid a rich premium to Blue Coat’s closing price, Thoma Bravo has been known to buy ageing software companies to turn them around.Likely, Blue Coat’s stamp on the entity’s cybersecurity business would have dampened over the last decade. Furthermore, with the software industry moving to the cloud and the R&D spending that would have occurred along the way, the cybersecurity business today is likely to be a much stronger value proposition than what it previously was.What Accenture has acquired is a unit with 300 people and is a part of the $10.7 billion portfolio snapped up by Broadcom. In attempting to understand this acquisition better, we note:As noted earlier, this would almost be the same value at which Thoma Bravo had acquired Blue Coat (or the main chunk of the CSS business in the Symantec portfolio).We also note that some readers may not agree with our estimate of the value of the CSS business. Since there was significant IP that Broadcom acquired from Symantec, which may not have been sold to Accenture during the cybersecurity services business sale. However, much of the thesis around Accenture is around the company’s deep services background and Accenture’s consistent move towards a platform approach to improve customer outcomes while maintaining margins.In order to strengthen its technology platform, the company has been making multiple acquisitions and integrating them successfully.Given the track record of the company and the strategic upside possible, it should not be surprising should the company eclipse the $200 mark pretty soon.Source: Accenture: In A League Of Its OwnThus, we find it unlikely that the CSS sale did not accompany any software and the associated IP with it. The only reason why the price of this deal could be lower is due to the fire sale nature of this deal – Broadcom completed the Symantec transaction in Nov 19 and in Jan 20 Accenture announced that Accenture was buying the CSS business.Thoma Bravo and Bain Capital were financial investors, who ended with near 2x returns on this asset. However, Symantec, after the acquisition came under a cloud with the company reporting some financial statement issues. Subsequently, the CEO exited, some numbers were restated and finally, the asset was sold to Broadcom. Broadcom did not even take a quarter to rid itself of this asset, by selling it to Accenture.For Julie Sweet, the CSS business would be one of Accenture’s first major acquisitions.Source: Accenture Press ReleaseConsidering that Julie has had a distinguished carrier as a legal eagle and technology strategist, it is unlikely that she would have missed any potential skeletons in the CSS closet. Although, the pressure to fill in the late Pierre Nanterme’s shoes could have been an entirely different matter.Fundamentally, we still like Accenture. The challenge for us is the recent CSS acquisition. Since this asset was primarily owned by financial investors (one of whom is known to buy companies where the technology is about to die down) and the last owners either had to restate numbers or sold off the asset in a hurry, we are slightly concerned about this buy from Accenture.Thus, we foresee two potential outcomes:Given the very real possibility of Option 2, we are changing our stance to neutral on the stock with a keen eye for any news coming out from Accenture about its most recent buy."
4311272,105417,2019-12-08T16:36:38-05:00,"Traditional spending on hardware, software, and IT services consists of declining revenues from legacy categories.
        Cost savings generated by cloud and automation may witness some core spending diverted towards new technologies.
        For Accenture, new technologies, such as SMAC engagements, can represent up to 30% annual Y/Y revenue growth.","In the present note, we are commenting on the recently published IDC data, which supports strong IT spending forecast and in turn supports our thesis regarding future client wins for Accenture. After summarizing what the company does and reiterating our valuation, we present several key takeaways as they pertain to Accenture.Accenture is an IT Services company that provides services in strategy, consulting, digital, technology, and operations segments. The company has a revenue base of about $40 billion, with more than 470,000 employees] serving clients in more than 200 cities in 120 countries. ACN focuses on an ""as-a-service"" model of service delivery, which includes business process outsourcing, cloud services, managed operations, security, and infrastructure services. Accenture works with more than 90 clients out total 100 current clients of the Fortune Global, though in recent years the company has been reaching out to smaller and “niche”-focused clients.Per our industry-wide analysis and Accenture’s favorable fundamentals, and given the company’s strong top-line growth, we believe that ACN shares merit ~29x P/E multiple on 2019 earnings. When we apply it to our 2019 EPS estimate of $8.49, we get the target price of $246. We note that this P/E multiple is contingent on the S&P multiple of ~18x, and may expand/contract together with the multiple.We see the following three core risks to our long Accenture thesis.While Accenture strives to make the pricing structure attractive to its core clients and, henceforth, attract greater business, we see a number of Indian players, such as Infosys, Tata Consultancy, and Wipro, potentially lowering prices in the foreseeable future. In addition, there are smaller players that are threatening Accenture in Europe, such as Epam and Luxoft.2. Too Much European Exposure:Europe makes up about 45% of Accenture’s total revenues. With economy in Europe slowing down, we may see demand on some European contracts pressured. At present, none of Accenture’s clients voiced concerns regarding the slowing economy; yet, we know from the previous European slowdown in 2012 that IT services pressures can be sudden and very impactful.3. Legislative Uncertainty:The company heavily relies on H1-B and L-1 visas; over the last several years Congress attempts to heavily regulate the number of visa works each company can hire. Should the H1-B and L-1 visas become even more limited, there could be a negative 40-60 bps negative impact to Accenture’s margin."
4316019,102764,2020-01-09T13:15:31-05:00,"Accenture is a market leader with strong competitive advantages in its main markets.Financial performance has been outstanding over the long term.The company produces profitability metrics widely above the median levels in the sector.The stock remains reasonably valued at current prices.The risk and reward trade-off in Accenture looks solid, and any pullback down the road could present a buying opportunity.","When making investment decisions, a simple and straightforward thesis can be remarkably effective. Accenture (ACN) is a high-quality business with outstanding cash flow generation, and the stock is reasonably valued at current levels. This makes Accenture stock a strong candidate to consider buying for the long term, and the stock could be particularly attractive as an opportunistic purchase on any price pullback.Accenture is arguably the most recognized brand in management consulting, systems integration, and outsourcing. The company has operations in 52 countries, and it works with 91 of the Global 100 companies and over three-quarters of the Fortune Global 500 companies.Brand recognition and reputation are key sources of competitive strength in the industry, especially among large corporations and governments, who are notoriously risk-averse.Management has focused on a series of businesses with particularly promising growth opportunities identified as ""The New"". These areas include digital, cloud, and security. In the most recent conference call management said that Accenture is now producing 65% of revenue from these businesses, which should have positive implications in terms of growth potential going forward.Human talent is expensive, and it is a key expense item for Accenture. But capital reinvestment needs are relatively low, and profitability tends to expand as revenue grows over the years. In this context, free cash flow growth has widely exceeded revenue growth over the past decade, which is a clear reflection on fundamental quality for the business.Data by YChartsThe table below compares multiple profitability metrics for Accenture versus the median player in the Information Technology industry. Looking at a wide variety of ratios, Accenture is clearly superior to the average player in the sector by a considerable margin.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialAccenture is currently trading at a forward price to earnings ratio of 26.5, and the forward price to cash flow ratio stands at 20.3. These valuation ratios are not particularly cheap in comparison to the broad market, but the stock is very reasonably priced by industry standards.The table compares different valuation ratios for Accenture versus the median values for the sector. The stock is priced at a slight discount to peers. Importantly, Accenture is far more profitable than the median, so these valuation ratios could be considered relatively attractive by comparison.Data Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialWhen considering valuation levels, it is important to keep in mind that valuation is dynamic as opposed to a static concept. Current valuation ratios are reflecting a particular set of expectations about the company's financial performance. If the company delivers earnings numbers above those expectations, this means that the stock is actually cheaper than what current valuation ratios are implying.In other words, when you look at ratios such as forward price to earnings, expected earnings are the key input in this equation. If actual earnings turn out to be higher than expected, then the stock price needs to increase in order for the valuation to remain constant.Accenture has an impressive track record of delivering earnings figures above or in-line with Wall Street estimates over the long term.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialThe fact that the company has outperformed expectations in the past does not guarantee that it will continue doing so in the future. However, it's good to know that management likes to under promise and overdeliver when it comes to earnings guidance and managing expectations.Valuation needs to be analyzed in the context of other return drivers. A company producing strong profitability and consistently delivering above expectations deserves a higher valuation than a business producing mediocre financial performance and underperforming expectations.But sometimes it can be challenging to incorporate multiple factors into the analysis in order to see the complete picture from a quantitative perspective. In that spirit, the PowerFactors system is a quantitative system that ranks companies in a particular universe according to a combination of factors, such as financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength.Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123The backtested performance numbers show that companies with high PowerFactors rankings tend to deliver superior returns over the long term, and this has bullish implications for Accenture.The company has a PowerFactors ranking of 88 as of the time of this writing, meaning that Accenture is solidly in the top quintile of stocks based on financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength combined.Corporate spending depends on economic conditions to a good degree, which exposes Accenture to considerable macroeconomic risk. The good part is that IT spending and outsourcing are related to cost-cutting efforts in many areas, which makes the business more resilient.Looking at both revenue and earnings during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, the company managed to sustain solid performance during tough times, and it emerged from the crisis in stronger shape than ever.Data by YChartsBut still, major economic trends and corporate spending levels could generate uncertainty around Accenture, so this is a relevant risk factor to assess when evaluating a position in the stock.Accenture is also prone to acquisitions, the company has made over 130 purchases in the past 5 years. While Accenture has a solid trajectory of successfully incorporating these purchases, integration risk is always a relevant factor to keep in mind.In terms of price action, Accenture is in a beautiful uptrend, the stock made new highs reaching overbought levels around $213 at the end of 2019. Since then, it has pulled back somewhat and it looks no longer overbought. The area around $200 is quite important and price action should be considered bullish as long as the stock remains above such a level.Source: TOSOverall, Accenture is a high-quality business positioned on the right side of major economic trends such as technology investing, business innovation, and outsourcing. Besides, the company is widely profitable and it produces strong cash flows. This makes Accenture a solid name to consider holding for the long term.The stock price is not materially undervalued at current prices, but it's not overvalued either. At these prices, chances are that Accenture stock will continue producing solid returns with moderate downside risk, and any substantial pullback down the road should be considered an opportunity to buy a top-quality business for a more attractive valuation."

For dividend growth investors, this can be an opportunity to start or add to positions prior to a new increased payout. This can be especially important for retirees who live on dividend checks.The lists I've compiled provide various stats for the stocks that are increasing their dividends next week.This list is a trimmed-down version only covering dividend increases. A full upcoming dividend calendar is always available here. If you know how this was built and the caveats, feel free to jump down to the lists themselves.The information presented below was created by combining the ""U.S. Dividend Champion"" spreadsheet hosted here with upcoming dividend information from Nasdaq. This meshes metrics about companies with dividend growth history with upcoming dividend payments (and whether those payments are increasing). These companies all have a minimum five-year dividend growth history.As a point of clarification, companies are included that may not raise their dividend every calendar year - but the total annual dividend received will still be higher each year. One example is Bank of America (BAC).In the table here on SA, the annual dividend payout received by a shareholder increased for each year in this time frame. Thus it is eligible for inclusion on the ""CCC"" list.That said, it did pay out the same amount for eight quarters in a row, but again, the total annual amount increased each year.United Technologies (UTX) is another example.The ""ex-dividend"" date is the day you are no longer entitled to the dividend or distribution. You need to have made your purchase by the preceding business day. If the date is a Tuesday, you need to have purchased (or already owned) shares by market close on Monday. Be aware that for any stock going ex-dividend on a Monday (or Tuesday, if Monday is a holiday), you must own it by the prior Friday.Here are the definitions of the streak categories as I'll be using them throughout the piece:The data is sorted by the ex-dividend day (ascending) and then the streak (descending):Field DefinitionsStreak: This is years of dividend growth history sourced from the U.S. Dividend Champions spreadsheet.Forward Yield: This is the new payout rate divided by the current share price.Ex-Dividend Date: This is the date before which you need to own the stock.Increase Percent: This is the amount by which the dividend is being increased.Streak Category: This is the overall dividend history classification of the company.Here's a table mapping the new rates versus the old rates. It also reiterates the increase in percentage. This table is sorted the same way as the first table (ex-dividend day ascending, dividend streak descending).Additional MetricsHere are some additional metrics related to these companies, including yearly pricing action and the P/E ratio. This table is sorted the same way as the table above. The value investor may find stock ideas with those companies near their 52-week lows. They may provide a larger margin of safety and inflated yield.Some investors are more interested in current yield, so this table is sorted descending by yield. This also includes some of the historical dividend growth rates as a bonus. Additionally, the ""Chowder Rule"" has been included, which is the current yield + five-year dividend growth rate.BonusBeing the lone company gets Accenture the spotlight this week. Do note that Accenture has now moved to a quarterly dividend payout schedule from a bi-annual.As mentioned above, Accenture has strung together a nice 15-year dividend streak that is poised to grow well into the future. Earnings have grown at an approximately 10% annual rate for about the past decade. Looking forward, that appears to be the case though earnings may be slightly more muted through 2020.(Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs)There are quite a few feathers in Accenture's cap - firstly they have just a token amount of debt. They could easily pay it off on a whim whenever they wanted to. Given that, they have an A+ credit rating from S&P and sport a current yield about 1.6%. It's low, sure, but this should continue to grow well into the future.Visually looking at the graph, shares appear to be a bit on the expensive side around 25x earnings. In absolute terms, it's not terrible given the growth consistency and high single/low double-digit growth expected into the future.Historically speaking, we are also at the trough of the dividend yield curve. Back at the end of 2018 it did pop above 2%.Looking at the scorecard from Simply Safe Dividends, here's how it ranks.Accenture scores very well overall with an incredibly strong 92 safety score and 89 growth score. Understandably it comes at the expense of current yield. With a total score over 200 (207 actually), it ranks in the top 5% overall of all the stocks in the SSD universe. That universe does contain things like preferred shares but the point should be well taken.Using the same math, if we assume an average company scores 150 (perfectly average safety, growth and yield), Accenture would still rank in the top 9% overall.(Source: Simply Safe Dividends)Now recall that ACN just changed their payout schedule so the 1-year growth score is being thrown off. Even scrolling back through the dividend history on Seeking Alpha, the data is slightly off but directionally correct.There have been several 10% increases each year for the past several years. With the aforementioned high-single/low-double digit earnings growth expected, investors can assume a similar yearly increase going forward without changing the payout ratio.Accenture essentially prints money with a steady 14-15% operating margin year after year. This translates into a ton of annual cash flow to return to shareholders.Additionally, there has been a bit of a buyback story going on as well. Share count has come down over 10% (depending which chart you view) which has helped to boost EPS (and not accumulate debt).I ran a stock return calculation comparing ACN to the S&P (SPY) and the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) since October 2011 (earliest date for SCHD).ACN trounced both the market and SCHD over the time frame. Considering all the highlights mentioned above it's easy to see why. Fat margins, no debt, growing earnings, reduced share-count all have a combined effect. With how fast the dividend has grown, total dividends have beaten the market.Here's a look at the investments over time:The three were fairly even until 2016 when ACN began to pull ahead by a substantial amount. It just highlights that it can take time for investment ideas to pan out.(Courtesy:Custom Stock Alerts)I hope you find this information valuable. Let me know if you want to see additional data points or what may help make this more useful.As always, do your due diligence on any stock before buying or selling. Happy investing!"
4308377,105417,2019-11-21T15:24:02-05:00,"Financial Services and Health & Public Services verticals continue to shine at Accenture, being main contributors to double-digit growth.
        CMT (Communications, Media, and Technology) CMT also generates mid-teens growth, mainly driven by engagements from Media firms.
        Resources and Consumer are lagging at low-single-digit growth, though Consumer segment should improve in 2020.","Accenture is an IT Services company that provides services in strategy, consulting, digital, technology, and operations segments. The company has a revenue base of about $40 billion, with more than 470,000 employees] serving clients in more than 200 cities in 120 countries. ACN focuses on an ""as-a-service"" model of service delivery, which includes business process outsourcing, cloud services, managed operations, security, and infrastructure services. Accenture works with more than 90 clients out total 100 current clients of the Fortune Global, though in recent years the company has been reaching out to smaller and “niche”-focused clients.Per our industry-wide analysis and Accenture’s favorable fundamentals, and given the company’s strong top-line growth, we believe that ACN shares merit ~29x P/E multiple on 2019 earnings. When we apply it to our 2019 EPS estimate of $8.49, we get the target price of $246. We note that this P/E multiple is contingent on the S&P multiple of ~18x, and may expand/contract together with the multiple.Accenture will report quarterly earnings in December in what will mark a remarkable calendar year 2019, when core industry trends came to fruition, despite fears of recession that were prevalent early in the year. Out of the company’s five verticals (discussed in detail below), we see Financial Services, CMT and Health & Public Services all posting double-digit growth. Resources and Consumer, meanwhile should grow in single digits, but remain positive nonetheless. Overall, Accenture remains on firm footing, representing approximately 3%-3.5% of total market share in the IT Services space, capable of approximately $500-$1 billion in annual acquisitions, as well as capital return in the 1-2% range. We reiterate our firm Buy conviction in ACN shares.Financial Services: We long maintained that Accenture’s Financial Services vertical is mainly about bulge bracket firms and various next-gen technology initiatives these clients sign up for. While money management and insurance firms cumulatively make up about 40% of the top line, banks are still at more than half. We note that 13%-14% Y/Y growth should be sustainable in the fourth quarter, largely driven by 1) traditional IT Services work; 2) cloud and mobile initiatives; and 3) business process outsourcing. We note that within Financial Services vertical margins are also better for banks than they are for insurance or money management players. While we expect an average bulge-bracket player to continue retaining about 6-8 IT Services vendors (in other words, Accenture is likely competing with companies, like IBM, Cognizant, and Capgemini), we still believe that most projects remained intact for ACN in the fourth quarter, positioning it well for 2020.CMT (Communications, Media, and Technology): Media sub-segment continues to outperform everyone else in this vertical, contributing as much as 18% Y/Y revenue growth during the quarter and easily offsetting any pressure points that communications and technology clients likely posed. We estimate that CMT grew about 16% during the quarter, with cloud projects remaining key to this traction. It is our understanding that cost-wise there may be incremental SG&A expenses around in-house technology work, but we expect them to be offset by Health & Public Service vertical.Health & Public Services: Within healthcare side, we see growth around 11% Y/Y, driven about equally by pharmaceutical and payer engagements, albeit patent cliff may somewhat kick in during 2020 and be a negative headwind for pharma; we expect more update on this during the call. Within Public Services, we don’t anticipate any new contracts or incremental work for existing contracts: we believe that growth has been fairly steady in low-mid teens for this sub-segment. Much has been rumored about Pentagon’s recent contract to Microsoft: whether or not Accenture could be an indirect beneficiary on the IT side. Should that materialize, it will not happen until 2021-22, but we should not speculate at this point.Resources: The growth of this vertical has accelerated throughout recent several quarters, but still remains at mid-single digits, with our model predicting 6.7% Y/Y during the fourth quarter. We believe that oil prices have reached a certain equilibrium during the second half of the year; further, we expect any hit from the bombing of Saudi Arabia plants to be marginal (no more than $20-$25 MM in revenue). At the same time, pressures around natural gas remain real and are likely to keep the Resources revenue in the single digits throughout 2020.Consumer: Finally, the consumer revenue is seeing some deceleration, as retailers in the US and Europe are demonstrating less demand in 2019 on a Y/Y basis, which leads to fewer consulting and outsourcing engagements. Most pressures come from the legacy IT engagements (definitely some scaling back in France and Great Britain), albeit we’ve seen some softness around cloud work as well. We estimate roughly 3-4% Y/Y for this vertical during the quarter, which should see 150-200 bps improvement in 2020.We see the following three core risks to our long Accenture thesis.While Accenture strives to make the pricing structure attractive to its core clients and, henceforth, attract greater business, we see a number of Indian players, such as Infosys, Tata Consultancy, and Wipro, potentially lowering prices in the foreseeable future. In addition, there are smaller players that are threatening Accenture in Europe, such as Epam and Luxoft.2. Too Much European Exposure:Europe makes up about 45% of Accenture’s total revenues. With economy in Europe slowing down, we may see demand on some European contracts pressured. At present, none of Accenture’s clients voiced concerns regarding the slowing economy; yet, we know from the previous European slowdown in 2012 that IT services pressures can be sudden and very impactful.3. Legislative Uncertainty:The company heavily relies on H1-B and L-1 visas; over the last several years Congress attempts to heavily regulate the number of visa works each company can hire. Should the H1-B and L-1 visas become even more limited, there could be a negative 40-60 bps negative impact to Accenture’s margin."

The stock is up 50% from its 52-week low in December 2018, so I'm skeptical it will continue that growth trajectory after such a strong runup.My bias on ACN is NEUTRAL at current valuation levels."

We note that this P/E multiple is contingent on the S&P multiple of ~18x, and may expand/contract together with the multiple.We review some of Accenture's verticals and then comment on the business as a whole.Products: This vertical grew 12% Y/Y during the quarter, driven by strong retail and travel services, as well as life sciences and consumer goods. We note that the strength in this vertical is strongly tied to the strength of the consumption spending, which in the US alone accounts for about 70% of the GDP (and stands at 50%+ of GDP in numerous European countries). In our research, we closely track consumer and retail spend, as well as various consumption indices, in order to continuously assess the health of Products group at Accenture and similar groups at other companies.CMT (Communications, Media, and Technology): The growth for this vertical was not its finest, only 7% Y/Y, with software and platforms leading the way in double digits, while some of the legacy products lagged in single digits. Furthermore, it is our understanding that the European business outpaced the North American business, as pockets of softness linger in the US markets.Financial Services: Financial Services business grew 6% Y/Y, strongly supported by the insurance business, though with a fairly lackluster performance in the banking segment. We continue to see banking as driven by 1) traditional IT Services work; 2) cloud and mobile initiatives; and 3) business process outsourcing. However, we may be in for a slight slowdown in the banking segment, for two-three quarters, potentially tied to the low interest rate environment.Remaining Optimistic About Core Markets: Recall that the largest markets for Accenture are United States, Italy, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Spain, Japan, and Australia, with these countries representing 80%+ of total revenues and representing more than 85% of ACN's largest clients. We believe that while effects of saturation have slowed down some of these markets (or at the very least brought some of them to a certain steady state of mid-single-digit top line growth), nonetheless the next-gen technologies, such as cloud and mobile, should help deliver at least 100 bps of annual revenue growth acceleration in the long run.""The New"" Digital Remains Key: Cloud and security account for about 65% of total revenues and continue to demonstrate very robust growth. In cloud alone, the company has 300+ patents and pending applications, with successful partnerships that engage Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure. In our view, the digital segment should drive strength across all verticals, with a possible exception of Resources.We see the following three core risks to our long Accenture thesis.1. Pricing WarsWhile Accenture strives to make the pricing structure attractive to its core clients and, henceforth, attract greater business, we see a number of Indian players, such as Infosys, Tata Consultancy, and Wipro, potentially lowering prices in the foreseeable future.

4301468,105417,2019-11-01T12:22:30-04:00,"Financial Services vertical continues to see strong support from bulge bracket firms and insurance companies.Multiple reads from technology segments indicate 20%+ Y/Y growth for the digital segment.Healthcare is slowing, particularly on the patent side, but payer segment should still provide upside.","With Cognizant reporting 3Q results, we have received a strong read-through for Accenture, which is one of Cognizant’s most important competitors in the United States, if not the most important one. Below, we analyze these implications on a per vertical basis:1. Financial Services: Demand for banking and insurance segments remains strong, as was evidenced by Cognizant’s top clients in this space, who also happen to be Accenture’s top clients. Note that it is typical for S&P 500 companies to work with at least several vendors, and CTSH and ACN frequently come up as top choices for most global firms. Within banking, we are seeing increasing demand for mobile and cloud services, which have grown at 20%+ for Cognizant, in addition to more traditional business process outsourcing for insurance clients. Overall, we continue to see Financial Services vertical growing 11% Y/Y in 2020, in line with the strong traction we have witnessed in 2019, as banking, insurance, and capital markets sub-segments in North America continue to drive the strength. The ongoing de-regulation in the United States should drive the banking revenue, which should continue to impact at least 40% of this vertical’s top-line, with the company’s bulge-bracket bank clients expanding their engagements with Accenture by at least 2-3%.2. CMT (Communication, Media, and Technology):The CMT (Communication, Media, and Technology) is definitely the strongest vertical at Accenture, and we project its revenue to grow 22-24% Y/Y in 2020. Cognizant’s results from the Telecom group is the best read for this vertical. At Cognizant, most of the tech-related growth is inorganic, given the tuck-ins the company pursued in recent years. This actually makes CTSH one of the best reads for Accenture’s CMT, given how diverse and broad these channels are. What we are seeing is continued strong demand for digital services. At Cognizant, it grew around 25% Y/Y during the third quarter: since historically, growth for this particular segment is within a 300 bps range at Accenture, we are comfortably (and conservatively) modeling 22% Y/Y growth for the quarter. Furthermore, we expect at least 100-150 bps in incremental revenue tailwinds from the Fintech clients. With CMT composing about 28% of Accenture’s total revenue, we see its strong revenue traction as the core driver of the company’s revenues; while this segment also commands a relatively weak margin, we believe that these bottom line investments are absolutely crucial to recruiting smaller clients (the company is already well-established with top-tier accounts), as well as to gaining traction in emerging markets, particularly Brazil and India. 3. Healthcare vertical:Formally known as Health & Public Service at Accenture, we have a read through only for the Healthcare side. Our conclusion here is actually more favorable for Accenture than for Cognizant itself, because while at CTSH this vertical is moderately declining (about -1% in 3Q, with our estimate for 2020 showing tepid growth), at Accenture we actually see an upside, since the patent cliff affecting Cognizant's pharma business is less pronounced for ACN. The payer business, which grew in mid-single digits at Cognizant, offsetting pharma, is a much more domineering force. We see enough traction to keep the payer momentum going for Accenture not only this quarter but also in 2020. Per our industry-wide analysis and Accenture’s favorable fundamentals, and given the company’s strong top-line growth, we believe that ACN shares merit ~29x P/E multiple on 2019 earnings.

The broader market volatility is definitely coming into play, but analysts are also concerned about management's disappointing forward revenue guide.However, let's not forget that ACN's shares are still up big so far in 2019 and outperforming the broader market by almost 18 percentage points.Data by YChartsThere are company-specific risk factors that need to be considered, especially given the broader market uncertainty, but I believe that Accenture's management team has this global IT consulting and outsourcing company well positioned for the future. This unique company has great, long-term business prospects, and in my opinion, Accenture's growth profile should not be overlooked, even after factoring in management's disappointing revenue guidance.On September 26, 2019, Accenture reported Q4 2019 adjusted EPS of $1.74 (beat by $0.02) on revenue of $11.1B (in line with estimates). These quarterly results also compare favorably to the year-ago quarter.Source: Q4 2019 Earnings PresentationOther highlights from the quarter:There was lot to like about Accenture's Q4 2019 results, but the market struggled to look past management's disappointing forward guidance:Source: Q4 2019 Press ReleaseAnalysts were calling for Q1 2020 revenues to be $11.25B, which is slightly above the high-end of management's guidance. Additionally, analysts expected Accenture to report EPS of $7.96, and this estimate is well above management's $7.62-7.84 range. The guide was viewed as lackluster by the Street. However, at the end of the day, I believe that investors should view Accenture as a long-term play because this tech company operates in several industries that have significant growth profiles. As such, the disappointing Q1 and full-year 2020 guidance should be viewed as near-term noise (remember, FX is projected to be a significant headwind), especially if you are in it for the long haul.The connected world is already upon us, and I believe that Accenture, which is the go-to IT product and service provider, is in a great position to benefit from a promising backdrop.There are many different Internet Of Things, or IoT, predictions, but the common thread throughout all of the estimates is the fact that we operate in a highly connected economy. Moreover, it would be hard to find a pundit who does not believe that the connected economy will experience tremendous growth in the decades ahead. For example, consider these two projections.Source: GartnerAs shown, Gartner predicts that almost all new tech products (95%) will contain some type of IoT component by 2020. Furthermore, to put a dollar figure to the predictions, McKinsey & Company expects for IoT technology services to have a CAGR of 17% and reach $143B in spending by 2021.Source: McKinsey & CompanyI could provide a number of different predictions that show how connected the economy may be in 5, 10, or 20 years from now, but I will save you the time. Simply put, IoT is going to play a critical role in the global economy for many years to come. Therefore, investors in Accenture should be encouraged that the company has reported strong results over the past few quarters (and years). Moreover, Accenture's main growth driver, The New (read more about The New here), appears to be gaining steam, which obviously bodes well for this company's future.Therefore, investors should be excited about an investment in this industry leader because, in my opinion, Accenture appears to be well positioned to benefit from multiple tailwinds in several key industries. And it helps that the stock is still reasonably valued.Let's consider two different comparisons. First, the company's stock price is trending well above its average historical P/E ratio.Data by YChartsHowever, ACN's shares are trading at a discount to the industry average P/E ratio.Source: FidelityWhile ACN shares are definitely not cheap by any means, let's also remember that Accenture is a shareholder-friendly company (management continues to raise the dividend and buy back shares) that operates in high-growth industry. Therefore, I believe that Accenture will not only grow into its current valuation but also the growth potential is not yet fully baked into the stock.Accenture is highly levered to the digital space, so any major disruption to The New would significantly impact the company's business prospects. Additionally, reputation risk is an important consideration because Accenture is the go-to consultant in its industry. Specifically, ACN's shares are trading at a premium to its peers (and the market), so a negative shift in investor sentiment would materially impact the company's stock price.The main takeaway from Accenture's Q4 2019 results is that this company is in a great position for fiscal 2020 (and beyond). Moreover, the market did not like the revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter and full-year, but when taking a step back, the short-term fluctuations are not legitimate reasons to be concerned, especially if FX is the major culprit. There may be some noise in the numbers over the next four quarters, but that is not a reason to sell the stock. I believe that this company is worthy of investment dollars.Accenture is operating in markets that have significant growth profiles, so in my opinion, investors with a time horizon longer than three to five years should consider adding ACN shares on pullbacks."

The company has a revenue base of about $40 billion, with more than 470,000 employees] serving clients in more than 200 cities in 120 countries. ACN focuses on an ""as-a-service"" model of service delivery, which includes business process outsourcing, cloud services, managed operations, security, and infrastructure services. Accenture works with more than 90 clients out total 100 current clients of the Fortune Global, though in recent years the company has been reaching out to smaller and “niche”-focused clients.Per our industry-wide analysis and Accenture’s favorable fundamentals, and given the company’s strong top-line growth, we believe that ACN shares merit ~29x PE multiple on 2019 earnings. When we apply it to our 2019 EPS estimate of $8.42, we get the target price of $245. We note that this P/E multiple is contingent on the S&P multiple of ~18x, and may expand/contract together with the multiple.Accenture’s strength comes from its five core verticals and from the tailwinds in those verticals over the next 12-18 months. Below, we analyze these verticals in some detail.1. Financial Services: We expect this vertical to grow 11% Y/Y in 2020, in line with the strong traction we are seeing in 2019, as banking, insurance, and capital markets sub-segments in North America continue to drive the strength. The ongoing de-regulation in the United States should drive the banking revenue, which should continue to drive at least 40% of this vertical’s top-line, with the company’s bulge-bracket bank clients expanding their engagements with Accenture by at least 2-3%. Further, we see some acceleration from insurance clients, though it is likely to be under 75-100 bps. Overall, the greatest threat to the financial services continues to come from low (and falling) interest rates; however, the link between falling interest rate revenue and lower IT engagement is a murky one at best; hence we are not making changes to our model at this time, while remaining cognizant of anecdotal evidence. Note that Financial Services make up about a quarter of Accenture’s revenues.2. CMT (Communication, Media, and Technology):The CMT (Communication, Media, and Technology) is definitely the strongest at Accenture, and we project its revenue to grow 22-24% Y/Y in 2020. At the heart of the vertical’s strength are various revenue streams within business process outsourcing and consulting segments, namely SMAC (social, mobile, analytics, and cloud) revenue streams. Furthermore, we expect at least 100-150 bps in incremental revenue tailwinds from the Fintech clients. With CMT composing about 28% of Accenture’s total revenue, we see its strong revenue traction as the core driver of the company’s revenues; while this segment also commands a relatively weak margin, we believe that these bottom line investments are absolutely crucial to recruiting smaller clients (the company is already well-established with top-tier accounts), as well as to gaining traction in emerging markets, particularly Brazil and India. Note that the emerging markets constitute approximately 12-14% of Accenture’s total revenue (across all five verticals).3. Health & Public Service The Health vertical, while not seeing major tailwinds from new accounts, should nonetheless grow in mid-teens in 2020 (14.7% Y/Y revenue growth, according to our estimates), driven by the payer IT work, though favorable comps are also at play here, relative to 2019. With the patent cliff evident for many pharma players, such as Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson, we nonetheless believe that existing projects should provide enough fuel to support growth. Further, pharmaceutical engagements are increasingly moving toward cloud, which should make support the top line as well. On the government side, we expect more contracts from the Pentagon, though it continues to be difficult to assess either their revenue or margins (for conservative purposes, they are not in our 2020 numbers).4. Resources: We expect the Resources group to be the weakest among the five, as oil and natural gas groups continue to be pressured at Accenture, with revenues in both falling 2-4% Y/Y, respectively. With a potential recession looming around the world, we believe that oil prices may decline 10-20% over the next 12-18 months, making the Resources segment even more anemic at Accenture. While we recognize that our estimates may be conservative, we are nonetheless modeling a 6-8% decline in the annual revenues for the Resources segment. At the same time, this is the weakest vertical in our model, and the only one with the negative growth, constituting more than 15% of total revenue, which doesn’t dampen the bullishness of our overall thesis for the company.5. Products: Despite some macro pressures, the economic state of the US consumer remains very strong. In fact, we analyzed both nation-wide retail sales and earnings reports from various retailers, such as Gap, Kohl’s, and even Wal-Mart to assess the health of Accenture’s Products group. Overall, we estimate that this segment will grow 12.3% Y/Y in 2020, which will mark approximately 120-130 bps of revenue growth acceleration.We see the following three core risks to our long Accenture thesis.While Accenture strives to make the pricing structure attractive to its core clients and, henceforth, attract greater business, we see a number of Indian players, such as Infosys, Tata Consultancy, and Wipro, potentially lowering prices in the foreseeable future. In addition, there are smaller players that are threatening Accenture in Europe, such as Epam and Luxoft.2. Too Much European Exposure:Europe makes up about 45% of Accenture’s total revenues. With economy in Europe slowing down, we may see demand on some European contracts pressured. At present, none of Accenture’s clients voiced concerns regarding the slowing economy; yet, we know from the previous European slowdown in 2012 that IT services pressures can be sudden and very impactful.3. Legislative Uncertainty:The company heavily relies on H1-B and L-1 visas; over the last several years Congress attempts to heavily regulate the number of visa works each company can hire. Should the H1-B and L-1 visas become even more limited, there could be a negative 40-60 bps negative impact to Accenture’s margin."

We look through the company’s business to ascribe intrinsic value to the Accenture stock based on a sum-of-the-parts approach, valuing each of the company’s business lines. Even in the base case, we find a 12-13% upside, which can easily swell up to 35% in a more favorable case.At the beginning of Sept 2019, the company announced that Julie Spellman Sweet had been elevated to the post of CEO. The interim CEO, David Rowland, became the executive chairman of the board.Sweet had previously served as the CEO for Accenture’s North American operations from June 2015 until Sept 2019. Before that Sweet was Accenture’s General Counsel. She had joined Accenture in 2010, after a nearly two-decade stint at a NY legal services firm, Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, where she left as a partner. Sweet holds a Juris Doctor from Columbia Law School.Additionally, her areas of expertise extend to innovation and impact of technology on business, among others. Sweet is also a member of the World Economic Forum's International Business Council.On Sweet’s earlier appointment as the CEO of Accenture's North American operations, erstwhile CEO, late Pierre Nanterme had stated:Source: Accenture press releaseDuring Sweet’s tenure at the helm of Accenture’s North American operations, the division had clocked an average revenue growth rate of 8%.Source: Company filings, Author calculationsWhile 2016 saw broad-based growth across verticals, 2017’s revenue growth was much lower on account of weakness in health and public sector and 2018 saw a bounceback in growth despite headwinds. 2019 has seen improvement in the federal business and Q3 results saw the company updated its guidance to 8-9% y/y revenue growth.Accenture has been steadily building out a technology core to host most of its businesses. The build-out has been effected through a mix of acquisitions and organic effort. As a result of Accenture's strategy, the company's margin profile has been improving. While tailwinds of contract profitability and low-cost delivery centers gets offset by FX headwinds, the benefits of automating routine jobs almost directly add on to the operating line.We also note that some of Accenture's business segments lend themselves amenable to greater benefits from the ""platformization"" of the company’s offerings.Certain research suggests that Accenture's consulting revenues are positively correlated to Fed funds rate, implying that rate cuts can potentially weaken the revenue growth for the company. While the Fed has been dragging its heels on excessive cuts, we look through each of Accenture’s segments to assess what the best- and worst-case outcomes could look like.Communications, Media & Technology (CMT)The clients in the CMT division (communications, media, high-tech, software, etc.) have a great need to catalyze their digital transformation journey. The resultant demand, coupled with Accenture's scale has allowed the company to deliver strong performance. For the nine months ended May 19, operating margin expanded by 160 bps on top of a 7% growth in $ revenue.Especially, the sustained growth in software and platforms has allowed for above-average revenue growth rates and coupled with strong contract profitability, the segment’s margins have seen a steady uptick.We expect the strength in platform services and cloud and infrastructure services to continue even in the worst case to drive 6% y/y revenue growth for 2020. What can further strengthen growth are custom services, which could end up adding another 4-5% to 2020 segment revenue growth.On the margin front, we think custom development can add nearly 100 bps to our base case operating margin.Source: Company filings, Author estimatesWe also note Julie Sweet’s view of the North American operations and technology bent can help further growth, making the upside case more likely.Financial Services (FS)Since the bulk of FS revenues are derived from banking and capital markets, weakness in this sub-segment has been a major headwind for FS despite strength in the insurance business. In particular, Europe has been a spot of bother. However, with an improvement in banking and the expectations of ECB action to support growth, we think that Accenture's expectations of recovery in FS in 2H19 have been well-founded. While for the nine months ended May 19, operating margin contracted by over 100 bps along with a 2% decline in $ revenue, the decline for 3Q19 was 1.5%.Looking out to 2020, we think the degree of improvement in banking and capital market business will be the key determinant of the segment performance. We expect a base case growth rate of 2%, with an improvement in banking and capital markets potentially adding 3-4% to segment growth.Source: Company filings, Author estimatesThe risks to our forecasts are from extreme fallout events such as a difficult Brexit, further deterioration of Italy’s condition and possible tariff tensions with the EU.Health & Public Service (HPS)The weakness in HPS had been due to the winding down of existing contracts in the US, with Europe remaining strong. As the US federal business has started recovering, HPS's performance has been improving.Source: Company filings, Author calculationsThe US federal government business accounted for nearly one-third of HPS's segment revenue for 2018, making it an important component of HPS's growth. We expect growth to pick up with stability in margins on the back of US presidential elections next year driving up spending.Source: Company filings, Author estimatesIn the base case, we think revenues could move up by at least 4%, with the catalysts highlighted having a potential to add another 2-3% of growth. Margins could also expand by 1-2%, should more lavish spending be unleashed.ProductsAccenture’s largest product division has seen strength across geographies and segments. We expect the Accenture to continue benefiting from the need to enhance distribution and sales efficiencies.Source: Company filings, Author calculationsHowever, competition and the need to invest has been evident in the margins with a 40-bps y/y contraction in 3Q19 margins and an even more pronounced 50-bps contraction for 9M19.Going forward, we estimate that despite the cushion from life sciences, competition in consumer-related industries and lumpiness in industrial business could cause a 3-4% difference in growth across the base case and the upside case.Source: Company filings, Author estimatesWe also note that the need for investments could keep margin growth muted.ResourcesThe Resources business group’s performance has been on a tear. Whether the need for old economy companies to play catch up by adopting digital transformation has been fueling profitable demand or structural changes in business models have been driving growth in Accenture’s resources division is debatable. However, the division has been delivering multi-quarter double-digit growth rates.Source: Company filings, Author calculationsEven the margin expansion has been stellar. Going into 2020, we expect strong growth.Source: Company filings, Author estimatesDespite the geopolitical influences over these industries, even in the base case, segment growth is unlikely to fall below high-single digits.While the underlying fabric of delivery remains the same across Accenture's business lines, the distinctive dynamics of each division are quite visible. For example, FS has seen headwinds and HPS has seen strength in Europe with the inverse characteristics in the US. Resources and CMT have seen broad-based strength, despite very different underlying drivers. The Products division has been growing while facing margin headwinds.Given the distinct nature of business dynamics, we value Accenture on a sum-of-parts method.We apply an EV/EBIT multiple to each of the divisions to arrive at our estimated value of each division and then adjust for the net debt to arrive at the estimated equity value for Accenture’s stock.Source: Company filings, Author estimatesBased on our upside and base cases, we have estimated the EBITs and the corresponding EV/EBIT multiples. Our estimate of the segment EV/EBIT multiple is based on the overall multiple that Accenture commands, adjusted for the segment revenue growth and margin. The adjustments have been made to preserve the distinct characteristics of the industries in focus.Source: Company filings, Author estimatesIn the base case, we expect a 12-13% upside from the current levels of $190-200. The upside case talks about going up by over one-third of the company’s market cap. Even in the upside case, the P/S does not look very expensive.Source: Company filings, Author estimatesIn April this year, we had noted:Source: Accenture: In A League Of Its OwnIn addition to the intrinsic valuation, factors such as the new CEO’s vision and currency moves are likely to be the key determinants of the Accenture stock’s price. In the same breath, we also note that the CEO has spent close to a decade at the company and over one-third of its workforce is in India and the Philippines, where currency depreciation has been helping lower costs. All things considered, we find Accenture to be a high-quality, low-risk stock with significant upside potential over the course of the next few quarters."
4292408,20715,2019-09-19T04:21:04-04:00,"Accenture is set to report fourth-quarter earnings on September 26.The company has been able to grow earnings and revenue consistently in the past few years and is expected to do so again.Sentiment toward the stock is skewed to the bearish side, but not by a great deal.The weekly overbought/oversold indicators are up near overbought territory at this time.","Tech consulting firm Accenture (ACN) is set to release fourth-quarter earnings results before the opening bell on Thursday (9/26/19). Analysts expect the company to report earnings of $1.71 per share on revenue of $11.08 billion. The Dublin-based company reported earnings of $1.58 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 on revenue of $10.15 billion. This means analysts are looking for earnings to grow by 8.2% and revenue to grow by 9.2%.Those figures are in line with the earnings and revenue growth we have seen in recent years. Earnings have grown by an average of 12% per year over the last three years, while revenue has increased by an average of 8% per year. In the third quarter, earnings grew by 8% and revenue grew by 4%. For 2019 as a whole, analysts expect the final growth figures to show earnings growth of 9% and revenue growth of 9.2%.While the growth figures have been consistent and above average, the management efficiency measurements for Accenture are mixed. The return on equity is well above average at 42.2% while the profit margin is average at 14.0%.Looking at the fundamental ratings from Investor’s Business Daily, the EPS rating for Accenture is 82, meaning that it is in the top 18% of companies in terms of earnings growth in the last few years. The SMR rating (measuring sales growth, profit margin, and return on equity) is a ""B,"" and that means it is slightly above average in these areas as a whole.Accenture experienced a pretty big rally off of its December low, gaining over 54% from the low to the high. Over the past few months, the rally seems to have stalled a little, and that has the stock on the verge of moving below its 13-week moving average.The stock hasn’t closed a week below the 13-week since it rallied above it back in January. It has flirted with the trend line on several occasions and even dropped below it on a few occasions, but it always managed to close above the moving average. ACN went through a similar stretch last summer before falling below the 13-week in October. That drop below the moving average signaled worse things to come in the fourth quarter with the stock dropping another 18% or so.The rally over the last nine months had put the stock in overbought territory based on the 10-week RSI and the weekly stochastic readings, but the selling in the last few weeks has allowed both indicators to move out of overbought territory.If you look at the pattern in the stochastic readings, it is similar to what we saw in early 2018. The stock was overbought, and then the stochastics dipped slightly before moving higher again. The indicators then completely rolled over and dropped all the way down to oversold territory at the end of March. The stock fell approximately 11% during this period. It is also worth noting that the rally from April 2017 through January 2018 is similar in length and percentage gain to the rally the stock has seen since December.Turning our attention to the sentiment indicators for Accenture, we see that the overall view of the stock is slightly more bearish than the average stock. There are 24 analysts covering the stock, with 15 “Buy” ratings, six “Hold” ratings, and three “Sell” ratings. This puts the buy percentage at 62.5%, and that is slightly below average and reflects less optimism toward the stock.The short interest ratio is currently at 3.9, and that is after there was a slight increase in short interest during the second half of August. This reading is slightly above average and indicates more bearish sentiment toward Accenture than the average stock.The put/call ratio for Accenture is currently at 1.44, with 35,374 puts open at this time and 24,494 calls open. This ratio is higher than the average stock and indicates more bearish sentiment. Not only is the ratio higher than average, it has increased significantly in the last three months. The put/call ratio was at 0.73 on June 26, and the company released third-quarter results on June 27.If I look at the overall picture for Accenture, there are some things that I like and some things I don’t like. The fundamentals are better than average with consistent earnings and revenue growth, and the REO is well above average.The overall sentiment picture suggests that investors and analysts are less bullish on Accenture than they are on the average stock. This is encouraging from a long-term view, as the bearish sentiment can shift to the bullish camp and that can help fuel a rally.My biggest concern at this time is the technical picture. The stock has rallied sharply since December and hasn’t really had much of a break in that rally - even in May when the overall market fell. The similarity in the rallies from 2017 and now is also a concern. I wouldn’t be surprised to see a modest pullback that brings the overbought/oversold indicators down closer to oversold levels.Accenture has beaten earnings estimates in each of the last eight quarters, and I am guessing the company will beat them again this quarter. Even with the earnings beats, that hasn’t led to moves higher each quarter. In fact, the stock has gapped lower after two of the last three earnings reports.Weighing everything, I am neutral on Accenture at this time. If the stock were to pull back a little and move close to the 52-week moving average, I would be more bullish. If that happened, the oscillators would likely be down close to oversold territory, and that would help me feel better about the stock as well."
4291114,95006,2019-09-12T02:27:55-04:00,"This analysis of Accenture stock uses a 10-year time frame and assumes a recession will occur at some point over that period.It projects expected returns from sentiment reversion-to-mean and business/shareholder yield based on the last economic cycle.It offers a buy, sell, hold suggestion and shares a strategy to take advantage of Accenture's current sentiment cycle.","SourceTraditionally, most of my analysis on Seeking Alpha has focused on how to avoid losses and how to profit from the price cycles of classic cyclical stocks. There is another group of stocks, however, whose stock prices and earnings fluctuate far less than the classic cyclical stocks I have traditionally written about. While these stocks aren't as cyclical as a ""classic cyclical,"" they can still be subject to large swings in sentiment and can go through what I call ""sentiment cycles."" Recently, I have been adopting some of the techniques I've used with classic cyclicals and applying them to sentiment-driven cyclicals. Today's stock is one of those.One of the major assumptions I make for both approaches is that history is the most reliable guide to the future. My experience has been that 80% of the time, even if we looked at nothing else, a stock will behave in a similar manner as it did the previous cycle or two unless there is a disruption to its core business. For this reason, I don't rely much on predictions of future earnings or sentiment that aren't supported by their existence during past cycles. That doesn't mean that ""this time is different"" isn't true sometimes - it just means that my analysis isn't counting on this time being much different. That said, if I think a stock is currently a ""Buy"" based on my 10-year, full-cycle analysis, before I invest I will examine the forward-looking trends and narratives more carefully to make sure there aren't major changes in the works that could affect the business.The main differences you'll find between my analysis and others' is that: 1) I focus on a clear 10-year time frame and the compound annual growth rate (aka CAGR) one might expect over that period of time; 2) I assume we will experience a recession during that time period, and I build that into the expected returns; 3) I try to calculate the expected returns based on a full business cycle; 4) I usually share both a basic shareholder return estimate and a more conservative shareholder return estimate, where I lower expected returns for companies with higher debt levels and raise them for companies with higher cash levels; and 5) I usually provide an ""opportunity risk/reward analysis"" if a stock is a ""Sell"" so that we can get an idea of how likely it is that the stock will trade low enough to become a ""Buy"" again over the next few years.As part of the analysis, I calculate what I consider to be the two main drivers of future total returns: Market Sentiment returns and Business/Shareholder returns. (Within the Business/Shareholder return category, I further break down where the future expected returns will likely come from: dividends, buybacks, business reinvestment, and earnings growth. This can help paint a clearer picture for investors who prefer to get their expected future earnings from one category or another.) I then combine the CAGR estimates from Market Sentiment and Business/Shareholder returns together to get an expected 10-year, full-cycle CAGR estimate. Currently, I consider an expected 10-year CAGR > 12% a ""Buy,"" 4-12% a ""Hold"" and < 4% a ""Sell.""With that, let's get into the analysis.Since I use different approaches for analyzing a stock based on how cyclical earnings are, historical earnings cyclicality is the first thing I like to examine. Let's take a look at Accenture's (ACN) historical earnings using a F.A.S.T. Graph, which is a great tool for this sort of analysis:I break down earnings cyclicality into five basic categories. The first category I call ""secular growth."" This category describes earnings that continue to rise every year even during economic recessions. The next three categories are ""low,"" ""moderate"" and ""deep."" ""Low"" is usually for businesses which have earnings that have a history of declining in the single digits percentage-wise during downturns but not much further than that. ""Deep"" I consider earnings that fall more than -50%, and ""moderate"" somewhere in between low and deep. And last but not least are businesses whose earnings go negative during cyclical downturns but recover soon after that, which I call ""highly cyclical."" For businesses that have earnings in the deep or highly cyclical categories, I use an entirely different type of analysis, so it's important to determine at the outset which category a stock falls into.During this 20 year period, Accenture only had a single year where EPS declined. That was during the heart of the Great Recession in 2009, when EPS fell -1%. So, for all intents and purposes, Accenture falls in the ""secular growth"" category, and on a scale of 1-8 I would rate its earnings cyclicality a ""1"".For stocks in the ""Secular Growth"" category, their price cycles are not usually explained by earnings fluctuations as much as they are explained by changes in market sentiment. In Accenture's case, with EPS this stable, it is appropriate to use a 10-year, full-cycle analysis (which focuses on market sentiment and earnings) rather than the shorter-term, price-cycle-based analysis (which focuses on historical price cyclicality). So, using a 10-year, full-cycle analysis is what I will do.In order to estimate what sort of returns we might expect over the next 10 years, let's begin by examining what return I could expect 10 years from now if the P/E multiple were to revert to its mean from the previous economic cycle. In order to estimate that, I'm going to shorten the time frame of the F.A.S.T. Graph so it starts about 2007, a little before the last cyclical peak.Accenture's current blended P/E is 26.49, while its normal P/E this past cycle has been 18.06. If, over the course of the next 10 years, the P/E were to revert to 18.06 and everything else was held equal, it would produce a 10-year CAGR of about -3.76%.There are four components to the business/shareholder yield: the dividend yield, the expected buyback yield, the portion of the earnings yield that the business keeps to reinvest itself, and the full-cycle earnings growth rate. Ultimately, the business/shareholder yield is going to be limited by the earnings yield or the FCFE/EV yield. So, let's take a look at those:Data by YChartsAccenture's basic forward earnings yield is 4.21%.Since I'm using historical EPS estimates from the F.A.S.T. Graphs for many of my calculations, I like to have a way to quickly check to see if a business is taking on debt (or already taken on debt) as a way to prop up those EPS numbers (often through stock buybacks). I like to look at free cash flow to equity/enterprise value yield in order to highlight potential problems. Looking at the longer-term chart typically also will show events like acquisitions, because there will often be a downward spike in the FCFE/EV yield. I tend to avoid stocks that have made bigger acquisitions or mergers and stocks that are borrowing money to buy back shares. So this is a good, quick check for me to know whether I need to dig deeper or not.Data by YChartsFCFE/EV yield is actually higher than the earnings yield as of the end of last quarter. This is probably because Accenture has no debt to speak of. I'll use both of these yields to get a range of expected earnings expectations.Next, let's see how earnings are being allocated by the company.Accenture's current dividend yield is 1.50%.Now let's see how much is being used for buybacks. This serves two purposes. The first is, much like the dividends, we want to know as investors how our money is being allocated. If the stock price of the business is low, then buybacks are a very efficient way of returning money to shareholders, especially if they are paid for with earnings instead of borrowed money. If the stock price is high, then buybacks are not a wise use of funds, because the returns might be lower than an investor might be able to get if they received a dividend and invested in something else or if the business invested in itself. The worst case is when a business is borrowing money to buy back expensive shares. Businesses that do this are to be avoided. It's a flashing warning sign that management's interests are not aligned with shareholders.Second, since I use long-term EPS trends in order to estimate earnings growth, I want to know how much stock was repurchased over the last cycle so that I can back out those stock repurchases when making my earnings growth estimates.Data by YChartsAccenture has reduced the number of shares outstanding by -18.05% this past cycle. I will back these share buybacks out of EPS growth estimates later in the analysis, but first I want to estimate how much shareholder yield we might expect from buybacks based on the most recent trends of 3 years and 1 year.Data by YChartsData by YChartsThey haven't really done much in the form of a buyback lately so I wouldn't expect much in the way of a buyback yield going forward.So, at its current price, Accenture is earning +4.21% and paying out +1.50% to shareholders all via the dividend, and there is 2.71% remaining for the company to invest in its business. Using the more optimistic FCFE/EV yield limits the long-term yield expectation to 5.60%, which means right now we can expect a business/shareholder yield range of +4.21% to +5.60%.Since I am interested in how much money Accenture might earn over the next 10 years, I also want to take into account any additional earnings from earnings growth that might occur over this time period. I'll estimate that by looking at the previous cycle which runs about 13 years from 2007 to 2020, and I'll remove the effects of stock buybacks. When I do the math on that, I get a cyclically adjusted earnings growth rate of +9.39%, which is very good.Now, what I want to do is apply that growth rate to current earnings looking forward 10 years to get a final 10-year CAGR estimate. The way I think about this is, if I bought Accenture's whole business for $100, it would pay me back $4.21-$5.60 per year, and that amount would grow at 9.39% per year for 10 years. I want to know how much money I would have in total at the end of 10 years on my $100 investment, which I calculate to be about $171.84 to $194.90, and that translates to a +5.56% to +6.90% 10-year CAGR.Potential future returns can come from two main places: market sentiment or business/shareholder returns. If we assume that market sentiment reverts to mean from the last cycle over the next 10 years, Accenture will produce a -3.76% CAGR. If the business/shareholder yield and growth are similar to the last cycle, Accenture should produce a +5.56% to +6.90% 10-year CAGR. If we put the two together, we get an expected full-cycle, 10-year CAGR of +1.80% to +3.14%. This range falls entirely below the 4% threshold I use for a Sell rating, so Accenture is currently a ""Sell.""Since I think Accenture is a good business and that it is simply priced too high, it's worth looking at the odds of the price falling to a level where we could buy it back if we sell, versus what we might miss out on by rotating out of the stock at today's prices.The first step of this process is to see during how many years in the past 20 did Accenture traded below its long-term average P/E of 18.06. At some point during each year in 13 out of the past 20 the stock traded below an 18.06 P/E and you would have had a chance to buy the stock below its average P/E. The last opportunity would have been in 2014. So, it doesn't seem unreasonable to me to think that during the next economic slowdown, Accenture's P/E will fall at least to that level (during the Great Recession, the P/E fell below 11). If the company's P/E contracts from its current multiple of 26.49 to 18.06 while earnings are held steady, the price would drop about -31%.In order to estimate the opportunity risk/reward, I use F.A.S.T. Graphs' forecasting tool to estimate future price appreciation, including dividends, for the next 2-3 years using analysts' estimates. Then, I assume we will have an economic slowdown after that point. What I want to know is if a recession begins in 2-3 years, whether I will have a reasonable chance to buy the stock at a significantly lower price than it trades today or if I would likely never get a chance at a lower price.Forecasting out toward the middle of 2022, including dividends, we can expect to add $76.78 to Accenture's current price. That gives us a price 3 years from now of $271.61 using today's 26.49 P/E ratio. If the stock price at that point reverts to its mean, it would lose about -31% of its value and produce a price of $187.41. That is a little bit lower than today's price, so there doesn't seem to be much opportunity risk in selling at today's price if we experience an economic slowdown within the next 3 years. Obviously, if an economic slowdown were to occur sooner than that, the stock would fall much lower before reaching its mean P/E, and if the price didn't fall until after 3 years time, it might not come back down to these levels again without a serious recession.I am currently writing a series about high-quality businesses that are overvalued, like Accenture. You can read about the strategy in these three articles: Part 1 ""Ignore Sentiment Cycles At Your Own Risk,"" Part 2 ""Mitigating Sentiment Cycles"" and Part 3 ""Sentiment Cycles: When To Sell And When To Buy Back Again.""My current suggestion is that owners of Accenture who would like to avoid part of the eventual correction in the stock rotate out of it and into a 50/50 mix of the Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV) and the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) until Accenture's price falls to a more reasonable level that offers better forward returns. My expectation is that owners would be able to increase the number of Accenture shares they own by 20-25% using this strategy without spending any additional money. (To see how this strategy works, read the three articles linked above.)I will track how this idea performs each month going forward, along with over a dozen other high-quality, overvalued stocks I have written about this year.

As many have learned the hard way, however, sometimes cutting edge talk is supported by the numbers, and sometimes, it’s just talk. With Accenture, the combination of old-time classic fundamentals and technical stock characteristics combine to look good, enough so to suggest this outfit is for real. © Can Stock Photo / pressmasterI rely heavily on stock screening to narrow my focus from the big unwieldy market to a small number of stocks for which there are objective indications that they are particularly worthy of attention. Accenture appeared recently in the Chaikin Analytics Bullish Swing Trade screen, which identifies stocks with strong technical and fundamental profiles that present as being short-term “oversold.” Though the name of the screen may conjure images of a quick in-and-out trade, my testing of the screen suggests it presents well even if we assume three-month holding periods.Accenture’s basic businesses are hardly new. Management consulting, those so-called outside experts called in to supposedly help senior executives figure out what they should be doing and how they should be doing it, is an age-old activity well known not just to the brass that cuts the checks for the billable hours but also to the rank-and-file who leerily eye the suits and wonder what sort of trouble they’re cooking up. Outsourcing, meanwhile, is now so well established as to have become a Hollywood theme and, lately, inspiration for a political crusade.But rather than sticking around within the business landscape, these endeavors may actually be moving the forefront, as the still-emerging digitization-automation-robotization of just about everything is pulling us into an economic (and societal) transformation no less and possibly more profound than the industrial revolution. Discussion of the socio-political ramifications of all this is for other forums. As to the investment implications, there are many choices such as ETFs dedicated to this theme (see e.g., the Ark Invest innovation-ETFs product line and many others that pursue the same theme, the multitude of shares of companies offering relevant products and services, and even pre-packaged equity portfolios offered by outfits such as Motif Investing).For those interested in individual stocks, as the focus of a stake in this area and/or as a supplement to positions taken via ETFs, Accenture stands out for the way it has its fingers in so many aspects of all this.Here are examples of such activities, as quoted from the transcript of Accenture’s 6/27/19 earnings call:As interesting as such anecdotal tidbits are, the reality is that they’re just three drops in a nearly $43 billion (in annual revenue) bucket. On what basis might we infer that matters such as these are sufficiently representative of the entire company, or at least the growing parts of it, to warrant accepting a bullish investment case? There can never be a precise answer when we deal, as we must, with the unknowable future. But strong inferences can be drawn from historical fundamental numbers as well as additional data-points consistent with favorable assumptions regarding the future on the part of market participants based on quantitative and qualitative evidence.Figure 1Figure 1 depicts as positive a profile as we’re likely to see. Using our traditional bottom-up reading of the chart, we note:Figure 2, the Chaikin checklist for this stock, which provides a quick summary of the presentation’s salient features, is firing on all cylinders except for overbought/oversold, the short-term oscillator that suggests the stock has started the process of edging its way out of its oversold status.Figure 2Figure 3, a 5-year view, of the presentation shows that the Power Gauge has not been bearish during the period and that prolonged intervals of a bullish rank, a bullish personality and bullish money flow, such as what we now have, have been accompanied by strength in the stock. In other words, the present situation is not an aberration but an often-recurring phenomenon.Figure 3Being a 20-factor ranking system, Power Gauge provides latitude for stocks/companies to look bad, sometimes very bad, in some respects but exhibit enough strength in certain key respects to pull the overall rank up into bullish territory. This is an important feature since perfection, situations that look good in all respects, are hardly ever, if ever, seen in the real world. We’re always balancing pros and cons.Figures 4, 5, 6, and 7 below show, however, that Accenture asks very little from us in the way of compromise, less at least than many other situations we’re likely to encounter.Starting with Earnings, we see that this category, based entirely on historical data, is the weakest area, relatively speaking. It’s not by any means bad relative to the investment universe; it’s neutral. But what we’ve seen thus far might have suggested we should expect more.Figure 4Actually, though, I’m fine with this being the weakest area (again, I’m speaking in relative terms). The Street has an unfortunate and often financially-damaging (to investors) habit of assuming that visible growth rates will persist indefinitely. The truth is very different. Growth rates accelerate and decelerate all the time (if you took calculus, think less about growth rates and more about the first derivative of the growth rate function). Super-strong growth is much more likely to falter. I tend to prefer buying into growth rates that have more room to accelerate going forward (the digitization story) particularly when, as here, the Earnings Surprise rank is no less than neutral (suggesting management, when it guides analysts, has a realistic picture of what’s going on out in the field) and when the company is maxing out on the Earnings Consistency rank.Table 1 provides more color on the growth picture. Revenue growth, as noted, has so far been okay. But even to this point, where “The New” is still in the process of kicking in, we see earnings as having grown more quickly as the company improved margins.Table 1I’m particularly impressed by the extreme bullish ranks for Return on Equity and Long-Term debt, both of which are in the Financials category.Figure 5Return on Equity is the penultimate measure of company quality combining margin, turnover and debt leverage.Accenture’s Return on Equity Score is top of the line. Table 2 shows how extreme (in a good way) Accenture is in this regard.Table 2Returns combine turnover and margin. We see here that Accenture is fine in both respects. (Don’t get too carried away with the gross margin comparisons.) Companies vary in terms of how they categorize expense items that could arguably be deemed “cost of goods sold” or “selling, general & administrative expenses.” Differences impact gross margin comps, but by the time we get down to operating margins, the differences are washed away and the comps are apples-to-apples.Normally, we would be concerned about trailing-12-month figures that are below 5-year averages; a deceleration. But the numbers are not normal. They are way, way above normal. In such cases, deceleration is to be expected. Accenture’s returns have a long way to go before we need to worry about them becoming unspectacular.Anyway, the strong returns are not just a matter of bragging rights. Return on Equity is an important indicator of the company’s ability to generate growth in the future; it gets a lot of bang for every buck it reinvests.It’s worth noting that some of this reflects share repurchases that reduce equity (the denominator of the income divided by equity return-on-equity equation). The company pays dividends, too, so a lot of excess cash flow is being given to shareholders. Note, though, from Table 5b, that funds for repurchasing are not coming from new debt (in other words, the company is not getting fancy or aggressive with its balance sheet).Hence the top-position for the Long-Term Debt score.Figures 6 and 7 reflect the behavior of key investment-community constituencies and the market itself.Figure 6Figure 7The Analyst Rating score is interesting. It’s actually a contrary indicator. The top score here reflects not a tendency of analysts to fall all over themselves pushing out Strong Buy ratings. It’s the opposite. Analysts have plenty of room to raise ratings and produce the impact such events often produce; mark a high point in the stock’s trajectory.But with a good estimate revision trend and a strong industry group (being a lone wolf is romantic in many aspects of life, but on Wall Street, the best stocks often run with a big posse in the form of comparably strong peers), it’s not hard to envision analysts finding reasons to boost ratings in the future and, hence, motivate potential buyers to take our shares later on, when we’re done with them.Meanwhile, the Technicals are fine.Let’s conclude by considering whether, as often happens, potential good news is already baked into the stock in the form of exorbitant valuation ratings.Amazingly, though, Power Gauge presents no bearish valuation components:Table 3 adds further context.Table 3* Click here for more on the P=V+N (Price - Value + Noise) framework.It reminds us that neutral Power Gauge value-related metrics aren’t subtle code words for bearish. In contrast to Wall Street culture, where a “Hold” analyst rating is often a coded “Sell” message, here, “Neutral” really and truly means “Neutral.” It’s hard to justify running in fright from a price/sales ratio, for example, that is not extreme relative to the S&P 500 median. While the P/E ratios are above those of S&P 500 stocks, they are in line with Industry norms. P/B, the most extreme ratio, was addressed above and in our overall rating, the near-bearish score it gets is overwhelmed by strong scores in the more-growth-oriented factors.So on the whole, Accenture, despite gains the stock has achieved to date, shapes up as a worthwhile play on the ongoing, and likely to accelerate, digitization of our economy, and it’s available at an acceptable valuation."
4255939,105197,2019-04-23T12:17:00-04:00,"Accenture represents a play on outsourced strategy and technology services.While large scale outsourcing firms have grown into becoming major consulting players, Accenture’s presence on the strategic side of the business gives the company an edge.If the company can continue its ruthless execution despite the loss of its long-standing leader, Accenture is one stock to hold for a long time.","Accenture (ACN) continues to reinvent itself in a market constrained by cost and pricing pressures. Not only has the company been able to successfully integrate many of its acquisitions over time, but also seems to be positioning itself well for the next wave of digital adoption. Considering the long operating history of the company, Accenture comes across as a gem of a stock.Understanding Accenture's businessAs per the company’s SEC filings, Accenture’s revenues can be attributed to five major verticals and businesses. These can be further classified into outsourcing and consulting:Communications, financial services and products make for the bulk of the company’s revenue by division. In terms of offerings, consulting revenues have been becoming a larger part of the overall business.Owing to the management philosophy of exiting lower margin commodity businesses to keep itself competitive, the company has been investing in the higher margin, cognitive solutions space:Source: Accenture Earnings CallWhat is noteworthy about Accenture is that the company has been remarkably successful at integrating multiple acquisitions and the company has an appetite for a lot more. After spending nearly half a billion on 15 deals so far in 2019, the company still expects to invest another billion dollars on acquiring companies in the second half. One aspect that has helped Accenture scale with its inorganic strategy is how the company’s offerings are structured.In an industry (technology outsourcing) where competitive price and cost pressures are normal, in addition to Accenture’s approach of leveraging expertise across business units, Accenture’s leadership position across many of its operating segments has helped the company sustain margins.Through its presence across consulting and technology, Accenture has been able to make its razor blade model sustainable. As technology helps in heavy lifting, the consulting side of the business is able to focus on coming up with creative analysis and solutions based on information.In order to strengthen its technology platform, the company has been making multiple acquisitions and integrating them successfully. What further seems to be strengthening Accenture’s position is its ability to sustainably generate demand.Source: Company’s SEC filingsIn addition to a strong pipeline, the stability in the company’s operating segments is an important contributor to Accenture’s underlying strength. Despite the weakness in financial services and public services business, the management believes the second half should see a rebound in financial services on the back of bookings visibility. On the public service business, Accenture remains confident around the natural cyclicality in contracts winding down and segment business recovery in second half 2019. In fact, in 2Q19,management had upped its guidance for its full-year revenue growth from 6-8% to 6.5-8.5%. and expected EPS range from $7.01-$7.25 to $7.18-$7.32.Over the last few months, Accenture has been making a few strides that look like small incremental moves along the lines of the company’s business philosophy to stay in the higher value end of offerings.Expansion of Relationship with Google CloudIn April 2019, Accenture and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) announced the expansion of the scope of the erstwhile Accenture Google Cloud Business Group to include:Source: Accenture Press ReleaseWhile technology service providers are known to align themselves with large public cloud providers to help channel sales and thus benefiting both parties, this announcement has a few unique aspects to it:Source: GartnerAccenture also has been recognized as a leader in CRM and customer experience implementation services, public cloud infrastructure professional and managed services and data center outsourcing and hybrid infrastructure managed services (for North America and for Europe also).On the face of it, Accenture appears to be a market-leading outsourcing vendor. However, Accenture also might have captured a large part of the ancillary solutions around the hybrid cloud and user experience market, where Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) have been known to be leaders.Source: GartnerMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Adobe had formed the open data initiative with an objective to increase the level of insights by increasing data fluidity across applications and platforms of the three companies (Adobe Experience Cloud, Adobe Experience Platform, Microsoft Dynamics 365, SAP C/4HANA and S/4HANA). The notable aspect of this partnership is each company's intent in this partnership. While the common data model will be based on Azure, the access to data will feed into Adobe's experience cloud and also will help increase SAP's share of transactions (which was 77%). The nature of this partnership points toward the growing importance of user experience and the role of analytics, and the consequent investments large software majors are making toward this phenomenon.Interestingly, Accenture now services the entire cloud-driven user experience space. Although it's questionable if a services company can offer a more software-oriented product, Accenture’s recent acquisition of the French Google Cloud specialist Cirruseo points toward the company’s sustained investment in its relationship with a large and fast-growing public provider.Given that Saleforce.com has an existing relationship with Google cloud and the fact that many people view the open data initiative as a competitive challenge to Salesforce.com, Accenture is likely to greatly benefit from the knowledge Accenture shall be able to accumulate on account of these market dynamics.Entry into Custom Client ApplicationsDuring the second quarter call, Accenture’s management made the following comments:Source: Accenture Earnings CallThis level of investment and focus from Accenture on custom development is a marked shift from the standardized, scalable solutions that the company and the market had been focusing on for a while. Accenture devoting more than 5% of its workforce (the company had 477k employees at the end of Feb 2019) toward an almost lost cause may not be a complete surprise though. Considering that Accenture has a strong handle across the cloud to digital experience (including creative) value chain, custom development may be the company’s next step toward entering the hybrid cloud market from unexpected dimensions (marketing and experience). While the lure of the trillion-dollar hybrid cloud market already has been causing public cloud vendors to align themselves with hybrid specialists to drive growth, Accenture’s service first solutions may just make it a preferred vendor for a large number of influential players. Not only can this move catapult Accenture into the league of large hybrid cloud vendors such as VMware (NYSE:VMW), Red Hat (NYSE:RHT) and Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX), but can also cause a re-rating in the stock’s multiples.As a point of reference, the leaders in the hybrid cloud space trade at price to sales multiples of 6-10x vs. the sub 3x for Accenture.Accenture has shown stable growth on the back of strong operating relationships and ability to grow inorganically. The company’s consulting business has become a potent tip of the spear that helps to get Accenture more than a foot in the door. Coupled with the company’s focus and delivery through digital, the Accenture stock may have strong upside potential.Evidently, Accenture is much larger than its peers and has been witnessing an uptick in growth. Despite these factors, the price to sales for the company has been around the average mark.In light of the strengths highlighted, a multiple of 3x is not particularly expensive (hybrid cloud leaders trade at two to three times higher than that of Accenture). Taking into account an expected 2019 sales figure of 43.5 billion and applying a price-to-sales multiple of 3x, the estimated market cap comes to $130 billion or $205 per share (or a 15% upside from current levels of $180). Given the track record of the company and the strategic upside possible, it should not be surprising should the company eclipse the $200 mark pretty soon.Unless the market witnesses any unforeseen events, Accenture looks to be a pretty solid bet."
4251354,20715,2019-03-27T14:18:35-04:00,Accenture is set to announce fiscal second quarter earnings on Thursday morning.The fundamentals are slightly above average and the sentiment indicators are average.The stock is in a long-term upward trend and could become attractive on a pullback.,"Consulting firm Accenture (ACN) is scheduled to release fiscal 2019 second quarter results on Thursday morning and analysts expect the company to earn $1.57 per share on revenue of $10.3 billion. The company has beaten earnings forecast in each of the last eight quarterly reports, but the reactions to the earnings reports have been mixed in recent quarters.Over the last three years, Accenture has seen its earnings grow by 12% per year. The EPS grew by 9% in the first quarter, but if the current estimate is accurate, it would mean a decline of $0.01 for the second quarter. Analysts do expect earnings to grow by 7% for 2019.Sales have increased at a rate of 8% per year over the last three years and they grew by 7% in the first quarter. The expectations for the second quarter are for sales growth of 7.4% on a year-over-year basis.Accenture’s management efficiency measurements are a little mixed. The return on equity of 42.2% is well above average, but the profit margin is at 14% and that is in the average range. It is worth noting that the company doesn’t have any long-term debt and that should help the company should the global economy go into a recession.Overall, the fundamental picture for Accenture is pretty good, but not great. The earnings growth is above average, but not in the top quartile according to Investor’s Business Daily’s rating system. Sales growth is modest, but the management efficiency ROE is well above average.From a technical perspective, Accenture has been methodically moving higher since the end of the bear market in 2009. The stock was trading between $20 and $25 in March 2009 and it moved all the way up to $174 in September. The stock did fall in the fourth quarter, but very few stocks didn’t fall in the quarter.The stock moved back above its 104-week moving average back in September 2009. After that, it really only challenged the trend line one time since until it moved below the 104-week in December. It was at the low in December that the stock hit the lower rail of the trend channel for the first time since early 2016.After hitting the lower rail of the channel in December, the stock has rallied back by almost 25%. That is in line with the overall market. The stock has rallied back enough that the weekly stochastic readings have moved from oversold territory to overbought territory.The chart I drew is a little different from what I usually draw. The lower rail was formed by the lows in October ’14, August ’15, and February ’16. The middle line you see on the chart was the upper rail in 2015 and 2016, but now it looks more like a median between the upper rail and the lower rail. This isn’t a calculated median, just a line I drew freehand that happens to fall almost exactly between the upper and lower rails.From a technical perspective, I would say that Accenture is well above average. According to IBD’s Relative Strength rating, the stock is in the top quartile in terms of price performance over the past year. The stock has tracked the overall market pretty closely, but there has been a slight outperformance since the first of the year.The best way to describe the sentiment toward Accenture is “average.” There are 29 analysts following the stock. Of those 29 analysts, 16 have the stock rated as a “buy,” 12 have it rated as a “hold,” and one has it rated as a “sell.” If you are familiar with my articles, you know that most stocks with decent fundamentals have between 65% and 75% of total ratings fall in the buy category. In this case, only 55% of analysts have the stock rated as a buy, so that is a little below average.The short interest ratio is currently at 2.63. There are 5.3 million shares sold short and that is up from 5.1 million shares at the end of February when the ratio was at 3.01. This means that the number of shares sold short went up, but the short interest ratio fell due to an increase in the average daily trading volume. Either way, both the 2.63 and 3.01 readings are in the average range.This shouldn’t come as a surprise at this point, but the put/call ratio is currently at 0.67 and that is in the average range as well. There are 14,485 puts open and 21,572 calls open at this time. The ratio was up near the 1.0 mark back in December when the company announced earnings last, so the ratio has fallen over the last few months.With above-average fundamentals, above-average technical performance, and average sentiment readings - I look for Accenture to move up and down with the market. I don’t see much of an opportunity for a short-term trade around earnings. As I mentioned earlier, the company has beaten earnings estimates in each of the last eight quarters. But that hasn’t always led to the stock moving higher.Looking specifically at the last two earnings reports, back in September, the stock moved up for a few days after the report, but then fell in October. But that was when the market was selling off in October. The stock fell for a few days after the earnings report in December and that was in the midst of the selloff in the overall market. The stock turned higher after the Christmas selloff, but that is what the market did as well.I certainly wouldn’t rate the stock as a sell, but it is hard to rate the stock as a buy with average to slightly above average in most categories. The company is solid and I don’t expect any big surprises from the earnings report.Accenture is the type of stock that you don’t mind having in your portfolio, but I would prefer to buy it at a better entry price. If it were to move down close to the lower rail or the 104-week moving average, I would consider buying it. Right now, the stock is above the “median” on the chart and the weekly stochastic readings are in overbought territory.I like the company, I just don’t think this is the most optimum time to buy the stock."

ACN is an the forefront of integrating these and related cutting-edge technologies into the fabric of businesses.Please see the 10-K, which provides much more granular detail about ACN's specific business lines and diverse types of clients.ACN recently announced the following for Q2 (ended Feb. 28):It's virtually all good news right now for ACN despite a slowing global economy.ACN is growing in all its geographic regions and in almost all of its several business segments. Growth is largely organic, supplemented with many small bolt-on acquisitions and an occasional larger deal. I thought that the most relevant part of the forecast made on the conference call was (emphasis added):ACN reports using US GAAP. Exactly how the ratio of FCF to earnings will trend down is not clear to me at this point.ACN has a high earnings quality, as it carry almost no debt, and has a normal tax rate around 23%.Consensus EPS (per ETrade) for the 12 months through November 2019 is about $7.40. Adjusting for the extra month and for ACN's propensity to beat consensus almost every quarter the past 3 years, I'll call this year's estimate $7.50, or 23.3X at Tuesday's close around $175. That puts ACN at about a 27% premium to consensus GAAP 2019 EPS of about $155 for the S&P 500 (SPY), of which ACN is a member. However, on a FCF basis, ACN is around 20X, which I think is lower than the price:FCF ratio for the SPY.I think of ACN as better than a bond, because it is reasonably safe (no guarantees, though), and probably providing alpha relative to the SPY over time, as well. Here's a quick walk through both thought processes.Morningstar finds ACN overvalued, as its analysts think a 6% FCF yield rather than 5% represents fair value. In that same report (available on ETrade), it points out that ""99 of the company’s top 100 clients (by revenue) have been with the firm for at least five years, and 97 have been with the firm for at least 10 years."" This is wide-moat stuff.I wonder about fair value in today's interest rate environment. ACN has strong tailwinds for many years, as the ongoing tech revolution has far to run; and it takes many years to integrate new technology into business practices even if and when that technology matures. What is the 'right' market premium for this debt-free company generating very high FCF, with 80 of Fortune's Global 500 companies as clients, and with very high customer retention rates?In a different interest rate and global growth environment, with similar high single digit growth for such a company, I would expect a higher FCF yield and lower P/E. But as matters stand in the economic world, I see ACN as attractive: its current 4% cash-on-cash return is already higher than a high-grade 20-year corporate bond. The retained FCF of course has value.This suggests a 10% FCF yield in 10 years and about an 8% cash-on-cash return (dividends and buybacks) in that time frame. Then, at least, ACN should be able to continue to grow at some rate for years to come, thus beating an investment grade 10-20 year bond handily.Of course, one can do the above for any 20X or 25X P/E name, or a low P/E stock. But most of other either have one, or more, of the following vulnerabilities:In contrast, I see ACN as elite and well-insulated against shocks to disturb its controlled, moderately high growth path.ACN's operating margins of 14% do not attract fast buck operators. While there are economic ups and downs, the digitalization of business is a secular trend, and the complexities are mind-numbing. A trusted, knowledgeable ACN has almost infinite growth possibilities, even in a recession.In a boom, ACN will not boom as fast as many little guys, but in the economy we have had since 2007, I think its defensive/growth characteristics, centered in high tech, suggest alpha ahead for patient investors.Next:ACN has shown (modest) positive relative strength versus the SPY and versus a proxy for tech stocks (QQQ) since last fall's market peak:Data by YChartsThat it achieved this despite the death of the CEO is a positive. The only negative is the typical period of digestion after a break-out to new highs.In conjunction with the first chart shown above, I give ACN an above-average technical rating. It is a long term outperformer that is leading a fresh bull market.Please see regulatory filings for ACN's disclosure of the many risks to its stock.I would target P/E compression as a trading risk, especially versus many tech stocks that are at a low ebb. ACN could suffer in relative terms if, for example, a resolution of the trade issues with China is announced soon; ACN does little business there. Other than the obvious ones of recession or unexpectedly tough competition from any number of peers, I am not focused on any one or two fundamental risks to ACN's business.ACN strikes me as a good exemplar of the Warren Buffett dictum to buy and hold shares of superior companies at a fair price rather than bargain-hunting amongst mediocre companies. A global slowdown, which remains in train, with central banks still fighting ""the last war"" in my opinion (i.e., inflation), leads me to emphasize quality in my stocks at this juncture. Thus, I see ACN as timely for those two reasons.Technically, I like ACN's price action, understanding that a period of digestion often follows a breakout.It is my understanding that beginning with fiscal 2020, ACN will move from twice-yearly to quarterly dividends, which should enhance its appeal to many investors.My goal is long term capital appreciation, and secondarily dividend growth. Given my view that ACN has well below-average risk versus other stocks, I would be happy with 10-12% average annual total returns on a long term basis. I view ACN as a conservative stock suitable to replace bonds in my portfolio, with the hope that compounded growth will more than justify its premium valuation.Thanks for reading and sharing any thoughts you wish to contribute.Submitted Tuesday night. I will be on the road Wednesday and will respond to comments as soon as possible."
4275202,79675,2019-07-16T11:49:37-04:00,"Accenture's new CEO, Ms. Julie Sweet, will take over a company that is already well-positioned for the future. Simply put, she will start the game with a pretty sweet hand.The company's industry is projected to grow materially over the next 5 plus years and, in my opinion, Accenture will be one of the direct beneficiaries.I hold a position in Accenture and I plan to stay long the stock.","Accenture (ACN) announced that its board approved the appointment of Ms. Julie Sweet as the company's next CEO, effective September 1, 2019. Ms. Sweet has been apart of Accenture's senior leadership team for over a decade and she currently serves as the North American CEO.Ms. Sweet has an extremely impressive background but, to be honest, no one truly knows how this appointment will play out for the company or its shareholders. However, what I do know is that Accenture has great long-term business prospects and that the company is already well-positioned for the future. Therefore, I believe that the new CEO will start the game with pretty sweet hand (see what I did there?).It would be an understatement to say that Accenture has promising long-term business prospects. To me, it is hard to find another technology consulting company (or company in general) that is as well-positioned as Accenture currently is. As I previously described here, Accenture is benefiting from operating in an industry that is experiencing significant growth. For example, the Internet of Things, or IoT, predictions all seem to project for the significant growth for the connected world to continue for years to come.Source: GartnerAs shown, Gartner predicts that almost all new tech products (95%) will contain some type of IoT component by 2020. Furthermore, to put a dollar figure to the predictions, McKinsey & Company expects for IoT technology services to have a CAGR of 17% over the next five years and to reach $143B in spending by 2021.Source: McKinsey & CompanyAnd let's not forget that Accenture is already viewed as the go-to service provider in the IoT space. Moreover, this promising backdrop is only just getting started and, in my opinion, these estimates may actually turn out to be too conservative.To this point, Accenture has been able to put up some strong operating results over the last few years.Source: Data from 2018 10-K; table created by authorA company with its top- and bottom-line up in excess of 30% over the last five years is impressive. Simply put, Accenture is in a sweet spot and the company's business should continue to be greatly impacted by several strong tailwinds that seem to be speeding up instead of slowing down. What's not to like?It also helps the bull case that Accenture's recent operating results support the long-term story for this company.On June 27, 2019, Accenture reported Q3 2019 adjusted EPS of $1.93 (beat by $0.04) on revenue of $11.1B (beat by $70M). These quarterly results also compare favorably to the year-ago quarter.Source: Q3 2019 InfographicOther highlights from the quarter:There was lot to like about Accenture's Q3 2019 results and it is important to note that the 2019 YTD results were just as good (actually better).Source: Q3 2019 InfographicAccenture has one of the strongest growth profiles that I can think of, especially in the tech consulting field. The company is well-positioned for the future and I believe that the story is just now starting to play out.Where the stock currently trades is one of the few concerns that I have when it comes to my investment in Accenture. ACN shares are trading at the top of the range based on its own historical metrics.Data by YChartsOn the other hand, the stock is reasonably priced when factoring in the company's industry.Source: FidelityAt the end of the day, ACN shares do look expensive at 27x earnings but I believe that this company has the potential to more than grow into its current valuation. Plus, as I previously described, this company deserves to trade at a premium valuation. And lastly, let's remember that Accenture is in a pretty sweet spot and the company has several significant catalysts in place that have the potential to create a tremendous amount of shareholder value.Accenture is highly levered to the digital space, so any major disruption to the New would significantly impact the company's business prospects.Additionally, reputation risk is an important consideration because Accenture is the go-to consultant in its industry. Specifically, ACN shares are trading at a premium to its peers (and the market), so a negative shift in investor sentiment would materially impact the company's stock price.Lastly, Accenture has a new leader and it is not a given that Ms. Sweet will be able to keep this company from veering off of its current path (a path that has the potential to create significant value for its shareholders).No one knows if Ms. Sweet is the right choice or not but it is hard denying the fact that Accenture is already firing on all cylinders. Additionally, the market conditions for Accenture continue to improve so this should bode well for the company (and its shareholders) over the next five plus years.The company has plans to return a material amount of capital to shareholders over the next few years, and management believes that the growth for The New (i.e., Accenture's key growth driver) is still in the early innings. As such, investors with a time horizon longer than two-to-three years should consider any significant pullbacks as buying opportunities.Author's Note: I hold an Accenture position in the R.I.P. Portfolio, and I have no plans to reduce my stake in the near future."
4238548,104958,2019-02-06T08:43:31-05:00,Accenture has a solid history of earnings growth with more growth forecast for 2020.The company's management is actively seeking out new markets to boost its future growth.Accenture has a sound business model and focuses on both organic growth and acquisitions.,"Accenture plc (ACN) provides technological consulting services to large organizations around the globe. The company has a solid history of growth which is expected to continue through to 2020.Accenture is well managed with a sound business model that focuses on both organic growth and acquiring their competition (whenever economically viable). Accenture's business model may also provide some earnings shielding during periods of economic weakness.The stock is somewhat expensive but most good growth stocks are expensive; as investors are happy to pay for future earnings growth. In my opinion, Accenture would make a sound investment with future capital gains potential.Accenture has reported financial results for the first quarter ending November 2018 (data from Seeking Alpha and Yahoo). Note: Accenture's financial year starts in September.The company's revenue was up 5.5 percent and its earnings were up 9.5 percent from the same quarter last year. Over the last five years, Accenture's revenue has grown 6.9 percent per year and its earnings have increased by 9.3 percent per year.The return on equity is high at 38 percent and the profit margin (profit to revenue ratio) is decent at 10 percent.The asset ratio (total liabilities to total assets) is 51 percent which means that Accenture's total debt is only 51 percent of the value of everything the company owns (note that the asset value is the book value and not the liquidated value of its assets).The company's book value is currently around $20 and with a stock price of $156, Accenture is trading at 7.9x book value.The analysts' consensus forecast is for revenue to increase by 3.1 percent in 2019 and increase by 6.8 percent in 2020. Earnings are forecast to increase by 11.9 percent in 2019 and increase by 9.1 percent in 2020. The 2019 PE ratio is 22x and the 2020 PE ratio is 20x.Accenture has a solid history of growth which is expected to continue through to 2020.Pierre Nanterme, Chairman & CEO stated in Accenture's Conference Call:Pierre Nanterme further stated that with the disciplined execution of Accenture's growth strategy, he remains confident in Accenture's ability to continue gaining market share, driving profitable growth, and delivering value for our clients.This indicates to me that Accenture will make every effort to continue its earnings growth into the future.Accenture is a leading globally focused company based in Ireland and listed on the NYSE. Accenture is essentially a technology consulting firm and works as a go-between for business and technology with the main goal of increasing productivity for their clients.Accenture has a diverse range of businesses it services and it's actively seeking out new technological based businesses to serve. As an example of Accenture's diversity, the company has formed a partnership with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). There are many businesses that are unfamiliar with the cloud technology offered by Google. The technology is vague and businesses tend to avoid what they don't understand. This is where a technology consulting firm like Accenture comes into play.I think it was a smart business move by both Accenture and Google to form a partnership. The benefit to Google is that they receive Accenture's consulting experience for their potential cloud clients. The benefit to Accenture is that they get a slice of Google's earnings. I think that Accenture figured out that there was more money in forming a partnership than there was in charging a consulting fee. As for Google, I think they were happy simply to receive Accenture's technology consulting services to use to help them secure clients for their cloud services. It's a partnership that benefits both parties.I like that Accenture is actively seeking out new markets to continue its growth into the future. The company has grown to quite a large organization with a market cap of around $100 billion and 469,000 full-time employees worldwide.A common fate of large organizations is that they find it more challenging to maintain high earnings growth rates. The all too common tendency is for growth to slow. Accenture appears to be aware of this as they are actively seeking out new markets and at the same time reducing their competition by acquiring their competitors (at least the smaller companies).Accenture has bought 70 companies over the last three years. As stated in the Shareholder Letter, in the 2018 fiscal year, Accenture spent $658 million on acquisitions which included Mackevision in Germany, Meredith Xcelerated Marketing in the United States, HO Communication in China, and Altima in France. Accenture also completed several acquisitions that included US-based Pillar Technology and Kogentix.Buying out their competition is a smart business strategy. The main benefit is the reduction of price wars which naturally arise when organizations sell products or need to quote on contracts (such as for consulting firms). The other benefit with acquisitions is that Accenture effectively acquires the skills of their competitors' employees without having to pouch them.In my opinion, the business model of combining organic growth (by seeking out new markets to expand into) along with buying out and merging the competition into Accenture's business structure provides a good mix to help secure its future growth.Another aspect of Accenture's business model that I like is that the company operates with little in the way of capital spending and no Research and Development costs. It's Property Plant and Equipment is only 5 percent of its total asset value and Accenture carries no inventory on its balance sheet.While Accenture is a technology company that deals with technology, unlike other technology companies that develop technology Accenture merely acts as a go-between. This means that Accenture effectively avoids all the Research and Development costs that go with technology companies.Accenture's business model builds long-term relationships with their clients. As stated in their shareholder letter, Accenture serves more than three-quarters of the FORTUNE Global 500 and 92 of the top 100. Accenture continues to build strong, long-term relationships with their clients (97 of their top 100 clients have been with Accenture for at least 10 years).This to me indicates brand loyalty and as such gives Accenture pricing power. This would help bolster its earnings during periods of economic weakness. During a weak economy, it's not unusual to see businesses reduce their prices in order to maintain market share.Being a large organization, Accenture has the financial and employee resources to take on large projects from large global organizations worldwide. These large organizations are a more reliable source of future revenue than the smaller organizations. Large organizations typically have generous budgets (with money to spend on consulting) while the smaller organizations typically have small budgets. Also, large organizations (with their generous cash flows) tend to be reliable payers whereas the smaller organizations tend to be cash strapped and payments can be unreliable.This puts Accenture in a good financial position as any due payments will almost certainly be paid by these large organizations. Add to this that most of Accenture's clients are long-term loyal clients; this further secures Accenture's revenue over the foreseeable future.Accenture's revenue has increased 6.9 percent per year and earnings increased 9.3 percent per year over the last five years. This shows that Accenture is a growth stock and the PEG (PE divided by the earnings growth rate) is an appropriate method for valuing growth stocks.The forward annual earnings growth using forecast data is 9.1 percent for 2020. Using the slightly lower 2020 annual earnings growth of 9.1 percent will lead to a more conservative valuation and is more appropriate as it is forward-looking rather than using the historical rate.With a 9.1 percent earnings growth rate into 2020, this gives a forward PEG of 2.2 with a 2020 PE multiple of 20x.A forward PEG of 2.2 means that Accenture is overvalued with a current stock price of $156. It is commonly accepted that a stock is fairly valued when its forward PEG is 1.0 which gives Accenture a fair value stock price of around $72.While Accenture is overvalued, most good growth stocks are expensive as the stock market is prepared to pay a premium for earnings growth. On a PE basis, Accenture is trading at a reasonable 20x multiple for its 2020 estimated earnings. The book value at 7.9x seems high but this disguises the fact that Accenture has little in assets as it's an outsourcing company.As an active investor, I personally like to determine some likely price targets. This gives me a feel for how high the stock price could go in the short term and how soon it could get there.Accenture chart by StockCharts.comExamining the stock chart reveals that Accenture has had a fantastic run up in price over the last decade.Should the stock resume its rally, in the short term, Accenture could easily trade back up to its 2018 high of $174 (which I think it could reach within twelve months or even six months).Over the longer term, the stock could trade well past the 2018 high and will probably do so as long as Accenture's earnings growth continues.The stock price pulled back below $140 at the end of 2019 and has since rallied back up to around $156. While there's a chance that the stock could continue rallying, there's also a chance that the stock has not finished with its pullback.The broader market indices have been trending upwards with a bull market that began in 2009. These market indices have currently pulled back from their highs and it's always possible that this is the start of a bear market.Should the bear market take hold, then there's a chance that Accenture's stock price will fall along with the rest of the market. If this is the case, I would expect Accenture's price drop to be fairly subdued compared to the market. Accenture has a business model that would reduce the impact of any adverse earnings which should help cushion the effect of a bear market.Over the longer term, I would expect the stock price to recover from any correction and continue higher in line with Accenture's future earnings growth potential.Accenture has produced solid growth over the years and management feels confident that this growth will continue into the future. Accenture has a sound business model that focuses on both organic growth and acquiring their competition (whenever economically viable).The stock is somewhat expensive but most good growth stocks are expensive as investors are happy to pay for future earnings growth.In my opinion, Accenture is worth buying as an investment for its future growth and capital gains potential. Accenture's business model may also provide some earnings shielding during periods of economic weakness."
4306585,105417,2019-11-14T09:58:37-05:00,"IT back end and IT infrastructure are crucial to Europe's bulge-bracket firms, translating into a revenue opportunity for Accenture.Accenture's Media and Technology verticals heavily rely on digital initiatives.Resources and Healthcare opportunities are smaller, but are still sizable, despite macro pressures.","With EPAM recently reporting 3Q results, we have a number of reads for Accenture, primarily from European clients. We note that since Accenture reports earnings in December, we have the luxury of analyzing earnings from a number of IT Services players and highlighting the most relevant impact for Accenture. Since the company derives approximately 40% of revenue from Europe, we find EPAM's results particularly helpful for ACN's European business. Our findings are below, on a per vertical basis:Accenture is an IT Services company that provides services in strategy, consulting, digital, technology, and operations segments. The company has a revenue base of about $40 billion, with more than 470,000 employees] serving clients in more than 200 cities in 120 countries. ACN focuses on an ""as-a-service"" model of service delivery, which includes business process outsourcing, cloud services, managed operations, security, and infrastructure services. Accenture works with more than 90 clients out total 100 current clients of the Fortune Global, though in recent years the company has been reaching out to smaller and “niche”-focused clients.Per our industry-wide analysis and Accenture’s favorable fundamentals, and given the company’s strong top-line growth, we believe that ACN shares merit ~29x P/E multiple on 2019 earnings. When we apply it to our 2019 EPS estimate of $8.49, we get the target price of $246. We note that this P/E multiple is contingent on the S&P multiple of ~18x, and may expand/contract together with the multiple.1. Financial Services: Demand from large European banks, such as Societe General and UBS, remains strong, as IT back-end and IT infrastructure workstreams remain crucial for banking and insurance segments, despite the ongoing slowness in the European economy (note that Germany is on a brink of recession). EPAM remains in the same league as Accenture and Capgemini in Europe, sharing many of the same clients in the financial services field. Within banking, we continue to see increased demand for cloud services, in addition to work around regulatory compliance. While Accenture and EPAM are in different pricing brackets, we believe that the scope of work remains similar and thus EPAM's success spells out a successful revenue traction for Accenture.2. CMT (Communication, Media, and Technology):Epam's Media and ISV/Technology verticals both have a meaningful presence in Europe, and cumulatively represent a strong read for Accenture's CMT segment. We identify three areas that we've seen over the last quarter (actually, last two quarters) as impactful at EPAM: 1) solid demand for digital services; 2) mobile-related work; and 3) regulatory compliance for tech firms. We note that compliance regulations are much more specific in Europe and require greater budgets than in the US, something that has historically been a major tailwind for both Accenture and Epam. We expect regulatory compliance to represent as much as 4% of total revenue for EPAM in 2020 and 2.5%-3.5% for Accenture. 3. Healthcare vertical:Europe is all about the pharmaceutical space in the IT Services world, with limited exposure to payer. EPAM has been a late entrant, though caught up fairly quickly, with revenue growth rates of nearly 50% Y/Y. As far as European healthcare firms, such as Novartis, are concerned, there is a lot of demand for outsourcing of basic healthcare IT functions, which requires very specific expertise. Accenture and Capgemini are perhaps the only two firms in Europe, capable of delivering it. It is our understanding that for some IT deliverables they act as a duopoly. While EPAM is not and should not be viewed as a direct competitor to Accenture in this space, the fact that large cap firms are seeking to expand their offerings by having conversations with EPAM is certainly a good read for Accenture. 4. Resources: Similarly, we are seeing an increase in demand for the Resources (energy) sector for Accenture, as cloud initiatives become increasingly important and many European-based firms seek to decrease their operating expense. We believe that while for EPAM the opportunity stands at $100-150 MM annually, for Accenture it could be as large as $1.2-$1.5 billion.We see the following three core risks to our long Accenture thesis.While Accenture strives to make the pricing structure attractive to its core clients and, henceforth, attract greater business, we see a number of Indian players, such as Infosys, Tata Consultancy, and Wipro, potentially lowering prices in the foreseeable future. In addition, there are smaller players that are threatening Accenture in Europe, such as Epam and Luxoft.2. Too Much European Exposure:Europe makes up about 45% of Accenture’s total revenues. With economy in Europe slowing down, we may see demand on some European contracts pressured. At present, none of Accenture’s clients voiced concerns regarding the slowing economy; yet, we know from the previous European slowdown in 2012 that IT services pressures can be sudden and very impactful.3. Legislative Uncertainty:The company heavily relies on H1-B and L-1 visas; over the last several years Congress attempts to heavily regulate the number of visa works each company can hire. Should the H1-B and L-1 visas become even more limited, there could be a negative 40-60 bps negative impact to Accenture’s margin."
4229921,79675,2018-12-24T07:26:11-05:00,"Accenture reported Q1 2019 results that beat the top- and bottom-line estimates, but management's forward guidance was not well-received by the market.I believe that the ""disappointing"" guidance is a short-term headwind that is creating a buying opportunity in a company that has a promising growth profile.There are several risk factors that need to be considered, but I plan to stay long the stock.","Accenture (ACN) recently reported better-than-expected Q1 2019 operating results (i.e., top- and bottom-line beats), but the stock finished the trading day down by almost 5%. The broader market selloff definitely came into play with the drop in the stock price, but analysts were also concerned about management's ""disappointing"" revenue outlook.After the recent drop, ACN's shares are now slightly underperforming the market on a YTD basis.ACN data by YChartsThere are company-specific risk factors that need to be consider, especially given the broader market uncertainty, but I believe that Accenture's management team has a story to tell. This unique company has great long-term business prospects and, in my opinion, Accenture's growth profile should not be overlooked, even after factoring in management's disappointing revenue guidance.On December 20, 2018, Accenture reported Q1 2019 adjusted EPS of $1.96 (beat by $0.11) on revenue of $10.6B (beat by $130M). These quarterly results also compare favorably to the year-ago quarter.Source: Q1 2019 InfographicOther highlights from the quarter:There was lot to like about Accenture's Q1 2019 results, but the market was not able to look past management's disappointing forward guidance. Management narrowed its range for revenue growth (from 5-8% to 6-8%) and EPS (from $6.98-7.25 to $7.01-7.25) for full-year fiscal 2019. The full-year guidance was encouraging, especially if you consider the current market turmoil.The problem? Accenture's Q2 2019 guidance. For the upcoming quarter, management expects for revenue to be in the range of $10.1-10.4B and that includes an anticipated negative FX impact of 4%. Analysts were calling for Q2 2019 revenues to be $10.3B, which is at the high-end of management's guidance. At the end of the day, I believe that investors should view Accenture as a long-term play because this tech company operates in several industries that have significant growth profiles. As such, the disappointing Q2 2019 guidance should be viewed as a near-term headwind, because FX hits are rarely ever a good reason to sell a stock, especially if you are in it for the long haul.The connected world is already upon us, and I believe that Accenture - the go-to product and service provider - is in a great position to benefit from a promising backdrop.The Internet Of Things, or IoT, predictions are all over the place, but the common thread throughout all estimates is the fact that the connected economy is expected to experience tremendous growth in the decades ahead. Just consider these two projections.Source: GartnerAs shown, Gartner predicts that almost all new tech products (95%) will contain some type of IoT component by 2020. Furthermore, to put a dollar figure to the predictions, McKinsey & Company expects for IoT technology services to have a CAGR of 17% over the next five years and to reach $143B in spending by 2021.Source: McKinsey & CompanyI could provide a number of predictions that show how connected the economy may be in 5, 10, or 20 years from now, but I will save you the time. Simply put, IoT is going to play a critical role in the global economy for many years to come. Therefore, investors in Accenture should be encouraged that the company has reported strong results over the past few quarters (and years). Moreover, Accenture's main growth driver, The New (read more about The New here), appears to be gaining steam, which obviously bodes well for this company's future.Therefore, investors should excited about an investment in this industry leader because, in my opinion, Accenture appears to be well-positioned to benefit from multiple tailwinds in several key industries. And it helps that the stock is still reasonably valued.Let's consider two different comparisons. First, the company's stock is trending closer to the average historical P/E ratio.ACN PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsHowever, ACN's shares are trading at a slight discount to the industry average P/E ratio.Source: FidelityWhile ACN shares are definitely not cheap at today's price, let's also remember that Accenture is a shareholder-friendly company (management continues to raise the dividend and buyback shares) that operates in several high-growth industries. Therefore, I believe that Accenture will not only grow into its current valuation but also, in my opinion, the true growth potential is not yet fully baked into the stock.Accenture is highly levered to the digital space, so any major disruption to the New would significantly impact the company's business prospects.Additionally, reputation risk is an important consideration because Accenture is the go-to consultant in its industry. Specifically, ACN shares are trading at a premium to its peers (and the market), so a negative shift in investor sentiment would materially impact the company's stock price.The main takeaway from Accenture's Q1 2019 results is that this company is in a great position for fiscal 2019 (and beyond). Moreover, the market did not like the revenue forecast for the upcoming quarter but, when taking a step back, the quarterly fluctuations are not a legitimate reason to be concerned, especially if FX is the main culprit. There may be some noise in the numbers over the next two-to-three quarters, but that is not a reason to sell the stock. This company is worthy of investment dollars.Accenture is operating in markets that have significant growth profiles so, in my opinion, investors with a time horizon longer than one to two years should consider adding ACN shares on pullbacks.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

4236966,104543,2019-01-31T06:51:39-05:00,"With a low payout ratio, excellent free cash flow generation and clean balance sheet, it offers one of the safest dividends in the market.Easy and understandable business: They pay talent/salary, rent office space, servers and a few other light assets and pocket the margin.CAGR is 15% since the IPO in 2001. Accenture is number one in its market and has a wide and durable moat.But due to its size, I expect growth will be somewhat lower the next decade, but most likely above market returns.","My investment horizon is at least a decade, preferably an investment I can just hold and never sell (and make 10%+ annually). The less investment decisions I make, the less details I look at and the less I read about the stock market, the better I do. Hence, my analysis always takes a very long-term view. I prefer companies that pay a growing dividend. I research companies in the USA, Canada, UK, Scandinavia, Singapore and Hong Kong. I tend to stick to beer-drinking countries.My main requirements are high historical returns, a proven business model that is preferably asset-light, predictable cash flows with as little cyclical exposure as possible, sustainable and growing dividend, good and ethical management with a stake in the business, fair valuation and the most important of all: a wide moat.Based on the criteria mentioned above, Accenture (ACN) is an absolutely perfect fit. The dividend is one of the safest in the market, there is plenty of room for dividend growth, the cash flow is predictable and valuation is fair. Cash flow yield is about 6%, certainly not a bargain, but a terrific business as Accenture's will often be at a premium.I expect minimum 8% annual returns over the next decade, but the most likely scenario is 10%+.Accenture was part of Arthur Andersen, one of the “big five” in the auditing and tax consulting business. Arthur Andersen had two units, one auditing and one consulting. The audit unit went bankrupt after the Enron scandal, but the consultancy unit split from the other in 2000 and renamed itself Accenture in 2001. Accenture has been listed on the NYSE since 2001 and is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland.Accenture is a global management consulting firm that provides consulting within strategy, management, digital/interactive, business operations and transformation. In addition, they also do outsourcing. The main goal is to increase the productivity of the client.The business model is quite ""simple"": They pay talent/salary, rent office space, servers and a few other light assets and pocket the margin. No heavy equipment or capital spending is needed to run the operations, it's extremely asset-light. It’s a human capital business and the asset is the 469,000 employees who have deep knowledge in 40 industries. This makes it a business quite hard to replicate, and also more adaptable than capital-intensive businesses.It’s a truly international and diversified company. 46% of the revenue comes from North America, 35% from Europe and 19 from growth markets. 28% of the revenue comes from Products (consumer good, travel, industry and retail), 20% from Finance, 20% from Telecom, 16% from Health & Public Service and 16% from Resources (utilities, oil/energy, natural resources). It has a wide reach and is represented in about 52 countries. It can serve any multinational company, both by geography, scope and knowledge/competence. Accenture takes aim to help companies becoming the disruptor (not the one being disrupted).Accenture cooperates closely with its clients to improve their efficiency, value, and growth prospects. Through their long list of clients Accenture has gained valuable insights into trends and technologies, which keeps the company highly relevant. This has helped them to “renew” their business over the years. For example, digital developments, analytics, cloud, Internet of Things and security now constitutes over 60% of the revenue compared to 30% just four years ago.Accenture is taking market shares from traditional marketing companies like WPP (WPP), for example. Interactive revenue grew about 20% last year and is now a direct competitor to traditional ad agencies. Martin Sorrel, the CEO ousted from WPP in 2018, recently warned that consultants like Accenture and Deloitte are moving more directly to compete with creative businesses. Accenture Interactive employs almost 30,000, and in comparison WPP employs about 125,000.Accenture grows organically and through acquisitions. Acquisitions are done often but mainly smaller rivals. Over the past three years, Accenture has spent $3.4 billion to buy 70 companies.In January 2019, the CEO stepped down due to health reasons (cancer) in a planned move already agreed two years ago. Currently, David Rowland, the CFO since 2013, is the interim CEO.The management is pretty experienced with most of the team having been employed by at least 20 years. Almost all are recruited internally, which means they should have a deep knowledge of the corporate culture and insights about business relationships.Personally, what I like best, is that management is required to have at all times at least an equity stake that is valued at six times their compensation (base salary). Hopefully, this aligns the interests of management and shareholders.Since 2010, eligible employees can purchase share at a small discount via a share purchase plan (ESPP).Since its listing in 2001, performance has been terrific:Source: Yahoo! Finance and my own calculations. Blue line is Accenture, pink is SPY.10,000 invested in July 2001 is now worth 133,000 compared to 31,000 for the SPY/S&P 500. The yearly return since 2001 is 15.1%.If we look at the rolling three-year performance, we get this chart:Source: My own calculations. Blue line is ACN and pink is SPY/S&P 500. The first observation is return from July 2001 to July 2004 and so forth.The chart shows Accenture has been almost constantly higher than SPY and barely negative. It’s simply a steady performer with no major drawdowns. For example, in the first half of 2009, SPY was down 40% compared to 2006 while Accenture was just 5% lower.EPS shows a steady increase:Source: Morningstar. Blue is EPS, red is free cash flow per share.Accenture ended the last accounting year in August 2018. The graph indicates cash flow for the most time is higher than the earnings because of its very asset-light business model. Yearly growth in EPS has been 11.8%, a bit lower than the share price because of PE expansion.Cash conversion ratio has been very stable at 12% the last ten years (for every dollar in sales, 12 cents ends up as free cash flow). CAPEX to sales is 1% so we can safely conclude this is an extremely asset-light business model.Source: Morningstar and my own calculations.Because of its asset-light business model, returns on invested capital, equity and assets have been very high:Data by YChartsAccenture is also a fairly recession-proof company. Because cyclical and capital-intensive companies experience huge swings in both sales and earnings during a recession, some even facing bankruptcy if a recession lasts for a long time, less cyclical businesses like Accenture perform much better. However, Accenture wrote in the annual report of 2009 that they experienced clients asking for price concessions during 2008/09. Sales did drop about 7% in 2009, but margins were the same.In July 2008, the share price peaked at $41, and fell to a low of $25 in October 2008, a fall of 39% at the maximum. $25 was the lowest price, but most of the time Accenture was around $30 during the recession and performed better than the S&P 500. During the volatility in October to December 2018, Accenture fell about 15% at the most. In any future recession, we can expect Accenture to drop less than the market. Its services are needed in every stage of a business cycle as companies need advice and strategy on how to stay competitive and how to save costs.The correlation of monthly returns with S&P 500 over a 12-month period is 0.6, slightly below the average for a random stock. Since the IPO in 2001, Accenture has experienced 32 months with losses more than 5% and 14 monthly drops bigger than 10%. This could be good opportunities to buy or add to a position. Average 12-month gain after a 5% drop is almost 24% and 19% after a 10% drop.Its return on equity has outperformed all other major IT companies over the last 10 years, to my knowledge. I believe they have a wide moat and their competitive advantage comes from client relationships, scale and scope, intellectual property, and a very powerful brand. They can adapt to changing market conditions because of its asset-light business model and the highly competent workforce. I believe they have a business that is hard to compete against and disrupt.Accenture has over 65 years of experience of acquiring skills and clients. Relationships are quite sticky: usually a client sticks with Accenture for a long time. 95 of their top 100 clients have been clients for more than 10 years and 99 have been clients for at least five years, which indicates switching costs. They serve 89 of the Fortune Global 100 and 75% of the Fortune Global 500, according to their fact sheet.They also have the scale to implement big projects, all over the world. The clients are mostly global institutions operating worldwide, and very few consultants have the scope required to serve such clients. This gives pricing power for those few who can. It’s a one-stop shop.Because of its wide scope, they can easily attract and implement “juniors” who can start working efficiently and cheaper than “seniors.” Young and intelligent people fresh out of university are keen on having Accenture on their resume to kick-start their careers. These tend to be high performers. Accenture has manuals developed decade after decade (intellectual property).In addition, they have a superior brand. Everyone seeking help in business development or strategy knows Accenture is up to the task.I expect Accenture to outperform all other IT services companies over the long term given the switching costs, scope and intangible assets.Accenture operates in a competitive environment. So far Accenture has a “first mover advantage” in the digital business among the consultancies, but most of them will compete to catch up. These are the “big four” of the auditing and consultancy business, Deloitte, KPMG, PWC and Ernst & Young. In addition we have for example McKinsey, The Boston Consulting Group, Bain, IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Capgemini (OTCPK:CGEMY). Increasingly also Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are competitors in handling data.There is also the risk that Accenture simply becomes too big and fat and grows less because of its size. Its assets are human resources, and competition can come from lower-cost countries.About half the revenue comes from 150 multinationals, and there is a risk they will take some of the services in-house. For example both Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Nestle (OTCPK:NSRGY) reduced spending on ad-agencies to do it in-house, and this trend might switch to other areas.Over the last years, Accenture has grown their market share in the ad-business. This is a more of a cyclical business than the other income.The future is of course always uncertain, and that’s one of the reasons we make money by investing for the long term. Diversification is needed, and any investment in Accenture is automatically a diversification into many businesses and regions.Dividend and capital allocation:Accenture is a very shareholder-friendly company. Since 2009, it has returned 95% of free cash flow back to shareholders, mostly in the form of buybacks:Source: Morningstar.Outstanding shares have declined from 787 million to 655 million, a 17% reduction, or about 2% per year, since 2009.Dividend is paid every year from 2006, and increased every year:Source: Accenture's website.The drop in 2011 is not really a drop: before 2010, the dividend was paid annually, but from 2010 semi-annually which led to a bigger dividend in 2010. CAGR is 17%, but we can expect this to drop down to about 10% in the future (the latest dividend increase was 10%). The current annual dividend is 2.92 USD, which equals a yield of about 2%. If future dividend growth is for example 10%, then dividend is at 7.6 USD in 2028 and 20 in 2038.Currently, the dividend is paid twice a year in May and November, but from 1st quarter of 2020, it will be paid quarterly.The dividend is extremely safe, probably one of the safest dividends in the market. That is due to a low payout ratio, wide moat, no debt and cash-rich business model.Source: Morningstar.Accenture is headquartered in Ireland. Withholding tax is 20%, but residents of EU and the US are exempted.The balance sheet is very clean, and at the end of 2018, there was practically no interest-bearing debt (just 25 million USD). At the end of 2018, cash and equivalents were about 5 billion, 5.5% of the market cap. About 3.5 billion are “excess” and not needed for the everyday business and could be given back to shareholders, according to my calculations. That equals $5 per share. The cash alone can cover the dividend for the next three years.About 25% of the assets are goodwill and intangibles. I usually find these two items questionable, but in the case of Accenture I’m more prone to believe in it. Goodwill is not depreciated or amortized, but exposed to audits annually on a case by case. No impairment (write-off) was done in 2018 and 2017.The biggest liability is pension obligations at 1.4 billion.Accenture is not cheap, but it deserves a premium valuation. Current PE is 23 and forward PE is 21 (latest guidance for EPS is 7-7.25 for 2019). But free cash flow is higher than earnings and P/CF is about 18:Data by YChartsAll in all I would say Accenture has a fair valuation considering its growth prospects.I’m long Accenture and plan to add on pullbacks. I’m long because of estimated future total returns. Nevertheless, I expect lower growth in the future because of its big size, but it is still a good investment. Assuming 9% growth in EPS, 10% dividend growth, 2% annual reduction in outstanding shares and PE of 20 in 2028, CAGR is about 11%. However, if PE is 15 in 2028 then CAGR goes down to 8%. I’m a conservative investor, so I try to take a conservative approach.But all in all the dividend looks very safe, there is a wide and durable moat, competent management, asset-light business model, high margins, one of the more recession-proof business models in the market and we can expect future growth. To me this looks like a good investment."
4208869,79675,2018-09-28T10:31:17-04:00,"Accenture reported Q4 2018 results that beat the top and bottom line estimates.Accenture's main growth driver (i.e., the New) experienced strong growth in 2018 and investors should expect more of the same in the years ahead.I plan to stay long ACN. What are your thoughts?","On September 27, 2018, Accenture (ACN) reported better-than-expected Q4 2018 earnings and strong top line growth but the market was not impressed, as shown by the fact that the stock finished the trading day down almost 3%. However, ACN shares are still outperforming the broader market over the first nine-plus months of 2018.ACN data by YChartsThe stock was under pressure because management's forward guidance fell short of estimates but, in my opinion, the bull case for this unique technology company is stronger than ever. Specifically, Accenture's most recent operating results show that its main business (""the New,"" which makes up digital, cloud, and security-related services) has a strong growth profile.The New made up approximately 60% of the company's fiscal 2018 revenue and the YoY growth was impressive, to say the least.As shown, the revenue stream for these businesses grew by 25% YoY led by digital services. During the conference call, management spent a considerable amount of time highlighting the importance of the New to Accenture's growth profile and, as expected, they let investors know that the company will continue to heavily invest in this space. Specifically, management mentioned how Accenture Interactive (read more about this business here) is allowing for the company to innovate and introduce new and exciting revenue streams in several key industries.At the end of the day, Accenture will go as the New goes so I believe that the strong Q4 and Full-year 2018 operating results for this category are very encouraging from a long-term investor's perspective.For Q4 2018, Accenture reported adjusted EPS of $1.58 (beat by $0.02) on revenue of $10.15B (beat by $140M), which also compares favorably to the results reported in the same period of the prior year. The following were the highlights from the quarter:Additionally, the company reported strong operating results for fiscal 2018, as the company saw both net revenue and adjusted EPS grow by double-digit figures.Accenture reported broad-based growth and, more importantly, the company was able to significantly grow its cash flow metrics. There was a lot to like about Accenture's Q4 2018 results but management's forward guidance was not well received.Source: Q4 2018 Press ReleaseWhile the fiscal 2019 estimates were nothing to brag about, it is important to note that management fully intends to heavily invest in their high-growth businesses. As such, the margin pressure and lower-than-expected earnings estimates are not significant concerns, at least in my mind. Moreover, the fiscal 2019 guidance did not change my view of Accenture being well-positioned for digital growth that is expected to continue through the next few decades, a topic that I previously covered here.The company's stock is currently trading close to the top of its historical P/E ratio range.ACN PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsOn the other hand, Accenture's stock is still trading at a slight discount to industry average P/E ratio.While ACN shares are definitely not cheap at today's price, let's also remember that Accenture is a shareholder-friendly company (the dividend was increased by 10% and an additional $5B was added to its buyback program) that operates in several high-growth industries. Therefore, I believe that Accenture will not only grow into its current valuation but, in my opinion, the true growth potential is not yet fully baked into the stock.Accenture's stock has followed a consistent path over the last year - that is, ACN shares run up into earnings, the stock sells off after earnings are released, and then the stock finds its way to new all-time highs.Source: NasdaqNotice the dips after almost every earnings release but also notice how the stock has continued to tick higher over the last two years. Therefore, I would view any pullback that may be caused by the Q4 2018 results as a long-term buying opportunity.Accenture is highly levered to the digital space, so any major disruption to the New would significantly impact the company's business prospects.Additionally, reputation risk is an important consideration because Accenture is the go-to consultant in its industry. Specifically, ACN shares are trading at a premium to its peers (and the market), so a negative shift in investor sentiment would materially impact the company's stock price.Accenture reported strong Q4 and full year 2018 results but the main takeaway was the fact that the New seems to be just getting started. This business category already makes up approximately 60% of Accenture's total revenue and it should continue to grow as digitalization continues to impact the global economy in a major way. As such, I would treat any pullbacks as long-term buying opportunities.Author's Note: All images were taken from Accenture's Q4 and Full-year 2018 Earnings Presentation unless otherwise stated.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

4200109,101421,2018-08-17T13:20:38-04:00,"Accenture has announced two acquisitions in the connected technologies space.It acquired Mindtribe and agreed to acquire Pillar Technologies, both for undisclosed amounts.ACN is continuing to use acquisitions to bolster its Industry X.0 initiative and provide next-generation technology services to the connected device industry.","Global consulting firm Accenture (ACN) has announced the acquisition and pending acquisition of two North American technology companies, Mindtribe and Pillar Technology.Mindtribe provides integrated hardware & software engineering services; Pillar Technology serves clients with its embedded software capabilities.ACN’s acquisition activity of IoT design and service companies makes sense as the firm continues to build out its Industry X.0 capabilities in this rapidly growing area.San Francisco-based Mindtribe was founded in 1998 to enable startup companies to access hardware engineering and project management services.As the Internet of Things industry has developed in recent years, the firm shifted its focus to integrated engineering for connected hardware.Management is headed by founder and CEO Steve Myers, who was previously a mechanical engineer at the Stanford Linear Accelerator.Pillar Technology, which is headquartered in Columbus Ohio and has offices in Palo Alto, Des Moines, and Ann Arbor, was founded in 1996. CEO Bob Myers started with the firm in 2002.Below is an overview video of Pillar Technology:(Source: Pillar Technology)Pillar's primary offerings to customers are the development and testing of enterprise-grade software and digital services engineering for hardware products.According to a 2017 report on the Internet of Things [IoT] market, it is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 14% from 2017 to 2022.While the IoT market is large and diverse, the number and breadth of connected hardware & software devices and applications are growing at a tremendous rate.The main drivers for this expected growth include rising Internet usage and penetration, growing BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) in the enterprise and demand for increased ‘smart’ technologies by cities, manufacturers, healthcare firms, industrials, logistics, and transportation industries, to name a few.Major competitive vendors that provide IoT platforms include:ACN didn’t disclose the acquisition price or terms of either deal nor did it file an 8-K or disclose a change in financial guidance, so the deals were likely for a non-material amount.A review of the firm’s most recent 10-Q filing indicates that the firm had $3.9 billion in cash and equivalents and $13 billion in total liabilities.Free cash flow during the nine months ended May 31, 2018, was $3.48 billion, so ACN has ample resources to make small acquisitions like these without difficulty.Accenture is acquiring the two companies to bolster its ‘Industry X.0’ consulting capabilities for the burgeoning hardware & software integration needs for connected devices.As Mike Sutcliff, group chief executive at Accenture Digital stated in the deal announcement,In the past 12 months, ACN’s stock price has risen 28.9%, more than double the S&P 500 Index of 13%, as the chart below indicates:(Source: SEEKING ALPHA)With the two acquisitions, Accenture gains a total of 360 employees with long relationships within the connected device and software development industries in North America. Both Mindtribe and Pillar boast top-tier, iconic companies as clients.Accenture is continuing to acquire firms in this nascent industry, having recently acquired design firm Altitude and design consultancy designaffairs in recent months.I’m bullish on ACN’s increased focus on IoT technology services. While these few acquisitions won’t move the dial in terms of stock price in the near term, they provide insight into how ACN management is thinking and reacting to opportunities in new markets.I expect to see more acquisitions and initiatives as Accenture executes on its Industry X.0 initiatives."
4170521,39141,2018-05-06T20:47:49-04:00,"Accenture is in the middle of the 'digital transformation' for many of the world's largest companies.Expect high single-digit revenue growth going forward, for several years or perhaps longer.Although Accenture is not cheap, it has put itself in a position for structural growth, and it pays a meaningful, growing dividend.","The way people shop and do business is being transformed by advances in digital interaction and artificial intelligence. The 'digitalization' of industry and business can be difficult to conceptualize, but its effect on businesses across industries is inarguable: Consumers these days, particularly those of the younger generations, demand more personal solutions and connected products, often times more in the form of services than anything else. This has pressured the 'one size fits all' manufacturing model, among other things, and it is forcing all kinds of businesses to adapt if they wish to remain relevant among Millennials and 'Generation Z.'One company leading the way in this is Accenture plc (ACN). This Ireland-based, worldwide consulting firm, otherwise known as Andersen Consulting years ago, has transformed its own business model to helping businesses make the 'digital transition.' Accenture is also a good choice for dividend investors, as it both pays a meaningful dividend and is poised to keep growing that dividend for quite some time ahead. This article takes a look at Accenture, its fundamentals, and what income investors can expect.In fiscal 2018, management expects 60% of company revenue will come from the ""new"" business of digital-related services, cloud-related services, and security-related services. All of these areas are growing by double-digits.Courtesy of Accenture Investor RelationsThe digital transformation is big business, and it is also ongoing with no end point. Consider why: Brand experience is no longer just about advertisement saturation and the product itself. That experience now includes webpages, apps and interaction, as well as advertisements. In other words, there are many more points of experience. The life cycle of a typical product is also, in general, compressing. This means that innovation will be an ongoing thing. Generally speaking, there will be no 'endpoint' when it comes to digital platforms and ecosystems for consumers.In addition to the takeover of connected products and personalized solutions, automated intelligence and 'deep learning' are making the production environment much more flexible and adaptive. To give one real-world example, recently Accenture worked as a partner with Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY) in seat cabin installation. Accenture created a digitally enabled, smart glass solution for workers to use as contextual-marking, to help them place on the cabin floor where to drill holes so the seats could be installed correctly. That brought the error rate down to zero and allowed workers to install the seats very quickly compared to the old process. In this capacity, Accenture becomes a valuable partner for big companies, and leverages its already-trusted brand name by which to do so.Revenue from the 'interactive' division has grown 35% compounded over the last three years, thanks to solutions like the one mentioned above. Accenture works with three-fourths of all Fortune 100 companies, and there is a lot of work to do. Investors can expect low double-digit growth from the company in fiscal 2018, and probably something similar for the next couple years. If the last few years are any guide, EPS should grow by low double-digits in such an environment.Unsurprisingly, Accenture is not cheap at all. Shares currently trade at 23.5 times trailing earnings. According to data from F.A.S.T. Graphs, Accenture has averaged 17.6 times trailing earnings over the last ten years. That's a premium of 33.5%. It's easy to call Accenture overvalued. In this case, Accenture carries a high valuation because it has structurally situated itself in the center of the digital transformation; a very good place to be. Accenture is up where it is for a reason.Chart courtesy of MarketWatch. On the other hand, Accenture has pulled back. Shares are down 6.7% from their mid-March highs, and now could be a good time to get in while shares take a breather.Regarding dividends, management expects to grow its dividend in line with 'income.' That's its way of saying that investors can expect dividends to grow by low double-digits. While it is difficult to predict things far into the future, particularly when it comes to technology, I am quite confident that Accenture will continue to grow its dividends at about this rate, so long as the company can stay ahead of the curve. I believe that it will.There is plenty of room for dividend growth, as well as cash flow in excess of dividends. For example, over the previous twelve months, Accenture generated $5.07 billion in free cash flow and paid $1.6 billion in dividends. In other words, dividends were only 31.5% of free cash flow. Investors should expect dividends to stay at roughly that ratio.With Accenture, you'll get a company that is in the center of a generational transformation of how people do business. I tend to believe that, in the end, outweighs the stocks' current high valuation. Accenture is a dividend payer that is going to be more relevant in 5 to 10 years as a company, not less relevant.For income investors, it is a challenge to have exposure to structural growth stocks, because often times the dividend-payers tend to be more mature companies. In paying a dividend here, despite all the growth and opportunities to reinvest in its very interesting and fast-moving business, Accenture is signaling a commitment to capital discipline. The growing dividend is also a signal that management understands and values income investors. These are important signs, and I strongly believe that income investors will be very happy owning this company for the long term. Shares yield only 1.8% right now; I see many years of strong dividend growth, backed by a generational trend. For this reason, I believe Accenture is a buy."

Since I first wrote about Accenture in early 2017, ACN shares have outperformed the broader market by a wide margin.ACN data by YChartsI still believe today that Accenture is worthy of your investment dollars, even with the stock sitting at [or close to] all-time highs because this company is well-positioned for the changing digital economy. It also helps the bull case that management continues to produce impressive operating results quarter after quarter.On June 28, 2018, Accenture reported better-than-expected Q3 2018 financial results. The company reported Q3 2018 adjusted EPS of $1.79 (beat by $0.07) on total net revenue of $10.31B (beat by $270M). For comparison purposes, the Q3 2018 net revenue and adjusted EPS increased by 11% and 18%, respectively when compared to the same period of the prior year.Additionally, as shown, the company reported strong results across the board. 3 out of 5 Operating Groups had double-digit net revenue growth - the other 2 had high single-digit growth - and the company experienced strong demand in all three of the geographic regions that it operates in.During the conference call, management highlighted Consulting (up 12% YoY to $5.69B) and Outsourcing (up 10% YoY to $4.63B) as two areas that had a real impact on Accenture's net revenue growth for Q3 2018. However, the company's digital, cloud, and security services businesses (i.e., ""The New"") continues to be the key growth driver for Accenture.The New now accounts for ~60% of Accenture's net revenue (up from 50% in Q3 2017) and, as described during the company's Investor & Analyst Meeting in April 2018, management believes that the prospects for this business improve almost every day.When taking a step back, I believe that Accenture is properly positioned for the ever-changing digital transformation that is occurring across the globe. And to put the company's potential market opportunity into context, the global Internet Of Things (""IoT"") market is expected to grow from $157B in 2016 to $457B by 2020 (a CAGR of 28.5%):Source: Forbes Article, December 2017Accenture is the go-to service provider in the digital space, so, at the end of the day, the company should be a direct beneficiary to the growth that is expected in the years ahead. The company has already been firing on all cylinders but, more importantly, management expects for more of the same through the end of fiscal 2018:These are meaningful increases for almost every metric, so investors should expect for ACN shares to perform well as the company heads into fiscal 2019. Let's also not forget that Accenture's stock is still reasonably valued, even after the recent run-up.Accenture's stock is trading at a premium when compared to its peers, but the company is attractively valued when compared to the average P/E ratio for the IT Services industry.Source: FidelityLastly, as I previously described in this article, I believe that Accenture deserves to trade at a premium because the company is the leader in multiple high-growth areas. In addition, Accenture being a shareholder-friendly company - the board recently approved a dividend increase of 10% and management repurchased $720M worth of shares at an average price of $153.60 during Q3 2018 - also helps the bull case for Accenture.As described throughout this article, Accenture is highly levered to the digital space, so any major disruption to The New would significantly impact the company's business prospects.Additionally, reputation risk is an importation consideration because Accenture is the go-to consultant in its industry. Specifically, ACN shares are trading at a premium to its peers (and the market), so a negative shift in investor sentiment would materially impact the company's stock price.The major takeaway from Accenture's Q3 2018 results is the fact that it appears that management has this company well-positioned for the future, especially in the digital consulting space. Moreover, the market conditions for Accenture continue to improve and this should bode well for the company (and its shareholders) over the next five plus years.The company has plans to return a material amount of capital to shareholders over the next year, and management believes that the growth for The New (i.e., Accenture's key growth driver) is still in the early innings. As such, investors with a time horizon longer than two-to-three years should consider any significant pullbacks as buying opportunities.Author's Note: All images were obtained from Accenture's Q3 2018 Earnings Presentation unless otherwise noted.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

4133295,51452,2017-12-21T12:42:50-05:00,"Finally, more than 50% of revenues came from providing customers the digital, cloud and security solutions that are where the enterprise IT momentum is to be found.This combined with this excellent management team running the company like a ""Swiss Watch"" to result in accelerating financial results.AI-enabled solutions are now being added.We are raising our rating from Buy to Strong Buy.","In Accenture’s (ACN) earnings report this morning the benefits of both the aligning of the company to the digital, cloud and security and now AI-enabling services demanded in today’s world – and running the business very well - can be seen. 55% of revenues came from providing these digital, cloud and security services that are aligned with the major enterprise IT trends and hence are getting most of the growth in spending. Accenture has been investing to provide these capabilities and now they are generating more than half of all revenues for the first time. In addition, now AI-based machine learning and analytics capabilities are being added. In part, this is being done via partnerships with companies like MSFT.Accenture’s November FQ1 results were $9.52 billion and $1.79, nicely above expectations for $9.26 billion and $1.67 that were based on $9.10-9.35 billion revenue guidance. These revenues were up 4% sequentially and up 12% YTY, an acceleration from 6%, 4%, 4% and 8% YTY the prior four quarters in that order. In local currencies, revenues were up 10%. This growth represents significant market share gains.Earnings were up 13% YTY, the same percentage as in FQ4 which was better than 4%, -1% and 8% the prior three quarters in that order.Accenture shares are trading up 3%-plus this morning, as they should on this accelerating growth. Again, this fine management team has both better aligned their capabilities with the digital, cloud and security services most in demand and continues to operate the business like a Swiss watch.For their February FQ2, Accenture management guided revenues to $9.15-9.40 billion compared to prior expectations at the low end of this range.For FY 2018, they raised their revenue guidance from $36.6-37.7 billion to $37.9-38.6 billion. This is calculated from a revenue growth rate guidance increase in local currency from 5-8% to 6-8%, partially offset by a 50bp reduction in their guidance for the positive impact of currency from 3.0% to 2.5%. FY 2018 earnings are guided to $6.48-6.68, with a $6.58 midpoint that is slightly above prior expectations for $6.56.If FQ2 earnings prove to be the same $0.12 above expectations for $1.46 as they were in FQ1, YTY earnings growth would be 19%, making the P/E of 20 look quite reasonable for a company of this quality.Let’s take a closer look at the additional FQ1 operating metrics behind these strong revenue and earnings numbers:Consulting revenues were $5.18 billion, up 13% YTY or up 11% in local currencies.Outsourcing revenues were $4.34 billion, up 11% YTY or up 9% in local currencies.Bookings were $10.0 billion, with consulting bookings of $5.9 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.0 billion. Compared to the seasonally stronger FQ4 these consulting bookings were up $800 million sequentially and these outsourcing bookings were $1.0 billion lower.YTY U. S. dollar revenue comparisons by customer sector:This growth was impressively even across these customer sectors.Gross margins were unchanged YTY at 32.1%.Operating margins were unchanged YTY at 15.6%.This looks to us well and carefully managed via spending levels.In summary, ACN now has most of its revenues coming from doing the digital, cloud, security and now AI work that enterprises and governments need and is a very well-managed company. And is reasonably valued with a P/E only slightly above its earnings growth rate.Accordingly, we are raising our rating from Buy to Strong Buy."
4158670,79675,2018-03-25T03:06:01-04:00,"Accenture recently reported better-than-expected Q2 2018 operating results (top- and bottom-line beats).
        However, the market is concerned about the company's operating margins and the potential for additional margin pressure over the next few quarters. In my opinion, these concerns are overblown.
        Accenture is a long-term buy at today's price.","Accenture (ACN) has been a top-performer for the R.I.P. portfolio for several years now but the company's most recent operating results (and forward guidance) caused a major selloff for the stock. Source: NasdaqThe market is concerned about Accenture's operating margins, in addition to the company's ""lackluster"" outlook, but, in my opinion, the recent selloff is creating a buying opportunity in a digital-focused company that has great long-term business prospects. (Image Source)Accenture is a global technology consulting company that is a major player in several key industries. To this point, Accenture is consistently listed as one of the best consulting companies to work for (according to Vault - #1 consulting firm for IT operations and strategy) and the company is a service provider to 89 of the Fortune Global 100 companies. Source: At A Glance, An Accenture Presentation It goes without saying that Accenture will go as the digital space goes. So, it helps Accenture's bull case that digital is a key pillar to many global companies' growth strategies. Additionally, Accenture has a management team that has produced time-after-time and I believe that they have put Accenture in a great position to capitalize on the digital transformation that is occurring across the globe.It is hard to fully wrap your hands around the potential market opportunity that Accenture will have in the years ahead but I believe that the opportunities are almost endless (dramatic, I know). For example, consider these forecasts that Forbes detailed in its ""2017 Roundup Of Internet Of Things Forecast"" report: The forecasts compiled by Forbes are all over the place but one thing is consistent, that is, the growth potential for IoT (and the sub-industries) is real. Connected things are expected to experience significant growth and I believe that it is hard to deny that digital will play a key role in the future growth of the global economy.Accenture will obviously not capture all of this growth but, in my opinion, the company will have its hands in many pots as the digitalization of the economy continues to gain steam over the next few years. Therefore, at the end of the day, Accenture's long-term story is pretty straightforward - the company is the go-to service provider in multiple industries that have significant growth prospects, with the kicker being the fact that it has a well-established management team that has a proven track record of creating shareholder value. What's not to like?On March 22, 2018, Accenture reported Q2 2018 results that beat on the top- and bottom-line. For the quarter, the company reported adjusted EPS of $1.58 (beat estimates by $0.09) on revenues of $9.59B (beat estimates by $280M). Additionally, Accenture's operating results were impressive almost across the board. Source: Accenture's Q2 2018 InfographicThe company reported a 19% YoY increase in adjusted EPS (which also beat estimates), 10% YoY growth in net revenue, double-digit growth in ""The New"" (read this article for additional thoughts on this business category), and net revenue growth for all operating groups BUT the market is focused strictly on the margin pressure that the company felt during the quarter. Management specifically highlighted that lower profitability on Health And Public Service (""H&PS"") contracts, in addition to other investments made to acquire mission critical skills and capabilities for high growth businesses, as the main culprits for the margin pressure. During the conference call, management highlighted two things that are impacting the H&PS margin pressure - (1) higher costs on few larger contracts and (2) higher contract acquisition costs - but it is important to note that these specific headwinds are expected to improve over the second half of 2018. Plus, management noted that their long-term strategic objective of expanding margins by 10bps-30bps over time has not been impacted by the most recent developments. In addition to the quarterly margin pressure, management now expects for the impacts to carry forward for the remainder of the year, which resulted in a change to the company's fiscal 2018 guidance: Source: Table created by W.G. Investment Research using company dataSimply put, Accenture reported impressive Q2 2018 operating results that supports the bull case for the company. Yes, the quarter (and forward guidance) was impacted by increasing costs but I view this as a short-term headwind. Remember, this company believes that the long-term objective for expanding margin is intact. And the recent developments are a result of near term pressures that will eventually put the company in a better position to expand its reach in several niche areas, in addition to win additional business in the future.The proof will definitely be in the pudding but I intend to give this management team the benefit of the doubt because they have a proven track record. Accenture's stock is trading at a premium when compared to its peers but the company is attractively valued when compared to the average P/E ratio for the IT Services industry.Source: Fidelity As I described in the past, I believe that Accenture deserves to trade at a premium because the company has promising long-term business prospects and a proven management team in place. Additionally, the fact that Accenture is a very shareholder-friendly company (recently increased its semi-annual dividend by 10% and returned $1.4B to shareholders in the form of buybacks so far in fiscal 2018) helps too. As described throughout this article, Accenture is highly levered to the digital space so any major disruption to The New would significantly impact the company's business prospects.Additionally, reputation risk is an importation consideration because Accenture is the go-to consultant in its industry. Specifically, ACN shares are trading at a premium to its peers, so a negative shift in investor sentiment would materially impact the company's stock price.Accenture's operating margins and lower-than-expected fiscal 2018 margin guidance are not great but it is important to take a step back to consider the long-term story for this company. Accenture is operating in several industries that have significant growth prospects and the company's fiscal 2018 guidance, while lower in several areas than what was previously communicated, still supports the bull case. As such, I believe that investors should treat the recent pullback as a long-term buying opportunity. Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

Excluding the Accenture investment, the amount of which was also not disclosed, Paxata has now raised more than $60 million in funding since inception.Concurrent with the investment, Accenture also said that it would partner with Paxata to include the Adaptive Information Platform and self-service application in the Accenture Insights Platform [AIP].As Accenture stated in the deal announcement:Accenture has not been a very active corporate investor in technology startups, investing in only a handful of startup companies.The graphic below shows its investment history by various metrics (click to enlarge),(Source: Mattermark)The data indicate that Accenture has invested most often in security and enterprise software companies in the B2B space and most often in the Series B stage.Geographic preference has been fairly widespread, which is not surprising given ACN’s global reach.While Accenture’s investment strategy is still unfolding via its recently-formalized Accenture Ventures unit, it appears to be taking an ‘invest and partner’ approach to working with startups.As companies like Accenture need to bring in more innovation due to the rate of technological change in business, I expect ACN to announce more partnership/investments in startups to keep pace.I write about IPOs at IPO Edge, M&A deals and public company investments in technology startups.

4228938,102404,2018-12-18T09:39:06-05:00,"Accenture offers strategy and consulting services and is especially focused on digital, cloud and security services.Revenue and EPS grow at a steady pace with margins very stable and return on invested capital in the high double-digits over the last decade.The company's brand name (and other intangible assets) as well as the switching costs create a wide economic moat for Accenture.In our opinion, Accenture's intrinsic value is $127 and the stock is therefore still overvalued.","In November, we already covered the credit rating agency company Moody’s Corporation (NYSE: MCO). Now we are looking at a similar company – Accenture plc (NYSE: ACN). Although the services Moody’s and Accenture offer are different in some ways – Moody’s main business are different credit ratings and Accenture offers strategy and IT consulting services – both companies operate in the service industry and offer consulting services for the biggest corporations in the world. And one of the main moat sources for both companies is the brand name.Like always, we will first describe how the company is generating revenue, look at the development during the past decade according to numbers like revenue, earnings per share, margins or return on invested capital. After describing the wide economic moat and taking a closer look at the dividend we will try to determine what we think is a fair price for Accenture and at what price we are willing to buy the stock.Accenture was founded 1989 in Ireland and has since then become one of the leading professional service companies in the world. In January 2001, the company changed its name from Andersen Consulting to Accenture and in July 2001, the stock had its initial public offering and shares began trading at the New York Stock Exchange.Accenture is a global company, although 45% of revenue are generated in North America and more than 35% of revenue are generated in Europe. But while Europe and North America grew “only” 9% in the last business year, the rest of the world grew 16% and is therefore one of the company’s growth drivers.(Source: Accenture Investor Presentation)Accenture’s revenue is distributed over five “operating groups” with “products” generating the highest revenue. The five operating groups are also the five reporting segments of Accenture and organized around 13 industry groups that serve clients globally in more than 40 industries. The operating groups assemble integrated client engagement teams, which typically consist of industry experts, capability specialists and professionals with local market knowledge.Aside from the five operating groups, Accenture is split up in different business dimensions, like Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting or Accenture Digital:Accenture’s revenue is mainly driven by the ability to maintain existing contracts with the biggest corporations in the world as well as the ability to secure new contracts and deliver services and solutions that add value relevant to the client’s needs.When looking at the past decade, Accenture could increase its revenue pretty stable from year to year since 2009, which is resulting in an average growth rate of 6.5% annually. Free cash flow and earnings per share fluctuated a bit more than revenue, but the overall trend is also upwards: free cash flow increased 7.1% on average during the last decade (especially in 2013, free cash flow declined in the higher double digits compared to the previous year); earnings per share also fluctuated and declined in 2014 and 2017, but on average EPS grew 11.2% annually.(Source: Own work based on numbers from Morningstar)When looking at the company’s margins – especially the growth and operating margin – we see great stability over the last decade. The gross margin is staying at about 30% and the operating margin was between 12% and 14% during the whole decade and with a slight upward trend. Aside from stable gross and operating margins, the return on invested capital as well as return on equity are extremely impressive. Although both were declining a little in the recent past, even the worst reported numbers (for 2018) are still above 40%.(Source: Own work based on numbers from Morningstar)The fact, that Roe and RoIC are almost identical indicates the company has almost no debt. At the end of August 2018, Accenture had about $19 million in long-term debt. Considering the $10.7 billion in shareholder’s equity, the resulting D/E ratio is 0.001. Additionally, Accenture has $5.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet. The only problem of an otherwise great balance sheet is $5.4 billion in goodwill.Accenture’s business model is not really recession-proof and Accenture might be affected by an economic slowdown similar to many other companies. During a recession, not many companies will enter into new contracts for business transformation services (unless they absolutely have to) or for strategy consulting as these are expenses many companies will cut during economic downturns. Many of Accenture’s contracts are only with 12 months duration and therefore clients could also cancel existing contracts in case of an economic downturn.Accenture is paying a semi-annual dividend and switched in 2010 from an annual dividend. The result of that switching process is a higher dividend in 2010 than in 2011, but since then, Accenture could increase its dividend every single year. In the last year, Accenture paid $2.66 as dividend to its investors, but the current semi-annual dividend is already $1.46 resulting in a dividend yield of 1.82%. In the last years, the payout ratio fluctuated about 40% but has increased since 2011 (it was about 30% back then).(Source: Own work based on numbers from Morningstar)During the last decade, the company could increase its dividend about 20% annually, but dividend growth slowed down in the last few years. As a consequence I would expect dividend increases in the low double-digits for the years to come.Usually, services companies like Accenture don’t have an economic moat for several reasons. Accenture is operating in a highly competitive business segment and is competing with a variety of organizations that offer similar services and solutions as Accenture (highly fragmented industry). Among the many competitors are the major consultancy firms like McKinsey or Boston Consulting Group or the companies specialized on accounting and audits like PricewaterhouseCoopers or Ernest & Young. To make matters worse, the barriers to enter are very low. It is very simple to start a consulting firm and provide services similar to Accenture. In many cases, there are no upfront costs necessary and everybody that has the knowledge and the skills (or that is fooling himself to have knowledge and skills) can try to consult other firms.Personnel costs are among the biggest expenses for Accenture and if other consulting firms can offer similar services but have lower salaries, they can offer cheaper prices and put Accenture under pressure. This is the reason, why Accenture has to fear especially the competition from India as costs are extremely low there. Another problem is in-house consulting of large corporations making external consulting firms like Accenture unnecessary.Despite the low barriers to enter, the fragmented industry and the intense competition, Accenture has pricing power which is stemming from two forms of competitive advantage – the brand name and switching costs. The brand name is responsible for attracting new customers and switching costs will keep existing customers from leaving.Accenture’s brand name (reputation probably might be a better term) will attract new customers. The fact, that Accenture is working or has worked with so many big, respected international companies helped Accenture gain a reputation and will attract new customers. If respected international corporations hire Accenture to consult them, other companies will tend to hire Accenture themselves. Accenture has also gained a big knowledge base and information about new trends and problems different companies might have by working with so many leading corporations all over the world.The brand name as source for a competitive advantage is belonging to the category of intangible assets. Accenture’s wide moat is stemming in parts from intangible assets. Not only due to its brand name, but also because of the over 4,200 patents and over 2,500 patent applications pending worldwide. To protect the Accenture brand, Accenture is also relying on intellectual property laws and trademark registrations held around the world.Another big success factor for Accenture is its ability not only to attract new customers but maintain long-lasting business relationships. A second competitive advantage are the high switching costs that will keep customers from leaving. According to Morningstar, 99 of the company’s top 100 clients have been with the firm for more than five years and 97 have been with the firm for more than 10 years. This underlines the stickiness of the business relationships as well as the high switching costs. There are several reasons why these high switching costs arise. First of all, the relationship between Accenture and its customers is often very intimate meaning that Accenture knows a lot about the company and has already gained a lot of information. In case of switching to another consulting firm, it would take several months for the new consulting firm to get to know the company as well as all the important details before the consulting process can start. Switching could not only be costly and take a lot of time, it could also be mission-critical for the company as the market environment doesn’t allow to take the time for instructing the new consulting firm.Like in past articles, we use a discount cash flow analysis to calculate an intrinsic value and determine a price at which we are willing to buy Accenture. For a simple two step discount cash flow model we need a growth rate for the next decade, we need a growth rate for perpetuity and we need a free cash flow to take as starting basis.When looking at the growth rates of the past decade, we see revenue increased 6.5% annually and earnings per share increased 7.1% every year. Calculating with 5% for the next decade is hence a realistic number we can work with. For perpetuity I would be a little more cautious as during the next decades a lot can happen. The growth rate we use for perpetuity in our calculation will hence be 4%. We have used similar numbers in the calculations of other companies whose economic moat is depending on the brand name. The brand name is not necessarily the best source for long-lasting competitive advantages and using more cautious growth rates makes sense.Like I have demonstrated in my article about Visa (NYSE: V), it could be a problem when we just use last year’s free cash flow as we are probably at the end of the cycle and the current free cash flow is probably extraordinary high and not good basis for a calculation. To get a feeling, how Accenture might behave during a recession, I added a screenshot from the 2009 10-K:(Source: Accenture 2009 10-K)When we look at the numbers during the last recession, we see revenue declining about 8.5% from 2008 to 2009, net income declined about 6% and operating income declined more than 12%. Of course, the next recession doesn’t have to be similar to the last one and we don’t know if it is going to be much worse for Accenture or if the company will manage just fine. In order to calculate with realistic numbers and not be overly optimistic, I would subtract about 15% from last year’s free cash flow as basis for our calculation.Using all those numbers as well as a 10% discount rate, we get an intrinsic value of $127.75 for Accenture. An intrinsic value calculation is no exact sciences and the margin for errors is quite huge. To compensate these additional risks, I would add a 20% margin of safety in our calculation which leads to a preferred entry point of $102.20.Compared to some other companies covered in this series like the credit card companies Mastercard (NYSE: MA) and Visa or the social networks Facebook (Nasdaq: FB) and Tencent (OTCPK: OTCPK:TCEHY), the growth rates of Accenture are only mediocre. And although Accenture can’t report double-digit growth rates, it is still an extraordinary company, which is growing at a steady pace, has a wide economic moat based on two different forms of competitive advantage and a great business model.Right now, Accenture is still overvalued and trading with a premium to what I would assume is its intrinsic value. And our central premise is still to buy undervalued stocks and Accenture is more than 35% away from our preferred entry point. Hence, like many other companies in this series, Accenture stays on our watchlist and we will wait what 2019 brings for us."
4128660,36431,2017-11-30T03:37:47-05:00,"Accenture remains a quality firm with above-average growth prospects.The company is growing bigger, but is it getting better?Bottom-line growth is expected to be in the double-digits.","Accenture (ACN) wrapped up its fiscal 2017 on a strong note, growing sales by 6% (7% in local currency), expanding its gross margin, and bumping its semi-annual dividend by 10%. I think shares could still be undervalued here, despite running up by over 25% in value so far this year - but this depends on a few factors going right, including retention of its above-average earnings multiple and sustained above-average growth in its bottom line.Despite growth in sales, free cash flow, and earnings per share (when adjusted for one-time charges), Accenture's return on invested capital continues to sink.ACN Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YChartsThe company also experienced a one-time charge that affected its operating income; and according to the company's 8-K form, excluding the impact of the pension settlement charge, operating income for fiscal 2017 was $5.14 billion. That puts net operating profit after tax, or NOPAT, at roughly $3.96 billion (using the adjusted effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 of 23%, provided in the firm's 8-K), and adjusted ROIC closer to 47.83%.While this is a far cry from the ROIC in the high-sixties to low-seventies range it was able to achieve from 2008 through 2013, Accenture is still churning out a very impressive return on invested capital. It's still an above average number, and likely far in excess of its cost of capital. The only worry is the sustained downtrend, which tells me that even though the firm is growing bigger, it might not be growing better.Accenture's return on equity has also continued its descent. I created the below DuPont (using data from its 10-K) to gain some better insight into what's been driving it lower.Its ROE looks to be all over the place at first glance, but the firm also has some items on its income statements for fiscal 2016 and 2017; most notably, the gain on sale of one of its businesses in 2016 and pension-related charges in 2017. Below, I adjusted fiscal 2017 and 2016's numbers using data provided by management below.Return on equity was much lower in 2016 after stripping out the one-time gain, but still higher than fiscal 2017's return on equity.Operating margins increased year-over-year, which is encouraging, and the drop in leverage means less magnification of the firm's ROE. Leverage increases ROE, but it's been dropping at Accenture over the past decade, largely because the growth in equity is outpacing the growth in its assets.Looking at the sinking asset turnover ratio, efficiency has dropped as well. It appears that the company is generating its growing revenues from more and more assets, which isn't surprising given the firm's acquisitive nature. The numerous acquisitions could also help explain the ballooning goodwill filling up the balance sheet:This bloats overall assets, and in turn likely drags down its asset turnover. If we held leverage constant year-over-year, I think Accenture's ROE would have largely been flat, or slightly higher, year-over-year - as the drop in efficiency wasn't enough to drag down the increase in margins and better tax rate.So to sum things up, it appears Accenture is adding a lot of ""air"" onto the balance sheet, probably as a result of acquisitions, which is distorting some of its capital allocation ratios downwards. The increase in the company's equity year-over-year outpaced the growth in assets, dropping leverage in the process.It appears that the strong underlying fundamentals of the business remain intact, however, if we ignore the fact that the decreasing leverage is leaking steam out of the ROE balloon, while the increasing goodwill is also simultaneously decreasing asset turnover - which in turn is dragging down overall ROE as well. Margins continued to expand with revenues, year-over-year, however, which is a good sign.If we cast aside management's decreasing capital allocation skills, the overall business still appears healthy and above-average. It's just not as above-average as it could be, in my opinion - but it's hard to complain about a company that earns ROIC that almost touches 50%.Accenture trades at a premium to both its five-year average price-to-earnings ratio and its thirteen-year median multiple, which are 18.3 and 17.42 times earnings, respectively.The company is expected to grow EPS by almost 11% this year and another 9% after that. If we consider this and place these growth rates in context with the amount of growth currently embedded in the share price, I think we can get a better glimpse of underlying value.If we assume a conservative discount rate range of 10% to 12%, shares look undervalued, considering EPS is expected to grow 2x to 3x faster in fiscal 2018 than what's currently implied by the share price. They still look undervalued on a growth basis even if we assume a high 15% discount rate. This is assuming it can continue to grow the bottom line by double-digits going forward.Accenture has had a nice run-up in value this year, but I still think shares could be a little undervalued here at 22.43 times expected 2018 EPS and just 20.55 times 2019's estimates. This also assumes, however, that the market is willing to continue to pay a premium price for shares versus what it has paid in the past.It remains an above-average operation, despite sinking capital allocation ratios. This tells me that it's a business with excellent underlying economics, but run by an average management team. Analysts expect earnings to grow at a slightly faster rate over the next five years than they did over the past five, and if Accenture proves this to be true, perhaps the elevated multiple (versus history) will be proven to be justified.If ""reversion to the mean"" back to an 18 times earnings multiple (or lower) occurs, however, there could also be double-digit downside risk - so I think that the retention of an elevated multiple is important and execution risk is high going forward. I'd say the downside risk is greater than the benefits of the potential upside in the short term, therefore.If you enjoyed this article and would like to receive further updates and articles in the future, please feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button at the top of the page next to the author's name."
4159273,101430,2018-03-27T14:41:10-04:00,"Accenture produced another solid quarter.Accenture is a innovative, shareholder-friendly company.On a technical basis, Accenture looks attractive.Investment risks are considered.","When the market pulls back like it has done recently, its a great time to take a look at buying some solid companies that have come down in price. A company I like and I own is Accenture (ACN). For those of you not familiar with Accenture, they call themselves a “leading global professional services company.” Simply put, they are business consultants. I like their business model and I think that this recent decline in the stock price is an excellent opportunity to pick up a quality company. This article will quickly review their most recent quarterly numbers, look at their business model, look at the current stock price using technical analysis, and finally take a look at the risks of investing in Accenture. Accenture reported their most recent quarterly numbers last week. For its most recent quarter ending February 28, 2018 Accenture posted year over year revenue growth of almost 15%. They earned $1.37 per share. While doing so their operating expenses also grew 15%. Accenture generated $1.6B in free cash flow during the quarter.Accenture reports five operating groups and they are: Communications, Media & Technology; Financial Services; Health & Public Service; Products; and Resources. Of the five operating groups the Communications and Media & Technology teams had the most revenue growth at over 19% year over year. That operating group also grew its operating income almost 47% year over year. Additionally, the Communications, Media & Technology operating group provides Accenture with its biggest operating margin of over 16%.Accenture is a global company broken down into three geographic areas: North America, Europe, and Growth Markets. Its revenue percentage growth increased by double digits in Europe and in Accenture’s Growth Markets. This area was led by Australia, Japan, Brazil, and Singapore. The North American market grew by eight percent.Accenture is a consulting company with a business model that I like. They operate globally in more than 120 countries. Their clients are in more than 40 industries. They are an innovative company with more than 6,000 patents. They constantly perform research, partner with other companies on projects, and invest in new technologies, all to deliver better products and services to their customers. This constant innovation is the reason I like Accenture’s business model. They are constantly looking for innovative ways to provide better solutions for their customers. Currently, Accenture is developing block chain technology, working in artificial intelligence, cloud technology, digital security, and more. They do this several ways. One, by proprietary research and development efforts through their in-house labs and studios. Two, by partnering with academic institutions such as MIT and Singular University. Three, by partnering with established companies or by investing in new technology companies. For example, Accenture has partnered with DHL and developed blockchain technology for the logistics industry, and in particular for the shipping of pharmaceutical products. In addition to being an innovative company, they are a shareholder-friendly company. They produce sizable free cash flow that they use to increase their dividends, which are paid semi-annually, and to buy back shares on the open market. Accenture has raised its dividend for 13 consecutive years. The upcoming dividend, payable in May, will be $1.33 which is a semi-annual dividend. This represents a 10% increase over the previous year’s dividend. While the current yield of 1.6% isn’t comparable to a utility stock, Accenture’s five year dividend growth rate of 12% is appealing to me. They are able to do that because they are well managed and fiscally responsible. Their balance sheet shows a current ratio of over 1.3.Accenture’s diluted share count decreased a scant .75% as the number of shares outstanding was reduced by almost 5 million shares. Accenture management has stated that they intend to devote a significant portion of their cash generated from operations for repurchasing shares in the open market during the remainder of 2018. Accenture has guided free cash flow for 2018 to be $4.6 - $4.9B.Looking at Chart 1 below, it is easy to see the recent decline in Accenture’s stock price that I think presents a buying opportunity. My bullish technical opinion is due to the configuration of the moving averages and the reading of the relative strength index.Chart 1 – Accenture Weekly ChartStarting with the two moving averages you can see that the 10 week moving average is above a rising 40 week moving average. For those of you that follow my monthly series of articles you may recall that the moving averages are in bullish alignment when the two moving averages are configured this way; the shorter term moving average is on top of the longer term moving average. The moving averages show that Accenture is clearly in a bullish trend and I look for that trend to continue. The relative strength index is an oscillator that traditionally is considered to show a stock to be overbought, and therefore subject to a decline, when the index goes above 70. When the index drops below 30 that is when a stock is considered to be oversold and then subject to a rise in price. A more modern interpretation of the oscillator is that in a bull market, which I believe we are in, an oversold condition exists when the index declines to the 40 level, and an overbought condition is when the index climbs above the 80 level. The blue arrows on Chart 1 show the times that the weekly relative strength index has declined below the 50 level. The previous three times this has happened has shown to be excellent buying opportunities. The three previous times the relative strength index has dipped below 50 Accenture has tested its 40 week moving average which it is coming close to now. The moving average convergence divergence indicator (MACD), shown in the lower panel of Chart 1, recently crossed over and is heading lower. This is a bearish indication for Accenture and a more conservative approach to investing in Accenture would be to wait until the MCAD stabilizes and starts to rise.The risks of investing in Accenture are as follows: first, Accenture is directly tethered to the economy. If the economy goes into a recession, Accenture will feel the effects as their consulting business will decrease. Second, while the stock is attractive at this price, it is not selling at a bargain basement price. Consequently, investors today could see Accenture's stock price stay at these levels for quite some time even though earnings rise. This would allow for the earnings per share to catch up to the price of the stock. Lastly, Accenture is susceptible to the type of data breach or computer hack that would make it lose credibility with its clients. In summary, Accenture’s most recent quarter was in line with my expectations, actually beating market expectations slightly. Accenture is a well-managed, shareholder-friendly company that is constantly innovating and applying those innovations in ways that help their clients improve their business. From a technical standpoint, there are a few reasons to think that the recent decline in the share price is a good time to add to your position or establish a new position in Accenture. Even though there are risks to investing in Accenture, I think now is a good time for long term investors to buy or accumulate Accenture."

The company also raised its fiscal 2018 guidance and management now expects to achieve double-digit EPS growth (10-13%) for the current year. As you can expect, Accenture's beat and raise was well-received by the market.Taking a step back, this company has reported impressive operating results over the last few quarters, so investors should not be surprised that ACN shares are outperforming the broader market by a wide margin so far in 2017.Source: NasdaqACN shares are up big in 2017 and the company's stock is trading at a relatively high valuation (more on this below), but, in my opinion, Accenture is still a long-term buy at today's price.Accenture reported Q1 2018 adjusted EPS of $1.79 on net revenues of $9.5B, which beat top- and bottom-line analysts' estimates. Moreover, the company's Q1 2018 adjusted EPS and net revenues were up 13% and 10%, respectively, from the same period of the prior year. Source: Q1 2018 Earnings PresentationAs shown, 4 out of 5 of the company's operating units reported double-digit net revenue growth for the quarter and the 5th unit (i.e., Health & Public Service) had growth in the high single digits. I was really encouraged by the company’s broad-based revenue growth, in addition to the strong new bookings number ($10B), but I believe that the growth reported for the company’s digital, cloud, and security services businesses (i.e., ""The New"") was the major takeaway from the Q1 2018 earnings release.The New now accounted for approximately 55% of the company’s total revenues and the growth has been tremendous since it was launched 4 years ago (net revenue up 3x). Plus, The New does not appear to be slowing down anytime soon, which means that these operations should continue to move the needle for this company through 2018 and beyond. This was actually a topic that management highlighted during the Q1 2018 conference call:The company has three main pillars of growth in the digital space - Accenture Interactive, Accenture Industry X.0, and Accenture Applied Intelligence (all discussed in great detail in the conference call that is linked above) - that will be key growth drivers in the years ahead and, in my opinion, the company’s differentiated digital capabilities will create a lot of shareholder value over the next 12-18 months.It is important to note that Accenture is not a one-trick pony either, as shown by the fact that the company's largest operating unit by revenue, Products, recorded its 10th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth.Source: Q1 2018 Supporting MaterialsMore importantly, looking forward, management believes that Accenture is in a position to benefit from improving market conditions. To this point, management raised the company’s fiscal 2018 guidance:Accenture's fundamentals are strong and its business prospects will likely to improve over the next 3 quarters. Long-term shareholders will be happy to hear that management also expects to return at least $4.3B through dividend and share buybacks, with intentions of retiring ~1% of total shares outstanding in 2018.Accenture's stock is trading at a premium when compared to its peer group.ACN PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsBut let's remember that Accenture is in growth mode while IBM (IBM) and HP's (HPQ) - peers per Morningstar - growth has slowed over the last three years.ACN Revenue (3 Year Growth) data by YChartsAccenture's strong net revenue growth is one of the main reasons why I believe that the premium valuation is warranted, and it is encouraging that the Street is on the same page.Word From The StreetAnalysts are currently bullish on Accenture with 7 ""Strong Buys"" and an average price target of $156 per share.Source: Yahoo! FinanceAdditionally, Cantor Fitzgerald recently raised their price target for Accenture to $180 per share (from $151 per share) and maintain the Overweight rating for the company.At 23x forward earnings, Accenture is what I would consider richly priced, but this company deserves a premium valuation. Moreover, I believe that the company will grow into its current valuation in short order as current estimates will likely be increased in the quarters ahead.As described throughout this article, Accenture is highly levered to the digital space so any major disruption to The New would significantly impact the company's business prospects.Additionally, reputation risk is an importation consideration because Accenture is the go-to consultant in its industry. Specifically, ACN shares are trading at a premium to its peers (and the market), so a negative shift in investor sentiment would materially impact the company's stock price.Accenture's stock is richly valued, but, in my opinion, this company deserves to trade at a premium. My biggest takeaway from the company's Q1 2018 results (and management commentary) was that management appears to have Accenture well-positioned for the future, especially in the digital consulting space. In addition, as described in this article, market conditions for Accenture continue to improve and this should bode well for the company (and its shareholders) over the next five plus years.As such, investors with a time horizon longer than two-to-three years should consider any significant pullbacks as buying opportunities.Author's Note: Accenture is a core holding in the R.I.P. portfolio, and I have no plans to reduce my stake in the near future.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned. These are only my personal opinions. Every investor must do his/her own due diligence before making any investment decision."
4116678,89805,2017-10-26T07:46:42-04:00,,"Accenture (NYSE:ACN) has raised its dividend every year since it began paying one in 2005, recording annualized dividend growth in excess of 20% during that time period.With healthy payout ratios, excellent free cash flow generation, a clean balance sheet, and proven durability, Accenture is well-positioned to continue rewarding shareholders with strong dividend growth in the years ahead.Furthermore, while the continued rise of the digital age is creating challenges for many companies, Accenture stands to be a beneficiary of many of these trends.Let's take a closer look at Accenture to see if this dividend growth stock looks attractive today.Accenture is one of the largest professional services companies in the world and provides a range of end-to-end services and solutions in strategy, consulting, digital technology, and operations. Accenture develops and implements technology solutions to improve its clients' productivity and efficiency.The company was started in the 1950s and now serves more than 40 industries, delivering virtually every business function needed by its customers.Accenture's clients include 94 of the Fortune Global 100 and over 75% of the Fortune Global 500. Approximately, 54% of Accenture's revenue is generated from consulting with the remaining 46% from outsourcing activities.By geography, North America is the company's largest region and accounts for 48% of total revenue. Europe generates another 35% of revenue, and the remaining 17% is from growth markets such as Brazil.By operating group, Accenture generates 26% of its sales from Products (consumer goods, retail, travel services, industrial, life sciences), 21% from Financial Services (banking, capital markets, insurance), 20% from Communications, Media & Tech, 18% from Health & Public Service, and 15% from Resources (chemicals, energy, utilities, natural resources).Accenture's competitive advantages begin with its long operating history, wide range of services, and focus on developing its people.The company has been in business for more than 60 years, which has given it the time needed to establish long-lasting customer relationships and build out its portfolio of skills and services.The longer Accenture works with a client, the more ingrained it becomes in the client's business processes and key strategic issues. As a result, switching costs are created that help with client retention.For example, 98 of the firm's top 100 clients have worked with Accenture for at least 10 years. The firm was a part of Forbes' top global brands' list for the sixth consecutive year and was also one of the top 25 companies on the Barron's 500 list for the second year in a row.Few companies can match the breadth and reach of Accenture's services, which is a requirement to serve large multinational clients. The company has offices in 55 countries around the world and is able to deliver end-to-end solutions virtually anywhere.Accenture delivers its services through around a dozen focused industry groups and consistently acquires smaller rivals to round out its services. The company has invested about $3.4 billion in nearly 70 acquisitions over its last three fiscal years (including $1.7 billion in fiscal 2017 itself) to enhance its skills and gain scale in key growth areas such as digital.Some of its recent acquisitions include Cloud Sherpas, a leading cloud advisory and services provider; IMJ Corporation, one of Japan's largest digital marketing agencies; and several European digital services companies.As the pace of technological advancements accelerates, Accenture is becoming an even more important partner for its clients because it helps them be the digital disruptors rather than the disrupted.From 3D printing, cloud computing, data analytics, artificial intelligence, and security to virtual reality and robotics, Accenture plays a leading role in helping its clients go more digital with their products and services.Digital-related, cloud-related, and security-related services now represent close to 50% of Accenture's revenue and are growing at a strong double-digit clip. Their share has continued to gain sharply from 40% of total revenues a year ago and 30% the year before.Accenture seems to have a clear lead in the digital arena, which is fueling a lot of the company's growth. For example, Accenture is the number one enterprise services provider for the cloud.The company provides cloud services for nearly 80% of the Fortune 100 and is the number one provider to all of the leading players in the ecosystem today such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), SAP (NYSE:SAP), and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).Above all else, Accenture is a human capital business. The firm's services are provided by its people, and the company must differentiate based on its expertise and trust accumulated with clients.To stay ahead of the pack, Accenture spends heavily on its employees. The company invested more than $940 million on training and development in fiscal year 2016. This is almost double the amount that Accenture invested in property and equipment and represented more than $2,400 per employee.With over 425,000 employees, including thousands of PhDs, web developers, data scientists, digital marketers, and big data specialists, Accenture's skilled workforce would be very hard to replicate - especially on a global scale.As a capital-light business, Accenture also benefits from being able to adapt its business model somewhat more easily to changing conditions. The company can hire, train, or acquire new personnel to fill holes in its services portfolio and stay ahead of trends. This is much easier than retooling a large manufacturing factory.Headcount can also be adjusted up or down based on the economy's strength, helping Accenture better manage its profitability throughout economic cycles.A final strength of the firm is its diversity. Approximately 80% of its revenue is derived from nine industry markets, and Accenture's nine largest geographic markets also account for close to 80% of sales. The firm's top 150 clients account for around half of total revenue, too.Simply put, Accenture is a very durable business with numerous intangible assets (e.g. brand recognition; skilled workforce; long-term client relationships) that make it hard to disrupt.With that said, every business still faces risks.Accenture believes that 25% of the world's economy will be digital by 2020, up from 15% in 2005.While the ongoing shift to digital is helping a large chunk of Accenture's business today, it goes without saying that the digital revolution is causing many companies to face an unprecedented amount of change - including Accenture.One example would be the rise of software-as-a-service (SaaS), which is taking market share from on-premise deployments of software.SaaS deployments are smaller in size, resulting in less revenue available for parts of Accenture's outsourcing business, which is witnessing a continuous decline (the company faces stiff competition from the likes of Indian outsourcers like Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH), Infosys (NYSE:INFY), Wipro (NYSE:WIT) and TCS (OTCPK:TTNQY)).IBM (NYSE:IBM) has certainly been caught off guard by a number of technological advancements (e.g. cloud computing), which have really hurt its business in recent years.While Accenture has arguably been a first mover in the digital space, other companies are fast catching up and making major investments in this area. Accenture also faces competition in its consulting area from the Big 4 consulting and audit firms such as Deloitte, KPMG, PWC, and E&Y.These companies have similar industry capabilities and are making huge investments into digital capabilities such as analytics, cybersecurity, and automation.Companies such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) could also emerge as new rivals as they continue to control an increasingly massive pool of valuable data for businesses and consumers.For now, however, Accenture's core businesses have continued to grow. The company's digital offerings have also done extremely well, but it's worth keeping an eye on the impact technology changes could have on Accenture's business model and long-term earnings power.Besides technological changes, most of Accenture's markets are extremely competitive. The company's long-term future could be hurt if cheaper overseas competitors begin to pressure the industry's pricing model or if clients move some of Accenture's services in-house.For now, Accenture's favorable competitive positioning appears to be on solid ground.We analyze 25+ years of dividend data and 10+ years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend.Our Dividend Safety Score answers the question, ""Is the current dividend payment safe?"" We look at some of the most important financial factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios, debt levels, free cash flow generation, industry cyclicality, ROIC trends, and more.Dividend Safety Scores range from 0 to 100, and conservative dividend investors should stick with firms that score at least 60. Since tracking the data, companies cutting their dividends had an average Dividend Safety Score below 20 at the time of their dividend reduction announcements.We wrote a detailed analysis reviewing how Dividend Safety Scores are calculated, what their real-time track record has been, and how to use them for your portfolio here.Accenture's Dividend Safety Score of 100 suggests that the company's dividend is one of the safest in the market. The company's solid payout ratios serve as the first support of Accenture's healthy rating.Over the last four quarters, Accenture's dividend payments have consumed 44% of the earnings and 35% of the free cash flow that the company has generated.As seen below, Accenture's dividend payout ratios have increased over the last decade and hovered close to 40% in recent years. This is a healthy level because it provides plenty of room for future dividend growth and a nice margin of safety in case business fundamentals unexpectedly declined.Besides payout ratios, a company's recession performance is another important factor to consider when evaluating dividend safety. Cyclical companies that experience large swings in sales and earnings can be more vulnerable to future dividend cuts.Accenture performed fairly well during the last recession. As seen below, the company's sales only dipped by 8% in fiscal year 2009, and its operating margin remained resilient. The company's stock also outperformed the S&P 500 by nearly 30% in 2008.Accenture's business performed relatively well throughout the recession because its services are needed by businesses through each stage of the economic cycle. As technology continues advancing, companies must continue investing in innovation and productivity to remain competitive.Accenture can also help companies reduce their spending, save costs, and better align their operations with future opportunities.Another factor supporting Accenture's strong Dividend Safety Score is the firm's consistent free cash flow generation. Without free cash flow, companies cannot continue paying dividends unless they issue debt or equity.Accenture has generated positive free cash flow each year for more than a decade, highlighting the quality of its asset-light business model. The company even grew its free cash flow per share each year during the last recession.Studying a company's balance sheet is also critical to gain an understanding of its dividend safety. Businesses will always make debt payments before distributing dividends, and companies with too much debt can be at greater risk of dividend cuts if financial results unexpectedly deteriorate.Accenture's balance sheet is in fantastic shape. As seen below, the company has $4.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet and practically no debt. It maintains investment grade credit ratings and could cover its current dividend payment for nearly three years just by using its cash on hand.Overall, Accenture's dividend is extremely safe. The company maintains healthy payout ratios, generates consistent free cash flow, earns strong returns, and has a rock solid balance sheet.Accenture began paying dividends in late 2005, and the company has increased its dividend every year since then. With a 10-year dividend growth streak, Accenture is a member of the Dividend Achievers list.As seen below, Accenture's historical dividend growth has been excellent. The company's dividend has increased by approximately 21% per year over the last decade and grown at a double-digit annual rate over the last five years.The company's last dividend increase was a 10% boost earlier this year, and investors should be aware that Accenture pays its dividends on a semi-annual schedule.Dividend growth over the next few years will likely sit in the upper single-digit range, tracking Accenture's underlying earnings growth.However, if management wanted to, they could probably grow Accenture's dividend at a meaningfully faster rate considering the company's practically debt-free balance sheet, $4 billion hoard of cash, stable business fundamentals, and healthy payout ratios near 40%.Shares of Accenture trade at a forward P/E ratio of 21.3 and offer a dividend yield of 1.9%, which is somewhat lower than the stock's five-year average dividend yield of 2.1%.Accenture estimates that its market is growing close to 4% per year, while the company is growing faster than its peers.Over the long run, it seems unlikely that Accenture would be able to grow much faster than the overall market given its existing large size (over $30 billion in annual revenue) and the law of large numbers.If Accenture clocks in mid single-digit revenue growth over the long term (the company is expecting 5%-8% growth in revenues in fiscal 2018), it seems reasonable to expect the company's underlying earnings per share to grow at a somewhat faster pace - perhaps mid- to upper single-digit annual growth (and EPS growth of 8%-12% in fiscal 2018).For comparison's sake, Accenture's earnings per share and free cash flow per share have compounded at 13.7% and 6% per year, respectively, over the last five years.Under these assumptions, Accenture's annual total return potential could be between 9% and 11% (1.9% dividend yield plus 7% to 9% annual earnings growth).Overall, the stock appears to be somewhat reasonably priced for long-term dividend growth investors but certainly doesn't look like a bargain. High quality businesses rarely go on sale.Accenture provides timeless services (consulting and outsourcing), benefits from its brand recognition and breadth of services, participates in extremely large and fragmented markets, and has a long runway for earnings and dividend growth thanks to its material exposure to digital-related, cloud-related, and security-related services.Dividend growth investors should keep an eye on this high quality stock. While Accenture's dividend yield is relatively low, making the stock less appropriate for income investors looking for the best high dividend stocks, the company's long-term total return potential remains solid."
4109656,55342,2017-09-26T16:55:46-04:00,Accenture is scheduled to report its Q4 earnings on Thursday before the market opens.The company's recent track record of trumping Wall Street estimates has not been that great.Can Accenture beat estimates this time?,"Accenture (ACN) is expected to report its Q4 2017 earnings on September 28, before market open. Accenture shares closed the last trading session at a price of $138.16 a share, just a few cents below its all-time high of $138.27 which was hit in the last trading session only. The stock has had a good run after the post Q3 earnings sell-off, gaining more than 13% since then, handily outperforming the Nasdaq, which is up nearly 2.15% in the same time frame. The big question going into the earnings announcement is: Will the upcoming earnings announcement help ACN stock maintain its good run? Also, will the Q4 2017 earnings announcement lift Accenture stock to fresh all-time highs? Let's take a closer look.Wall Street expects Accenture to report non-GAAP earnings of $1.46 per share on a revenue of $9 billion. The estimates compare against earnings of $1.31 on a top line of $8.49 billion in the year ago quarter, implying 11.45% earnings growth and a top line growth of 6%, on a year-over-year basis. On the Q3 earnings call, management issued guidance for 5% to 8% revenue growth between $8.85B and $9.10B.On the bottom line front, Accenture management lowered its EPS guidance for FY 2017 from a $5.70 - $5.87 range to a $5.37 - $5.44 range. including the pension settlement. This would imply a YoY growth of just 1.31%, at the midpoint.Accenture doesn't have a solid history of trumping Wall Street estimates. As per the Estimize database, Accenture has beaten the Wall Street consensus on the earnings front six out of the last eight quarters. The company was only able to meet the estimates in its last quarter earnings. Accenture has beaten the top end of Wall Street estimates in only one out of the last eight reported quarters.Source: estimizeComing to the revenue numbers, management issued revenue guidance in six out of the last eight quarters. Accenture went on to beat the high end of the guidance as well as the high-end estimate of Wall Street estimates in four out of those six quarters. Looking at the most recent four quarter time frame, Accenture has missed the Wall Street estimates in two of the last four reported quarters.Source: estimizeACN stock has a history of making big movements in response to earnings announcements. Following the last four earnings release, the stock has lost 2.3%, on average, in the trading session immediately following an earnings release.An important point to be noted here is that the discouraging post-earnings movement of ACN stock in three of the last four quarters is because of the company missing on earnings or revenue metric or result not as per expectations, so a beat in Q4 could reverse the trend the stock has fallen in. The big question now is will Accenture deliver an earnings beat tomorrow?Given the recent earnings history, which has seen the company failing to live up to expectations, it could be a real challenge for Accenture to deliver an earnings surprise/revenue beat in Q4 2017. However, since the company already has set the bar low by reducing the guidance in the last quarter earnings call, a narrow beat could be on the cards. The possibility of a narrow earnings beat is also supported by the ACN Q4 2017 earnings whisper number, which at $1.48 implies a 2 cent beat, or a 1.36% earnings surprise.The stock currently trades at pretty steep valuations in comparison to its own historical valuations. The current valuations bake in significant growth expectations, and any miss in Q4 could prove costly again for investors. More than an earnings beat, FY 18 outlook will be very crucial as Q3 proved. Further, the stock is overbought or near overbought territory as per popular technical indicators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Bollinger Bands. The stock needs more than an earnings beat to take it to new all-time highs. Hence, we believe Accenture stock is a hold going into the earnings release. In light of this, conservative long-term investors looking for initiating fresh positions in Accenture stock should wait for any post-earnings pullback, which might be a good opportunity to buy into the stock. There are reports of a dividend hike announcement on the earnings call which also investors need to watch for."

Since the previous article was published, ACN shares have greatly outperformed the broader market.(Source: Nasdaq)The outperformance has been impressive since that point in time, but I believe that ACN shares still have room to run because this company has proved again and again that it has great long-term business prospects in place.(Image Source)On September 28, 2017, Accenture reported impressive top- and bottom-line growth for the final quarter of its fiscal 2017. Moreover, the company's quarterly results were good from top to bottom, as two of the three geographic regions had double-digit net revenue growth and all five operating groups experience top-line growth.(Source: Q4 2017 Infographic)The company's net revenue growth was aided by the fact that the digital, cloud, and security services (dubbed ""The New"") accounted for over 50% of revenue for the quarter --up from 40% a year ago and 30% from two years ago. To this point, management has long described The New as the key growth driver for Accenture and it appears that everything is already beginning to fall into place.(Source: Q4 2017 Infographic)As shown, this category grew by ~30% in local currency in fiscal 2017 and management does not anticipate for the growth to slow anytime soon. For example, management highlighted the opportunities that Accenture has within the digital, cloud and security spaces during the Q4 2017 conference call and, more importantly, they guided for ""strong double-digit growth in The New in fiscal '18"".From a bottom-line perspective, Accenture finished fiscal 2017 with a strong quarter as Q4 adjusted EPS was up 13% YoY (to $1.48) and operating margins expanded by 10 bps (to 14.2%). For full-year 2017, Accenture's adjusted EPS came in at $5.91 (11% YoY increase) on operating margins of 14.8% (20 bps increase).This was a great fiscal year for Accenture but, looking forward, management still anticipates for this company to have a strong fiscal 2018. It helps management's case that the numbers prove that Accenture has a promising growth profile, as new bookings came in at $10.1B for Q4 2017 and $38.4B (6% YoY increase) for full-year fiscal 2017. During the conference call, management providing the following full-year fiscal 2018 outlook:There was a lot to like about Accenture's results for Q4 and full-year fiscal 2017 but I believe that investors should begin to bake in expectations for this company to report strong top- and bottom-line growth for at least the next few years.Not only has Accenture been busy in the M&A space (spent $1.7B in fiscal 2017 on small tuck-in acquisitions) but the company has also been making important partnership deals with major players in several key industries. A few recent examples are:Additionally, as an long-term investor in Accenture, it is hard not to get too excited about the Internet of Things (or IoT) predictions because this company is viewed as the go-to service provider in this industry that is expected to experience significant growth over the next few decades. (Source: Gartner)As shown, Gartner predicts that almost all new tech products (95%) will contain some type of IoT component by 2020. Furthermore, to put a dollar figure to the predictions, McKinsey & Company expects for IoT technology services to have a CAGR of 17% over the next five years and to reach $143B in spending by 2021.(Source: McKinsey & Company)Any way you slice it, IoT is going to play a critical role in the global economy for years to come. Therefore, investors in Accenture should be encouraged that the company reported strong results over the past 12 months, but, in my opinion, the company's growth prospects are what should make you the most excited about an investment in this industry leader.Accenture reported impressive operating results for Q4 and full-year fiscal 2017 but I believe that the focus should be on the company's promising growth profile. Given this, the strong fiscal 2018 guidance should be viewed as only the starting point because this company has several long-term catalysts in place that should help propel the stock price higher over the next three-to-five years. Yes, Accenture appears fairly valued based on current earnings estimates (i.e. P/E ratio of ~20), but, in my opinion, the investment opportunity looks more attractive the further you look out.Accenture is well-positioned to capitalize on the digitization megatrend, which has the potential to be a multi-decade growth opportunity for this company. Given this, investors with a long-term prospective should consider adding ACN shares at the current level.Author's Note: ACN is a small (but growing) position in my R.I.P. portfolio.If you found this article to be informative and would like to hear more about this company, or any other company that I analyze, please consider hitting the ""Follow"" button above.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

4083436,36431,2017-06-23T03:38:21-04:00,"ACN ended down by almost 4% after reporting earnings.
        It's an elite business, with excellent capital allocation.
        Valuations aren't great, but they're becoming reasonable.","Accenture PLC (NYSE:ACN) fell by over 6% at one point on Thursday, presumably due to weaker-than-expected guidance.ACN Price data by YChartsI think ACN is an elite business, one that's now sitting on the top of my watchlist. Here's why.Enviable capital allocation metrics and strong balance sheetACN earned roughly 54.34% return on invested capital in fiscal 2016, which is stellar. It accomplished this with a balance sheet that is basically all equity and hardly any debt. As I was flipping through the notes to the financial statements in its most recent annual report, however, I noticed that ACN does utilize a sizable amount of off-balance sheet financing in the form of operating leases.I created the below chart (and all others in the rest of the article, unless otherwise noted) in Excel.Because there isn't any good way to judge an appropriate discount rate for ACN's leases (there's no indication of capital lease rates), I decided to use IBM's pretax cost of debt. If you think this rate is too low, I also ran the numbers at the 5% mark, which would put the adjusted debt-to-equity ratio at roughly 0.31x. By theoretically capitalizing these noncancelable operating lease obligations, we can get a gauge of how they would effect the overall capital structure.This also has implications for return on invested capital. First, we need to adjust operating profit, or EBIT.Now, taking taxes into effect, we can determine an adjusted net operating profit after tax, or NOPAT, numerator.After dividing NOPAT by the adjusted capital base, we get a significantly lower ROIC number, but it's still an elite number that is easily higher than the firm's likely cost of capital. If we used a higher 5% discount rate, I calculated adjusted ROIC at roughly 38.70%.This is a moat in numbers, adding to the more qualitative moat the firm has if looking at the stickiness of its business. According to Morningstar, 97 of the company's top 100 clients (by revenue) have been with the firm for at least 10 years.The equity slice, just as attractiveNow I'd like to analyze just the equity portion of the capital structure pie with the below DuPont analysis.The company's leverage has decreased, leading to less magnification of its return on equity, but asset turnover has also been sinking along with it. Still, the company's ROE bounced back in fiscal 2016 after falling in 2015. Things aren't always as they seem, though.ACN had a notable gain on the sale of a business in 2016, to the tune of $848,823 (in thousands), so I'd like to adjust for this one-time gain.By my calculations, underlying ROE fell for a third straight year, but leverage is also almost 13% lower than in fiscal 2014. Applying the same leverage ratio as 2014 would (in theory) put 2016's ROE back around 55%. It is also encouraging that operating margins have improved.Was this quarter really that bad?Now that I've illustrated why I'm such a fan of the business, I'd like to look at yesterday's events. Perhaps guidance wasn't great, but revenues increased by 7% in local currencies and 5% in USD. About half of these revenues came from ""The New"" segment - encompassing cloud, digital, and security services - which experienced double-digit growth. Headline ROE and ROIC appear to have continued their slide for the first 3 quarters of the year, but I'll hold judgment until the year is up and I have a 10-K to look at.As of Thursday's close, valuations have been pushed down to 20.83 times estimated 2017 earnings and 19.08 times forward earnings. Hardly cheap in absolute terms, but getting close to where I'd feel comfortable paying up for some ACN shares, especially considering the overall market's valuations and ACN's superior business quality and growth prospects.If you enjoyed this article and would like to receive further updates and articles in the future, please feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button at the top of the page by the author's name."

In my opinion, investors with a long-term perspective should treat the pullback as a buying opportunity because Accenture's long-term story is still intact.The Q3 2017 Results, Good From Top To BottomThe company reported adjusted EPS of $1.52 ($1.05 if the pension settlement charge is included) on revenues of $8.9b.(Source: Q3 2017 Earnings Presentation)More importantly, Accenture reported top-line results that were impressive almost across the board, as each of the company's operating groups had YoY net revenue growth.(Source: Q3 2017 Earnings Presentation)Additionally, the company continued to experience strong growth in ""The New"" category, which includes digital, cloud, and security services. This category again had double-digit growth and now accounts for ~50% of Accenture's total revenue. The company's CEO, Pierre Nanterme, highlighted just how important The New will be to Accenture in the years ahead:I believe that Accenture is well-positioned for the ongoing digital transformation that is occurring across the globe. To put the company's potential market opportunity into context, a BI survey shows that an estimated $6 trillion (yes, trillion) will be invested in Internet of Things (""IoT"") solutions in the coming years.(Source: businessinsider.com)Accenture is the go-to service provider in the digital space, in my opinion, so the upcoming years look extremely promising for this company.Not all of the information from the earnings release was well-received by the market, as management's lackluster fiscal 2017 guidance caused the stock to sell off.Lackluster Guidance, But Was It Really That Bad?In addition to reporting impressive Q3 2017 operating results, Accenture's management team surprised the market by lowering the company's fiscal 2017 guidance.As shown, the big change from the prior guidance was the increase in the pension settlement charge, which obviously had downstream impacts. I believe that investors should look past this short-term headwind and treat the stock price pressure as a buying opportunity.

This company is the leader in its market as three quarters of the Fortune 500 deal with ACN. Keeping such close relation with its clients makes it hard for any of them to switch toward a competitor. Plus, ACN is a real money making machine generating continuous free cash flow insuring a sustainable dividend growth policy:Source: YChartsAs the business world evolves fast, large companies require Accenture services more than ever to help them adapt. Let's dig deeper in ACN fundamentals to see if it could be a good fit to your portfolio.Understanding the BusinessAccenture is a professional service company that provides management consulting, technology services, and outsourcing. ACN operates in over 120 countries and employs over 411,000 employees. ACN has developed a strong expertise with 75% of the Fortune 500 companies operating in various industries:Source: ACN Q3 2017 infographicAccenture's goal is to work closely with its clients to improve their efficiency, value, and growth potential. Throughout its relationships with the largest U.S. companies, ACN is able to learn about the evolution of its clients need and adapt quickly.RevenuesSource: YChartsAs cloud services are rapidly increasing, Accenture is now showing ""The New"" digital, cloud and security services related as 50% of its revenues. This is ACN's biggest growth vector with double-digit growth during its latest quarterly update. The company makes roughly 53% of its revenue outside North America ($13.6 billion out of $25.7 billion generated so far in 2017 after three quarters). This makes ACN's business model vulnerable to currency headwinds.EarningsSource: YChartsAccenture shows nice earnings progression throughout the years fueled by its continuous growing sales. The most recent earnings dip is attributable to a pension settlement charge of $0.47/share (ACN Q3 2017 infographic).The secret in ACN success lies in its strong relationships with its clients. With nearly 150 accounts with billing price of $100 million in 2015 and 97 of their top 100 clients being with them for over 10 years (source: Morningstar), Accenture has built a nearly impossible business to replicate.Dividend Growth PerspectiveACN started paying dividends in 2006 and has never stopped increasing it since then. Last year, ACN entered the elite group of Dividend Achievers. The Dividend Achievers Index refers to all public companies that have successfully increased their dividend payments for at least 10 consecutive years. At the time of writing this article, there were 265 companies that achieved this milestone. You can get the complete list of Dividend Achievers with comprehensive metrics here.Source: YChartsPlease note the drop in the dividend payment between 2009 and 2011. This was due to change in the dividend policy going from one payment a year to two and a special dividend payment of $0.75/share in 2010 (announced in September 2009, for more details, please visit ACN dividend history).While the payouts keep increasing, ACN dividend yield remained between 2% and 2.50% for the past five years. Accenture shows an interesting combination of both capital and dividend growth.Source: YChartsLooking forward into the future, I notice that both cash payout ratio and payout ratio are under control at 34.68% and 43.76%, respectively. Management has plenty of room for future increases. While the dividend yield remains low, ACN meets my 7 dividend growth investing principles.Potential DownsidesAt this time, I don't see any important downsides for Accenture. Lately, the market has been disappointed by management 2017 low guidance and surprising weakness in the health & public service segments. Upon their earnings release, the stock price plunged 4% but is still up by 6% this year lagging the S&P 500 by about 2%.The key for Accenture is to maintain its strong reputation by continuously improving its services and retaining its best resources. I don't see the company dropping the ball on this point.ValuationAs I've painted a pretty picture of the company so far, I'm getting very interested to see if the valuation will make the cut to be included in my portfolio. The first valuation method I use is the 10-year PE history. This gives me an idea of how the market values ACN.Source: YChartsIn the light of the above mentioned graph, the stock price seems fairly price. Don't forget to ignore the latest PE valuation jump and consider a 17 multiple instead of the 22. The earnings drop was related to a one-time charge for Accenture pension plan.In order to have a better idea of ACN value, I will determine its fair price by using a double-stage dividend discount model. I will use an 8% dividend growth rate for the first 10 years and reduce it to 7% as a terminal rate. Since Accenture business model is very solid and the company is well diversified among 120 countries and over 40 different business line, I will use a discount rate of 9%.Source: Dividend Toolkit Excel calculator spreadsheetAs you can see, the stock price seems to trade at about a 10% discount using this approach. This is enough to put ACN on my buy list.Final ThoughtAccenture shows a great combination of capital and dividend growth potential. Through its solid economic moat, the company generates a continuously increasing cash flow, leading to growing payouts for shareholders. As the stock performance lagged the S&P 500's over the past 12 months, ACN is now trading at an interesting discount. I will add this company to my watch list.Disclaimer: I do not hold ACN in my DividendStocksRock portfolios.The opinions and the strategies of the author are not intended to ever be a recommendation to buy or sell a security.

It is in both of our model portfolios at Friedrich Global Research, both the ultra conservative growth and aggressive growth. It has been, and we believe it will continue to be a consistent performer for many years to come.The company is concerned, as many large multinational firms with a significant presence in the U.S., that a more restrictive policy regulating the H1B visa program could be disruptive to its business model. Accenture is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland but it serves clients in more than 120 countries around the globe. It has over more than 400,000 employees with plans of adding 15,000 to its approximately 50,000 employees currently in the U.S. But it employs about 140,000 in India.How much lasting damage could a potential change in the H1B visa program have on Accenture? Admittedly, it is hard to say with any true confidence but I believe it is safe to assume that the company will need to make adjustments. Otherwise it would not be squawking about the potential changes.The real concern is how it may affect its operations in India. That does not seem to be as big a problem since the company already employs directly so many in that country. It also seems that those employees should not need access to H1B visas unless Accenture needs them to relocate to the U.S. With all the communications and collaboration options available online, combined with the nature of the business as a technology consulting firm, it would seem that Accenture has the capacity and is well positioned to make the necessary adjustments. Any disruptions should be very temporary and limited in magnitude.I also do not expect any changes that affect technology companies operating in the U.S. to have the detrimental effects that corporate leaders are screaming about. They just want all the advantages that they have enjoyed to stay the same or get better. By the time any bill gets through Congress I would expect that the effects of industry lobbyists will have declawed much of the rhetoric and created a law that would have very little detrimental impact. It will end up being a give and take compromise where the President and Congress can claim victory with some relatively minor changes and corporation keep most of what they really need to hold down costs.And of all the potentially impacted companies I would expect that Accenture is possibly the best managed and most capable of adapting to whatever comes from legislative changes. There really is not much to get concerned about if you own shares in Accenture, in my humble opinion.Look at the ratios and the consistency across the board in the table below (courtesy of Friedrich Global Research):Source: AskFriedrich.comThere are very few companies that consistently produce a FROIC (free cash flow return on invested capital) over 50 percent! The price to cash flow is also at a good level (we call it the Price to Bernhard/Buffett ratio) at 17.73. By comparison and for perspective, the weighted average of the S&P 500 index (NYSEARCA:SPY) for FROIC is about 12 percent and the price to cash flow is around 38. You want the FROIC to be as high as possible (preferably above 20 percent) and the price to cash flow as low as possible (preferably below 15).The point is that Accenture can adapt and change without missing a beat. After all, that is part of what its clients hire it to help accomplish by using the latest in technology. It really ought to be able to contend with a little change in the laws.One of the companies in India that I believe subcontracts for Accenture, Eclerx Services (NSE:ECLERX) and traded on the New Delhi exchange, is already making adjustments to continue its path toward further growth. The company is something of a mini Accenture that has aspirations to expand internationally. It has recently decided to set up shop in the U.S. and is advertising for new hires. The stock has taken a beating since the U.S. election (see chart below):Now take a look at the ratios over the last five years:Green is good and just look at all the green on this table! The price to free cash flow ratio sits at a bargain level of just 13.39 while the FROIC is still near 50 percent. That is a powerful combination and very rarely found anywhere. But it seems like a golden needle in a haystack has been found by Friedrich here since India is also one of the fastest growing economies in the world.This is one with a lot of potential, in my humble opinion, because of the consistency of operational results, its small size in a business space that has ample global growth potential, aggressive growth and cost conscious management and the present and future potential growth in its domestic market.Management is not taking any potential change in U.S. laws sitting down. Instead it has decided to enter the U.S. market directly and compete with the big dogs. Even though India is growing faster, the U.S. and Europe still offer much more potential for a small company like this that does its home market. It should be interesting to watch this one to see how well it can compete outside its own turf."

Additional investors or rounds are unknown.Acquisition Terms and RationaleNeither company disclosed the acquisition price or terms. Accenture did not file an 8-K, nor did it provide a change in forward guidance, so the transaction was likely not material enough to its financial condition to warrant a filing or guidance announcement.Accenture acquired Phase One ostensibly to bolster its Federal Services business segment efforts.As the US government seeks to modernize its national security, citizen services and healthcare information systems, the potential market for providing additional services with runs in the many billions of dollars.Phase One is exclusively focused on the federal agency market and also is a Salesforce Platinum Consulting Partner, with extensive expertise in integration and development services for federal technology environments on the Salesforce platform.As Accenture stated in the deal announcement,Accenture said it was ‘one of the first global companies to establish a strategic alliance with Salesforce and currently counts more than 11,000 Salesforce-skilled employees.The company has been quite active in acquiring numerous consultancies and technology companies in recent years as it assists enterprises and government entities in the transition to the cloud.The Phase One deal represents the ‘seventh Salesforce-related acquisition that Accenture has made since 2014; the others include Media Hive, New Energy Group, CRMWaypoint, Cloud Sherpas and ClientHouse.’Investors have rewarded ACN for its results over the past 12 months, as its stock has risen from around $110 per share to $128 per share:(Source: Seeking Alpha)Assuming Accenture did not overpay for the deal, investors should continue to reward management for executing on an acquisition-centric strategy to bolster its offerings during this historic transition from closed, on premises environments to the cloud.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, insider activity, and IPOs.

4067091,29761,2017-04-29T13:48:03-04:00,The IT services industry has outperformed the general markets due to shifting trends into cloud based solutions and increased M&A activities.Accenture continues to build upon long-term contracts with large customers producing steady and profitable cash generation.Accenture touts a wide economic moat over competitors with a very lucrative return on invested capital.,"Accenture PLC (NYSE:ACN) is a quality stock that has outperformed the market and will continue to do so in the future. The company delivers value by leveraging industry knowledge and technical expertise in the five segments that they serve: Communications - Media & Technology, Financial Services, Health & Public Service, Products, and Resources. The majority of their revenue is driven from consulting work, but they are also a large player in outsourcing. Their solid value proposition in outsourcing has performed well recently, winning large deals from Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Merck (NYSE:MRK), GlaxoSmithKline (NYSE:GSK), and Eli Lily (NYSE:LLY).Geographically, Accenture has slightly more revenue outside of the US compared to in the US; however, in the last year, the US market was double the growth of international markets.Per the latest 10-K, the company continues to grow in various verticals in the U.S. and operating margins have either increased over last year or remained flat in each segment except for resources which dropped 1%.The company's strategy is growing a network of industry experts and leveraging their knowledge to serve clients. Accenture continues to acquire small firms in order to bring in additional experts, enter new markets, and maintain their strong position in the consulting industry. As client demands adapt and change, Accenture will continue to position themselves to handle these demands through strategic acquisitions.These recent acquisitions include Altitude - a private product design and innovation firm, Seabury Group - a strategy consulting firm of 120 employees focused on aviation, and a majority stake in SinnerSchrader AG - a leading digital agency in Germany to expand digital marketing capabilities. This will also help them take market share from competitors in the digital marketing space such as IBM (NYSE:IBM). In fiscal 2016, Cloud Sherpas was acquired to enable Accenture to accelerate their cloud first agenda. These acquisitions will better serve the growing demand for cloud capabilities, offer cyber security expertise, and continue to lead Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) capabilities with over 3,700 skilled consultants.Some recent bad news includes lower guidance for fiscal 2017. Revenue is expected to grow 5-8% in local currency and earnings of 5.64-5.87 (prior 5.75-5.98). Considering the strong balance sheet of 4 billion in cash and only about 24 million in debt, I'm considering this company to be low risk. Additionally, they've built a strong reputation over the years which has enabled them to have such stability.- Warren BuffettImage source: Business InsiderAccenture has taken this quote about reputation to heart. As one of the largest global consulting firms, more than 90 of their top 100 customers have remained their customers in the past decade.Some challenges the company will face going forward include any reduction in IT services spending. This is a low-risk item considering the IT Services Index has outperformed the S&P 500 quite simply because it not only has better growth in sales and earnings overall but also because it has more profitable growth than the S&P 500 on average. I arrived at this by looking at the mean companies in the IT Services industry compared to the mean companies in the S&P 500.Consulting firms work with clients to solve business problems by utilizing industry specific knowledge and technical skills. The need for consultants is multifaceted, but the main drivers continue to be increased global competitiveness, e-commerce and cloud computing growth, continuous regulatory changes, post-merger integration issues, and overall increased M&A related activities.Second to IBM in revenues, Accenture is continuing to grow at a very profitable rate. With an industry leading return on invested capital averaging 60% in the last decade, this implies a very wide moat. Such a strong performance metric indicates the strength of expertise and relationships that Accenture has built over time and will profit from long-term contracts with healthy renewal rates.Source: author created via morningstar.com dataFree cash flow as a percentage of sales has remained in the healthy range of 10-14% in the last ten years, implying that the company continues to invest profitably. The discounted cash flow analysis I performed implies a 20% margin of safety, putting this consulting firm at a value of $150 per share.To summarize, Accenture is a quality business in an attractive industry. The small and consistent bolt-on acquisitions will fuel future growth and help them maintain an industry leading position in the consulting category. Shares have fallen slightly so far in 2017 and this is a great time to pick up this quality business at a slight discount."
4061179,79675,2017-04-07T19:04:16-04:00,The company's revised full-year 2017 guidance and Q2 2017 results were not well received by the market.I will discuss the three main reasons why I bought Accenture's stock.Accenture is a long-term buy at today's price.,"Accenture (NYSE:ACN) is a global technology consulting company that has been in the news a lot over the last month. On March 23, 2017, the company released its Q2 2017 results and revised full-year 2017 guidance, which were widely viewed as ""disappointments"" by the financial community. In April 2017, there were rumors that Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) was interested in acquiring the company but those rumors were already shot down by Oracle's management team.Accenture's stock price has been under pressure since the company released its Q2 2017 results, as shares are down by over ~7%. On a YTD basis, ACN shares have underperformed the broader market by four percentage points.(Source: Nasdaq - edited by author)Based on Accenture's revised guidance, Goldman Sachs downgraded ACN shares to ""Neutral"" with a price target of $110 (down from $125) and noted expectations for Accenture to experience ""slowing digital growth and faster legacy erosion"" over the next few quarters.I believe that investors with an investment time horizon longer than two-to-three years should consider treating the recent pullback in ACN shares as a buying opportunity because Accenture has great long-term business prospects in place.The ""Disappointing"" Q2 2017 Results and Full-Year 2017 GuidanceFor Q2 2017, Accenture reported adjusted EPS of $1.33 on $8.3b of revenue and the company was able to maintain its strong operating margins (13.7%). Accenture's quarterly revenue was up 5% YoY and the company beat the consensus adjusted EPS estimate by $0.03, or 2%.Accenture continued to experience strong growth in both consulting (3%) and outsourcing (7%), and four out of the company's five operating groups reported YoY net revenue growth, even after factoring in the significant foreign exchange headwind (-2% impact for the quarter).(Source: Q2 2017 Earnings Release)During the conference call, management mentioned that the Resources operating group was again impacted by the challenging energy, chemicals and natural resources markets but it is important to note that management expects for this operating group to deliver positive growth in the second half of 2017.Furthermore, the company's digital, cloud and securities services revenues were up double-digits (to ~$8b) and now accounts for ~45% of Accenture's consolidated revenues.(Source: Q2 2017 Earnings Release)I believe that Accenture reported impressive Q2 2017 results but the market only cared about the fact that management lowered the company's full-year 2017 guidance.Management narrowed the company's full-year net revenue guidance to 6%-8% (from 5%-8%) but lowered the adjusted EPS guidance to $5.31-$5.48 (from $5.64-$5.87). The main reason for the lowered EPS guidance is the anticipated non-cash charge related to the termination of the company's U.S. pension plan, which is expected to reduce adjusted EPS by $0.39. The market sold off ACN shares due largely to the company's new full-year 2017 guidance but, in my opinion, investors should look past this short-term headwind and stay focused on Accenture's long-term growth story, which is definitely still intact.The Reasons Why I Bought ACN SharesI first started following Accenture after learning more about the company's partnership with General Electric (NYSE:GE) in the Industrial Internet of Things, or IIoT, space (see this article for a detailed review of the Accenture-General Electric partnership) but I only recently added a small ACN position to my R.I.P. portfolio. There is a lot to like about Accenture's long-term growth story but, in my opinion, investors should really consider adding this company to their watch lists for these three main reasons:1. Top-Line Growth - Accenture has experienced strong revenue growth over the last five years, as the company has been able to heavily invest in its businesses in addition to making small tuck-in acquisitions that have had an impact on its top-line.ACN Operating Revenue (Annual YoY Growth) data by YChartsMore importantly, Accenture is still expected to experience top-line growth through at least the next 12 months.(Source: Estimize.com)Accenture is well positioned in the changing digital landscape and this company has tremendous market opportunities in several different industries, with the IIoT being a great example, so investors should fully expect Accenture to grow its top-line for many years to come.2. Balance Sheet Strength - As of Q2 2017, Accenture maintained its strong net cash position as the company's debt balance was consistent to the prior period.(Source: Q2 Earnings Press Release)Accenture's balance sheet strength has not only allowed for management to heavily invest in its businesses but it has also allowed for the company to be able to make strategic acquisitions in multiple high growth industries (for example, see this crunchbase report for a listing of Accenture's recent acquisitions).3. Dividend Growth Prospects - Accenture currently pays a semi-annual dividend of $1.21, which translates into an annual yield of ~2%.Plus, the company's payout ratio (ttm) is only 40% so there is room for Accenture to grow its dividend over the next five years. Moreover, management has been committed to reducing Accenture's share count - the company has already repurchased 12m shares for a cost of $1.4b in fiscal 2017 - which will only give management more wiggle room to grow the company's dividend in 2017 and beyond.Bottom LineAccenture is reasonably valued (P/E ratio of ~17) but the company looks more attractive the further that you look out. The current year may turn out to be a ""challenging year"" for Accenture in terms of adjusted earnings growth, but the company has several different catalysts in place that should help propel the stock price higher. As such, investors with a long-term prospective should consider adding ACN shares around the $115 level.If you found this article to be informative and would like to hear more about this company, or any other company that I analyze, please consider hitting the ""Follow"" button above.Disclaimer: This article is not a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned.

4057669,89805,2017-03-24T02:27:16-04:00,,"What Happened?Accenture (NYSE:ACN) reported second-quarter results that caused its stock to drop 3-4% Thursday morning.Accenture’s organic sales grew 6%, and adjusted earnings per share were roughly flat compared to the prior-year period.The company’s sales and earnings were roughly in line with analysts’ estimates heading into the quarter.Management expects full-year revenue growth of 6-8%, which is slightly higher than its previous forecast of 5-8% growth.Accenture also increased its adjusted earnings per share guidance to $5.70 to $5.87 from $5.64 to $5.87.Accenture’s shares hit an all-time high earlier this week before selling off Thursday and have roughly kept pace with the broader market over the last year.Why did the stock fall on this earnings report? Stocks that have enjoyed a strong price run-up sometimes drop on good news as traders take profits.Accenture’s stock trades at a relatively high P/E multiple (although not an excessive level) and had about doubled the S&P 500’s year-to-date return through Wednesday, making it more vulnerable to some profit-taking unless the company really delivered knockout earnings and guidance.Is It Noise or News?One of the most important investing habits to learn is the ability to distinguish between noise and news. There is no shortage of financial news every second of the day, but very little of it ever affects a company’s long-term earnings outlook.When a stock drops in price, it’s important to take a slow, rational approach to understanding why the stock is down. If the reason doesn’t seem to impact the company’s long-term prospects, it could be a buying opportunity.These aren’t always easy judgment calls to make, but Accenture’s weak stock price response to the company’s earnings release seems like noise to me.The company’s fundamentals remain strong across the business, and management even slightly increased guidance for the year.Most importantly, Accenture’s digital, cloud, and security services growth engines now account for over 45% of revenue and continue growing at a double-digit clip.The only real issue I can see with the stock is valuation. ACN’s stock trades at a forward P/E multiple of 21.6, which represents a meaningful premium compared to the S&P 500’s forward P/E multiple of about 18.Accenture’s higher multiple reflects the company’s superior business quality and faster earnings growth profile, which both seem intact to me.I think the stock remains a quality holding for long-term shareholders, but it would take another 5-10% pullback in the stock to make me interested in adding more to my position.Few companies can match Accenture’s high Dividend Safety & Growth Scores. The company last increased its semi-annual dividend by 10% in September 2016 and should continue rewarding dividend growth investors with strong payout increases for many years to come.My long-term thesis on Accenture can be seen here, and I continue to believe that the company’s best days remain ahead of it."
4057901,101421,2017-03-25T18:09:14-04:00,Accenture has agreed to acquire First Annapolis Consulting for an undisclosed sum.First Annapolis provides a range of consulting services to various payment industry stakeholders.The deal promises to build Accenture's payments consulting practice at a time of rapid change within the industry.,"Quick TakeGlobal consulting major Accenture (ACN) has agreed to acquire payments consulting firm First Annapolis Consulting for an undisclosed amount.First Annapolis has developed expertise and client relationships across the payments industry value chain.The deal promises to speed Accenture's practice growth in the rapidly changing payments sector, which is one of the largest sectors within the financial services industry.Target CompanyAnnapolis, Maryland-based First Annapolis was founded in 1991 primarily to provide core management consulting services to the following payment industry players in North America and Europe:Below is an infographic overview of the company's industry practice areas:(Source: First Annapolis Consulting)First Annapolis also provides several ancillary services such as M&A advisory, strategic sourcing, partnership finance, portfolio management and rewards program support.Acquisition Terms, Rationale and CommentaryNeither company disclosed the amount or terms of the transaction agreement.I expect that Accenture will pay in the range of 2x–4x TTM revenues (Trailing Twelve Month).The acquisition is squarely aimed at bolstering Accenture's capabilities in the financial payments vertical.Alan McIntyre, head of Accenture's Banking practice, said, ""The pace of innovation in the payments sector is accelerating with new platform and tools being launched daily; and emerging technologies such as blockchain, mobile wallets, and P2P payments disrupting traditional financial services and technology providers… As payments increasingly move from plastic to digital, players across the industry value chain will need to rethink their value propositions and business models.""Accenture has already developed technology expertise in the payments area, and the acquisition of First Annapolis will add to its service capabilities.As an example of the disruptive forces at play, below is a graphic published in December 2015 of a selection of payments industry technology companies aiming to disrupt various aspects of the financial processing chain:(Source: CB Insights)Within the larger financial services industry, payments activity accounts for a large category of volume.Payments technology startups raised nearly $4 billion in venture capital investment in 2015.According to a January 2017 report, startups in the Payments/Loyalty/E-commerce sectors secured $13.5 billion in new investment, the largest category within the FinTech sector:(Source: Let's Talk Payments)Accenture is quite right to move to scale its payments practice as quickly as possible, so an acquisition to speed that process is entirely justified in my view.The firm has accelerated its acquisition pace in recent years, as the pace of technological change has increased and the need for solutions by middle market and large enterprises grows.As an example, I recently wrote about ACN's purchase of iDefense Security in my article, Accenture To Acquire VeriSign's Threat Intelligence Unit.Cyber security is area of rapid change and risk for businesses as threats proliferate.With the rise of machine learning and its promising application to security technologies, I viewed that deal as a positive for Accenture's security practice.Accenture management appears to be making the right moves, and I support their approach to staying at the forefront of rapidly changing industries.I write about IPOs and M&A deals.

4058047,101430,2017-03-27T06:19:03-04:00,"Accenture's most recent quarterly numbers are reviewed.
        Accenture has been busy in the month of March acquiring companies.
        The recent sell off offers an opportunity.","Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), had a very busy month. This article will review its most recent earnings release, look at its recent corporate activity, and take a look at how the market reacted to all of this news to see if there is an opportunity to either initiate a position or to add to an existing position in Accenture.Earlier this week Accenture reported their numbers for the second quarter. In summary, Accenture had revenues of $8.76B, net income of $876.7M, and earnings per share of $1.33. In my previous article on Accenture, I stated that I was looking for $1.34 in earnings per share. Additionally, Accenture's management issued guidance of 6-8% revenue growth for FY 2017 and an earnings per share estimate of $5.70 to $5.87.For FY 2017, Accenture has over 45% of its revenues coming from Digital, Cloud, and Security Services, which are high margin revenues for Accenture. Accenture spent $1.4B for share repurchases, and generated $1B in free cash flow so far. Accenture also announced $9.2B in new bookings in the most recent quarter. Table 1 below shows some metrics for Accenture going back 5 years.Table 1 - Accenture's 5 Year MetricsSourceTable 1 shows that the metrics are fine in my opinion. Revenues, operating margins, net income, earnings per share, dividends, payout ratio, shares outstanding and return on assets are all trending in the right direction. As a person who intends on being a long term shareholder, I can't complain about the most recent numbers or the trends depicted in Table 1.Since my last article, Accenture has been busy adding to its business portfolio. Just in the month of March, Accenture acquired several companies and opened several new offices, laboratories, and innovation centers. Accenture acquired Davies Consulting enhancing Accenture's capabilities in the utility industry. It acquired First Annapolis Consulting which is designed to expand Accenture's capabilities in the payments market. Accenture acquired Focus Group Europe which enhances Accenture's cloud strategy. It completed its acquisition of OCTO Technology, which will expand Accenture's digital services in France and it completed its acquisition of Seabury Group, enhancing its aviation consulting capabilities. Accenture opened three Liquid Studios; one in Latvia, one in Singapore, and one in Sydney. These Liquid Studios are essentially laboratories for rapid development of software and applications for businesses. Accenture has more than 30 of these studios worldwide.Accenture also opened an office in Portland, Oregon and a new innovation center in New York for finance and risk innovation. Additionally, Accenture enhanced their alliances with SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).All of this activity I find to be positive for Accenture's long term competiveness. Accenture's management makes good use of its free cash flow to open new laboratories and to acquire new companies. These acquisitions enhance Accenture's capabilities in different industries or in different markets globally. By looking at the return on assets in Table 1, it appears that Accenture's management is skilled at identifying strategic assets to acquire and at not paying too much for those assets.While I think Accenture had a good quarter and I appreciate their recent corporate activity, apparently Wall Street didn't appreciate the quarter as much as I did. Chart 1 below shows a daily chart of Accenture. Note that the earnings release was prior to the market opening on Thursday.After the earnings announcement Accenture sold off almost 6% in the next two days. I think this sell off offers an opportunity for people to either initiate a position or to add to your position in Accenture.In summary, Accenture's most recent quarter was a decent one in my opinion. Revenues and earnings per share increased. Free cash flow continued to accumulate and shares outstanding have been reduced. Additionally, Accenture continued to expand its capabilities and the markets it can serve. Wall Street's immediate reaction to Accenture's most recent quarterly report offers a buying opportunity for people who feel that Accenture has an excellent long term future. I may take advantage of the minor sell off to add to my position."
4047413,102758,2017-02-19T03:16:11-05:00,Accenture presents an attractive opportunity at current valuations despite exceptional growth.They have a rock solid balance sheet and a nice dividend.They are positioned well to continue their growth into the future.,"ThesisAccenture PLC (NYSE:ACN) is a professional service juggernaut that is a low risk, high potential return, long term play. They are about as financially sound as a company can be. I believe they are an attractive addition to any long term portfolio.About The CompanyAccenture provides management and technology consulting services across all varieties of industry. Everything from banks, healthcare providers, and miners, to public education and energy companies. A breakdown of their operating and industry groups is shown below. Their broad client base helps diversify risk from any one industry discontinuing their services.Communications, Media, and TechnologyFinancial ServicesHealth and Public ServiceProductsResourcesWhat I LikeI like that Accenture is extremely well diversified. This means they are not too dependent on one thing to do well. In fact, they have their hand in nearly everything. Their balance sheet is outstanding with only $27m in debt and nearly $4.1B in cash. They have a very high return on equity, assets, and capital. This is shown in Figure 1.Figure 1: Accenture PerformanceSource: Simply Wall StThey have all of the growth I usually look for: revenue up 6.4% YoY, net income up 22% YoY, GAAP diluted EPS up 23% YoY. Their gross margins, free cash flow, and sales growth was also up last year. So let's talk valuation. Accenture currently trades around 18 times earnings. This trails the S&P which is just over 26. They also trade at a discount to future cash flow. This is shown in Figure 2. For more information on discounted cash flow valuation visit Simply Wall St!Figure 2: Accenture Future Cash Flow ValueSource: Simply Wall StFinally, Accenture offers a moderate dividend and buyback program. Their dividend is currently 2.06% and their payout ratio is 33% which is safe. During Q1 of 2017, Accenture repurchased five million shares for a total of $588m. As of November 30, 2016, their remaining share repurchase authority was $4.9B and at this point they had already purchased nearly 650 million shares. They continue generously to return cash to shareholders.Opportunity And DriversIn their most recent earnings call, CEO Pierre Nanterme emphasized cloud and security services, which together represent more than 40% of total revenue and are growing at a double-digit pace. With the cloud computing revolution underway, Accenture is uniquely positioned to capitalize on this. No matter which tech giant becomes the leader in cloud computing, it doesn't matter. Accenture will help corporations implement various technology, they don't depend on the technology itself.Accenture has identified five trends to take advantage on in their most recent technology vision newsletter. This is shown in Figure 3.Figure 3: Accenture Five TrendsSource: Technology Vision NewsletterThe first trend is in my opinion the biggest. Artificial intelligence (NYSE:AI) is poised to transform the workforce in ways we haven't seen since the industrial revolution. At a point, sooner rather than later, an AI will be able to start taking away tasks from human employees. Whether it is autonomous vehicles or accounting, AI is capable of taking over numerous jobs. When more and more companies start to take advantage of this who will be implementing all of it? Well, I believe Accenture will fill that role.RisksDespite all of the above Accenture is expecting a rough 2017. It would appear this is already priced in judging by their lower than average P/E ratio. Their P/E and price over three years is shown in Figure 4. They recently revised guidance to account for a negative 2% foreign-exchange assumption where it was previously flat. They were hit pretty hard by Brexit but have since recovered. I believe any immediate risk is mitigated by their potentially lucrative future.Figure 4: Accenture P/E and PriceACN data by YChartsFinal ThoughtsI think Accenture represents a valuable addition to a long term portfolio. They have demonstrated exceptional growth and they distribute cash to shareholders. Any headwinds from currency risk are mitigated by tailwinds from rapid technological revolution. I believe implementation of artificial intelligence represents an extremely lucrative opportunity for Accenture. I believe their impenetrable balance sheet shields them from any risk in interest rates. I believe Accenture presents a high potential reward for its investors."
4049805,22742,2017-02-26T09:12:19-05:00,This article will show readers how to analyze a portfolio using a unique valuation methodology using free cash flow similar to how Warren Buffett might.There is a difference between Main Street analysis and Wall Street analysis that investors should know.Introducing an investment strategy that practices capital appreciation through capital preservation.,"I will start with a quote from Warren Buffett's letter to shareholders from the 1958 Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) annual report:Judging by his compounded annual return over the 50 years from 1965 to 2015 of 21.6 percent I would have to say he and his investors are pretty happy. Consistent returns of that magnitude are getting harder to achieve but the principle is still rock solid, in my humble opinion.I want to explain to readers how to analyze a portfolio with a focus on free cash flow return on investment rather than the often biased Wall Street recommendations. Let us begin by analyzing one of my favorite dividend growth companies, Accenture PLC (NYSE:ACN) and at the same time explain how the methodology involved in this analysis came about.Main Street (the real world) is where Accenture operates and Wall Street (the hype casino) is where its shares trade. Accenture shares available for purchase on Wall Street are in the public domain and the company has little control over the price at which each share will trade. Accenture is required to release its earnings reports each quarter and from time to time it also provides press releases to its shareholders (and the general public) giving updates on how its operations are doing on Main Street.Main Street is where Accenture invests in its own operations, creates products/services that its customers can purchase. How well Accenture management does in pricing and selling those products determines the profitability the company. Wall Street then reacts based on the success or failure of management to meet goals, set by analysts with guidance from Accenture management. Main Street and Wall Street thus have a seemingly symbiotic relationship. The disconnect that often occurs between the two is the result of perceptions and the ability of almost anyone to buy or sell any stock at any time. Expert analysis is not a required to invest on Wall Street. The rise of such competitive forces such as hedge funds, dark pools and HFTs (high frequency traders - using algorithms) that account for the majority of trading volume most days has created a far different investing environment from that which existed 30 or more years ago.It seems to me that we are subject to much more of a herd mentality and momentum investing than ever before. Fundamental analysis and investing for the long-term have become unfashionable on Wall Street. That is probably because it does not produce as much revenue for the powers that be on Wall Street. They need ever-rising volumes to keep revenues and profits rising.This results in Wall Street relying on advice coming from Wall Street to be very dangerous for individual investors. Many individual investors experience emotional swings about individual stocks and tend to follow the herd in and out creating more volume and revenue for Wall Street and often more taxable revenue for the government. During bull markets, investors experience euphoria as ""the rising tide lifts all boats."" But when a bear market suddenly shows up, these same investors tend to panic and stampede over the cliff like lemmings. Thus we have the classic case of ""greed vs. panic."" It is the game that Wall Street plays to its advantage, not ours.I am a fan and student of both Benjamin Graham and Warren Buffett. Our Friedrich algorithm was designed to assist all investors (pro and novice alike) and give them the ability to quickly compare a company's Main Street operations to its Wall Street valuation. Friedrich can do this on an individual company basis or it can assist users in analyzing an entire index like the S&P 500, an ETF, mutual fund or individual portfolio.In reading Berkshire Hathaway's 1986 letter to shareholders, I noticed a ratio which Mr. Buffett entitled ""Owner Earnings."" It is what we would consider to be a version of ""free cash flow."" This is one of the many gems hidden throughout the letters and footnotes where one can find explanations from Mr. Buffett on one of the key ratios that he and Charlie Munger used in analyzing stocks. In that footnote, he defined the term ""owner earnings"" as the cash that is generated by the company's business operations.""[Owner earnings] represent A) reported earnings plus B) depreciation, depletion, amortization, and certain other non-cash charges…less C) the average annual amount of capitalized expenditures for plant and equipment, etc. that the business requires to fully maintain its long-term competitive position and its unit volume.""I like to use this free cash flow ratio as I believe that earnings can be manipulated but a company's ability to create cash flow is more representative of its underlying operational efficiencies and financial well-being. Arnold Bernhard, the founder of Value Line Investment Survey, was a big fan of free cash flow and probably introduced it sooner than Mr. Buffett did. Our 60-year backtest of the DJIA from 1950-2009 used data from Value Line.In the backtest mentioned above, we demonstrated that if one can purchase a company whose shares are selling for 15 times or less its price to free cash flow ratio that the probability of success will dramatically increase in most cases. We have renamed the ratio the Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow ratio in honor of both men. The following is how that ratio is calculated.Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/ [(net income per share + depreciation per share) + (capital spending per diluted share)]Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding))The above are the ratios to use when analyzing a stock on Wall Street and below are the ratios we use when analyzing a stock on Main Street.FROIC means ""Free Cash Flow Return on Invested Capital""Forward Free Cash Flow = [((Net Income + Depreciation) (1+ % Revenue Growth rate)) + (Capital Spending)]FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/ (Long-Term Debt + Shareholders' Equity)What the FROIC ratio does is tell us how much forward free cash flow the company is generating on Main Street relative to how much total capital it has employed. So, if a company invests $100 in total capital on Main Street and generates $20 in forward free cash flow, it therefore has a FROIC of 20%, which we consider excellent. This is just one of the key ratios (66 in total) that we use to identify how a company is performing on Main Street, as it is our belief that if a company is making a killing on Main Street, that this news will eventually show up on Wall Street's radar.So, let us begin our analysis and at the same time try to teach everyone how to do a similar analysis on one's own portfolio. In analyzing Accenture's Price to Bernhard Buffett FCF ratio we must first analyze Accenture's Sherlock Debt Divisor. Here is a detailed definition of what that ratio is:Sherlock Debt Divisor = A major concern that we have these days in analyzing companies is the amount of debt relative to its operating cash flow and whether management is abusing this situation by taking on more debt than it requires. Debt can be used wisely to create leverage and leverage can be extremely beneficial within certain parameters. On the other side of the coin, too much reliance on debt can be unsustainable and put a company's future in jeopardy. So, what we have done to determine if a company's debt policy is beneficial or abusive, is to create the Sherlock Debt Divisor.What the Divisor does is punish companies that rely too heavily on debt and rewards those who successfully use debt as leverage. To do this we take a company's working capital and subtract its long-term debt. If a company has a lot more working capital than long-term debt, we reward it. Conversely we punish those whose long-term debt exceeds its working capital. If the result of this calculation is higher than the current stock market price, then leverage is being employed. A company with too much leverage will generate a result of this ratio that will adjust our other ratios making the stock less attractive as an investment.Having successfully defined the Sherlock Debt Divisor, we now need the following four bits of financial data in order to calculate it for Accenture. TTM (trailing 12 months) is about as close to real time data as we can get, based on when each company reports. Accenture last reported results in December for the quarter ended November 20, 2016 and we will use those reported numbers with the exception of the current market price.Market Price Per Share = $122.60Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current LiabilitiesTotal Current Assets = $11,368,400,000Total Current Liabilities = $9,170,100,000Working Capital = $2,198,300,000Long-Term Debt = $24,600,000Diluted Shares Outstanding = 663,800,000Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding))Sherlock Debt Divisor = $122.60 - (($2,198,300,000 - $24,600,000)/663,800,000))Sherlock Debt Divisor = $122.60 - ($3.27) = $119.33Since Accenture has less long-term debt than working capital, we reward it by using the slightly lower price of $119.33 as our new numerator in all of our calculations.Price to Bernhard Buffett FCF Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/ [(net income per share + depreciation per share) + (capital spending per diluted share)]Sherlock Debt Divisor = $119.33Net Income per diluted share = $4,297,500,000/663,800,000 = $6.47Depreciation per diluted share = $734,600,000/663,800,000 = $1.01Capital Spending per diluted share = $-486,300,000/663,800,000 = $-0.73$6.47 + $1.01 + ($-0.73) = $6.75Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = $119.33/$6.75 = 17.68Now if one goes to our FRIEDRICH LEGEND (on what is considered a good or bad result) you will notice that our result of 17.68 is considered good.We last ran our Datafile for Accenture on February 22, 2017, and our Friedrich Algorithm gave a recommendation to our subscribers that Accenture is a ""Strong Buy"" as our Friedrich Datafile and chart below show. There you will also find the last ten years of Accenture's Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow results.Now that we have shown everyone how to calculate our Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow ratio, let us now move on and explain how to calculate our FROIC ratio.This is how we calculate it:FROIC means ""Free Cash Flow Return on Invested Capital""Forward Free Cash Flow = [((Net Income + Depreciation) (1+ % Revenue Growth rate)) + (Capital Spending)]FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/ (Long-Term Debt + Shareholders' Equity)Net Income per diluted share = $$4,297,500,000/663,800,000 = $6.47Depreciation per diluted share = $734,600,000/663,800,000 = $1.01Capital Spending per diluted share = 486,300,000/663,800,000 = $-0.73Revenue Growth Rate TTM = 2%[(($6.47+ $1.01) (1.02%)) + ($-0.73) =$6.90]Long-Term Debt = $24,600,000Shareholders Equity = $7,417,100,000Diluted Shares Outstanding = 663,800,000($24,600,000+$7,417,100,000) / 663,800,000 = $11.21FROIC = (Forward Free Cash Flow)/ (Long-Term Debt + Shareholders' Equity)$6.90/$11.21 = 61.6%FROIC = 62%Now if one goes to our FRIEDRICH LEGEND again (on what is considered a good or bad result) you will notice that our result of 62% is an excellent result and tells us that Accenture generates $62 in forward free cash flow for every $100 it invests in total capital employed. Better yet, if we scroll back up to the datafile table, we see that Accenture has been churning out free cash flow like this for at least the last ten years. This is outstanding!One other consideration is how a stock performs during bear markets. We include the following chart for Accenture that includes the daily closing price along with the quarterly updates from our Friedrich algorithm for overbought (shown as ""sell""), fair value (labeled ""Main Street Price"") and our Bargain Price.This stock lost about 20 percent of its value in 2008 while the S&P 500 Index lost about 38 percent. It also regained its highest level of 2007 by early 2010 while the S&P 500 Index did not fully recover until early 2013. Since its peak in 2007 Accenture has risen more than 180 percent. The S&P 500 Index has risen by 50 percent over that same period. From this perspective Accenture looks to be one to buy and hold for the long term, collecting a rising dividend along the way. Current yield is just shy of two percent but it has grown at a rate of over 11 percent compounded annually over the last ten years.Accenture is in the sweet spot of enabling governments and corporations, large or small, to adopt the newest technologies. And technology is changing at an ever increasing rate. The company has global reach with additional expansion potential into new markets. It also has room to grow through increasing market share within the markets where it already operates.On Main Street Accenture is doing great, while on Wall Street it is far from overbought. Now, if one can build a portfolio containing similar excellent Main Street results and buy all at attractive Price to Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow ratio results, then your portfolio should be a star on both Main Street and Wall Street. Finding companies that have excellent results on Main Street and Wall Street (simultaneously) these days is, unfortunately, like trying to find a needle in a haystack. In order to prove this point we have analyzed the S&P 500 Index using the exact same methodology and produced final Main Street (FROIC) and Wall Street (Price to Bernhard Buffett FCF) results for the entire index.The final results for the S&P 500 Index are:FROIC = 12%Price to Bernhard Buffett FCF = 38.34For FROIC, we consider any result above 20% to be excellent and any result above 10% to be good, so the S&P 500 index in having a FROIC of 12%, can be considered good and tells us (that as a group on Main Street) the components of the index are doing well.The problem is that Wall Street has ""overbought"" the index, giving it a score of 38.34 for our Price to Bernhard Buffett FCF ratio. That ratio considers a stock a bargain when it trades under 15 times and overbought when it trades over 30 times. Therefore, the S&P 500 index is some 8.34 points or about 28% in ""overbought"" territory.When analyzing the S&P 500 Index components we set up certain rules to use when analyzing any group of stocks, such as one's own portfolio:1) If a stock has a negative FROIC result, we automatically assign it a score of 100 for its Price to Bernhard Buffett FCF ratio, in order to keep everything consistent and logical, as you can't have a negative Price to Bernhard Buffett FCF ratio when analyzing portfolios.2) Then at the same time the maximum FROIC allowed is 100%, so we can keep everything consistent and logical as well, as anything higher distorts the results for the group.3) We also give a zero result for FROIC for any ""cash position"" in the portfolio and a 22.50 result for the Price to Buffett Free Cash Flow, (which is 15 (buy) + 30 (sell) = 45/2 = 22.50). This was done to force one never to feel comfortable in cash, unless one has no choice in the matter, which is the case for us now. Our real time research clearly shows that the markets are overvalued, as measured by our analysis of the S&P 500 index.Going forward, if you want to duplicate this same analysis for your own portfolio, it will require some effort on your part to calculate the FROIC and Price to Bernhard Buffett ratio for each holding. But once you have done that, you simply weigh each holding in your portfolio, multiply that weighting result by each holding's FROIC result and then multiply each weighting by each holding's Price to Bernhard Buffett result. Calculate the sum for each of the two columns and that will give you the final results for both ratios for your portfolio. Then you compare how your portfolio stacks up on Main Street vs. Wall Street and easily compare it to any index. For those who don't want to do the leg work on your own we offer a service where we have done the calculations for 4000 US stocks and soon (as early as mid-year) to be 16,000 global stocks from 27 countries.In conclusion, it is my belief that free cash flow analysis is the ultimate tool when analyzing companies, and my hope is that you may add these ratios to your own investor tool box in order to help you in your own due diligence.

Now that we are able to analyze indices we will begin the process of analyzing ETFs, Mutual Funds and certain popular portfolio managers' (gurus) portfolios in a series of articles here on Seeking Alpha. That effort will, of course, be in addition to providing analysis on individual stocks. Since most use the S&P 500 Index as the comparative benchmark, we can see how each is doing in a side-by-side comparison.For those who would like to learn more about my investment philosophy please consider reading "" How I Created My Own Portfolio Over a Lifetime."""
4043687,23479,2017-02-08T04:02:05-05:00,"Accenture excelled in 2016 as its consulting division reported growth in both new signings and revenue.The consulting division makes up 59% of Accenture’s stock value in our estimation and contributed 54.26% to the revenues in 2016.According to our estimates, the outsourcing division contributes approximately ~41% to Accenture’s value.At present, we have a $118 price estimate for Accenture, which is 2.5% below its current market price.","Accenture (NYSE:ACN) excelled in 2016 as its consulting division reported growth in both new signings and revenue. However, the outsourcing division, which was once the cash cow for the company, faces intense competition. This has resulted in a decline in new signings for outsourcing and lower than expected growth. Nevertheless, the company is aggressively acquiring companies in order to improve its footprint across the globe and building its portfolio of products and services for new technologies such as Machine Learning (Artificial Intelligence), etc. The year 2017 holds promise for the company as it continues to improve its offering and products.Consulting Business Will Drive Revenue In 2017The consulting division makes up 59% of Accenture's stock value in our estimation and contributed 54.26% to the revenues in 2016. Accenture's consulting division offers services across multiple domains including finance, operations, strategy, risk management and talent management. These services are offered across multiple verticals and industries such as banking, capital markets, chemical, energy, health, insurance, life sciences, retail, etc.Over the past three years, consulting revenues have grown at a CAGR of 5.7% from $15.36 billion in 2013 to $18.17 billion in 2016. (The company's fiscal years end with August, though we base our data on the calendar year ending in December for comparative purposes.) An important factor for this growth has been the growth in new contract signings, which have grown at a CAGR of 6.23% from $16.38 billion in 2013 to $19.64 billion in 2016. The book-to-bill ratio, the key metric that ascertains the growth in new contracts, has been stable at 1.08x or 108%.The primary reason for the growth in new signings has been strong double-digit growth in strategy and consulting services for digital-related services. Accenture has been able to strategically position itself in these domains through acquisitions over the past few years. These acquisitions not only diversified Accenture's geographical footprint but also augmented its portfolio of services in the emerging Cloud, the Internet of Things, mobile computing and cyber security domains. Furthermore, opportunities in social media, mobile, analytics and cloud (SMAC) are abundant. Companies are looking to tightly integrate their existing services with SMAC. Accenture, through its consulting practice, has a significant body of knowledge on clients' businesses and processes, which helps it stay closer to clients. We expect that as the company continues to focus on emerging technologies, the consulting division will continue to post 5% growth in organic revenues. However, the company continues to acquire companies in order to improve its service portfolio and reach across the globe. This strategy can have a meaningful impact on the top line, as it did in 2016.Outsourcing Will Continue To DeclineAccording to our estimates, the outsourcing division contributes approximately ~41% to Accenture's value. While this division continues to outpace its peers, net revenues grew at a tepid CAGR of 4.7% from $13.3 billion in CY2013 to $15.33 billion in 2016. Additionally, new contract signings have declined at a CAGR of 3.4% from $18.1 billion in 2013 to $16.33 billion in FY2016. As a result, the book-to-bill ratio has declined from 1.36x to 1.08x over this period.The primary reason for the slowdown in Accenture's outsourcing has been the soft demand for its outsourcing services, due to increased competition. Companies such as Infosys (NYSE:INFY), Wipro (NYSE:WIT) and TCS (OTCPK:TTNQY) are operating successfully in the outsourcing space. Generally, these companies, especially the Indian ones, operate on a lower billing rate and have dented Accenture's market share in the outsourcing industry. Nevertheless, Accenture holds an edge with superior knowledge centers and its pool of experienced management and technology consultants. We expect that Accenture will continue to leverage its knowledge and technical know-how to bag more outsourcing contracts and keep competition at bay. Additionally, with the advent of cloud computing, Artificial Intelligence and machine learning (ChatBots), need for employing extensive manpower at offshore centers has been eliminated. As a result, the contract value of new signings has been low compared to previous years. Therefore, we believe that new signings for outsourcing will decline by 4% to $15.68 billion in 2017. As a result, outsourcing revenues would decline to $14.2 billion in 2017.At present, we have a $118 price estimate for Accenture, which is 2.5% below its current market price.Disclosure: No Positions."
4037908,24992,2017-01-19T10:39:14-05:00,"Healthy balance sheet - debt represents only 18% of the equity present.Good history of buying back shares and increasing dividends at a robust pace.Stock is currently trading at a 34% discount to the S&P 500.Daily Momentum turned Bullish on January 13, 2017 - upward target price of $123.00.","I like finding companies that are inexpensively priced relative to the market, and that have great fundamental and technical characteristics. Accenture (NYSE:ACN) is such a company and, for that reason, I'm suggesting investors jump on board.I like the fact that the company has partnered with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to help clients with digital information. This trend is only going to become more relevant going forward. Additionally, a strong case could be made to suggest that the disruption that is causing people to worry about many sectors of the economy actually benefits Accenture. Given that they're a massive IT consultancy company, the probability of being made obsolete anytime soon is quite low. Also, the fact that Accenture's clients have increased their spending consistently is perhaps why net income has grown at a CAGR of 13% since 2010. I see no reason why this trend will reverse itself.The Capital StructureThose who have read my writings recently know that I obsess over the balance sheet. Accenture is the best I've seen in some time. Debt represents only about 18% of the equity present. Please note that when I calculate ""debt"", I'm adding other elements. Because Accenture is a less capital intensive business than most, and so it'd be reasonable to expect lower long term debt than most, and that's what we see in this case. That said, retirement obligations are significant, so to examine the health of the balance sheet, I've lumped ""long term debt"" and ""retirement obligations"" together. I feel this is reasonable, because the economic characteristics of both obligations are similar enough. Even with the (significant) retirement obligations included in my analysis of the balance sheet, this is still a very healthy situation.The SharesAs I've said many times, investors don't just purchase the company, they purchase the shares that supposedly represent the company's fortunes. Sometimes those shares are overpriced, so the shares of an excellent company can still be an awful investment if the acquisition price isn't favorable.In the case of Accenture, there's much to like about the shares also. First, the company has purchased approximately $13.2 billion of shares since 2010. Second, in spite of years of net income increases, the market is forecasting earnings to fall by approximately 14% over the next 12 months. This is an unrealistically gloomy perspective in my view. Finally, and most importantly, is the fact that these shares trade at 34% discount to the S&P500. Given some of the components of that index that trade at a premium, this valuation makes no sense to me. In my view, a reasonable ""reversion to the mean"" trade would involve buying these discounted shares with the expectation that the market will see the error of its ways.Technical SnapshotAs per our ChartMasterPro Daily Price Model, the daily trend for ACN turned Bullish on January 13, 2017. The stock gapped down from $123.00 to $118.00 on December 21, 2016 after reporting earnings. Since December 21 the stock trended lower until finding support at the $115.00 level (this support level was established in October 2016). We now see the stock rising to $123.00 over the next six months.Today we will buy the ACN 19MAY17 115 Call Options which will provide us with approximately 12x leverage for our LONG trade. Our initial stop-loss exit signal will be a daily close below $115.00.For those investing in the shares of the company we recommend holding for six months or until the stock hits $123.00, whichever comes first.ConclusionThere's much to like about Accenture. Unlike many areas of the economy, they actually benefit from disruption. They've also got a strong operational history, and an excellent balance sheet. Finally, they have a strong history of buying back shares and increasing dividends at a robust pace over the past six years. I rate Accenture a Buy."
4044094,102646,2017-02-08T21:51:03-05:00,"Accenture has managed to grow revenues in different economic environments.Trump's policies could increase company spending.The company's growth is to be led by the consulting segment, as outsourcing is expected to lag.","Accenture (NYSE: ACN) is a Dividend Champion with a proven track record of rewarding shareholders with dividend increases and share repurchases. The company's stock price is currently near its all-time high at $115.92. Its all-time high price is $125. The company has a market capitalization of $71 billion and an enterprise value of $70.69 billion. It has a trailing twelve months P/E of 17.17 and a forward one-year P/E of 18.10. Before making an investment at these levels, investors should consider carefully whether there is a potential for growth. In this analysis, I will look at the implications of a Trump presidency on Accenture, and why I believe there is still room for the company to grow.(Source: Investing.com)Accenture provides strategy, consulting, digital, technology, and operations services to its clients in more than 40 industries. The company has succeeded in a very competitive industry against Indian companies such as Wipro (NYSE: WIT), Infosys (NYSE: INFY), and Tata Consulting Services (NYSE:TCS). In the United States, the company's competitors include IBM Corp. (NASDAQ: IBM), Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), Cognizant Technology Solutions (NYSE: CTSH), and other companies like PriceWaterHouseCoopers, among others.In December, Accenture reported its Q1'17 quarter with revenues of $8.5 billion, which missed by $70 million. In local currency, revenues were up 7%. The EPS of $1.58 beat by $0.08. In the quarter, the company generated FCF of $1 billion and returned $1.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and repurchases. In fiscal year '16, it generated revenues of $34 billion, up $1.9 billion from the previous year. FCF for the year stood at $4.8 billion, up from $3.7 billion in the previous year. In fiscal 2017, the company forecasts net revenues between $8.15 billion to $8.40 billion.Donald Trump campaigned with the promise of bringing back jobs to Americans. He complained that countries like Mexico and China were stealing American jobs. He also campaigned on the promise of easing ""job-killing"" regulations and the the tax burden on companies and individuals, a tax overhaul, investing in American energy, and renegotiating trade deals. When implemented, these policies have a chance to impact companies positively and negatively as well.The general consensus among many analysts is that reducing regulations, a tax overhaul, and easing the tax burden have a chance to spur growth. The stock market seems to be buying the idea. since the major benchmarks are now at their all-time highs. Another consensus is that some of Trump's proposals, such as mass deportations, trade war, and protectionist policies, could have negative implications for companies and the American economy. Deutsche Bank has warned that Trump could soon name China a currency manipulator, which could escalate tensions between the two countries.For Accenture, the performance to a large extent depends on economic growth. The logic is that companies spend highly on consultants in periods of economic growth and stability. As shown below, most of the company's revenues come from North America.(Source: Accenture)As shown above, consulting leads outsourcing in terms of revenues. In the last quarter, consulting contributed 59% of the revenues, while outsourcing contributed 41%. Most American companies use Indian firms such as Wipro and Infosys for outsourcing services because of their access to a cheaper workforce. The Visa H1-B program helps them in this. Fearing Trump's protectionist agenda, the companies have warned their employees of tough times ahead. The chart below shows projected offshore outsourcing operations until 2020.(Source: Wall Street Journal)Outsourcing is a major division of Accenture, as explained above, bringing in 49% of total revenues. The company has more than 384,000 employees, with the most being in India. Trump's crackdown on outsourcing could have negative implications on Accenture. In fact, according to the Wall Street Journal, organizations have started asking their consulting firms like Accenture to prepare to move jobs to the United States.(Source: Accenture)While the outlook of outsourcing is not very encouraging, consulting work, especially in the United States, is expected to grow. As funds from abroad are repatriated to the country, these companies will increase their spending. At present, the economy is doing well, with the recent nonfarm payrolls number increasing by 227,000 and the unemployment rate staying little unchanged at 4.8%. Consumer confidence, which was at a 15-year high in December, eased in January but remained at relatively higher levels. In addition, according to the Institute for Supply Management, manufacturing in the country expanded at the fastest rate in two years as companies anticipated a friendlier regime. The financials have also rebounded as Trump promises to ease the regulatory environment and make banks ""lend again"". Fidelity believes companies will continue investments in cloud, Big Data, and artificial intelligence. I believe Accenture stands to benefit from these investments.Accenture will also benefit from the new tax regime. In Q1'17, the company had an effective tax rate of 20.4%, down from 29.3% in the same quarter in the previous year. The low tax rate was as a result of ""higher benefits from adjustments to prior-year taxes, as well as our early adoption of the new accounting standard on employee share-based payments"". Trump promises to significantly reduce corporate taxes. Accenture stands to benefit significantly even with a point reduction in corporate taxes. As a global company, some of its revenues are held overseas, which could benefit the company and the shareholders if this cash were to be brought back.ValuationAccenture has a market valuation of $71 billion and a trailing twelve-month P/E of 17.14. The P/E is slightly higher than the industry average of 15.34, but is much lower than the S&P 500 average of 25.34 and higher than its 5-year median of 17.98. Also, as shown in the chart below, Accenture's P/E is near its 52-week low.ACN has a 1-year forward P/E ratio of 18.06, which is slightly higher than that of its closest competitors such as Wipro, Infosys, and Cognizant Technologies, which have a P/E of 16.46, 13.96, and 13.88 respectively. This could be because of the challenges the competing firms are facing. For instance, INFY, Tata, and Wipro have recently been hit the US' threat to cut on skilled visas. Though ACN lowered its full-year guidance, it attributed this to foreign exchange challenges, not the business challenges its competitors have raised. In addition, the company's operating margin of 13.93 is near its 5-year high.ConclusionThe new administration will bring significant changes to corporate America. Business leaders are banking on the increased infrastructure spending, tax overhaul, and regulatory overhaul. In addition, with technology changing rapidly and the need for agile organizations, I believe Accenture will benefit. It serves more than three-quarter of the Fortune 500 companies. In addition, with the recovery in US manufacturing, and with manufacturers looking for cost cutting strategies such as automation, I believe Accenture's services will be needed. There are, however, some risks which could be brought by the new administration - such as trade wars - which could have significant implications, especially in the outsourcing segment."

This growth will be slowly adjusted in the share price.Geopolitical tensions and FX volatility will impact Accenture but I don't think it is a major negative catalyst.","Sometimes I discuss stocks which sit out of my comfort zone, simply because they have a few characteristics which could be of interest to any kind of investor but don't necessarily fit my portfolio. For example a blue chip stock which has features of positive capital gains combined with interesting dividend. In this case I am talking about Accenture (NYSE:ACN). A little bit more than a year ago, I covered this enormous IT consultant on Seeking Alpha.I concluded that the firm is sometimes made fun of in the internet for its reputation to no surprise, but has excellent financial figures and a solid backlog. I thought based on current figures it would see another positive year in 2016 and the firm did not disappoint:2015 was only marginally better:Overall, Accenture has performed significantly better than the market since the bull market started in March 2009:As we are now officially in 2017, will this be another market-beating year? Is Accenture a good investment in 2017? In this article I will have a look what 2017 has to offer for Accenture.Accenture: What happened in 2016?Accenture seems to be the preferred option in the IT industry for any kind of corporation which would like an upgrade of their systems (in any of the new IT trends) for years now. Competition is fierce, from local competitors as well as third party developers, large blue chips like IBM (NYSE:IBM) as well as other consultancy firms such as Cap Gemini and Deloitte but Accenture has dodged many of their attacks.2016 was a rocky year with Brexit on 1 hand, and the US elections on the other. Both are likely going to cause FX volatility and the new negotiated trade deals will impact businesses all around. However, Nanterme, CEO of Accenture, is not expecting that Trump (and any of his policies) will have impact on Accenture going forward. Furthermore, Accenture started a new alliance with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in 2016 around industry-specific mobile and cloud solutions to help their customers and clients with the digital change and transformation. I'm a big fan of this alliance as I believe any alliance between consultancy firms and Google acts ultimately in the benefit of the consultancy firm as it will be their consultants going the client, not the ones from Google.Accenture: Latest ResultsAccenture recently published their earnings in late December. As this was just recently, it's worth having a look on what kind of implications this can have for 2017.Source: AccentureAccenture reported financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, with a staggering record of net revenues around $8.5 billion. This is a 6% increase in U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency over the same period last year.Financial services revenue increased to $1.8 billion, up 4% from $1.75 billion due to growth in the European financial markets. Revenue for Accenture's products group increased 17% to $2.3 billion. This is mainly driven by rapid implementation of digital, cloud and security changes.On the other hand, revenue in resources fell to $1.2 billion, which is down 4%. This is mainly due to the unfavourable macroeconomic environment for the natural resources and energy sector in America. With Trump in office in 2017, I'm not expecting this to decline significantly.As consultancy firm, the firm is maintaining a high level of utilization:Source: AccentureAccenture is still active in eating (acquiring) the lunch as well as breakfast and dinner of their smaller peers. The firm has always been a large M&A machine which is a huge driver for their growth. It allows the consultancy firm to stay on top of their game. M&A activity is used for either growth within recognized sectors or it is used for different cash flow streams. Accenture recently acquired Karmarama, an advertising agency and surprised competitors with this move. It once again showed that Accenture is on top as there is a lot of interest in this sector. Reading many articles on this particular move makes me believe there are more M&A deals within this industry coming. Especially as it is expected to support long-term growth for Accenture and any competitor which would like to achieve presence in this particular sector.Furthermore, Accenture recently acquired Arismore, a firm specialized in access and identity management to sustain and grow Accenture's expertise in the cloud sector. This is needed as there are still so many issues to overcome in the security industry.The conference call is a must-read for any specific Accenture investor, but there is one specific question I would like to point out:Source: Accenture Latest Conference CallAs this confirms the M&A acquisitions line up with the strategy management is planning out, and gives out a strong sense that the backlog is fine. This underlines the expectation that Accenture will be able to maintain their growth.Accenture: Share PriceAccenture's share price has lifted much similar to their free cash flow growth since the bubble burst in 08/09:The graph above indicates the firm has been able to continuously strengthen their books. This in turn allowed the firm to have their dividend yield to remain 'relatively' stable over the years as they continuously increased dividend:Based on the firm's profitability spurt (specifically in the last few years) and their growing revenue I believe the firm will be able to keep up with their dividend growth:To further emphasize that this pattern is most likely to happen, let's look at analyst expectations:Source: 4-traders.comThese expectations are much in line with what I've discussed before. The anticipation is that the firm is most likely going to continue their growth (on nearly every level). Their forward P/E is much in line with what it has been for years. It is not priced ridiculously expensive or cheap (as it has often been the case with Accenture). I don't believe this to change any day soon either. Income is anticipated a bit lower as Accenture lowered their guidance due to expected upcoming FX volatility.I don't believe Accenture will at any point boost their dividends simply as it doesn't fit their strategy. Nevertheless, the firm doesn't have to as their current dividend policy is easily sustainable.ConclusionI think it will be hard to find any competitor surpassing Accenture in 2017. Their M&A deals seem always righteously placed which allows the firm to be ahead of the game. And considering Accenture operates in the IT industry, it is definitely amazing as the IT landscape is constantly changing. Especially as certain technology changes mature much faster than others, timing of these M&A acquisitions are key.I really don't believe there are any major large positive or negative catalysts in 2017 which either can catastrophically crash or jump the share price. I believe growth will much likely continue in a similar fashion. The share price will simply adjust to this. There is always the risk that Accenture takes a large miss-step in the world of acquisitions and has to write off a large sum. But that won't cause any major issue. Geopolitical tensions, with new trade deals and the impact on currency will impact many, but Accenture is quite well diversified that any major loss won't impact the firm to such an extent that it validates a significant loss in share price. The firm did lower their guidance on earnings based on FX fluctuations, but I believe the drop in share price after earnings were published already adjusted for this effect.I believe it will be difficult for the market to beat Accenture in 2017.DisclaimerI currently do not hold stocks in Accenture.

The company tracks notable cyber hacking campaigns throughout the world and provides in-depth research via over 100 in-house analysts.iDefense seeks to 'identify patterns in domain registrations, IP addresses, and attack correlation to discover these assets before they are used'.Below is a brief overview video:(Source: VeriSign)Competitors to iDefense include:Also, many security software companies have their own threat intelligence units that assist in their product and service development planning. iDefense says its approach is based on its IntelGraph database that can correlate a variety of threat factors that enhance its ability to analyze threats and reduce time to customer notification.The unit is composed of more than 100 security researchers and 40 threat intelligence analysts, and its primary customer base includes industries such as banking, communications, products, technology, and media.Acquisition Terms, Rationale and CommentaryNeither buyer or seller disclosed the terms of the transaction. In addition to the team, the main asset that Accenture is acquiring is the IntelGraph database, which has obtained large amounts of historical cyberattack data in the unit's 18-year historyiDefense has also developed various APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), which enable it to programmatically notify customers in real time regarding vulnerabilities and evolving threats. Accenture will embed iDefense into its Cyber Defense Services unit, which provides Fortune 500 clients with threat hunting and incident response services.Kelly Bissell, managing director of Accenture Security, stated, ""We are confident that the collective capabilities of Accenture Security and iDefense can help organizations better understand where threats are coming from and adjust protections before damage is done.""This deal is one of several for Accenture in the security space, with recent deals including Defense Point Security, FusionX, and Endgame Federal Services Business. Large consultancies and security companies have been snapping up security units and startups at a busy pace since security is becoming a huge issue for large and middle market enterprises.As these prospective customers transition from on-premise systems to the cloud, security is an imperative, especially in many of the highly-specialized compliance environments for critical industries such as banking, healthcare and technology.I expect to see more M&A activity in the security space as new technologies such as machine learning and behavioral modeling continue to be developed to improve the ability for enterprises to defend themselves against cyberattack operations.I write about IPOs, M&A, follow-ons and secondaries.

4045407,101430,2017-02-13T13:05:41-05:00,Accenture has seemed expensive in the past.Accenture's growth opportunities seem durable.Management and the shareholder interests are properly aligned.,"A company that has long been on my wish list is Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN). I know it as a business consulting firm but it actually does more than that. Accenture bills itself as a ""leading global professional services company."" The professional services it provides are in strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations. What it tries to provide its customers is to help them ""…improve their performance and create sustainable value for their stakeholders."" Accenture always seemed to be the kind of company that was always ""expensive"" in terms of its valuation. After looking at some stock charts this weekend I noticed that Accenture has pulled back somewhat and I thought that the recent pullback may offer an opportunity for me to initiate a position in the company. This article will outline Accenture's business strategy, review some common performance metrics for the past 5 years, look at its growth potential, consider the stock's technical merits and lastly identify some risks of investing in Accenture.Accenture is more than just the consulting firm I initially thought it was. Accenture is a global company that operates in more than 120 countries. It operates in more than 40 industries. It has revenues of over $39B. Accenture grows both organically and through acquisitions. The company operates five operating groups: Communications, Media & Technology; Financial Services; Health & Public Services; Products; and Resources. The operating groups are provided the following services and solutions: Strategy; Consulting; Digital; Technology and Operations. Accenture believes its competitive advantage is its global delivery model, which allows it to provide scalable solutions, tools, methods, automation and artificial intelligence to its clients, enabling them to perform at a higher level. Accenture's management sees growth in its business due to cyber security threats, cloud technology demand and companies' needs to just be more efficient. Additionally, Accenture has business alliances with companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN).From an operational standpoint, Accenture has done quite well. Looking at some common metrics for the past five years shows how well Accenture has performed. See Table 1 below.Table 1 - Accenture 5-Year MetricsSourceThe metrics in Table 1 are strong and it is why Accenture has always seemed expensive to me. Revenues have continued to climb higher. Operating margins have been consistently in the 29-30% range. Earnings and dividends have increased nicely, while the dividend payout ratio has actually declined. Shares outstanding have fallen as well. The free cash flow per share has provided Accenture's management flexibility to raise the dividend, buy back shares and invest for the future. Accenture has grown organically, but management has spent money acquiring other companies in the past several years. By looking at Accenture's return on assets, the high returns tell me that Accenture's management has not overpaid for these acquisitions.All in all, the metrics show that Accenture is a well-run company. Accenture has done a great job of rewarding the shareholder. Dividends have been raised for 12 consecutive years. Accenture pays a semi-annual dividend, last paying $1.21 to shareholders in November 2016. It represented a 10% increase from the previous dividend payout. In addition to paying dividends, Accenture's management uses its prodigious free cash flow to repurchase its shares. Accenture currently has $4.9B remaining on its share repurchase plan. Morningstar has given Accenture's management an exemplary rating for stewardship. One reason for this is that Accenture has a Senior Equity Ownership Policy that requires executives to have six times their base salary in equity ownership of Accenture by their fifth anniversary of being named an executive. From a long-term perspective, an investor in Accenture knows that Accenture's executive management team is investing right alongside the individual investor. Both Accenture's executive management team's and Accenture's individual investor's long-term goals of business and stock appreciation are aligned.Accenture's growth potential looks strong to me. Over 40% of its annual revenues are in digital, cloud and security services. These areas continue to grow at double-digit levels. Cyber security is a growing market for Accenture. According to the FBI, since January 2015 there have been over 22,000 domestic and international companies that have been exposed to business email compromise scams such as the one that affected the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign (Katz). Cloud services are also a growing market for Accenture. Accenture is trying to be ""the largest enterprise cloud company,"" according to its CTO Paul Daugherty.Accenture expects FY 2017 revenues to grow 5-8 percent. It expects to generate about $4B-4.3B in free cash flow. The consensus growth estimates for Accenture are to have 5-year growth of just under 10% per year. For the last 5 years, growth was just under 9% per year. From a valuation standpoint, Accenture seems fairly valued to me. Its forward P/E ratio and its current P/E ratio are about the same at 18. Paying 18 times earnings for a company growing 8-9% does not seem outlandish to me. I think that the current valuation offers an opportunity to initiate a position.From a technical standpoint, Accenture is in a clear uptrend as can be seen in Chart 1 below. The 10-week exponential moving average is above the rising 40-week exponential moving average. Since early December, the stock has declined back to its 40-week moving average and last week had a decent bounce off of the moving average. To me, the stock looks strong on a technical basis.Chart 1 - Accenture Weekly Stock ChartThere are risks to investing in Accenture. A company like Accenture earns and maintains accounts based on the performance it provides its customers. If Accenture fails to protect its clients from cyber security breaches, or if its managerial advice to its clients does not provide sustained value clients will drop Accenture and its reputation will be stained. This could result in a cascading effect as more clients refuse to continue doing business with Accenture. Another risk is that of currency exchange. Accenture operates globally and is subject to having its overseas earnings reduced due to a higher dollar.In summary, Accenture is more than just a consulting firm and to me it has very good and durable growth potential. While it has seemed to be ""expensive"" in the past, it seems fairly priced to me right now. I particularly like its growth prospects in cyber security and cloud computing. I also like the fact that Accenture's executive management team has a vested stake in equity ownership. Technically, the stock is strong and while there are risks to investing in Accenture, the risk-to-reward relationship seems favorable at this price. I think Accenture offers the long-term investor an acceptable entry point now. Second-quarter earnings are due March 23, 2017, before the market opens. The consensus is for an EPS of $1.30, with a high of $1.34 and a low of $1.27. I will be monitoring the earnings release while looking for Accenture's quarterly earnings to approach $1.34.BibliographyKatz, David M. ""The Corporatization of Cyber Crime.""

4032005,29681,2016-12-21T14:53:58-05:00,"Accenture is a market leader in all the key sectors of the IT services industry.
        The company has a healthy balance sheet, strong cash flow, and has shown consistent growth in both revenue and earnings.
        Accenture offers a 1.86% dividend which it has increased by more than 20% annually since first introducing it in 2005.","Accenture (NYSE:ACN) is a global leader in information technology services. It employs 384,000 people and has a presence in more than half of the countries of the world. Accenture has long-standing relationships with many of its clients while over 80% of the Global Fortune 500 is serviced, at least in part, by Accenture. Accenture is the ideal stock for dividend investors as it is a growing company with a long history of paying out an increasing dividend on a consistent basis.Streamlined Operations and Forward Looking ApproachThe IT services industry is very fragmented so Accenture has a lot of competitors. Its chief competitors include large blue chip stocks like IBM and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Accenture has managed to grow revenue meaningfully over the last few years despite significant switching costs as its focus on the IT services industry often makes it the preferred option for companies looking to upgrade or change their IT infrastructure. Accenture offers a broad range of services through specialized groups. It has forged a reputation in recent years as the innovative and nimble player in IT succeeding in a climate where its competitors have largely stagnated.IT services are developing fast as companies move to cloud-based platforms and expand their social presence through various 'new media' sources. Accenture's new platform is focused on bridging the gap between legacy systems and the 'everything-as-a-service' cloud approach. In the last couple of years Accenture has carried out over $2 billion in acquisitions as it grows its scope. It is exciting to see them embracing this hybrid approach which gives them a broad arsenal to help deal with clients at various levels of technology adoption. In tandem with this approach, Accenture's long term relationships with market leaders in key industries lends them a unique perspective of evolving technological trends which they can use to keep relevant and stop their offering becoming commoditized.Industry Leading Revenue and Earnings GrowthThe IT services industry has been stagnant over the last few years as the US economy has stalled. Accenture has managed to expand its business in contrast to its competitors. Over the last three years, Accenture has delivered revenue growth of 4.6% annualized while earnings have grown by 7.8%. IBM, Accenture's chief competition, has seen 18 consecutive quarters of revenue decline and is forecast to shrink further in the coming year. IBM is forecast to lose 2% in revenue over the next year while, over the same period, Accenture is expected to grow revenue by 7%. Therefore, although Accenture's P/E is 19.2 while IBM trades at 13.7x earnings, the growing company is the preferable buy.Healthy, Consistent and Growing Dividend PaymentAccenture has raised its divided every year since it originally introduced one in 2005 achieving greater than 20% annual dividend growth over the last 12 years. While it has raised its dividend rapidly, it has also maintained a healthy balance sheet free of both short term and long term debt. Due to strong earnings growth, Accenture has managed to maintain a low payout ratio allowing it significant scope for further investment while also offering a healthy dividend. Over the next three years, Accenture is expected to grow the annual dividend from $2.31 to $3.20 yielding a payout ratio of 40% on consensus earnings per share of $7.80.I first acquired stock in Accenture 5 years ago in October 2011 at a price of $55.88. I have got a compound annual growth rate (including reinvesting dividends) of 17.7% from ACN over this period. For context, if I had bought IBM or Oracle stock at the same time I would have got a CAGR of 1.0% and 7.1% respectively. Even if I had bought IBM or Oracle at the lowest point they hit in 2011, my CAGR for each would still have been 4.5% and 10.8%.Accenture is well positioned for the future as the leading provider for cloud-based enterprise services as well as offering a suite of other market leading services. It has a very loyal management and client list as well as a healthy financial footing. I would recommend it to any dividend investors looking to add a safe blue chip dividend stock to their portfolio which will provide at least a 6% annual return over the next five years."
3987436,50662,2016-07-11T02:38:58-04:00,"Accenture still doesn't seem to be getting the attention it deserves as one of the most robust businesses on the NYSE.
        The revenue increased by almost 10% in the third quarter of its financial year, boosting the EPS by 13%, an impressive result.
        Based on the adjusted cash flows in the first nine months of the year, Accenture has a good chance to beat its cash flow projections.
        The majority of the cash flow is spent on dividends and share buybacks, but the share count is only decreasing slowly due to option exercises.","IntroductionThere's an old Dutch (?) song from the sixties called 'so beautiful, so blonde and so lonely'. And that's exactly the feeling I get whenever I look at Accenture's (NYSE:ACN) updates. Despite the gorgeous results, the company doesn't really get the attention it deserves as a resilient and robust cash flow machine. As Accenture has now entered the final quarter of its financial year, I wanted to check up the company after having recommended to buy some stock as a Christmas present. The share price is currently up 10.5% (11.5% if you include dividends), and that already makes me quite happy.ACN data by YChartsAnother 9% revenue increase is very impressiveAccenture's momentum remained very strong in the third quarter of its financial year 2016 as the company was able to add $9.1B to its order book, emphasizing its dominant position in the services markets it's working in.Source: SEC filingsThe Q3 revenue increased by almost 8.5% to $8.97B (after taking the reimbursements into consideration) and even though that's a great result, let's keep in mind the total cost of the company's services increased at a faster rate (9%+). Fortunately this was mitigated by the absence of a special pension settlement charge (compared to a $64M charge in Q3 FY 2015). This, and the fact the G&A expenses actually decreased by almost 1% despite the substantial increase in Accenture's top line, are the main reasons why the operating income increased by an impressive 15% to $1.3B.ACN Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsAs Accenture's balance sheet is very robust with a net cash position, the company actually has a net interest income rather than an interest expense, the net income also showed a substantial increase to almost $900M. As the company continued to repurchase shares to offset the dilution by stock options and to reduce its share count on a net basis, the EPS jumped from $1.27 in Q3 FY 2015 to $1.44 in the most recent quarter. That's great, but Accenture's excellent financial year is more emphasized in the 9M results, as the EPS increased from $3.69 to $4.86, an increase of almost 32% (mainly caused by a one-time item; the sale of one of Accenture's subsidiaries)!Very impressive indeed, and Accenture remains on track to report a net income of in excess of $4B. That's great, but I'm also very curious about the company's conversion rate; what percentage of the net income has effectively be converted into real free cash flow? And will Accenture be able to meet its own guidance of $3.6-3.9B this year?Source: SEC filingsAccenture generated a total operating cash flow of $2.5B in the first nine months of the year which is slightly less than the comparable period in the previous financial year, but the adjusted operating cash flow is much more impressive as a lot of the company had to 'lock up' some additional cash due to some shifts in its working capital position. If you'd adjust the cash flows for these changes in the working capital position, the adjusted OpCF was a very impressive $3.7B (and keep in mind this already excludes the one-time benefit from the sale of one of Accenture's subsidiaries). After deducting the $337M in capital expenditures, the adjusted free cash flow came in at $3.35B and it's now really starting to look like the company could beat its own guidance of $3.6-3.9B in free cash flow (on an adjusted basis).Share buybacks and dividends remain the company's preferred ways to return cash to its shareholdersAccenture is obviously generating plenty of cash these days, but companies sometimes see this as a blank cheque to do whatever they want with the cash flow and it's needless to say some of those decisions don't always increase the value for the shareholders.ACN Dividend data by YChartsFortunately Accenture does respect the unwritten law of not spending more than you're earning, and the company is keeping its dividend and share repurchase expenses in balance. The total amount of cash spent on dividend payments was $1.44B, but as Accenture pays a semi-annual dividend, this amount won't increase anymore in the current financial year, which means Accenture will have access to approximately $2.5-3B (depending on the final amount of (adjusted) free cash flow to use for share repurchases).ACN Free Cash Flow (Annual) data by YChartsIn the third quarter, the company has repurchased 4.3 million shares, but unfortunately this had no real material impact on the share count, as several options had been exercised as well. That's also clearly visible in the cash flow statement, as the net cash inflow from issuing new shares was in excess of half a billion dollar, resulting in a net amount spent on buybacks of $1.45B. So, long story short, yes, Accenture's adjusted free cash flow is higher than the total amount that has been spent on dividend payments and share buybacks.Investment thesisThat's great as this emphasizes Accenture's relatively conservative management style. Despite having a net cash balance of in excess of $3B, the company doesn't seem to feel any urge to spend it anytime soon and that's quite refreshing to see as dozens (if not hundreds) of other companies are even borrowing more cash to buy back stock, a strategy I absolutely don't agree with. Due to the massive amount of options that remain outstanding, the impact of the stock buybacks doesn't have a huge net impact, but it definitely mitigates the dilution factor.After seeing the 9M results, I think Accenture will beat its own FY 2016 free cash flow guidance (on an adjusted basis), and I think Accenture remains one of the more robust companies out there. The current free cash flow yield still seems to be higher than 5%, and that's a good enough reason to continue to hold the stock, as the company might become one of the backbones of my portfolio thanks to the robust cash flows and the strong balance sheet."

It develops and implements technology solutions to improve its clients' productivity and efficiency.The company was started in the 1950s, and now serves more than 40 industries and delivers virtually every business function needed by its customers.Accenture's clients include 94 of the Fortune Global 100 and over 80% of the Fortune Global 500. Approximately 54% of its revenue is generated from consulting, with the remaining 46% from outsourcing activities.By geography, North America is the company's largest region and accounts for 47% of total revenue. Europe generates another 35% of revenue, and the remaining 17% is from growth markets such as Brazil.By operating group, Accenture generates 25% of its sales from Products (consumer goods, retail, travel services, industrial, life sciences), 21% from Financial Services (banking, capital markets, insurance), 20% from Communications, Media & Tech, 18% from Health & Public Service, and 15% from Resources (chemicals, energy, utilities, natural resources).Business AnalysisAccenture's competitive advantages begin with its long operating history, wide range of services, and focus on developing its people.The company has been in business for more than 60 years, which has given it the time needed to establish long-lasting customer relationships and build out its portfolio of skills and services.The longer Accenture works with a client, the more ingrained it becomes in the client's business processes and key strategic issues. As a result, switching costs are created that help with client retention.For example, 97 of the firm's top 100 clients have worked with Accenture for at least 10 years. It also owns one of the 50 most valuable brands in the world and is a trusted partner.Few companies can match the breadth and reach of Accenture's services, which is a requirement to serve large multinational clients. The company has offices in more than 50 countries around the world, and is able to deliver end-to-end solutions virtually anywhere.Accenture delivers its services through nearly 20 focused industry groups, and consistently acquires smaller rivals to round out its services. The company has invested about $2.5 billion in nearly 40 acquisitions over its last three fiscal years to enhance its skills and gain scale in key growth areas such as digital.As the pace of technological advancements accelerates, Accenture is becoming an even more important partner for its clients, because it helps them be the digital disruptors rather than the disruptors.From 3D printing, cloud computing, data analytics, and security to virtual reality and robotics, Accenture plays a leading role in helping its clients go more digital with their products and services.Digital-related, cloud-related, and security-related services now represent close to 40% of the company's revenue and are growing at a double-digit clip.Accenture has a clear lead in the digital arena, which is fueling a lot of the company's growth. For example, it is the number one enterprise services provider for the cloud.The company does cloud services for nearly 80% of the Fortune 100, and is the number one provider to all of the leading players in the ecosystem today, such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM).Above all else, Accenture is a human capital business. The firm's services are provided by its people, and the company must differentiate based on its expertise and trust accumulated with clients.To stay ahead of the pack, Accenture spends heavily on its employees. The company invested more than $800 million on training and development in fiscal year 2015. This is more than double the amount that it invested in property and equipment, and represented more than $2,000 per employee.With over 375,000 employees, including thousands of PhDs, web developers, data scientists, digital marketers, and Big Data specialists, Accenture's skilled workforce would be very hard to replicate - especially on a global scale.As a capital-light business, Accenture also benefits from being able to adapt its business model somewhat more easily to changing conditions. The company can hire, train, or acquire new personnel to fill holes in its services portfolio and stay ahead of trends. This is much easier than retooling a large manufacturing factory.Headcount can also be adjusted up or down based on the economy's strength, helping Accenture better manage its profitability.A final strength of the firm is its diversity. Approximately 80% of its revenue is derived from nine industry markets, and Accenture's nine largest geographic markets also account for 80% of sales. The firm's top 150 clients account for just over half of total revenue, too.Simply put, this is a very durable business with numerous intangible assets (e.g., brand recognition, skilled workforce, long-term client relationships) that make it hard to disrupt.With that said, every business still faces risks.Key RisksAccenture believes that 25% of the world's economy will be digital by 2020, up from 15% in 2005.While the ongoing shift to digital is helping a large chunk of its business today, it goes without saying that the digital revolution is causing many companies to face an unprecedented amount of change - including Accenture.One example would be the rise of Software-as-a-Service (NASDAQ:SAAS), which is taking market share from on-premise deployments of software.SaaS deployments are smaller in size, which means less revenue available for parts of Accenture's outsourcing business. IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM) has certainly been caught off guard by a number of technological advancements (e.g., cloud computing), which have really hurt its business in recent years.For now, Accenture's core businesses have continued to grow. The company's digital offerings have also done extremely well, but it's worth keeping an eye on the impact technology changes could have on its business model and long-term earnings power.Besides technological changes, most of Accenture's markets are extremely competitive. The company's long-term future could be hurt if cheaper overseas competitors begin to pressure the industry's pricing model or if clients move some of Accenture's services in-house.For now, I believe its favorable competitive positioning remains intact.Dividend Analysis: AccentureWe analyze 25+ years of dividend data and 10+ years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend.Dividend Safety ScoreOur Safety Score answers the question, ""Is the current dividend payment safe?"" We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios, debt levels, free cash flow generation, industry cyclicality, ROIC trends, and more. Scores of 50 are average, 75 or higher is very good, and 25 or lower is considered weak.Accenture's Dividend Safety Score of 100 suggests that its dividend is one of the safest available in the market. The company's payout ratios are an important factor supporting its strong dividend safety.Over the last four quarters, its dividend payments have consumed approximately 40% of the free cash flow and earnings the company has generated.As seen below, Accenture's payout ratios have increased over the last decade and hovered close to 40% in recent years. This is a healthy level, because it provides plenty of room for future dividend growth and a nice margin of safety in case business fundamentals unexpectedly declined.Source: Simply Safe DividendsSource: Simply Safe DividendsBesides payout ratios, a company's recession performance is another important factor to consider when evaluating dividend safety. Cyclical companies that experience large swings in sales and earnings can be more vulnerable to future dividend cuts.Accenture performed fairly well during the last recession. As seen below, the company's sales only dipped by 8% in fiscal year 2009, and its operating margin remained resilient. The stock also outperformed the S&P 500 by nearly 30% in 2008. Many companies did much worse than Accenture.The business performed relatively well throughout the recession because its services are needed by businesses through each stage of the economic cycle. As technology continues advancing, companies must continue investing in innovation and productivity to remain competitive.Accenture can also help companies reduce their spending, save costs, and better align their operations for future opportunities.Source: Simply Safe DividendsAnother factor supporting Accenture's strong Dividend Safety Score is the firm's consistent free cash flow generation. Without free cash flow, companies cannot continue paying dividends unless they issue debt or equity. I only invest in companies that consistently generate free cash flow, and Accenture is no exception.It has generated positive free cash flow each year for more than a decade, highlighting the quality of its asset-light business model. The company even grew its free cash flow per share each year during the last recession.Source: Simply Safe DividendsAnalyzing a company's return on invested capital is important because it provides clues about its economic moat and ability to quickly compound earnings.Businesses that earn high returns on invested capital create economic value and typically have a stronger ability to pay dividends.Accenture's business requires very little capital to run. As I mentioned earlier, the company spent more on training its employees last year than it did on purchases of capital equipment and property.As seen in the chart below, Accenture's asset-light business model has generated a superb return on invested capital over the last decade, highlighting its moat and ability to compound earnings.Source: Simply Safe DividendsStudying a company's balance sheet is also critical to gain an understanding of its dividend safety. Businesses will always make debt payments before distributing dividends, and companies with too much debt can be at greater risk of dividend cuts if financial results unexpectedly deteriorate.Accenture's balance sheet is in fantastic shape. As seen below, the company has $3.5 billion in cash and practically no debt. It maintains investment grade credit ratings and could cover its current dividend payment for nearly three years just by using its cash on hand.Source: Simply Safe DividendsOverall, its dividend is extremely safe. The company maintains healthy payout ratios, generates consistent free cash flow, earns strong returns, and has a rock-solid balance sheet.Dividend Growth ScoreOur Growth Score answers the question, ""How fast is the dividend likely to grow?"" It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score, but places more weight on growth-centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios. Scores of 50 are average, 75 or higher is very good, and 25 or lower is considered weak.Accenture's Dividend Growth Score of 96 suggests that the company has some of the strongest dividend growth potential in the market.The company began paying dividends in late 2005, and it has increased its dividend every year since then.As seen below, Accenture's dividend growth has been excellent. The dividend has increased by 21.6% per year over the last decade, and has grown at a double-digit annual rate over the last three years.The company's last dividend increase was an 8% boost in late 2015, and investors should be aware that Accenture pays its dividends on a semi-annual schedule.Source: Simply Safe DividendsDividend growth over the next few years will likely sit in the mid- to upper-single digit range, tracking Accenture's underlying earnings growth.Management could grow Accenture's dividend at a meaningfully faster rate considering the company's practically debt-free balance sheet, $3 billion hoard of cash, stable business fundamentals, and healthy payout ratios near 40%.ValuationThe shares trade at a forward-looking P/E multiple of 21.6 and offer a dividend yield of 1.9%, which is somewhat lower than the stock's five-year average dividend yield of 2.1%.Accenture estimates that its market is growing close to 4% per year. Over the long run, it seems unlikely that the company would be able to grow much faster than the overall market given its existing large size (over $30 billion in annual revenue) and the law of large numbers.If Accenture clocks in mid-single digit revenue growth over the long term, it seems reasonable to expect its underlying earnings per share to grow at a somewhat faster pace - perhaps mid- to upper-single digit annual growth.For comparison's sake, the company's earnings per share and free cash flow per share have compounded at 12.3% and 7.9% per year, respectively, over the last five years.Under these assumptions, Accenture's annual total return potential is approximately 8-11% (1.9% dividend yield plus 6-9% annual earnings growth).The stock appears to be reasonably valued to me, but certainly doesn't look cheap. High-quality businesses rarely go on sale.ConclusionAccenture reminds me of some of my favorite blue-chip dividend stocks. The company provides timeless services (consulting and outsourcing), benefits from its brand recognition and breadth of services, participates in extremely large and fragmented markets, and has a long runway for earnings and dividend growth.Dividend growth investors should keep an eye on this high-quality stock. While its dividend yield is relatively low, the company's long-term total return potential remains strong."
3983419,57891,2016-06-21T14:56:36-04:00,Emerging technology business growth driving profitability.Slowdown in traditional application development business may lead to price wars in the industry.Recession in Europe may provide a major opportunity for ACN.,"Businesses' growing interest in adopting emerging technology solutions in the cloud and analytics space alike is helping Accenture (NYSE:ACN) drive above-industry-average revenue growth. The company has recorded an average revenue growth of 11% on a constant currency basis in the past 6 quarters, with consulting, rather than outsourcing, driving revenue.ACN's consistent performance has allowed it to outsmart its competitors and grow its market share significantly. With around 70% of its resources located in low-cost geographies, the global delivery network model allows it to record robust margins and provide low cost solutions.Increasing demand for digital services driving top-line growthAmid the global economic glut, the need to make businesses swift, regulatory-compliant, and remotely accessible is driving clients' demands for innovative solutions in analytics, cloud, mobile and social. The rise in demand for digital services has been pushing Accenture's revenue consistently higher (on constant-currency terms) since 2014.Adoption of emerging technology solutions will drive Accenture's marginsThe company has delivered stable operating margins in the past few years. While there is a challenge to minimize the fluctuations in operating profit growth amidst increasing pricing pressure from traditional IT services, the company's focus on moving its delivery centres to low-cost emerging economies and shifting focus on selling digital services (like cloud solutions, analytics, and mobility) could help it mitigate the impact of decline in margins due to the competition emanating from the outsourcing and traditional IT support segments.ACN's history proves that the company has always tried to be proactive in dealing with changes and has always been an early adopter of emerging changes in the technology sector. Be it the decision of investing billions to create low cost centres in emerging economic geographies to being one of the earliest adopters and propagators of emerging technology solutions in the field of cloud, mobile and analytics, the company is leaving no stone unturned to ensure robust and sustained growth.Businesses moving towards the app platform driving growth in the industryAs businesses move towards adopting mobile devices as the preferred mode to allow clients and employees to access enterprise data and applications, corporations are spending more money to extend services to mobile platforms, and it is benefitting IT solution providers like ACN, which are helping clients make this transition while ensuring data security and integrity issues are well managed.IT services providers are helping clients in this transition and ensuring that corporate data remains secure on personal devices. The mobile applications are also becoming a key point of client engagement.Businesses shifting the focus of their IT budgets from infra spending to emerging technologiesSMAC technology adoption is attracting greater spends as compared to areas such as building IT infrastructure and the trend is expected to continue in 2016. The shift is clearly evident as IT solution providers with greater focus on selling SMAC solutions are recording above industry growth as compared to peers with higher exposure in the infrastructure outsourcing space.Recession-hit Europe: a major growth driver for AccentureEuropean firms are looking at ways to reduce non-core expenses to make their businesses sustainable amidst the ongoing economic crisis. The recession has led to these companies trying to shave its expenses leading to creation of opportunities for IT solutions providers find Europe as a major growth driver for its outsourcing and emerging technology solutions.Accenture is recording faster growth in market share than peers like IBM (NYSE:IBM) and HP (NYSE:HPE)Accenture's early entry in the emerging technologies space has given it a clear edge over its other major competitors and has led to ACN recording faster growth in comparison to rivals IBM and HP. With clients seeking to outsource IT functions to low costs locations, the company's move to open delivery centres in India and the Philippines gives ACN a competitive edge over its rivals in acquiring clients. Moreover, ACN's move into the emerging technology business of providing SMAC solutions has allowed the company to record organic growth and expand its operating margin.Traditional IT services businesses will see a price warDecline in demand for traditional ERP application development and implementation business may lead to a price war this year as solution providers look for ways to maintain market share. The decline could result in the entire industry reeling under a slowdown despite growing demand for the emerging SMAC technologies.The slowdown, however, provides the opportunity for consolidation in the sector and acquisition of valuable targets, fueling M&A activity.Final wordsACN has played its cards really well so far. Its entry and ability to create value in the emerging technology space is a great opportunity to consistently beat peers and record healthy top line and margin growth. I rate the company a definite buy and a solid pick for your portfolio."
3982737,96536,2016-06-17T13:14:10-04:00,"Accenture PLC shares are trading near all time highs.Consistent earnings and dividend growth have supported the share price.But valuation is stretched, so is it worth investing in ACN right now?","Accenture PLC (NYSE:ACN) is a multinational professional services firm headquartered in Dublin, Ireland. They provide management consulting as well as technology and outsourcing services to clients. Since 1989, ACN has grown to employ over 373,000 employees, with about 130,000 in India.And the big footprint doesn't stop there. The company has clients in more than 200 cities in 55 countries. Clients' include 94 of the Fortune 100, and 80% of the Fortune 500 (source). With a list like that, and in-depth knowledge of client business processes, ACN probably has a sticky list of customers to fuel future growth.It's for these reasons, plus the fact that ACN stock continues to close at all time highs, that I want to take a closer look at the historical financial results of this powerful consulting company. I don't love to buy stocks at all time highs. But ACN just continues to march higher. So let's try to learn why.Now given this strong share price performance, let's take a look at the historical financial results to see if they support the rise in price. We'll start with the top line.Accenture PLC: Consulting Financial History For GuidanceThe revenue growth for ACN is consistently up and to the right, growing from below $20B, to almost $35B. It's grown consistently over the last 10 years and looks promising on a trailing-twelve month basis as well (source). It's always encouraging to see a company methodically growing sales.Although things look good overall, one potential warning flag to note is that revenue did fall in 2008-2010. And I think should we see another big recession, however unlikely, ACN is liable to repeat that revenue performance. It's feasible to me that companies would cut new consulting projects and scale back on vendors as much as possible to conserve cash during times of crisis. So this remains a potential risk.On the other hand, I'm encouraged by how ACN has grown sales while showing relatively consistent margins over the last 10 years. And this means revenue growth has, for the most part, dropped to the bottom line. Now that you've seen the revenue picture, here's a look at how net income has been growing too.Although earnings declined a little in 2014 and 2015, the trailing-twelve month numbers are promising. And I'll be very curious to see how this turns out on an annualized basis. So stay tuned.Another appealing characteristic of ACN is that consistent earnings growth is also benefiting shareholders directly, through share buybacks and growing dividends. The dividend growth rate below is rather impressive, and given the metrics we've looked at so far, I expect it to continue. So even though the current yield is shy of 2%, I think the growth record makes it compelling as your yield on cost could get fairly attractive quite quickly.And as I mentioned above, these shareholder returns are augmented by share buybacks. While I'm not always a fan of buybacks, in this case ACN has brought down the share count substantially from 894M to 673M. Have a look:Finally, book value per share has also multiplied over the last ten years. As a long-term equity holder, it's encouraging to invest in a company that has a track record of growing equity value, rather than diluting shareholders. I'm always happy to see this kind of trend.If ACN can continue this growth in equity for the next decade, it's likely to be a profitable investment. For context, analyst consensus estimates for growth in the next 5 years are 10.1% vs 10.5% over the last five (source).The other reason that I think ACN may be worth considering for an investment is because the company has maintained a consistently high ROE. The ten-year average is 61.7% (57.4% TTM). The fact that the company has maintained these strong returns without seeing them competed away is very unusual and speaks to their competitive positioning.Finally, I'd like to point out that ACN also has a very clean balance sheet. The liquidity position is rather impressive and it's unlikely the company will run into any financing or cash flow problems. This always helps me breathe easy.So is it time to pull the trigger on ACN? Well, unfortunately I think the shares are overvalued, and likely by a pretty wide margin. The biggest example of this I see is the increase in price to cash flow multiples. It's just kept going up over the last few years.It's hard to buy companies trading near all time highs, at high valuations. But maybe that's just the price of high quality consistent earnings. So while I'm happy for a pullback, I also don't want to leave money on the sidelines unnecessarily when it could be earning me a return.And as mentioned before, the only additional risks I'm wary of are slowing global growth among the large-cap clients of ACN. But in my personal opinion, and as shown in the TTM revenue numbers above, that's not too likely in the immediate term.Conclusion: Starting a Position in ACNAt the end of the day, I decided to start investing in ACN. I've bought an initial position and look forward to adding more on a pullback. So long as the operating metrics and revenue hold up, and I can't really see why they wouldn't, then ACN remains an attractive profit generating machine that I want to own a piece of.As I have a relatively long investment timeframe and regular money coming in, I'm comfortable being a little bit more lenient on entry price than others. So what do you think? Is ACN worth an investment? Or do you foresee risks that I've overlooked?"
3961652,86786,2016-03-29T10:40:30-04:00,"Forex has been hurting ACN since 2015, but the company was still growing.Holding ACN during this time is statistically a good idea.Anyone investing in ACN should be aware of the revenue growth vs. forex issue.","Accenture (NYSE:ACN) recently released its FQ2 earnings report, giving us much insight into the company's fundamentals moving forward into FQ3. Today, we look at how this new information might change your opinion of the company and the stock. Let's dive into the main issue (in my opinion): How forex has affected revenue.Forex and RevenueAnyone investing in ACN should be aware of the forex issue. While revenue growth is up in every country, revenue is actually down once you run the currency exchange. In the FQ2 earnings report, we learned that revenue actually grew 12%, which is significant for any company.This month we saw the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth. However, because this revenue is in local currencies, it will be weakly reflected on the balance sheet of ACN. The 12% growth in local revenue only translates to a 6% revenue growth in USD. Still, this 6% beats ACN's own forward guidance from last quarter.In addition, consulting has been in growing demand. Consulting revenues are up 18% in the local currency and 12% in USD. And outsourcing is up 6% in the local currency and 0% in USD.The takeaway should be that ACN is successfully growing in foreign countries, and that growth is still spilling over into the US balance sheet. Quarterly revenue growth is up and should continue upward during this time of currency wars. Eventually, the forex issue will work itself out and that growth will come back as a huge asset for both the company and the shareholders. Still, going forward, ACN is likely to see a negative 5% forex effect on its USD revenue.FQ3 Seasonal OutlookHolding during this time is statistically a good idea:The March-to-July seasonality of ACN is generally strong and should yield holders 5% ROI on average. Investors not holding now will have to decide whether to miss March, typically the best month, and enter April, missing out on roughly 2% of the 5% ROI. However, buying in April will give us access to half of ACN's dividends.But at this point, we shouldn't care that much about ACN's seasonality, as we only have three weak months in the year and because we already missed the nice March post-earnings pop. The fundamentals, however, can tell us a lot about what to expect moving forward.What We Learned from the FQ2 Earnings Prediction: How to Predict EarningsIn my Exposing Earnings Newsletter, we nailed it on Accenture. Watch the video below for a quick explanation of how we analyzed ACN prior to earnings.The main idea behind the prediction was that the fundamentals and true seasonality of ACN showed FQ2 to likely be a very strong quarter for the company. I believed that true seasonality was different than analysts' perceived seasonality, which implied a lower EPS in FQ2 than in FQ1.In addition, I believed that analysts were putting too much weight on forex issues. Yes, forex has been hurting ACN since 2015, but the company was still growing:In addition, because of the significant amount of offshore labor, ACN actually stood to gain from Forex issues, offsetting much of the post-conversion revenue loss.Now that FQ2 earnings are out, we take this opportunity to look at ACN moving forward.OverallACN has proven its ability to fight against forex headwinds and continually increase its revenue. With a six-year track record of consistently increasing its dividend, ACN is on track for another dividend hike later this year. Whether you're looking for a growth stock or a dividend grower, you can add ACN to your portfolio or watchlist with confidence.The high price of this stock might dissuade some potential investors, but I expect a split somewhere down the line to make this stock more appealing to new investors. Moving forward, ACN will focus on risk reduction and cost reduction, as indicated by its decision to scrap their US pension plan. More importantly, digital cloud and security are quickly gaining ground in their revenue makeup - approaching 50% - and should improve their overall margins and bottom line.If I had to sum up ACN in one phrase, it would be ""a low-risk, high-growth stock fogged from the investors' eyes by temporary forex problems.""Sidenote: Outcome of the Earnings PredictionWe expected a strong earnings surprise, and that expectation was met.

4005774,24491,2016-09-13T01:53:11-04:00,"Accenture pays a very healthy semi-annual cash dividend. We expect material expansion in the dividend in coming years.
        Fundamentals at Accenture continue to be impressive. Despite a volatile and fast-changing environment, the company continues to deliver record annual bookings.
        Fiscal 2016 is shaping up to be another great year for Accenture. The company's outlook for full-year revenue growth is a range of 6%-9% in local currency.
        Let's take a look at the firm's investment considerations as we walk through the valuation process and derive a fair value estimate for shares.","By The Valuentum TeamAccenture (NYSE:ACN) is one of the world's largest consulting and outsourcing companies, and its global scale provides it with the ability to deliver end-to-end solutions for its business customers. Approximately one-quarter of the firm's fiscal 2015 revenue came from digital-related services, a high-growth area, and one that is expected to continue to play a growing role in its business moving forward.The company plans to continue to drive revenue growth in ""The New"" (digital-related, cloud-related, and security-related services) via acquisitions. Though we generally like the focus on such high-demand areas for businesses, such commitment to acquisitions comes with integration risk and will eat into capital that could have otherwise been allocated to paying a more competitive dividend. Its yield currently sits at ~1.9%.Accenture's balance sheet is a key positive for its dividend growth potential (net cash of nearly $3.5 billion as of the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2016), and its average annual free cash flow generation of nearly $3.3 billion from fiscal 2013-2015 has been more than sufficient in covering average annual cash dividend obligations of over $1.2 billion over the same period. Share repurchases have also taken up a significant amount of cash in recent years (averaging more than $2.5 billion from fiscal 2013-2015).Nevertheless, we expect nothing less than continued growth in Accenture's payout based on its Dividend Cushion ratio above 3.Image Source: ValuentumAccenture's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Accenture is one of the world's leading consulting and outsourcing companies. The firm's global resources provide it with the ability to deliver complete end-to-end solutions for its business customers. The company went public in 2001 and is based in Dublin, Ireland.• Accenture pays a very healthy semi-annual cash dividend. We expect the company's strong balance sheet and robust free cash flow to drive material expansion in the dividend in coming years.• Fundamentals at Accenture continue to be impressive. Despite a volatile and fast-changing environment, the company continues to deliver record annual bookings, and we expect further expansion in coming years. Margins are healthy, and the company is returning cash to shareholders.• Fiscal 2016 is shaping up to be another great year for Accenture. The company's outlook for full-year revenue growth is a range of 6%-9% in local currency, and it expects adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.29-$5.33. Its services remain highly relevant to its clients.• Digital-related services has been a bright spot at Accenture. During fiscal 2015, for example, the company generated revenue expansion of approximately 35% in local currency in its digital line of business. This pace of growth should continue.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital.The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Accenture's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 87.4%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimateCash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Accenture's free cash flow margin has averaged about 10.3% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Accenture, cash flow from operations increased about 24% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 7% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisWe think Accenture is worth $97 per share with a fair value range of $78-$116.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them. Our near-term operating forecasts, including revenue and earnings, do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 5.5% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 3.4%.Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 15.7%, which is above Accenture's trailing 3- year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.6% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Accenture, we use a 10.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $97 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future were known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Accenture. We think the firm is attractive below $78 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $116 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Accenture's fair value at this point in time to be about $97 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Accenture's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $125 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $97 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

3868226,97486,2016-02-05T00:13:41-05:00,"ACN has produced an impressive Shareholder Yield of 5.8% over the last five years which is set to continue.
        Company is in very rude health: highly cash generative, lightly leveraged and with solid underlying revenue growth.
        Despite a moderately high valuation on an absolute basis, it remains fairly valued by historical standards under $111.","I find consulting and outsourcing companies pretty attractive. Despite the risks inherent in contract-based businesses, these companies tend to produce prodigious amounts free cash flow courtesy of strong operating cash flow and often fairly light CapEx requirements.It is for this reason that I bumped into the company at hand: Accenture (NYSE:ACN).As you will see, I argue that Accenture represents a pretty compelling buy despite a slowdown in growth in recent years. With remarkable fundamentals and a striking shareholders' yield it offers investors quite a lot of bang for their buck.First though, let's unpick the business a little.What Does It Do and Where?Accenture is chiefly split between two segments: consulting and outsourcing. In 2015, their revenues were pretty evenly split between the two with consulting contributing 52% and the rest from outsourcing.Within that they have a number of operating groups from which revenue is fairly evenly split:This is a nice diversity of revenue income. But this diversity goes further (literally and figuratively). Accenture has a generous geographic spread:Accenture therefore derives a lot of its revenue from overseas. This is, of course, attractive for the long-term although has rather dented revenue growth in recent years due to the strength of the dollar:Although this exposure to foreign currency is running against it at present. Over the long-term, these things tend to balance themselves out. Headwinds become tailwinds.All in all, therefore, Accenture looks well-placed for long-term growth.Strong Cash Generation HistoryOk, so let's get down to the fundamentals.First the matter of cash generation. Certainly looking at Accenture over the last few years shows that my description of a highly cash generative business is certainly applicable to Accenture:Ok, FCF growth has seen a modest CAGR of 4% over this period. However, OCF conversion into FCF has been staggeringly high averaging about 90% over the period:At Q1 2016 time as well, it looks as though those margins are set to get a little boost by year end. Operating profit margin at that point was about 23 basis points ahead of the same time the year before. Modest, maybe, but an improvement nonetheless. This is something to watch in coming quarters, but things look good so far.Impressive Shareholder ReturnAs noted in my title, Accenture's shareholder return really draws you in as an investor. The reasoning may not be entirely obviously when you look at the dividend by itself:Sure the current yield is running only a little ahead of the S&P 500 yield (1.91%). Sure the FCF yield is pretty high, but it is not dizzyingly so. However, this only tells a small part of the story.You see, Accenture is a consistently generous share repurchaser.Since 2011 it has returned around $5.3 billion in dividends to investors. Over the same time, though, they have returned almost $9.2 billion in share buybacks returning on average over 92% of all its FCF generated over the period:Such largesse is hard to ignore, especially as it means that (in real terms) the shareholders' yield on Accenture's stock over the last five years has averaged nearly 6%:A stronger share price performance in 2015 on the back of peer-beating revenue performance resulted in the lower yield in 2015. However, as noted above, Accenture continued to push over $1.8 billion the way of investors through share buybacks.Nor has the company set about cutting back it generosity in this department.In September 2015 the company added another $5 billion to its planned repurchase pot leaving it with over $7.5 billion outstanding on their current repurchase program. Quite staggering.By Q1 2016 time they had already shoved another $658 million in this direction suggesting that they are likely to contribute about $1.9 billion again in this year. Considering that all this shareholder return is covered by FCF, you would struggle to think on this without being impressed.Underlying Business is in (Very) Rude HealthNor is this largesse seemingly to distract investors from underlying issues at the business. Far from it, like all such good programs it comes from a strong performance and excess cash.Let's take a look at what I mean.Revenue and EBIT GrowthOver the last five years it has seen revenue grow at a CAGR of 3.7% with net income before taxes growing at a slightly faster 4.6%. Over that time it has also seen its operating profit margin remain stubbornly high:At Q1 2016 time as well, it looks as though those margins are set to get a little boost by year end. Operating profit margin at that point was about 23 basis points ahead of the same time the year before. Modest, maybe, but an improvement nonetheless.Debt Levels MinisculeNor is this performance debt-fuelled. it is comparatively commons for companies in this sector to carry little to no debt. Nonetheless, looking at Accenture's balance sheet shows a remarkably lightly leveraged business.At FY2015 time, they carried a debt of (wait for it...) $27 million. That is on a business with an enterprise value of around $60 billion and equity of a little over $6.4 billion at the same time.Needless to say this leaves the company on a remarkably tiny debt to equity ratio: 0.44%.What is more, with the strength of its FCF being as it is it leaves its entire debt covered by FCF over 136 times. To put that in perspective, this means it could repay its entire debt using its FCF generated in just over two and half days.Credit risk is not a big issue here then. Certainly, the credit agencies appear to agree giving Accenture an impressive looking normalized credit score (to find out more on how I normalize credit ratings see here):Incredible Cash Generating EfficiencyAll this points us to another attractive feature of Accenture. Its incredibly efficient generation of cash. We can ascertain this using the CROIC (cash return on invested capital) metric. This takes FCF and divides it by the sum of the debt and equity.A CROIC of 10% would mean that for every $100 of capital invested in the business, it produces $10 in FCF. For me, that is an already impressive rate of cash return.So, does Accenture generate a CROIC of 10%? No. It generates much more. Over the last five years it has averaged a CROIC of 55.6%.Indeed, last year it was even higher than this at over 60%:In other words, it generated over $60 in cash for every $100 in capital invested. That is staggeringly impressive. There are few businesses with a more attractive CROIC than this that I have encountered.ValuationI know what you're thinking here: ""Ok, it is a great looking company. Bet it is over-priced."" I may not be able to entirely surprise you here.Over the last five years it has averaged a PE ratio of about 19.9. Right now, it is trading a little ahead of this figure:It is therefore running a little ahead of its historic valuation. But a combination of continued expected revenue and income growth and share repurchases will likely see a CAGR EPS growth over the next couple of years of around 9%.This is attractive, but does it mean that it currently fairly valued? Let's take a look.Fair ValueI calculate my fair value here by taking the average from the EPS predictions for this year and next and then multiplying it by the historic PE average over the last five years. Doing so provides us with a:I then add in the cash held on the books. Doing so provides a:This would suggest that at the moment, Accenture is actually trading a little under its fair value.ConclusionAccenture is a great looking company. Although the outsourcing market has increasingly matured in recent years with a number of large-scale players aggressively competing with one another there is clearly space for growth for all. What is more, Accenture has proven itself capable of delivering peer-beating growth figures.Looking at the business there are no obvious ""warning lights"" to sour an investors taste for the stock. With negligible debt, robust and growing cashflow and solid underlying constant-currency revenue growth it looks set to continue to produce consistently impressive results in the future.Tied in with this is a shareholder yield which is both generous and regular. But as I noted in the title, this is just the tip of the iceberg. Accenture is a well-rounded business which, I think, deserves a place in anyone's portfolio. Right now, despite its slightly lofty valuation, seems as good a time as any to open a position.Certainly, anything under $110 with such a large-scale buyback program in place seems fair if not exactly bargain basement.NotesUnless otherwise stated, all graphs and the calculations contained within them were created by the author.

3824666,89326,2016-01-21T11:59:53-05:00,"Accenture's entire portfolio is growing impressively which demonstrates that the company is successfully managing its growth across operations and boundaries with great consistency.Looking forward the company has huge potential to expand across multiple fronts including digital technologies, advanced analytics capability and cloud platform.Based on this discussion, the stock is currently undervalued by 13% and deserve a strong Outperform recommendation.","Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN) impressed us with a resoundingly solid growth, which was diverse, both geographically and operationally. The growth results posted mostly strong double-digit increase in core business segments and across geographies with 11% in North America and 12% in Europe. Revenues were $60 million above the upper end of guided range, primarily driven by stronger than expected consulting revenues. Margins improved overall, despite pressures from increased penetration by GDN from 68% headcount to 75%. Before we go into the details of our analysis and expectations, here is a snippet of what we think of this stock:ACN is a strong Outperform stock with a TP of $111 representing the potential to bank on its clientele and bookings and increase its footprint through its market potential while improving its operational efficiencies.Returns outweigh risksAccenture Plc. announced a solid set of 1Q16 results that reflect 10% constant currency growth, and 1% ahead of top end of management 6-9%. The company's highlights over the quarter included strong consulting bookings, reflecting 24% growth in local currency over last year, fueled by demand for digital related services across Accenture Strategy, Accenture Consulting, and Application Services.Moreover, operating profit margins expanded 0.2% to 15.2%. However, the growth increase and improved margins did not reflect effectively with all entirety in EPS as higher than expected tax offset the momentum of earnings and EPS fell short of 3% from the consensus while operating cash flow fell 30% year over year. However this offset in EPS is short lived and cannot shake our faith in ACN as the demand growth continues to increase across geographies and margins improve over time favoring the case of this stock. Moreover the negative effect of increased tax is more of a one-timer impact and will reverse through the rest of year, allowing for growth to go its direction, unhampered.Diverse growth promises bright futureAccenture's entire portfolio grew impressively, showing the potential of the company in managing its growth across operations and across boundaries. What stood out was not the fact that ACN improved its growth numbers but the fact that it could do so in almost all of its business segments and that too with great consistency. Digital-related services grew over 20% in constant currency terms (local currency) and fueled strong double-digit growth in strategy and consulting services combined. Operations in application services came in as expected with high single-digit growth and mid single-digit growth respectively. Communications, Media & Technology grew 12% QoQ and marked the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This shows the company's ability to sustain profitability over long term. Moreover, growth was multi-dimensional and across borders as double-digit growth was recorded in North America and in Europe with 11% and 12% growth respectively. Industrial and life sciences industries also solidified the strong momentum of 12% growth for Products in Europe and growth markets. These growth numbers of Q1 have paved way for the second quarter's potential expansion based on strong pipeline and strong bookings.Expectations from ACNLooking at the growth momentum of Accenture we believe that the company has quite successfully embarked on the journey uphill. Looking forward the company has huge potential to expand across multiple fronts including; unleashing innovative ways of providing value through digital technologies, banking on their advanced analytics capability as the likes of Accenture Insights platform and last but not the least enhancing the scope and scale of Accenture cloud platform as hybrid cloud solution. Conclusively we see a very promising year for Accenture and believe that not only will it post convincing growth numbers but will also deliver shareholder value year over year. The figure below illustrates our forecast for quarterly EPS.Financial ValuationThe following is an excerpt of the financial performance of Accenture Plc. All the figures below are given in $ millions except for percentages.Source: Company 10-KsIn order to derive financial valuation, we have taken into account the above-mentioned factors and extrapolated recent past averages to forecast future trends. The table below summarizes the key assumptions for projections till 2021.With regard to capital structure, the company has only 0.03% debt based on market value. When funneled through the discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation method and assuming terminal free cash flow to firm (FCFF) growth of 2%, the enterprise value turns out to be $90.17 billion. Taking into account long-term debt of $27.4 million, the equity value came in at $90.14 billion. Assuming 809.5 million outstanding shares, the intrinsic value of stock is estimated to be $111."
3573656,87996,2015-10-15T05:05:45-04:00,"Accenture has a simple and transparent business model, and it is able to generate high free cash flow to equity.The stock gained almost 10% in 2014 and 15% in 2015. The financial results of the Company should remain strong.Nevertheless, current market capitalization implies quite high expectations. The results expected for year 2016 do not match them and the stock may need to take a breather.","Accenture (NYSE:ACN) reported its 2015 results in September, and it also gave guidance for 2016. The management expects net revenues to be in the range of 5% to 8% y-o-y growth (in local currency). The management also expects operating margin to be 14.6% to 14.8% (this corresponds to a 10 to 30 basis-point expansion). Full-year diluted earnings per share for financial year 2016 should be in the range of USD 5.09 to USD 5.24 (this means 6% to 9% y-o-y growth).Importantly, the Company expects operating cash flow to be in the range of USD 4.1 billion to USD 4.4 billion, CapEx should amount to approximately USD 500 million and at least USD 4 billion should be returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Performance delivered...Increasing profits and payout, but stagnating cash flowAs you can see from the following table, cash flow from operations reached USD 4.1 billion in 2015 and CapEx reached almost USD 400 billion. Total investments reached USD 1.1 billion, which means cash flow after total investing reached USD 3 billion. The Company returned USD 3.3 billion to shareholders. In other words, the Company paid out slightly more than it generated.Using the above presented estimates, cash flow after CapEx should be in the range of USD 3.6 billion to USD 3.9 billion in 2016. Assuming the other investments (i.e., mainly acquisitions) will be at a similar level as in the 2013-2014 period (approximately USD 750 million), cash flow after total investments should be in the range of USD 2.9 billion-USD 3.2 billion in 2016.The above means the Company currently expects approximately the same result as in 2015 as far as cash flow after total investments is concerned. Nevertheless, Accenture wants to increase the payout to shareholders. It can do so, because it has more than USD 4 billion of cash in the balance sheet, and its interest bearing debt is minimal. In other words, it can use reserves, but investors should keep in mind that increasing payout does not reflect improving cash generation.Valuation is not attractive anymoreIf we want to make some valuation estimates, we should use cash flow after total investment as a key measure (this cash flow can be perceived as free cash flow to equity here). The stock has a beta of 1.16 (see this), and the required rate of return should therefore be close to 8.5% (according to the standard CAPM model). Now let us assume cash flow after total investments will really reach USD 3.2 billion in 2016 (I take the more optimistic figure from the above derived range). Assuming this cash flow will be stable in the future, its present value is close to USD 35.5 billion.Current market capitalization is at USD 66.7 billion. This means the market is much more optimistic regarding future cash flow growth. We can actually quantify its optimism. The market assumes long-term cash flow growth will be close to 4% (i.e., if the cash flow grows by 4% indefinitely, its present value is equal to the current market cap).Is the 4% benchmark realistic? The last three years brought much stronger free cash flow growth, but history may be a very poor guide in this case. I do believe the growing global economy, structural changes in the corporate sector, and increasing weight of the services in the global economy indicate the 4% benchmark is not excessively high as far as revenue growth is concerned.Nevertheless, reaching the same growth of cash flow may be a much bigger challenge due to rising expenses and investments. In any case, expected 2016 cash flow should be basically flat (as I mentioned, we should not be mistaken by increasing payout to the shareholders - see the above). And there is no clear indication the situation should improve in the medium and long term.When I looked at the stock in 2014, I was quite bullish. At that time, the cash flow growth implied by the market cap was much lower. Nevertheless, after gaining more than 15% YTD, the stock may need to take a breather, because the expectations got quite high."
3776806,50662,2015-12-26T04:29:00-05:00,"Accenture performed as expected in Q1 2016 and remains on track to generate almost $4B in free cash flow this year.The company repurchased in excess of 3M shares (net of option exercises) and continues to reduce its share count by 2% per year.As Accenture has just $26M (yes, million) in long-term debt, it can use its entire free cash flow to fund dividends and stock buybacks.Accenture could be seen as a safe company that could remain in your portfolio for decades to come.","IntroductionThe headlines weren't really nice to Accenture (NYSE:ACN) after the company released its financial results of the first quarter of the financial year 2016, and even the day before it announced its results, the share price fell by approximately 5%. To be honest, I'm a little bit surprised by this slide despite a 'light' guidance for the second quarter, as Accenture again proved to be a resilient performer.ACN data by YChartsQ1 2016 was a bit disappointing, but the guidance has been confirmedAccenture's revenue increased by 1.3% (before reimbursements) when expressed in US Dollars, but if the company would have been allowed to report the numbers in the local currencies, the revenue would have jumped by 10%, indicating the currency headwinds Accenture is currently experiencing. Once you also add the reimbursements to the equation, the total revenue increased by 1.5% to almost $8.5B and that's a bit better than widely expected.Source: SEC filingsAccenture also did a remarkable job to keep all of its operating expenses under control and was even able to reduce the sales and marketing expenses which helped to offset the higher G&A expenses as well as the cost of services. The operating income increased to $1.22B from $1.19B in the same quarter last year. As the operating income increased by 3% whilst the revenue increased by 'just' 1.5%, the operating margin actually expanded from 14.23% to 14.42%. A 0.2% improvement might be meaningless, but don't forget this 0.2% represents $17M per quarter, and that's almost $70M per year that could be used for other purposes.Thanks to Accenture's very robust balance sheet and the lack of long-term (expensive) debt, the company actually generated a positive net interest income, as the income of $7.1M on its cash balance was sufficient to cover the $4.1M interest expenses.Source: SEC filingsThe net income attributable to Accenture on the other hand fell by 1.5% to $819M on the back of a 20% increase in the tax provisions (which increased from $300M to almost $360M). The diluted EPS was $1.28 versus $1.29 in the previous year, but if you'd neutralize the impact of the higher tax bill, the EPS in Q1 FY 2016 would have been $1.35 per share, a 5% increase! So, yes, you should take the lower than expected Q1 net profit with a grain of salt as the lower result is NOT due to deteriorating operating circumstances but has been caused by a higher tax pressure, as has been confirmed on the conference call.Indeed, Accenture has now also already increased its guidance for the entire year 2016 and now expects the revenue to increase by 6-9% (compared to the previous guidance of 5-8%) despite a total impact of 5% due to fluctuating currencies. The income and cash flow guidances have not been updated and the effective tax rate will still be 25-26%. This indicates the tax bill should decrease in the next few quarters as the average tax rate in Q1 was in excess of 29%!A hefty share buyback neutralized the impact of exercised stock optionsA net attributable income of $819M is pretty good, but I'm mainly interested in Accenture's potential to convert accounting profits into real hard dollars. And it looks like the company did a pretty decent job. As usually is the case in the first quarter of its financial years, Accenture's headline operating cash flow was impacted by changes in its working capital and once you isolate these WC changes, the operating cash flow of $611.3M increases to $1.08B which is a pretty good result!The total capital expenditures were just $95M, indicating a positive free cash flow of $985M in the first quarter of this year, and this means the company is right on track to meet its free cash flow guidance of $3.6-3.9B for the entire financial year.Source: SEC filingsSo what was the cash spent on? A large chunk ($721M) was used to fund the semi-annual dividend which was $1.1 per share, but the company also spent $658M on share repurchases. If you'd now add the dividend expenses to the share repurchases, you might indeed reach the conclusion Accenture was overspending on shareholder rewards (as it spent $1.38B on those two things), but a large part of the share repurchases was funded by the cash inflow from stock options that have been exercised, reducing the net amount spent on shareholder rewards to approximately $1.2B.Okay, yes, that's still slightly 'overspending', but I don't particularly mind considering the balance sheet of Accenture is very robust and the company has almost no long-term debt (just a silly $26M).Source: SEC filingsThe net amount of $475.5M spent on repurchases allowed Accenture to reduce the share count by 3.07 million shares, indicating a net cost of almost $160/share. Of course, Accenture didn't pay this much, and the discrepancy is entirely caused by the exercise of stock options as the average cash inflow per exercised option as just $55/share. So some employees will have had a very nice Christmas!Investment thesisAccenture still has a repurchase authorization of $7B, and I would expect the company to be able to reduce its total amount of outstanding shares by 3M per quarter, reducing the share count by almost 2% per year. This will in turn help to fund an increasing dividend as well as the free cash flow per share, which should come in at $5.85 per share this year for a free cash flow yield of 5.62% which is pretty decent for a company with a progressive dividend policy, a strong balance sheet and a share repurchase program.Analysts might think the Q2 guidance was 'light', but I think I might buy myself some Accenture stock next week as a long-term investment."
3302935,24063,2015-07-05T04:06:04-04:00,"Insider selling has picked up in June and early July.
        Renaissance Technologies exited a sizeable stake in the company.
        Other companies might be a better buy at current price.","By Andrew SebastianInsider selling has been heavy as of late in the shares of Accenture PLC (NYSE:ACN). Insiders sold a little over 89,000 shares of the company in June and in the first week of July. Richard Lumb, the head of Accenture's Financial Services group, sold 2,000 shares of Accenture on July 1. Like Lumb's sales, however, most of the sales occurring in June were automatic sales set in motion in previous plans and not an affirmative sale by insiders. Insiders often have plans to sell shares in their companies periodically in order to supplement their income or for other personal reasons. Nonetheless - the head of Accenture's Products group, Alexander M. van't Noordende, did sell close to 13,000 shares apart from any established plan. Moreover, insiders have sold six times more shares than they have purchased over the last three months and have been net sellers of Accenture over the last twelve months.Insider trading is important to analyze because studies show that insider trading can produce alpha. While there are many reasons why an insider would sell, there is only one reason why an insider would buy. Academic research shows that certain insider purchases have outperformed the market by an average of 7 percentage points per year. In addition to following insiders, another way to beat the market is by following the small-cap stock picks of hedge funds. Our research shows that the 15 most popular small-cap stocks among hedge funds have outperformed the market by nearly a percentage point per month between 1999 and 2012. We have been forward testing the performance of these stock picks since the end of August 2012, and they managed to return more than 132% over the ensuing 2.5 years and outperformed the S&P 500 Index by nearly 80 percentage points (read the details here). On the flip side, large-cap stocks like Accenture have had a less stellar record in hedge fund portfolios. The most popular large-cap picks of hedge funds actually underperformed the S&P 500 by seven basis points per month during the same period. This is likely a surprise to many investors, who think of small-caps as risky, unpredictable stocks and put more faith in large-cap stocks.In hedge funds' latest filings, five funds initiated new positions in ACN shares and ten funds raised their previous stakes. Three funds kept their positions the same, while seven funds decreased their holdings and nine funds exited their stakes. The top holders of ACN were mostly funds building or initiating their positions in the shares of the company with Landsowne Partners leading the way with 2.49 million shares with a value of $233 million. Adage Capital followed with a slightly reduced (-1%) position of $73.9 million, but the next five top holders were all increased or new stakes. First Eagle had a new $53.8 million stake; Polar Capital raised its stake 46% to 47.6 million; and Sloane Robinson upped its position by 334% to $28.6 million. Jim Simons over at Renaissance Technologies sold out of the largest position in ACN; Renaissance's stake was 1.3 million shares with a value of about $116.7 million.On the valuation front, ACN seems fairly valued with trailing and forward P/E multiples of 20.7 and 19.4, respectively. In contrast, IBM (NYSE:IBM) has a trailing P/E of 10.5 and a forward P/E of 10.3. Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) has a trailing P/E of 25.2 and a forward one of 19.8, representing its stronger growth profile. Given that neither ACN nor IBM is growing very fast, IBM might be the better buy with respect to paying for growth over the next year. Looking at cash flow, ACN trades at a P/FCF multiple of 15.8, while IBM trades at 13 and CTSH trades at 39.3. Thus, IBM is the best buy with respect to this cash flow valuation with ACN following closely behind. Moreover, IBM may be the better buy for income investors at its stock currently yields 3.1% versus 2.1% for ACN; CTSH does not pay a dividend.Accenture is a good company with returns on equity and capital of 50% plus throughout its history. In light of its relatively fair valuation, Renaissance's exit, and insider selling, however, it might be better to wait for the stock to get a little cheaper before initiating a position. If you are a current investor in ACN, then holding onto your shares is probably the best bet as ACN is a solid company and should produce nice returns long-term. The recent selling by funds and insiders is not necessarily a cause for alarm, but it should be monitored carefully by current shareholders as it could shed light into the prospects of the company going forward."

It is clear that ACN has created significant value for shareholders over the past decade, but can it do the same over the next decade?Dividend History:Before we dig into ACN's fundamentals, let's review its dividend history. As seen below, the company has increased its dividend for nearly 10 years, compounding its dividend paid by 30% over the last five years. The dividend has increased every year since it was initiated in 2005.While a growing dividend is a critical part of the total return equation, it is even more important that the dividend growth is sustainable. The payout ratio shows us what portion of a company's earnings and free cash flow is paid out as a dividend. Lower payout ratios suggest the current dividend is safer and might have greater long-term growth potential. When a payout ratio rises, it means the company is growing its dividend faster than its underlying earnings or free cash flow.Looking below, we see ACN's EPS payout ratio has increased from 29% in FY10 to 41% in FY14. The company's free cash flow (NYSE:FCF) payout ratio has roughly tracked the EPS payout ratio in recent years, suggesting ACN's earnings quality is high and the EPS payout ratio is an appropriate metric to analyze. With moderate sales and earnings growth expected to continue far into the future and a moderate payout ratio today, ACN seems to have a long runway to continue growing its dividend by 5-10% per year. I wouldn't be surprised if ACN was a dividend aristocrat in 16 years.Safety ScoreOur safety score measures 20 fundamental factors covering a period of 10+ years to assess the safety of ACN's dividend. It is measured out of a total possible score of 100 and accounts for the company's performance during the financial crisis, the industry's cyclicality, long-term and recent trends in growth and profitability, dividend growth track record, debt levels, stock price performance, free cash flow generation, company size, and more.ACN achieved the highest ranking of 100, meaning it achieved a Safety Score higher than 99% of the other 2,250+ dividend-paying stocks we analyze. The company's solid balance sheet, stable sales and earnings growth trends, consistent free cash flow generation, moderate payout ratio, commitment to dividend growth, and several other factors contributed to ACN's stellar rating.Growth ScoreWhile the Safety Score is most concerned with the safety of a company's current dividend, the Growth Score is all about a company's potential to significantly grow its dividend in the years ahead. It assesses nearly 20 factors to gauge a company's dividend growth potential, including EPS and free cash flow payout ratios, free cash flow generation, short and long-term sales and earnings growth trends, trends in return on capital, dividend growth track record, and more.ACN's Growth Score came in at 79, placing it in the top 21% of all dividend-paying stocks and suggesting it has a long runway to continue increasing its dividend. The company's high return on capital, strong and consistent earnings growth, and moderate payout ratio contributed to its attractive rank.Long-term FundamentalsACN's asset light business model has enabled it to sustain very high returns over the past decade.Revenue has grown at a 6% CAGR over the last seven years and a 5% CAGR over the past three years, demonstrating nice consistency. Sales also held up fairly well during the financial crisis, falling 8% in FY09 and remaining roughly flat in FY10. Results were helped by the usefulness of business consulting in each part of the economic cycle - helping companies cut back with their existing capabilities, align and position for future opportunities, and execute new strategies and major changes to operations.As previously mentioned, one of the distinguishing features of ACN is its asset-light business model. Working mostly with ultimately variable labor costs, ACN can flex its workforce to respond more dynamically to supply and demand surprises than other more capital-intensive businesses like a chemical manufacturer. While ACN's sales fell nearly 10% in FY09, its operating margin remained remarkably resilient, moderating slightly from 12% to 11% from FY08 to FY09.Solid margins, consistent sales growth, and greater labor utilization are a recipe for earnings growth. As seen below, ACN has compounded its diluted earnings per share by 18% and 10% over the past seven and three years, respectively.Almost all of ACN's earnings showed up as cash, highlighting the strength and resilience of ACN's capital-light business model. Looking at the chart below, you would have never guessed the world experienced one of the most devastating recessions ever in 2008-09. ACN's free cash flow per share has compounded at a rate of 8% over the past seven years and 4% over the last three years.ACN maintains a very strong balance sheet with practically no debt and over $4 billion in cash. As seen below, management has maintained an extremely conservative balance sheet since ACN has been a public company. This flexibility provides room for ACN to continue raising its dividend while investing to remain relevant far into the future.In addition to dividend increases, we see ACN has also been active buying back its own shares. In fact, ACN's total diluted shares outstanding have decreased at a 3% CAGR over the last five years. This capital allocation decision has proven to be a good one over the past decade as ACN has grown in value and each shareholder has happily increased his or her relative ownership stake.Quarterly ResultsACN's fundamentals have remained stable in recent quarters, supporting the stock's modest outperformance despite foreign exchange rate headwinds. Sales growth has remained positive in each of the last eight quarters and seems likely to continue in the low to mid single digit range. Earnings have grown at a slightly faster clip and will likely continue to grow in the high single digits range on average.Pierre Nanterme, Accenture's chairman and CEO, said, ""We are extremely pleased with our very strong financial results for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2015. Our revenue growth of 12 percent in the second quarter was again broad-based across the different dimensions of our business, and we gained significant market share. We delivered excellent new bookings of $9.4 billion, demonstrating that our services continue to be highly relevant to our clients. Based on our continued momentum and very strong performance in the first half, we are raising our business outlook for revenues for the full fiscal year.""Our growth strategy and the focused investments we have made across our business are clearly differentiating Accenture in the marketplace-particularly in digital, where we delivered revenue growth of more than 20 percent in local currency in the first half of the fiscal year. We continue to invest to further differentiate our capabilities and to enhance our competitiveness. We remain confident in our ability to continue driving sustainable, profitable growth and delivering value for our clients and shareholders.""Looking AheadWhile ACN has certainly done well over the past 10 years, we need to be concerned with the next 10. From a growth perspective, it seems likely that the markets ACN competes in will continue to grow at or slightly faster than GDP - consulting and outsourcing are timeless services.While industry growth will continue, it's likely that future growth will come in slightly different shapes and forms. For example, consulting services could become increasingly performance-based, and technology advancements are likely to accelerate the pace of change at clients and the specialized skills that they demand.ACN's long-term client relationships and in-depth knowledge of their specific business issues provides some protection against change. ACN's strong balance sheet ($4 billion in cash and practically no debt) and consistent free cash flow generation also position it to innovate organically (invested $800M last year alone on technology capabilities; has the ability to invest in the right talent to consistently match specialized skills with clients' changing needs) or make acquisitions to fend off new threats as they emerge. The company's industry and geographical diversification also add to its durability.Finally, the markets ACN is in are well over $400 billion in size, which means that ACN has less than 8% market share today and plenty of room to continue growing at a rate at least in line with the overall market.ValuationA high quality company like ACN is unlikely to ever come at a significant bargain, even despite its moderate sales growth profile. The stock's current price does not appear to be a bargain at 20 times trailing earnings, but its 2.1% dividend yield and potential for 8%+ annual dividend growth far into the future result in a more respectable 10%+ total return going forward. Additionally, ACN's current dividend yield ranks in the 45th percentile of all dividend-paying stocks. While this is a middle-of-the-pack rank, the company's dividend growth potential is higher than many of its peers. For long-term dividend growth investors, ACN is one to keep an eye on.Sources: Company Data"

The firm employs over 300,000 people, making it one of the biggest consultancy firms in the world. When it comes to consulting, only one ratio matters: utilization. Utilization is all about chargeability per employee. As an employer, you would want your employees to bill as many clients on as many projects as possible. And with a utilization rate of 91% for the second quarter of fiscal 2015, the consulting firm is clearly still going strong.Hence, the firm's stock performance has been outstanding. Therefore, it's worth having a look if the firm will be able to continue this path into the future. This article will act as an extension to that question.Source: YchartsAs can be seen above, Accenture was able to increase its utilization rate over the last few years. If the consultants on the floor are capable of bringing in more money, net income will rise consequently (as depicted in the graph). While the overall P/E ratio remains the same over the last 5 years, in other words, earnings grew at the same pace as the price, as of today's value, Accenture still yields enough potential upswing.Most importantly, the P/E values before the crash in 2008 were significantly higher in comparison to the current valuation, signaling even more potential that investors are willing to pay a higher P/E than its current value of around 20.Accenture - IT consulting (the world of consultancy firms)When people think about the consultancy world in all its glory and reputation, MBB is what would come to mind for most. MBB stands for McKinsey, Bain, and the Boston Consultancy Group. Nevertheless, their main business focus is significantly different than the much lower ranked consultancy firms such as IBM Global Business Services (NYSE:IBM), Accenture and Deloitte which are the top 3 for IT operations and IT strategy related projects. Accenture (and its IT competitors) focuses on the less prestigious consultancy projects.Nevertheless, there is a great overlap between all these large consultancy firms:Source: firmconsulting.comBesides the obvious, BCG and Bain, Accenture is the third ranked consultant which appears the most on McKinsey's website.Considering the majority of clients worldwide (which cover numerous amounts of firms in the Fortune 500), many firms are going through essential IT changes: such as upgrades on software, moving everything to the 'cloud' and so forth. A simple Google Trend overview of interest in the cloud shows interest in this sort of IT is still going strong. Hence, there is enough potential business for Accenture, and I see no reason why this would not continue in the foreseeable future. In addition, there are a lot of new regulatory changes coming up such as the Basel/Solvency directives and other financial compliance regulations, which all come along with new software packages. It's all part of the car Accenture is driving. And that car is fully loaded with a variety of IT projects.Source: Google TrendsAccenture - Strong FundamentalsSource: 4tradersFrom a fundamental perspective, as discussed before, Accenture is utilizing its profitable business model to the full extent. Revenues and income are expected to grow in line for the coming years. With a forward PE of 18 and a current PE of around 20, it's likely Accenture's share price will hit anywhere above $110 some time next year.Source: YchartsAccenture is still paving the way with increasing dividends, while FCF still supports those dividends (even though Accenture is using large chunks of its FCF for share buybacks).I'm not expecting Accenture to be in any financial trouble any day soon. Its Altman-Z score has been tremendous, even through the financial crash of 2008.Source: GurufocusFrom an investor perspective, on average, they have been underestimating strong EPS quarters while overestimating weak quarters. Accenture either surprises investors positively, hence a surge in share price, or surprises investors negatively, causing a slump in share price after corporate earnings are published.Source: estimizeAccenture - Reputation and why it really matters…Accenture as a whole doesn't have the best reputation, not among employees or among professionals who have worked with Accenture. It's often being mocked for its (questionable) business model. For example, employers asking employees to fill in positive reviews about their work environment smells a little fishy. A clever author delved a bit deeper into this process, which can be read upon here.He is willing to go far enough to say that Accenture is manipulating employee reviews. Whether or not he is right is not the point. The fact that concerns me is that negative media like this is spread around the internet, and that is not positive. For one, you will not find such bad reviews about the big MBB for example. Or for any other firm in such a substantial way as is being done with Accenture.Source: bigtimeconsulting.comOne factor adding to this negative reputation is the fact that Accenture specifically focuses on IT projects. And we all know that the IT project sector is one which has an atrocious history of failures. The majority of IT projects fail, while 17% of large IT projects go so badly that they can threaten the very existence of the company. This is one of the reasons why the overall reputation of Accenture is relatively poor, as that's what their employees are busy with from a day-to-day basis.Why does this all matter? Even though the fundamentals can be squeaky clean when a firm such as Accenture is performing so significantly well from a financial point of view, it's important to realize any of the variables which could jeopardize this profitability. And the singular most important metric of profitability for a consulting firm such as Accenture is the utilization rate. If this falls, more pressure will be laid upon current employees while the overall pressure on IT projects will only increase. All in all, enough recipes for a disaster.I foresee potential issues in the future where competitors could hijack certain market share from Accenture due to the ability to perform better in IT related projects. The only joker card Accenture holds in this position is the ability to grow aggressively through acquisition. Rather than feeling threatened, Accenture has the ability to acquire these competitors. A quick show through their M&A history:Source: BlueBookUnfortunately, the overall success rate of IT projects is still dismal to say the least. It's interesting to see which firm is going to jump in this ""gap of failures"" and significantly change the entire strategy of IT operation and technology consulting all around.The first firm being successful in this field will change the entire mindset of IT consulting. Until then, Accenture is a typical 'best of the worst' case. And a moderate buy at best.ConclusionPersonally, I consider Accenture's business model to be very profitable. Revenue and profits have been growing in the same pace as the price; hence, overall valuation has remained relatively the same over the last few years. This means that Accenture, as of today, is still very attractive from an investor point of view. Dividends are purely extra juice to maintain capital growth.Although Accenture has the financial ability to acquire (small) competitors to grow horizontally and vertically (and prevent losing market share), its overall reputation is poor. This is the one spot where Accenture could potentially suffer in the future. If it is capable of turning this poor reputation around (while shifting towards successful IT projects), Accenture might become the golden goose.For now, it's a moderate buy at best."
3252675,23471,2015-06-11T12:13:02-04:00,"ACN is suitable for the Enterprising Investor but not the more conservative Defensive Investor following the ModernGraham approach.According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is fairly valued at the present time.The market is implying an 6.56% earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, within a margin of safety relative to the rate the company has seen in recent years.","Accenture (NYSE:ACN) may intrigue many investors due to its healthy dividend yield and strong dividend growth over the last ten years. In addition, several qualitative factors make the company interesting. For example, Harm Elderman recently wrote about Accenture's ability to acquire any smaller firms that may become a competitive threat. This is a great qualitative issue to consider, but one must first look at a quantitative analysis of the company.In fact, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to determine a potential investment's merits. Here's an updated look at how Accenture fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.This model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.Defensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 4/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests, or be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey DataBalance Sheet - March 2015Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryConclusionAccenture is suitable for the Enterprising Investor but not the more conservative Defensive Investor. The Defensive Investor is concerned by the low current ratio, and the high PEmg and PB ratios, while the Enterprising Investor is only concerned with the low current ratio. Therefore, all Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding with the next stage of the analysis, which is a determination of an estimate of intrinsic value.From a valuation side of things, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $2.81 in 2011 to an estimated $4.49 for 2015. This level of demonstrated growth is in line with the market's implied estimate for earnings growth of 6.56% over the next 7-10 years.The company's recent earnings history shows an average annual growth in EPSmg of around 7.5%. The ModernGraham valuation model reduces such a rate to a more conservative figure, assuming some slowdown will occur, but still returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling within a margin of safety relative to the current price, indicating Accenture is fairly valued at the present time."
3961165,50662,2016-03-27T08:29:11-04:00,"Accenture reported a 6% revenue increase in Q2 FY 2016, which would have been 12% based on constant exchange rates.The free cash flow results are in line with my expectations on an adjusted basis. I continue to aim for $4B in free cash flow this year.Despite having spent a net amount of $1.2B on share repurchases, only 0.5% of the amount of outstandings shares has been bought back, due to option exercises.","IntroductionBack in December, I made my case for Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and called the company a Christmas present you should buy for yourself. We're now three months later, so I wanted to check up on Accenture to see if the company was still meeting my requirements.ACN data by YChartsThe second quarter was a bit week on the cash flow front…Accenture's second quarter of the financial year 2016 was in line with my (and the market's) expectations as the company reported a revenue increase of 6% compared to the same quarter in the previous financial year. In fact, if you'd calculate the adjusted revenues excluding the impact from fluctuations in the currency exchange rates, the revenue would actually have increased by 12% and that would have been a very remarkable achievement for a company that is already generating in excess of $30B in revenue on an annual basis.Source: SEC filingsDespite the higher operating expenses and the higher sales and marketing expenses in the second quarter (which were however lower than in the first quarter of the current financial year), the Q2 operating income increased from $1.02B to $1.09B, an increase of almost 7%. On top of that, Accenture completed the sale of a division and also recorded a one-time gain of in excess of $550M. As the tax bill was quite low, the net income of the second quarter was approximately $1.4B. Keep in mind this does include some one-time events, and then normalized net profit would have been quite a bit lower (at $800-850M). That's also 'visible' in the financial results of the first half of FY 2016, as the net income was 'just' $2.23B which seems to be a bit low considering the $1.4B net profit in the most recent quarter.Source: SEC filingsAn exceptional quarter, indeed, but what did this do with the cash flows generated by Accenture? Well, not that much, as the profitable sale of a subsidiary was deducted from the operating cash flow (as Accenture preferred to book the cash inflow as an investing activity, which I think is the correct way to do this, considering the income from the sale was most definitely a one-time event). The operating cash flow was $929M, but that's the result after taking the changes in Accenture's working capital position into consideration. As those WC changes were rather sizeable during the first semester, it would make more sense to compare apples with apples instead of with lemons. The adjusted operating cash flow was $2.3B and after deducting the $243M in capital expenditures, the adjusted free cash flow was $2.1B, which means the company is still completely on track to generate an adjusted free cash flow of $4B this year, which was my expectation in the previous article.… But the full-year expectations remain solidSo don't let the 'low' operating cash flow fool you, as this was predominantly caused by the changes in Accenture's working capital position. That's not surprising and the company confirmed in the most recent conference call it remains on track to generate quite a bit of free cash flow:Keep in mind this very likely refers to the non-adjusted free cash flow result, and for now I'm sticking with my adjusted number of $4B.Accenture's share buyback program is still in the fifth gear as the company spent almost $1.5B on repurchasing its own shares. This was partly funded by a $303M cash inflow due to some options being exercised, but still, the net cash outflow to repurchase shares was almost $1.2B and that's quite a lot of money! As Accenture's dividend also costed the company $721M, it looks like Accenture will spend 100% of its adjusted free cash flow on shareholder rewards. As the balance sheet looks very clean and robust, I obviously have no concerns and the mix of paying a dividend and repurchasing shares could be a good balanced exercise.Source: company paperThe share repurchases are definitely necessary to counter the effect of the options being exercised. Despite having spent a net amount of $1.2B in the first semester, Accenture bought back a net amount of just 3.4 million shares, or just 0.5% of its total amount of outstanding shares.Investment thesisAccenture's second quarter shows the company is still on track to meet my expectations. The headline operating cash flow looks low but that's entirely caused by higher investments in the company's working capital position, and these investments will be 'reversed' later on this year (we saw the same thing happening last year).If you bought yourself some Accenture as a Christmas gift, you're already sitting on a 10% gain. That's great, but it also means Accenture is now relatively correctly priced and it's no longer the bargain it was in December or during the sell-off in January."
3221626,83756,2015-05-29T09:31:34-04:00,A comparison of Accenture and IBM services' financial metrics.Accenture boasts higher growth but has a lower margin business.Accenture's current market valuation appears to be rational.IBM still appears to be undervalued by the market.,"The purpose of this article is to do a preliminary comparison of the financial metrics of Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and IBM's (NYSE:IBM) Services segment, and to draw some subsequent inferences about the current market valuations of both companies.At the very outset two caveats need to be pointed out:Accenture vs. IBM ServicesAll the information below is sourced from the companies' SEC filings. All dollar amounts below are in billions.AccentureIBM Services segmentOn a purely numerical basis, I believe the comparison between Accenture and IBM's services segment is tough. IBM has a much higher margin business, but in recent years growth has been non-existent. Accenture on the other hand doesn't have as wide margins, but has shown the ability to grow in recent years.If one is to assume that Accenture will be able to grow over the next 5 years at rates similar to or greater than the past 5, then its current market capitalization of $64 billion (about 15x pre-tax income) seems reasonable/rational. I would assert that at its current valuation Accenture is efficiently priced by the market.IBM valuationTo value IBM cautiously (after all IBM is a dinosaur), I propose to make the following mildly pessimistic assumptions - assume that IBM services revenue declines to $50 billion along with pre-tax margin contracting to 14% and the company is able to maintain these numbers (with no growth or further deterioration) for the long term. Assuming a 10% pre-tax return on invested capital hurdle rate, this would value IBM services at $70 billion.Now a rough sum of the parts valuation of IBM would look something like ...IBM intrinsic value = Software + Services + Hardware + Financing.In a previous article I very conservatively valued IBM's software segment as a $100 billion business. Putting this together with the above, we get a rough estimate (on the low end):IBM intrinsic value = $170 billion + Hardware + FinancingAs of writing, IBM's market capitalization is about $170 billion. In view of the above, I believe that even with conservative assumptions, IBM is still trading below intrinsic value.Note that IBM's hardware segment, despite all the headwinds it faces, still churns out a small profit every year. Further, IBM's financing segment is a perpetual profit machine - I would argue that it is at least a $15 billion business, very conservatively estimated (but that is a discussion for another time).The margin of safety with IBM is not quite as wide as when I wrote the article referenced above (at that point the market was valuing IBM at $156 billion). Regardless, I maintain that buying at current prices, IBM will at worst turn out to be a respectable investment for the long term investor. Of course, every individual should weigh this against their own opportunity costs."
3065116,39011,2015-04-14T04:44:30-04:00,Accenture stock has seen huge returns in the past few years.But it has also become a terrific dividend growth story as well in recent years.I’ll take a look at Accenture’s financials to see how long it can continue to raise its dividend.,"IT/Consulting group Accenture (NYSE:ACN) has certainly been on quite a run of late. Just the last five years have seen ACN roughly triple as the company's earnings have soared. ACN has also done a nice job of not only becoming a dividend stock but growing the payout rapidly as well. The stock's gains have been impressive but in this article, I'll take a look at the company's financials to see how much of a strain the dividend is at this point and if the company can continue to raise it as rapidly as it has been in the recent past.To do this, I'll be using data I've gathered from Morningstar.We'll start with a quick look at the company's per share payout in the past ten years.We can see that ACN's dividend didn't begin until late in 2005 after the fiscal year had already ended. The following year saw a 30 cent annual dividend and it has risen from there to the current $2.04 annualized dividend. To be sure, ACN has made it very clear that returning cash to shareholders is a priority with its massive dividend growth of the past decade. I'll also mention that due to the timing of ACN switching from annual to semi-annual dividends, 2010 actually had more cash paid out than 2011, so it looks like ACN cut its dividend. While it technically did pay out less in 2011 than 2010, it was due simply to the timing of the switch.We can see that below as this chart shows us the magnitude the various raises ACN has implemented since it began paying a dividend.As I mentioned, the switch from annual to semi-annual makes it look like 2011 suffered a dividend cut but apart from that, the company's dividend increases have been substantial. Increases on the order of 20% aren't unusual and that's the reason why ACN has been able to increase its dividend six fold since its inception.So now that we have a handle on ACN's dividend, how has it come to increase it by so much so quickly? This chart shows the company's net income against the cost of its dividend for the past ten years.We can see that ACN has managed to grow its profits by about 200% during the last decade that has also seen revenue double. The company has expanded rapidly and profits are soaring. We can also see the cost of the dividend has soared during that time frame and now consumes more than $1.2 billion per year. But ACN is vastly out-earning the cost of the dividend so that must mean the dividend can continue to see large raises, right? Not exactly, as this is the wrong information to make that determination.The reason is because we are looking at the two components of the payout ratio, net income and the dividend. These components are totally different from each other in that the dividend is a cash distribution, whereas profit is nothing more than an accounting metric. Net income is a useful tool for assessing a company's profitability but a company cannot pay anything, including the dividend, with net income. In other words, comparing a metric to a real cash outlay makes no sense. The good news is that all we have to do is replace net income with free cash flow, as I've done below.We can see that ACN's free cash flow is actually stronger than its profit numbers, an unusual situation that is actually great news for the dividend. ACN has produced $27 billion in FCF in the last decade but only $19 billion in profits. In other words, not only does ACN cover its earnings with FCF but actually produces cash well in excess of earnings. The end result is that ACN's dividend is actually even safer than what earnings would have you believe.So how much of ACN's ample FCF is it actually using on the dividend?We can see ACN has moved its dividend payment higher much more quickly than FCF but that's okay because it started so low. Even after increasing its dividend so quickly during the last decade, ACN is still only using about 40% of its available FCF on dividends. That's great because that means it could potentially pay twice what it is paying now before running up against liquidity issues.So what does that mean for the question I posed at the beginning? It means that ACN is still very low on the scale in terms of cash usage for its dividend. We can infer from that the idea that ACN is in a good spot to continue to boost its dividend by double digits each year with no issues. Unfortunately, it isn't quite that simple. ACN also buys back a lot of stock, so in order to understand how much room there is for dividend raises, we need to take that into consideration. This chart will show us how ACN used its FCF last year.What we see here is interesting; the dividend eats up about 40% of FCF - which we already knew - but ACN also spent $2.6 billion buying back stock last year. This pushed the total amount of capital returns in excess of FCF generation, something that cannot go on forever. However, the third component of FCF usage here is a very large credit for stock that was issued - $558 million worth - that brought total FCF usage very close to zero for the year.So what have we learned here? We learned that capital returns are certainly a priority for ACN as it spends more than the entirety of its FCF on dividends and buybacks. We also know that if it is going to continue to do that and raise the dividend more quickly than it increases FCF, the buybacks will have to be decreased in order to avoid a net cash outlay each year. I say this in reference to the long run as cash outlays can persist for a prolonged period of time if they are small and the company has the ability to finance the capital returns from a source other than FCF. ACN is certainly in that position but I would expect dividend raises to remain large for the near future and for buybacks to be tailored somewhat to available FCF."
2764235,72015,2014-12-18T21:07:49-05:00,"Accenture is one of only two stocks in the S&P 500 to match a screening criteria I created focused on low debt, high returns on capital and solid dividends.The firm has several impressive fundamental attributes, scores well in each of the DRAG criteria and trades at just 16 times forward earnings despite a 10% earnings growth outlook.Accenture appears to represent compelling value at its current price and its non-cyclical nature and cash rich balance sheet reduce its risk level.","A recent stock screen I completed at YCharts.com was meant to locate large cap companies with minimal debt levels (debt to equity ratio of less than 0.20), high returns on invested capital (greater than 20%) and above average dividend yields (greater than 2%). There were only two corporations that matched each of these criteria on the S&P 500: Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and Coach (COH) (which I have written about previously). While Coach has an uncertain growth outlook, Accenture possesses impressive fundamental attributes and analysts expect future earnings growth will remain robust. Its shares have performed well over the last five years, but have largely moved sideways thus far in 2014. This article investigates Accenture in detail to determine whether it represents a compelling opportunity for both growth and income investors.Please click here to read my article, which outlines the DRAG analysis framework in more detail.To summarize, the four variables used in a DRAG (dividend and risk adjusted growth) analysis are as follows (each company is ranked from 0 to 3 in each category): 1) How cyclical is the industry in which Accenture operates? 2) How strong is Accenture's competitive position within this industry? 3) How risky is Accenture's balance sheet? 4) What is Accenture's dividend yield and dividend growth history?The premise is that a company that operates in a non-cyclical industry, with a strong competitive position and a clean balance sheet that pays an attractive dividend should trade at a higher earnings multiple than a company without these attributes, even if the lower-quality company has higher projected future earnings growth. After adjusting for these variables, it becomes easier to compare companies in different sectors with different levels of future growth potential.Accenture DRAG Analysis:Two separate sources suggest that Accenture's industry tends to possess slightly below average volatility. This academic research website demonstrates that computer services stocks have a typical beta of 0.92, while the iShares Global Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:IXN) (which includes shares of Accenture) has a beta of 0.89 over the last 12 months. And although the company's results have remained fairly stable over the last decade (its earnings fell by just 8% during the financial crisis), its beta has been rising in recent years and currently sits above 1:However, given the lack of volatility present in the firm's earnings and its pristine balance sheet (which will be discussed in greater detail later in this article), it appears probable that Accenture's beta will drop back below 1 over the long term. Based on the data available for its industry as a whole and the company's historical results, consulting is not an overly cyclical business and Accenture deserves a slightly above average score for its lack of economic sensitivity.Accenture's margins have remained stable for much of the last decade, allowing the firm's revenue growth to translate into impressive earnings expansion. IBM (NYSE:IBM) achieves significantly wider margins, but has not been able to achieve any revenue growth in recent years. Accenture has generated a return on assets of greater than 15% for each of the past five years and its return on invested capital during this period is even more remarkable:The company's ten-year average return on invested capital of 63% is the highest I have ever come across. Being able to generate such impressive profits for each dollar of capital invested over the long term is evidence of significant and lasting competitive advantages.In some cases (such as IBM), companies utilize significant amounts of debt to create the illusion of an impressive competitive position by boosting their return on invested capital. However, Accenture has just $26 million (yes, million) of long-term debt outstanding compared to a market capitalization of over $50 billion. Furthermore, the company holds nearly $5 billion in cash and equivalents and has remained essentially debt free for more than a decade. While goodwill ($2.4 billion) represents a significant amount of the firm's book value of equity ($5.7 billion), investors can feel highly confident in both the short- and long-term financial position of Accenture.Accenture pays a dividend twice each year and has raised its payout every year since it was initiated in 2005. The stock currently yields a respectable 2.4% with a conservative payout ratio of below 50%. In recent years, management has returned nearly all of the firm's free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks; the recently completed fiscal 2014 featured $2 billion of buybacks and $1.25 billion of dividend payments. While the company only deserves an average score in this section of the analysis due to its moderate yield, dividend growth and income investors should find Accenture to be a logical candidate for inclusion in their portfolios.Analysts predict that Accenture's earnings growth rate will decline slightly over the upcoming three years, but a long-term earnings growth rate of greater than 10% is acceptable considering the company's strong fundamental attributes:Operating in a relatively non-cyclical industry, Accenture generates exceptional returns on invested capital, has a flawless balance sheet with a strong cash position and pays an attractive dividend. A company with these attributes deserves to trade at a premium multiple relative to other firms with similar projected earnings growth, but yet the stock trades at a forward multiple that is in line with the broader market:To reach my $114 price target (which represents more than 30% upside from its current share price), Accenture would need to trade at a forward earnings multiple of nearly 22, which does not appear overly realistic given its historical valuation range. However, the DRAG framework emphasizes non-cyclical companies that possess impressive efficiency ratios, balance sheets, dividend track records and earnings growth potential. Accenture happens to meet all of these criteria trades at an entirely unremarkable multiple, making it a particularly compelling investment opportunity in the current volatile environment."

2835596,25791,2015-01-21T05:13:05-05:00,,"By CapitalCubeAccenture Plc (NYSE:ACN) reports preliminary financial results for the quarter ended November 30, 2014.Accenture, a global management consultancy, technology services, and outsourcing company, reported an increase in revenue of 7% year-over-year when it announced earnings for the quarter ended on November 30, 2014. Earnings per Share (EPS) were $1.29, an increase of 12% over the same period last year.The strong revenue performance led the company to raise its revenue forecast for fiscal 2015, as winning new contracts led to better than expected revenue and earnings. Challenges from managing the strong US dollar impacted performance in the quarter. Accenture gets more than half its revenue from outside the US.This earnings release follows the earnings announcements from the following peers of Accenture Plc -Infosys Limited Sponsored ADR (NYSE:INFY) and Wipro Limited Sponsored ADR (NYSE:WIT).HighlightsThe table below shows the preliminary results and recent trends for key metrics such as revenues and net income.Market Share Versus ProfitsCompanies sometimes focus on market share at the expense of profits or earnings growth.Revenues vs. EarningsCompared to the same quarter last year, Accenture's change in revenue trailed its change in earnings, which was 10.60%. The company's performance this period suggests a focus on boosting bottom-line earnings. While the revenue performance could be better, it is important to note that the quarterly change in revenue was among the highest in the peer group thus far. Also, for comparison purposes, revenue changed by 0.92% and earnings by 18.62% compared to the immediate last quarter.Earnings Growth AnalysisThe company's gross margins showed no year-on-year improvement. In spite of this, the company's earnings rose, influenced primarily by the improvement in operating margins (EBITDA margins) from 15.16% to 16.24%. For comparison, gross margins were 31.96% and EBITDA margins were 15.15% in the quarter ending September 30, 2014.Gross Margin vs. EBITDA MarginGross Margin TrendCompanies sometimes sacrifice improvements in revenues and margins in order to extend friendlier terms to customers and vendors. CapitalCube probes for such activity by comparing the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital. If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital, it is possible that the company's performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply an accounting prop-up using the balance sheet.Gross Margin vs. Working Capital DaysAccenture's modest decline in gross margins were offset by some improvements on the balance sheet. The management of working capital, for example, shows progress. The company's working capital days have fallen to 39.51 days from 41.69 days for the same period last year. This leads Capital Cube to conclude that the modest gross margin decline is not altogether bad.Cash Versus Earnings - Sustainable Performance?Accenture's year-on-year change in operating cash flow of 381.65% is better than its change in earnings. This suggests that the company might have been able to declare a higher earnings number. The change in operating cash flow is better than the average of the results announced to date by its peer group.Operating Cash Flow Growth vs. Earnings GrowthMarginsThe company's earnings growth has also been influenced by the following factors: (1) Improvements in operating (EBIT) margins from 13.29% to 14.25% and (2) one-time items. The company's pretax margins are now 14.29% compared to 13.89% for the same period last year.Pretax Margin vs. EBIT MarginEPS Growth Versus Earnings GrowthAccenture's change in Earnings per Share of 12.17% compared to the same quarter last year is better than its change in earnings of 10.60%. However, this change in earnings is better than the peer average among the results announced to date, suggesting that the company is gaining ground in generating profits from its competitors.EPS Growth vs. Earnings GrowthCompany ProfileAccenture Plc operates as an investment holding company with interest in providing management consulting, technology and outsourcing services.

2668885,44001,2014-11-11T05:59:07-05:00,"Accenture has great financial efficiency ratios.
        The stock appears to be fairly priced based on 2015 earnings estimates.
        I would like this stock to come in a bit so that I can buy it, but for now I'll take a pass.","Accenture PLC (NYSE:ACN) is a professional service company. The Company is engaged in providing management consulting, technology and outsourcing services to clients. On September 24, 2014, the company reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings of $1.08, which missed the consensus of analyst estimates by $0.02. In the past year, the company's stock is up 10.95% excluding dividends (up 13.47% including dividends) and is losing to the S&P 500, which has gained 14.75% in the same time frame. I am took my IRA back from my financial advisor who managed to not make as much money as the market has and I've decided that I want to look at Accenture as a potential investment. With all this in mind, I'd like to take a moment to evaluate the stock to see if right now is a good time to purchase shares for the technology sector of my IRA portfolio.FundamentalsThe company currently trades at a trailing 12-month P/E ratio of 19.64, which is fairly priced, but I mainly like to purchase a stock based on where the company is going in the future as opposed to what it has done in the past. On that note, the 1-year forward-looking P/E ratio of 15.87 is currently fairly priced for the future in terms of the right here, right now. The 1-year PEG ratio (2.23), which measures the ratio of the price you're currently paying for the trailing 12-month earnings on the stock while dividing it by the earnings growth of the company for a specified amount of time (I like looking at a 1-year horizon), tells me that the company is expensively priced based on a 1-year EPS growth rate of 8.79%.FinancialsOn a financial basis, the things I look for are the dividend payouts, return on assets, equity and investment. The company pays a dividend of 2.44% with a payout ratio of 48% of trailing 12-month earnings while sporting return on assets, equity and investment values of 17.4%, 54.6% and 55.2%, respectively, which are all respectable values.The really high return on assets value (17.4%) is important because it is a measure of how profitable the company is relative to its assets, telling us how efficient a management team is at using its assets to generate earnings [for comparison purposes, Accenture has the highest ROA of all large-cap or over companies in the information technology services industry, ahead of Wipro Ltd. (NYSE:WIT), which sports an ROA of 16.4%, and IBM (NYSE:IBM), which sports an ROA of 12.3%].The really high return on equity value (54.6%) is an important financial metric for purposes of comparing the profitability, which is generated with the money shareholders have invested in the company to that of other companies in the same industry [for comparison purposes, Accenture has the second highest ROE of all large-cap or over companies in the information technology services industry, behind IBM, which sports an ROE of 85.1%, and ahead of Wipro, which sports an ROE of 23.9%].The really high return on investment value (55.2%) is an important financial metric because it evaluates the efficiency of an investment that a company makes and if an investment doesn't have a positive ROI then the investment should not be made [for comparison purposes, Accenture has the highest ROI of all large-cap or over companies in the information technology services industry, ahead of IBM, which sports an ROI of 26.4%, and ahead of Wipro, which sports an ROI of 16.9%].Because I believe the market may get a bit choppy here and would like a safety play, I believe the 2.44% yield of this company is good enough for me to take shelter in for the time being. The company has been increasing its dividends for the past 10 years at a 5-year dividend growth rate of 28.3%.TechnicalsLooking first at the relative strength index chart [RSI] at the top, I see the stock in overbought territory with a current value of 74.08. I will look at the moving average convergence-divergence [MACD] chart next. I see that the black line is above the red line with the divergence bars flattening in height which tells me bullish momentum in the name is getting tired. As for the stock price itself ($83.48), I'm looking at $86.28 to act as resistance and the 50-day simple moving average (currently $79.07) to act as support for a risk/reward ratio which plays out to be -5.28% to 3.35%.ConclusionThere is absolutely no doubt that this company is operated in a financially sound manner. Fundamentally I believe the company to be fairly valued on next year's earnings estimates and expensive on earnings growth projections. Financially, the dividend is solid and does have a lot of room to grow while sporting excellent financial efficiency ratios. On a technical basis the risk/reward ratio shows me there is more risk than reward right now. Maybe if I see this name drop in price in the near future I will put it into the IRA, but not right now.Disclaimer: This article is in no way a recommendation to buy or sell any stock mentioned. This article is meant to serve as a journal for myself as to the rationale of why I bought/sold this stock when I look back on it in the future. These are only my personal opinions and you should do your own homework. Only you are responsible for what you trade and happy investing!"
2522835,25341,2014-09-26T08:40:16-04:00,Accenture posted double-digit revenue growth and strong profits.The company performed well in all areas and geographies.Strong cash flow yielded a healthy balance sheet.This is a growth company that is not priced like one.,"On Wednesday, Accenture (NYSE:ACN) announced financial results for the previous quarter and the company gave guidance on the upcoming quarter. The company posted $7.8 billion in revenues and $1.08 per share in earnings. The revenues beat analyst estimates by nearly $200 million while profits missed analyst estimates slightly by 2 cents per share. This article will discuss the implications of Accenture's performance in the last quarter as well as its guidance for the future.Compared to the same quarter a year ago, Accenture saw its revenues rise by 10% and the company's net earnings climbed by 7% on per-share basis. For the full-year, the company generated $30.0 billion in revenues, $4.52 per share in net income and $3.2 billion in free cash flow. As a result, Accenture was able to raise its dividend payments by 10% to $1.02 per share to be paid semi-annually. Furthermore, the company guided for a revenue growth of 4% to 7% while generating $4.74 to $4.88 per share in net earnings.There were many positive trends in the company's results for the last quarter. For example, it was noteworthy that growth came across multiple business units and product types, which means that the company did not have to rely on any particular product, service or business to increase its revenues and profits. For the full-year, we could see the effects of cost-cutting measures in the company's strategy, as its margins rose nicely and its profit growth rate was larger than the revenue growth rate. For the year, Accenture's operating profit margin came at 14.3%, which is a solid improvement over the previous year's 13.3%.The new bookings of $35.9 billion represented an all-time high for Accenture and this gives the company visibility as we move forward. Even though Accenture spent $3.8 billion to repurchase its shares and pay dividends, the company still ended the quarter with a strong cash position of $4.9 billion. This strong cash position allows Accenture to raise its dividends and continue its stock buyback program. In the last two quarters of the year, Accenture's revenue and profit growth accelerated and if the company can keep this up in the coming quarters, the results will be very rewarding for the investors.For the full-year, almost all of the results (i.e., cash flow, revenue growth and profits) came at the top of the company's guidance range that was provided in the beginning of the fiscal year. In fact, the company even outperformed the top end of its guidance range in some of the metrics. Accenture's consulting bookings of $17.1 billion came as an all-time record and it has a book-to-bill ratio of 1.0 for bill and technology consulting and 1.1 for management consulting and systems integration. A book-to-bill ratio around 1 implies that there was a good balance between orders received and orders fulfilled, so Accenture seems to have achieved that during the last fiscal year.Accenture's outsourcing business also saw revenue growth as the demand for its services kept increasing. The company's BPO segment (Business Process Outsourcing) had a book to bill ratio of 1.7, indicating that there has been a strong demand for the products and services of this particular segment. The company also saw some solid growth in demand for its Technology Outsourcing segment.The biggest growth drivers for Accenture for the last quarter as well as the fiscal year were communications, media and technology industries. Accenture saw its revenues grow by 12% in these three segments. There seems to be solid demand for Accenture's consulting and outsourcing services in these industries and this is likely to drive further growth for the company in the coming quarters.The company's financial arm saw its revenues grow by 8% due to strong demand for its services and products from banks and other financial institutions. Resources industry proved to be one of the most challenging industries for the company and the challenging situation isn't likely to change anytime soon as the companies in this industry are currently in an aggressive cost-cutting mode. Still, this industry makes up only a small part of the Accenture's revenues, so the company is not likely to be affected that badly.Accenture was able to cut costs in several areas in order to become more profitable while keeping revenue growth strong. Sales and marketing was one area where the company was able to cut costs in relation to its revenues. Last quarter, sales and marketing costs came at 11.8% of revenues compared to last year's 12.6%. This was helped by simultaneous cost-cutting and revenue growth. It is difficult for companies to achieve solid revenue growth while cutting their marketing and sales spending, but Accenture seems to be doing fine so far. Accenture's general and administrative expenses came at 6.1% of revenues, down from 6.7% in the same quarter a year ago. For the quarter, the company's operating margin was flat from last year due to lower gross margins; however, for the full-year, the operating margin was significantly better as mentioned above.Even though there is a lot of competition in consulting and outsourcing industries, Accenture continues to gain market share and outpace the growth of the overall industry. During the last year, the company made some acquisitions (for example, Procurian) and it spent nearly $1 billion on growing its businesses. This proved to be successful and the investment will continue paying off for the company for years to come. Now that Accenture's headcount is at 300,000 after hiring nearly 80,000 people during the year, the company's massive size will allow it to benefit from further economies of scale. Accenture now serves more than 40 different industries and the company is the biggest consulting/outsourcing company in many of these industries.Accenture's strong performance was pretty consistent across geographies. In the US, Accenture posted 10% revenue growth in the last quarter. In Europe, the main growth markets were France, Italy, Germany and the United Kingdom. Japan was another location where Accenture was able to post solid double-digit revenue growth.The company had a very strong fiscal year and posted strong growth in both revenues and profits compared to the previous year. Accenture's cash flow was solid and the company enjoys a healthy balance sheet that warrants further growth-oriented investments or shareholder-friendly policies such as further dividend increases or stock buybacks. Currently, the company trades for 16-17 times its forward earnings and the company's current share price reflects very little future growth. As Accenture couples cost-cutting with revenue growth, investors of the company will continue to be rewarded. This year, the company's share price has been flattish and it has definitely been an underperformer but this can't go on forever. As long as Accenture continues to post strong results, its stock ought to catch up with its fiscal performance sooner or later."

Accenture is one of the strongest creators of economic value, and let's calculate that metric in this piece, too.For those that may not be familiar with our boutique research firm, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. We think stocks that are cheap (undervalued) and just starting to go up (momentum) are some of the best ones to evaluate for addition to the portfolios. These stocks have both strong valuation and pricing support. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.Most stocks that are cheap and just starting to go up are also adored by value, growth, GARP, and momentum investors, all the same and across the board. Though we are purely fundamentally-based investors, we find that the stocks we like (underpriced stocks with strong momentum) are the ones that are soon to be liked by a large variety of money managers. We think this characteristic is partly responsible for the outperformance of our ideas - as they are soon to experience heavy buying interest. Regardless of a money manager's focus, the Valuentum process covers the bases.We liken stock selection to a modern-day beauty contest. In order to pick the winner of a beauty contest, one must know the preferences of the judges of a beauty contest. The contestant that is liked by the most judges will win, and in a similar respect, the stock that is liked by the most money managers will win. We may have our own views on which companies we like or which contestant we like, but it doesn't matter much if the money managers or judges disagree. That's why we focus on the DCF - that's why we focus on relative value - and that's why we use technical and momentum indicators. We think a comprehensive and systematic analysis applied across a coverage universe is the key to outperformance. We are tuned into what drives stocks higher and lower.At the methodology's core, if a company is undervalued both on a discounted cash flow basis and on a relative valuation basis, and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Accenture posts a Valuentum Buying Index score of 6, reflecting our ""fairly valued"" DCF assessment of the firm, its neutral relative valuation versus peers, and bullish technicals. Accenture's technicals aren't as strong as they were when this report was published on our website (a number of weeks ago), but the company remains in a defined uptrend.Accenture's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Accenture's business quality (an evaluation of our ValueCreation™ and ValueRisk™ ratings) ranks among the best of the firms in our coverage universe. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders with relatively stable operating results for the past few years, a combination we view very positively. Accenture has a very attractive Economic Castle rating.• Accenture is one of the world's leading consulting and outsourcing companies. The firm's global resources provide it with the ability to deliver complete end-to-end solutions for its business customers. The company went public in 2001. We like its presence.• Accenture has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 12.2% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 0 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 0.5%.• Fundamentals at Accenture continue to be impressive. Despite a volatile and fast-changing environment, the company delivered record annual bookings of $33.3 billion in 2013, and we expect further expansion in coming years. Margins are healthy, and the company continues to return cash to shareholders.• Accenture pays a very healthy semi-annual cash dividend. We expect the company's strong balance sheet and robust free cash flow to drive material expansion in the dividend in coming years.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisAccenture is one of the strongest economic value creators in our entire coverage. The best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Accenture's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 146.4%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Accenture's free cash flow margin has averaged about 11.3% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Accenture, cash flow from operations decreased about 4% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 8% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisThe estimated fair value of Accenture is $78 per share , which represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 16.9 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 10.7 times last year's EBITDA. The company is trading in-line with those levels at present. Our valuation model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 4.7% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 9.6%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 14.2%, which is above Accenture's trailing 3- year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.6% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Accenture, we use a 10.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.We understand the critical importance of assessing firms on a relative value basis, versus both their industry and peers. Many institutional money managers - those that drive stock prices - pay attention to a company's price-to-earnings ratio and price-earnings-to-growth ratio in making buy/sell decisions. With this in mind, we have included a forward-looking relative value assessment in our process to further augment our rigorous discounted cash flow process. If a company is undervalued on both a price-to-earnings ratio and a price-earnings-to-growth ratio versus industry peers, we would consider the firm to be attractive from a relative value standpoint. For relative valuation purposes, we compare Accenture to peers Amdocs (NASDAQ:DOX) and IHS (IHS).Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $78 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Accenture. We think the firm is attractive below $62 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $94 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Accenture's fair value at this point in time to be about $78 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Accenture's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $100 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $78 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsIn the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of the Valuentum Buying Index has stacked up per underlying score as it relates to firms in the Best Ideas portfolio.

2521285,65313,2014-09-25T14:20:06-04:00,"Infosys currently has the highest aggregate ESG disclosure score compared to its top peers.Infosys outperforms Accenture on key GHG emission, energy usage, and intensity metrics.To continue leading, Infosys needs to show continuing improvement on ESG disclosures year to year.","ModernGraham recently identified Accenture (NYSE: ACN) as appropriate for Enterprising Investors, and Infosys (IN: INFY) as appropriate for Defensive or Enterprising Investors. As a potential investor, now I want to know how well these two global professional service enterprises perform beyond the financial metrics, by examining their environmental, social and governance (or ESG) or sustainability performance.Why Do Investors Value ESG Data? There is a growing body of evidence of a strong link between long-term financial performance and sustainability performance from trusted sources like Deloitte, Harvard Business Review and Global 100. See this white paper (p. 5/9) for links to these sources. Also, this summer IR magazine published the results of a study by New Amsterdam Partners that concluded that investors could improve their returns and lower the volatility of their portfolios by eliminating the stocks with the lowest ESG ratings.To drive ESG insights, best practice is to compare several companies' side-by-side, usually from within the same industry sector. In this blog, Accenture and Infosys are compared to each other, and to eight top peers on key environmental and social metrics.Table 1 below compares Infosys and Accenture on aggregate ESG disclosures between the years 2009 and 2014. Bloomberg generates the ESG disclosure score based upon how well a company discloses key ESG metrics. I like the ESG disclosure score because it provides a quick macro-read on how accountable and transparent a company chooses to be when it comes to sustainability performance. ESG scores range between zero (no disclosure) and 100 (full disclosure).TABLE 1: ESG DISCLOSURE TRENDS FOR 2009 TO 2014Infosys currently has the highest ESG disclosure score among its peers, meaning Infosys has made more robust ESG disclosures to date. However, Infosys' 2014 ESG score, based on 2013 performance, dropped eight points from 56 to 48. More research is needed to pinpoint the reason for the drop, but the drop is related to INFY's 2014 environmental and social disclosures.Accenture's ESG score has remained flat between 2009 and 2013 by remaining at 42. Accenture reports ESG data on a fiscal year basis. In March 2014, Accenture released its current ESG data for 2012-2013. Based on this, we expect that Accenture will publish its 2013-2014 ESG data in March 2015 - thus, the ""NA"" for Accenture under 2014. For this blog, we are comparing the most currently available ESG data available for these companies as reported on Bloomberg.Table 2 compares ACN and INFY on total greenhouse gas (NYSE:GHG) emissions, which include company generated GHG emissions (Scope 1) and company purchased or utility emissions (Scope 2), and also three key intensity metrics. According to Bloomberg, Infosys's Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG data has been 100% data verified. Accenture's Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG data is 20% verified.TABLE 2: KEY GHG AND ENERGY METRICSInfosys emits less GHG (Column 2) and uses less energy (Column 5) compared to Accenture, which makes sense because Infosys is a smaller enterprise compared to Accenture. However, Infosys also outperforms Accenture on GHG and energy intensity metrics. This is a fact, whether investors are analyzing the companies' GHG or energy metrics as a percentage of company sales (Column 3), or company assets (Column 4), or company profits before EBITDA (Column 6).According to the data, Accenture's GHG intensity as a percentage (%) of sales (Column 3) is 27 times higher than Infosys's. A close look at Accenture's ESG data suggests that Accenture's Scope 2 (utility) related emissions are much higher than Scope 2 emissions for Infosys.Accenture's GHG intensity as a % of total assets is 56 times greater than Infosys's. Accenture's energy intensity as a % of profit before EBITDA is 39 times greater than Infosys's. These metrics suggest that Infosys is doing a much better job addressing internal operational and energy efficiencies than Accenture, thereby directly reducing Infosys's costs to provide services.TABLE 3: KEY ENVIRONMENTAL METRICS FOR TOP PROFESSIONAL SERVICE PEERSWhen it comes to total water usage (Column 2), and total waste disposed (Column 3), Infosys uses more water and disposes off more waste than the other three peers that reported these metrics. Accenture lags by not disclosing total water usage and total waste disposed, along with about half of the peers in this benchmark.None of the professional service companies in this benchmark have disclosed their investment in sustainable operations. This metric provides investors with the operating budgets for the companies' investment in millions to address operational efficiencies, among other internal sustainability initiatives. By not providing this metric, companies miss an opportunity to demonstrate that sustainability goals and budgets are transparent and executable.At a minimum, the key environmental metrics reviewed above raise intelligent questions for investors that may require more research if you are an investor that wants to invest in companies that are committed to accountability and transparency when it comes to corporate use of natural resources in operations.Beyond the environmental footprint, key social metrics show that both Infosys and Accenture employ women in the workforce at a rate slightly above the industry average of 32% (Column 2).TABLE 4: KEY SOCIAL METRICS FOR TOP PROFESSIONAL SERVICE PEERSWhen it comes to employee diversity, which is often a mark of whether a company attracts the best and the brightest, Accenture has fewer women in management (17%)(Column 4) than it has in its workforce (36%)(Column 2), or on its board (25%)(Column 3). The same is true of Infosys, which has 26% women in management, 34% women in its workforce, but only 8% women on its board of directors.None of the 10 companies benchmarked measure the percentage of minorities in management. However, almost all of these companies have equal opportunity policies, so these key social metrics raise questions about gender parity and equal opportunity in large publicly traded professional service enterprises.Walk the Talk? According to the ESG data provided here, Infosys outperforms Accenture when it comes to measuring and reducing the company's environmental footprint and energy usage. Neither company demonstrates momentum or commitment when it comes to continuing improvement on a range of ESG disclosure and performance issues. Yet, both of these enterprises develop, sell, and deliver a wide range of sustainability solutions to their clients. Therefore, what interests me, as a potential investor, is whether these companies operate in a way that shows they walk the talk. In other words, do these companies demonstrate through sustainability performance disclosures and reporting that they really know how to compete on sustainability to drive business value? I hope that this blog will help you answer that question satisfactorily for yourself.What is ESG Data? Companies release ESG data through annual reports such as the 10K and the corporate social responsibility (CSR) report. Standard key ESG metrics help investors and other stakeholders' conduct due diligence about a company's values, leadership style, operational efficiencies and environmental footprint, employee and customer loyalty and opportunity, and community relations. Our primary source for ESG data is Bloomberg's Professional Finance and ESG database (Bloomberg). Since 2009, corporate ESG data has been available through subscription services provided by Bloomberg. With nearly 400,000 Bloomberg terminals located in financial institutions, publicly traded companies, academic institutions, and some public libraries throughout the world, this big data is available for stakeholder consumption. Therefore, if a company sees an error in their public ESG data, it should have a corporate representative contact Bloomberg and get it corrected, as it would with public financial data.Disclaimer: The author does not hold a position in any of stocks mentioned in this article, and has no plans to change that position within the next 72 hours."
2467815,71605,2014-09-03T10:57:53-04:00,The world's leading consultancy firm has incredibly stable return on equity.Deep industry ties and a big commitment to cloud services indicate that Accenture will continue to be an industry leader for some time.The size of Accenture and the consistency of their operation gives us a reasonable chance to estimate future performance.,"In this article, we will provide insights into how Accenture PLC's (NYSE:ACN) distribution of earnings between dividends, reinvestment and share repurchases make the consultancy a great buy at the current price. The analysis will be a case study of hypothetical scenarios to assess what future potential investors should expect.Accenture is the world's largest consultancy as measured by revenue. It has extremely deep industry ties: Among its clients are 91 of the Fortune Global 100 companies and more than 75% of the Fortune Global 500 companies. With revenue of $31.13 billion and net income of $2.91 billion, this Fortune Global 500 consultancy is itself a giant both within its industry and on a global scale.However, what we believe makes Accenture a tremendous investment opportunity is its strong earnings history coupled with a clever distribution of the earnings between reinvestment, dividend payouts, and share repurchase programs. Let's take a closer look at how this is done, and what it tells us about the future.Hard NumbersOver the last 10 years, Accenture has posted extremely high and consistent return-on-equity levels. Compared to consulting rivals IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Accenture provides both higher and more reliable (less volatile and more stable) return on equity, as is clear from the table below (data taken from MSN Money):The CoV is the coefficient of variation (also known as the unitized risk), which is the ratio of the standard deviation over the mean. Intuitively, it is favorable to have as low a coefficient of variation as possible, as this points to both high return on equity and the possibility of more accurately predicting future results. Given such consistent return on equity, a realistic estimate for future earnings will be the total shareholder's equity multiplied by the historical mean return on equity.How does the company spend its earnings? Accenture has an average dividend payout ratio of 26.4%. Moreover, the company spent an average of about 40% of earnings buying back its own shares in the market, and by the latest financial reports it seems that it will continue to aggressively buy back shares. This means that 33.7% of earnings are being added to the total shareholders' equity, through either reinvestment, increased cash holdings, or paying off debtors.Possible Future Scenario for AccentureWith current total shareholders' equity of $5.6 billion, we expect (purely from our estimates above) that next year's net income will be $3.5 billion (63.5% of $5.6 billion). Provided Accenture chooses to continue its policy regarding the division of earnings, this will result in $1.4 billion worth of share repurchases, $0.93 billion in dividends paid, and an increase in the equity base of $1.19 billion through reinvestment. If we expect current P/E levels to persist, this simple iterative method enables us to calculate the number of outstanding shares and thereby EPS for any given number of years in the future. Given our own investment horizon and the increased uncertainty associated with estimates further into the future, we chose to look at a five-year period. Following this hypothetical scenario to the end, our method yields the following estimates for 2019:This provides long-term investors with an annualized rate of return of 23.2%, excluding dividends (24.2% including dividends). It is noteworthy that we have computed the result using the current P/E ratio of approximately 18, which is low in historical terms. With a P/E closer to the historical mean, the annualized rate of return could be up to 30%, excluding dividends.Accenture's Margin of SafetyOf course, as everybody knows, past performance isn't always a good predictor of the future. In Accenture's case, however, there are reasons to believe that current trends will continue. Accenture has succeeded spectacularly well in holding on to its clients: Of its 100 biggest clients, 99 have been customers for the last five years, and 91 for the last 10. This shows both a commitment to Accenture's business model and the company's focus on customer service, but it also shows that Accenture understands it needs to keep its services up to date.This latter point is particularly evident when looking at the company's investment in cloud consulting. With the increased importance of cloud-based services, Accenture took on a role as a self-proclaimed broker of cloud services. This essentially meant that the company specialized in helping costumers implement cloud-based systems. The success of this line of business has made Accenture invest an additional $400 million in its cloud services, and so far it seems to have paid off with cloud-generated revenues having surpassed $1 billion annually.To back these somewhat intangible arguments, Accenture boasts a very strong balance sheet. We believe this would provide an extremely solid safety net for Accenture in the case of a potential shock. More specifically, Accenture has enough cash (and equivalents) to pay back it long-term debt over 150 times. Moreover, it has low levels of operating activities, which together with the lack of debt indicates that the company's expansion is also financially viable.ConcludingWe find Accenture to be an investment opportunity of high quality. The company looks attractive whether one analyzes the company structure or the financials. With deep industry ties, it has shown that it is a company that is willing to both commit to existing customers and to keeping its services relevant. Also, with almost zero long-term debt, its expansion (both internally and externally) has been financed through reinvestment and nothing in our analysis indicates that this should change in the future. This analysis suggests -- based on incredibly consistent return on equity -- that the annualized rate of return on a five-year investment made at current prices (and constant P/E) could reach 24%."
2522645,71215,2014-09-26T07:10:05-04:00,Accenture reported mixed earnings results.Management posted highly detailed full-year guidance for the next fiscal year.Expect steady growth and continued cash repatriation from management.,"BackgroundOn September 24, 2014, Accenture plc (NYSE: ACN) reported Q4 FY 2014 earnings of $760 million ($1.08 per share) on sales of $7.78 billion, compared to earnings of $727 million ($1.01 per share) on sales of $7.09 billion in the same quarter in the prior year. The earnings numbers were below Estimize-reported consensus estimates of $1.12, but sales beat estimates of $7.66 billion. These numbers are based on a fully diluted share count of 688.3 million in 2015 and 706.9 million in 2013.Accenture plc is a worldwide consulting firm that offers its services to businesses and institutions. Its main products and services include management consulting and business outsourcing services. The company provides its services across a wide array of businesses and industries. The company is based in Dublin, Ireland, and currently employs 305,000 people.Its most direct publicly traded competitor is IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM).Key PointsGuidanceWhat to look for in Q1 2015Continued cash repatriationThe company repurchased 8.2 million shares in the fourth quarter (~$658 million), and repurchased $2.6 billion in shares in the fiscal year. The company also declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.02 per share, which represents a 10% increase over the company's previously declared dividend.Continued steady growthManagement does not appear to want to take a lot of risks in the current environment, but is positioning the company for long-term success. Given management's precise full-year guidance, look for management to continue its passive strategy.Quick TakeI was impressed that management published extremely detailed guidance for the next quarter and the entire next fiscal year. This type of disclosure shows that management has a firm hand on its future plans, and has a very good idea as to what to expect over the next year. However, such tight guidance also shows that management is not looking to take any major risks in the coming year, so we can likely rule out any major expansions, acquisitions, or product shifts.Given that management has made such precise guidance, and has made its cash repatriation initiatives a priority, I would expect that management would not expose the business to any risks that could jeopardize its cash payouts or share repurchases. I would be very surprised if management made an announcement regarding a substantial acquisition or made a major push into a new market. Likewise, I don't expect management to consolidate the company and reduce the amount of services that it offers.Accenture represents a mature, but solidly poised consulting company that has experienced consistent, but steady growth. Management appears to be positioning the company for long-term success, and as such, the company will likely continue its pattern of single-digit annual sales growth. As such, this company represents a solid opportunity for an investor who is looking to expand his or her portfolio beyond US blue-chip stocks and is comfortable in making an investment with a long-term horizon.Transcript available from Seeking Alpha here. 8-K with news release and financials available here."
2292405,54332,2014-06-30T08:23:29-04:00,"The earnings and guidance of Accenture are not attractive.Intense competition in the industry is putting pressures on pricing, and weak global economic growth conditions diminish any hopes on a fast increase in new contracts.Investment in shares should be avoided for some time to consolidate.","Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) posted earnings for the third quarter of fiscal 2014 that are not overwhelming or discouraging from an investor point of view. ACN generated net revenues of $7.74 billion, an improvement of 7% from the same period last year, surpassed the company's guided range of $7.40 billion to $7.65 billion. Earnings per share grew to $1.26 from $1.21 for the third quarter last year, which improved by 4%, beating analyst estimates by $0.05.ACN paid a total dividend of $1.86 per share for the current fiscal year and repurchased and redeemed 24.4 million shares in the first three quarters of fiscal 2014.For Accenture to generate double-digit growth in revenues, either it needs accumulate more new contracts or it has to charge higher prices for its services. Global economic conditions have not changed significantly positive for Accenture to charge higher prices or to seek more contracts. Further, the global economic outlook for 2014 has been cut by the World Bank due to a weak start to the year in both developing and developed economies. Slow global economic growth reduces the clients' spending on services and solutions provided by Accenture, which decreases its revenues. ACN reduced its upper range of net revenue growth expectations from 6% to 5% for fiscal 2014.Extreme competitive pressures from competitors that are operating from low cost environments are giving tough competition, forcing Accenture to keep the prices low. This is a great disadvantage for companies like Accenture in terms of profitability.GuidanceFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, Accenture expects net revenues to be in the range of $7.45 billion to $7.70 billion, including a positive impact of foreign exchange by 1.5% compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.The company expected net revenue growth to be in the range of 4% to 5% in local currency for fiscal 2014; earlier it expected 3% to 6% net revenue growth. ACN expects its earnings to be in the range of $4.50 to $4.54, rather than $4.50 to $4.62 previously expected.ConclusionACN is trading at 18.83 times earnings (TTM) and 9.77 times book value (mrq); that is a high valuation for a company that is posting mid-single digit growth numbers in terms of revenue and earnings. The mounting growth concerns due to intense competition and weak global economic conditions cannot justify the valuation at which ACN is trading. If I were supposed to put my money in the equity market, ACN would not be one of the choices.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Finding high quality in and of itself is extremely difficult. Things like high ROIC, creditworthiness, strong management, strong disclosures, competitive advantages, etc. are hard to find all in one place. Adding the qualification that I must be confident that the business will continue to display these characteristics for a long time makes the search so much more difficult though. After preliminary research, I am actually still hopeful that Accenture (NYSE:ACN) may fit this high standard and that is why I am still very much interested after performing the research that makes up this article. I plan on doing much more detailed research for a more comprehensive follow-up piece.InformationAccenture describes itself as a leading global management consulting, technology and business process outsourcing company. The company has 293,000 employees, operations in 56 countries, and $31.1B LTM revenue. It is a very large company to say the least. It was previously the consulting arm of Arthur Anderson and went public in July 2001.PositivesExpect Continued Increasing Popularity of VBMAccenture's revenue is virtually 50/50 split (actually 54/46) between management consulting and outsourcing. I am excited about the nature and future of both of these industries. In the book Valuation by McKinsey & Company, the authors detail the rise of Value-Based Management or ""VBM"" in the U.S. VBM is essentially just managing based on the teachings of the book - acknowledging that the combination of high ROIC, low WACC, and high growth drive value creation and managing to sustainably optimize all of those numbers. Over the past few decades, this has become increasingly popular among both managers and investors, but there is still plenty of ignorance in the world (see my article on growth-centrism). From what I understand, much of what management consultants do, whether a tech-oriented consultant from IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Accenture or a generalist from McKinsey or Bain, is enlighten management teams of VBM, the value drivers for the particular business, and how to optimize them. If that's the case, then I think the future for the global management consulting industry is very bright. From a very recent blog post by esteemed NYU Stern Valuation professor, Aswath Damodaran:Valuation courses are becoming increasingly common in U.S. higher education and I think this will continue to be the trend. I liken it to the rise in popularity of basic concepts of value investing like margin of safety and circle of competence 1940-present.Industry Ripe for High margins, Strong Brands, Differentiation, Etc.There's a lot of talk in the investment community about pricing/margin pressures at Accenture. Maybe that is a valid short-term concern, but long term, I think the consulting industry will continue to be high margin and the company's LTM 13.5% pre-tax operating margin really doesn't seem unsustainably high.In Modern Security Analysis by Marty Whitman, he mentions repeatedly how remarkable it is that corporate-level contractor professionals like investment bankers, auditors, lawyers, and consultants don't really compete on price. The following comes from pages 124 and 211:If this does not sound not convincing, I would encourage readers to read the book as it is full of helpful investment gems anyway and you will almost certainly come away with a similar view of pricing in these industries or at least get the full point.Maybe I am expending too much time, effort, and too many words drilling this point home, but I'd also like to bring up a recent book review I read by Whopper Investments, who also happens to be a prolific SA writer. The book review is of Double Your Profits in Six Months or Less by Bob Fifer. It is a favorite of 3G Capital, Warren Buffett, and Jack Welch. Here is the relevant excerpt from Whopper's post with emphasis added:I wholly agree with Whopper's conclusions in general and as they apply to the consulting industry.Benefits from Continued Tech ShiftAccenture is not just a management consulting company but a technology-oriented management consulting company and business process outsourcing company. The shift to high-tech, task automation, SaaS, etc. is a strong one and I don't see why that won't continue in the next 10-20 years.Should Intuitively Be Well-Managed and Seems to BeI would expect a company that advises other companies on good management practices, VBM, etc. to practice what it teaches in the management of itself and that seems to be the case as I will hopefully show in my other points.Lots of IPIntellectual property is one of the most basic forms of a competitive advantage and Accenture has lots of it:Strong Financial PositionThe company has virtually no debt and lots of cash (though the cash seems to be necessary to operations as it has been on the balance sheet for years and thus seems a real part of working capital and not ""excess cash""). The company has a safety rating of 1 and A++ Financial Strength rating from Value Line. These ratings are really rarely given by Value Line, but make sense as most consistent high ROIC growing businesses can and do take on significant financial leverage, but ACN hasn't. To me, this is a win-win: either the company levers up and gets more cash at low rates to lower its WACC and create more value, or the company continues to be ultra-safe through its current financial standing.Compensation and Attrition Look GoodJust about every company says in its 10-K's Risk Factors section something to the effect of ""attracting and retaining talent is critical to our success and we may not be able to continue to execute on this front."" For some companies this is much truer than for others. For a consulting business like Accenture where much of the value the firm offers to any one client is in the brains of the consultants retained by the firm, attracting and retaining talent is absolutely critical. I'd argue it's one of the most important, if not the most critical factor to a firm like ACN's long run success. The company seems to be doing a good job retaining and incentivizing its employees. I have no link because I heard it via word-of-mouth from a friend, but apparently, McKinsey's labor force turns over every 3 years. The attrition number is typically very high in management consulting, but it was only 12% for Accenture in FY2013, in line with 2012. Compensation is largely equity-based which is generally good for this type of business. Performance is based on EBIT, relative stock performance to the company's peer group, and subjective judgment of the board. These seem like decent criteria (though nothing special) and the board has been no pushover in judging performance. In 2013, the board only deemed performance to be in the 6th highest section of its 9-section range:Source: ACN ProxyValue Creation CredibilityMany of the companies I look at have outstanding 10-year charts and that is no coincidence. In the search for companies that will appreciate in value a great deal in the future and management teams and business models that will create that value, it makes sense to heavily consider companies that have done so in the past:Since going public in 2001, Accenture stock has appreciated rather consistently by 14.1% annually, with annual total return probably 1.5-2% higher due to the dividend.The company consistently repurchases lots of stock and pays a dividend. Charlie Munger is a strong advocate of investing in 'cannibals' or serial share repurchasers and that seems to be a common link among some of the best long term, high quality investments. I've had good luck with share repurchasers as well.Tax AdvantagesWith its headquarters in Ireland, Accenture pays substantially less in taxes than it would as a U.S. company. Its tax rate has averaged about 24% in the last 11 quarters, much lower than the 36-40% you typically see in the U.S. This makes it much easier to earn high after-tax ROIC and boosts margins and sustainably so.High ROICTo counteract the lumpiness in capex/acquisition costs (that I will mention in Negatives section), I averaged out 3 years of performance: FY2012, FY2013, and LTM. Keep in mind that there is 1 quarter of overlap between FY2013 and LTM. Here are the results:I am not too concerned by the trend in ROIC over the 3 periods as it is likely just due to timing of investments. The average ROIC came out at 27% after tax. That's very, very good.Highly Diversified Revenue StreamThe company offers consulting services in most industries and sectors (Products 23.8%; Financial Svc. 21.6%; Communications & High Tech 19.9%; Resources 18.0%; Health & Public Service 16.6%; Other less than 1%) and its business is also pretty evenly split between consulting (54%) and outsourcing (46%). Since I run a highly concentrated portfolio (2-3 positions), I like when companies diversify for me (so long as it does not sacrifice ROIC).NegativesPrimary Asset is PeopleBecause of how labor-intensive the business is, I have a lingering fear that the business is not really worth much outside of its employees. It is sort of like a private construction contractor's business is typically worth little to nothing when he retires because he IS the business and he cannot sell himself. I just am a bit intimidated because I have never analyzed a company so dependent on its labor talent.High Quality CompetitionThe following is the peer group that the company uses to evaluate its relative stock performance for performance-contingent compensation purposes:Source: ACN ProxyMany of the companies on this list are notably excellent businesses. I find comfort investing in businesses that I can definitively say are best of breed but I am not sure that is the case with Accenture.Stock Seems Pricey Without PerspectiveThe stock trades at:Without perspective, these look like pricey multiples.The compounded annual growth rates I calculated:Based on all this I don't see the company being anymore than a 10-12% per share grower in the next few years. Over the long term, I would only expect slightly higher growth than the global economy - maybe 5% annually. If you're just looking at those growth numbers alone relative to the valuation multiples above, the stock certainly looks pricey, however, I don't think this is the correct approach to take as ACN is a very high ROIC business and I actually think it may well stay that way for a long time. I used the 'tao of corporate finance' valuation equation to account for ROIC:I plugged in the following:I came up with $114 per share. Obviously there are some flaws in using a perpetuity equation and the ROIC, growth, and WACC assumptions have a huge impact on the result, but I think this is more accurate of underlying value in high ROIC situations than a PEG approach. I tend to think the stock is reasonably priced- neither cheap nor expensive, but back to the original point, without perspective, I could understand why others would think this stock to be pricey.Significant Lumpiness in PerformanceAll components of ACN's capital investments are quite lumpy/unpredictable from year to year and that bothers me. I own Express Scripts (NASDAQ:ESRX) right now and appreciate the fact that every year, changes in working capital are accretive to cash flows. That is not the case at ACN and capex and acquisition costs are also lumpy as my ROIC graphic above shows.ConclusionLike any other investment research I've done, there's some good and bad to the ACN story, but I was generally quite impressed and even more enthusiastic to have discovered an industry in consulting that I really, really like over the long term. I will most likely pursue this idea further and check out other companies in ACN's peer group. I am not a buyer of ACN just yet as I don't have enough information at this point and don't know that the stock is obviously discounted enough for my liking.Disclosure: The author is long ESRX.

2329325,67815,2014-07-22T11:15:37-04:00,"We pitch two companies from the technology sector, HP and Accenture, against one another in the latest installment of our Head-To-Head series.The article focuses on the relative strengths and weaknesses of HP and Accenture based on business performance and sustainability/dividends/forecasts.It ends with discussion of the current valuations of the two companies, and details whether HP represents good relative value at current price levels.","Hewlett-Packard BackgroundHP (NYSE:HPQ) was founded in 1939 and is headquartered in Palo Alto, California. It provides products, technologies, software, solutions, and services to individual consumers, small-and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health, and education sectors worldwide. Its Personal Systems segment offers commercial personal computers (PCs), consumer PCs and workstations for the commercial and consumer markets. The company's Printing segment offers consumer and commercial printer hardware. Its Enterprise Group segment provides industry standard servers; business critical systems, as well as traditional and converged storage solutions. HP's Enterprise Services segment offers technology consulting and outsourcing, while its Software segment provides enterprise information management solutions, such as data analytics for structured and unstructured data.Team Money Research RatingOur investment philosophy is to focus on company fundamentals and identify stocks that are displaying strong business performance, that operate sustainably and that pay a decent, well-covered dividend.We analyze each company relative to the other on the following criteria within each of our two main buckets:Business PerformanceSustainability/Dividends/ForecastsOnce we have analyzed the two companies based on the first two buckets, we can then assess whether they represent good value based on the current prices of the two stocks. We use the following criteria to assess valuations on a relative basis.ValuationSo, for example, a company that performs well compared to its rival on the first two buckets (business performance and sustainability/dividends/forecasts) and that is undervalued relative to its peer (based on the third bucket: valuation) could outperform its competitor going forward.The table below provides the data that we will use to analyze HP and Accenture (NYSE:ACN) for the first two buckets.The results from our first two buckets show that HP is fairly evenly matched by Accenture. For example, both companies have very comfortable amounts of balance sheet risk, with HP having a net interest income (hence the 'N/A' for interest cover) and being well-shielded from interest rises, while Accenture has very low levels of debt, as highlighted by its debt to equity ratio of just 0.43%. Furthermore, both companies pay similar yields (1.90% for HP and 2.20% for Accenture) although we feel that there is more scope for HP to increase its dividend due to its lower payout ratio of 20% (versus 42% for Accenture).However, where HP loses out to Accenture is in terms of profitability. Sure, HP scores well in terms of return on equity, return on assets and operating margins. However, its scores are easily outmatched by Accenture, which has a return on equity of 52.58% for instance. This is highly impressive - especially when Accenture has such low levels of debt on its balance sheet.In terms of growth, both companies are forecast to increase the bottom-line at a respectable pace, with HP being edged out by Accenture as the former is forecast to increase EPS by 5.39% next year, and the latter is expected to increase it by 8.83%. As a result, we feel that Accenture fares slightly better in terms of the sustainability/dividends/forecast bucket and, when combined with its strong profitability (as shown in the first bucket: business performance), we think that HP is edged into second place by Accenture.Overall, these are strong scores for both companies, but we feel Accenture is the better performer in the first two buckets.ValuationDue to its outperformance of HP in the first two buckets, we would expect Accenture to trade at a slight premium. Let's see if it does.While we feel that Accenture deserves to trade at a premium to HP, we believe the current premium is too high. For example, HP's forward P/E is 45% less than Accenture's, while its EV/EBITDA ratio is 46% lower than that of its sector peer. Indeed, it's a similar story with regard to the two companies' price to free cash flow ratios, where HP also trades at a discount of 46% to Accenture. In fact, it is only the PEG ratio in which Accenture represents better value for money than HP, with the former having a PEG ratio of 1.52 and the latter having a PEG ratio of 2.03. So, while we feel Accenture does deserve to trade at a premium to HP, we think the premium is currently too wide and, as such, we believe that HP could outperform Accenture going forward.ConclusionHP is a high quality company that posted impressive scores on The Team Money Research Rating System. Although its scores were not quite on a par with sector peer, Accenture, the valuation bucket highlighted that the company appears to offer significantly better value for money at current price levels. As a result, we believe that HP could outperform Accenture going forward.Don't forget to follow Team Money Research and let us know which stocks you'd like to see go head-to-head against HP in future articles!Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2165833,20521,2014-04-25T12:58:17-04:00,,"According to IBIS World Research, the Information Technology Consulting industry has grown 2.2% over the past four year period from 2009 through 2013. The research firm estimates that The IT Consulting industry was worth $337 billion in 2013, growing by a modest 1.2% over the year.Accenture's Financials Leading technology and management consulting services provider, Accenture, (NYSE:ACN) is also battling with this modest growth. For the recently ended quarter, Accenture's results missed market forecasts as price pressures and economic conditions continued to take a toll on the industry.Second quarter revenues grew 1% to $7.13 billion, missing the Street's forecast of $7.21 billion. EPS of $1.03 was also short of the market's projected earnings of $1.04 per share. However, their bookings show strength. During the quarter, bookings hit a record $10.1 billion, with outsourcing bookings at $5.5 billion.Analysts believe that despite the strong bookings, the modest earnings growth reflects the increasing pricing pressure that Accenture is facing. Vendor consolidation in the industry and continued customer pressure to manage costs is hurting Accenture as it tries to build its market share.By segment, outsourcing revenues grew 4% over the year to $3.43 billion while consulting revenues fell 1% to $3.7 billion. Within operating segments, revenues from Health & Public Services fell 1% over the year to $1.18 billion. Revenues from Financial Services and Products grew 4.0% to $1.56 billion and $1.75 billion respectively. Revenues from Resources segment fell 2% to $1.22 billion while Communications, Media & Technology revenues were flat at $1.41 billion.By region, revenues from the Americas, and EMEA grew 2% while APAC revenues reported a 7% decline over the year.Among operating metrics, utilization levels were flat sequentially at 87%, but registered a decline over previous year's 88%. Attrition increased from 11% a year ago to 12%. They ended the quarter with 289,000 employees.Accenture expects their performance to improve in the coming quarters and they raised their full-year guidance of revenue growth from 2%-6% to 3%-6%. Earnings expectations also improved to $4.50-$4.62 a share, compared with earlier projected $4.44-$4.56 per share. For the current quarter, they projected revenues of $7.40-$7.65 billion. The Street was looking for revenues of $7.55 billion this quarter.Accenture's Acquisitions Accenture's acquisition pace seems to have slowed down. During the last quarter, they announced the acquisition of Germany-based ClientHouse for an undisclosed sum. ClientHouse is a provider of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Veeva Solutions (NYSE:VEEV) in Europe. They are a Salesforce.com Cloud Alliance Partner and operate the longest-standing Salesforce training center in Europe. They also have a strategic alliance with Veeva Systems to offer cloud-based CRM solutions for life sciences and biotech sectors. Through the acquisition, Accenture will be able to expand their Salesforce offerings and grow their cloud services offerings to the life sciences and other industries.Earlier this month, Accenture also announced a $30 million investment in mobile Application Performance Management (mAPM) solutions provider, Crittercism. Crittercism owns a platform that helps companies monitor their mobile app performance. Their customer list includes names like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), LinkedIn (LNKD), and Yahoo (YHOO). Through the alliance, Accenture will be able to resell Crittercism's mAPM solutions and will include their apps in the Accenture Application Factory to deploy with their customers worldwide.Accenture's stock is trading at $79.42 with a market capitalization of $50.3 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $85.88 in January this year."
2279393,60871,2014-06-20T14:54:52-04:00,,"Accenture PLC (NYSE:ACN) is an Ireland-based business consultant that provides management consulting, technology services and outsourcing to various businesses and companies around the world.Accenture trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “ACN”.ACN is part of the S&P 500 index.ACN currently trades around $83.00 and currently yields about 2.24%.ACN is an Irish corporation but pays its semi-annual dividends in U.S. dollars. All the following figures are thus in U.S. dollars.Since ACN is based in Ireland, foreign investors will likely be subjected to withholding tax.Dividend CalendarACN pays a semi-annual dividend.The dividends are generally declared in March and September, and are generally paid in May and November.ACN typically increases its semi-annual dividend once a year, in September. In that sense, the last dividend increase, in September 2013, was of 14.8% (from $0.81 semi-annually to $0.93 semi-annually).Dividend HistoryWith the most recent increase, ACN has increased its quarterly dividend for 9 consecutive years, making the company a dividend challenger (between 5 and 9 years of consecutive dividend increases).The evolution of the annualized dividend and of its growth over the last ten years is presented in the graph below.The first thing to note from the graph is the dividend growth spike in 2010. Simply, in fiscal year 2010, ACN changed its annual dividend payment schedule to a semi-annual payment schedule. So fiscal year 2010 includes both an annual dividend payment and a semi-annual payment. This explains the dividend growth spike of 2010.Also, since ACN has started to pay a dividend only in 2006, I don’t have a 10-year average.However, over the last 8 years, ACN as been raising its dividend at the average compound dividend growth rate of 27.24%. This rate is a pretty aggressive rate. But I suspect ACN is trying to bring its dividend to a more reasonable level. At some point, I believe ACN will slow down the dividend increases.Dividend AnalysisIn this section, I verify two important aspects of the dividend:Understandably, answering no to either one of these questions should mark the stock under consideration as being unsuitable for dividend investment purpose.Is the current dividend safe?To determine the safety of the dividend, I check the historical levels, the current level and the evolution of the payout ratio with respect to the earnings and, when relevant, with respect to the free cash flow.First, the evolution of the earnings, dividends, and payout ratios.Then, the evolution of the free cash flow, dividends, and payout ratios.To begin with, with respect to the earnings, the dividend payout ratio has been under 35% over the last 8 years (except in 2010 due to the exceptional dividend payment). Similarly, with respect to the free cash flow, the dividend payout ratio has been under 40% over the last 8 years.A payout ratio under 40% is safe as it provides more than enough margin should ACN face one or two tougher years.Still, what is clearly apparent from the two graphs is the upward trend in the payout ratios. In other words, the dividend is growing faster than both the earnings and the free cash flow.In that sense, as I mentioned above, I think ACN is aggressively increasing its dividend to reach a target payout ratio. Once ACN reaches that target, I think the dividend growth rate will be more in line with the earnings and/or free cash flow growth rates. Otherwise, the payout ratios will reach unsustainable levels.In any event, with current payout ratios under 40%, I think the dividend is safeOverall, I think the current dividend is safe. Is the current dividend likely to grow?The short answer is yes.ACN has been increasing its dividend at double-digit rates since initiating a dividend in 2006. For me, that shows that ACN has the willingness to pay meaningful and growing dividends to its shareholders.In addition, as we have seen above, the business is growing and the current payout ratios are still reasonably low, giving ACN more room for further dividend growth.So yes, the dividend is likely to grow.I would only add that I don’t think ACN will maintain the recent average dividend growth rate in the foreseeable future. Since the dividend has been growing faster than both the earnings and the free cash flow, the dividend growth will have to slow down at some point to allow the earnings and free cash flow to catch up.Overall, I think the current dividend is likely to grow in the foreseeable future.Stock ValuationEstimated Fair ValuesTo calculate a range of fair values, I calculate how much one share will return in cumulative dividends over the next 20 years, according to different scenarios, and adjusted for inflation.The calculations are performed using the affiliated website Dividend Stock Valuation.For ACN, I’ve used the following inputs:The optimistic DGR generally corresponds to the 10-year average, while the realistic and pessimistic DGRs respectively correspond to 80% and 60% of the optimistic DGR. In the present case, the optimistic DGR corresponds to the 5-year average since ACN does not have 10 years of dividend history.According to the above values, the range of estimated fair values for ACN varies from $223.19 (pessimistic) to $1098.89 (optimistic) with a realistic value of $493.80.With a current share price around $83.00, ACN appears significantly undervalued.However, given the fact that the recent average DGR is very high, even the pessimistic valuation is most probably very optimistic.So, I’ve calculated that the DGR would need to be 11.54% over the next 20 years to justify the current price of $83.00. Compared to its recent historical average, this DGR is low.Given the growing trend in both the earnings and free cash flow, I think ACN could maintain a DGR of 11.54% over the next 20 years. However, maintaining a DGR of more than 10% over 20 years is not necessarily easy.So, even if ACN could possibly maintain such a DGR, that would not leave much margin of safety.At $83.00, I think ACN is fairly valued as a dividend investment.Estimated Cash ReturnWith the estimated cash return, I calculate how much cumulative dividends a fixed investment in the stock under consideration will return over a period of years.Estimated cash return values allow to compare dividend stocks with different yields and different growth rates.For ACN, I’ve used the following inputs:Notably, the DGRs are the same as the DGRs used for valuation.I also compare the various estimated cash return values with the estimated cash return of a benchmark dividend stock having a yield of 3% and a dividend growth rate of 8% (e.g., Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) or Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)).If ACN could maintain a DGR of 34% over the next 30 years, I would buy stocks by the truckloads. However, I’m not aware of any company that has managed such a feat. Even maintaining a DGR of 20.4% would be almost impossible.Still, if ACN can manage to maintain a DGR of 11.54% over the next 30 years, an investment in ACN would return more money than a comparable investment in the benchmark stock.But, then again, I think that maintaining a DGR of 11.54% over 30 years would be a stretch for ACN.At the current price and yield, I think ACN would make a medium risk dividend investment. ConclusionWith its reasonable yield, aggressive dividend growth rate and reasonably low payout ratios, ACN would seem to be a very interesting dividend stock.However, in view of my analysis, I think ACN is a bit too expensive given the fact that the dividend growth rate will most likely drop in the near future.In addition, since ACN is located in Ireland, I don’t know what will be the effective withholding tax rate. According to Deloitte, the withholding tax rate could be as high as 20% for some investors.So, given the lack of margin of safety and given the possibly high withholding tax rate, I would not buy ACN at the current price and yield.Final recommendation: I don’t think ACN is a buy at the current price. Full DisclosureI don’t currently own shares of ACN. I don’t intend to initiate a position in ACN within the next 72 hours."
2284193,23479,2014-06-24T13:36:15-04:00,"Accenture is set to announce its Q3 FY2014 results on June 26.In the previous quarter, the company delivered strong growth for its outsourcing division, which has outpaced the industry.In this earnings announcement, apart from the growth in outsourcing division, we will closely monitor revenue from the consulting division, as it is critical for Accenture’s future growth.Additionally, we will continue to observe the consulting order pipeline as it will give us a fair indication of whether global consulting demand is on the mend.","Accenture (NYSE:ACN) is set to announce its Q3 FY2014 results on June 26. In the previous quarter, the company delivered strong growth for its outsourcing division, which has outpaced the industry. The company reported 1% year-over-year growth in U.S. dollar terms to $7.1 billion. However, soft global demand for consulting services plagued its consulting business as revenues were flat. In this earnings announcement, apart from the growth in outsourcing division, we will closely monitor revenue from the consulting division, as it is critical for Accenture’s future growth. Additionally, we will continue to observe the consulting order pipeline as it will give us a fair indication of whether global consulting demand is on the mend.Guidance For Q3 and FY14In its outlook for Q3 2014, Accenture expects revenues to range from $7.40 billion–$7.65 billion. For fiscal year 2014, Accenture expects net revenue growth to be in the 3%–6% range (with a midpoint of $29.9 billion) and GAAP operating profit margins to be in 14.3%–14.5% range. It expects a mild improvement in diluted EPS, in the $4.50–$4.62 range. The company has also increased its guidance for new bookings for fiscal 2014 to the $33 billion–$36 billion range.Consulting Revenues Under The LensManagement and technology consulting are important drivers for Accenture’s value and account for around 45% of our price estimate combined. This division has failed to deliver growth, as revenues have been flat or declining due to two primary factors. Firstly, the business environment remains challenging as clients continue to shy away from discretionary IT spending. Secondly, Accenture continues to book long-term contracts, which take longer to convert to revenue. However, prospects for this division are improving as more companies are looking to improve their efficiency to increase production. While the revenues for the divisions were flat at $3.69 billion in Q2, the company reported momentum in new orders that might help it to post low single-digit growth in Q3, according to its guidance. In this earnings announcement, we will closely monitor the growth in its consulting revenues. Furthermore, we expect the company to report a strong build up in its consulting pipeline, which should help Accenture post growth in revenue in the coming years.Outsourcing Revenues To GrowAccording to our estimates, the outsourcing division contributes approximately 43% to Accenture’s value. Accenture’s outsourcing division has outpaced the industry and clocked nearly 5% year-over-year growth in recent quarters. The company also booked $5.5 billion worth of fresh contracts in Q2 2014, and the book-to-bill ratio was at 1.6 during the quarter. We expect this trend to continue in Q3, and Accenture to report mid-single-digit growth in revenues and order book. We also anticipate the book-to-bill ratio for the company to stabilize at 1.4 in Q3.New Business Verticals To Deliver GrowthAccenture continues to focus its vertical industry practice groups on the needs of its clients in emerging areas such as analytics, digital marketing, cloud and mobility, computing and communications. Satisfying these needs will not only bolster its growth in the coming quarters, it will focus its client relationships on the highest-value, most profitable parts of the business. The company’s goal is to enhance its client engagements by operating as much as possible at the strategic, C-level echelon, where it can make both the biggest difference and the most money. In this earnings announcement, we will be closely monitoring the release and commentary for the impact of these efforts in driving Accenture’s overall revenues and margins.We currently have a $76 Trefis price estimate for Accenture, which is slightly below its current market price.Disclosure: No positions."
2153223,21848,2014-04-22T07:08:39-04:00,,"by Dan MyersCash Flows from Financing Activities on the Statement of Cash Flows are the window to the soul of the company. Because it is the last section of the last financial statement, a lot of people never get into it or use it. This Cash From Financing section provides a simple insight into how friendly a management team is to shareholders. It also provides a glimpse into what management really thinks about the company and its long term prospects.Actions speak louder than words.Let's take a look at Accenture. Below is their Financing Activity for the last 10 years (source: Old School Value Stock Analyzer)AT&T Cash from Financing Activities (Source: Old School Value) Accenture is doing two things that shareholders should love.Both items reflect a conscious effort by management to reward shareholders. Great! If you look deeper, you see something even better: consistency.Every year for the last ten years, Accenture bought back shares. In fact, they are increasing their share buybacks at a regular and steady pace.Accenture Share Buybacks Each YearAccenture is actually dollar-cost-averaging (DCA) their share purchases. When the market is up, they buy fewer shares. When the market is down, they buy more.The goal with DCA is to lower your cost basis by buying more shares at lower prices. With Accenture consistently buying back, you get more value from your shares even though you hold the exact same amount. Fewer slices of the pie means your slice is larger.It also means there is a floor to the share price. The day to day fluctuations of a stock price is dictated by supply and demand. But having a steady buyer out there provides a floor on the stock. If the price drops too low, the company is there scooping up more and more shares to your benefit. It's an odd sort of peace when you're happy with the stock price dropping.A lot of companies buy back shares when they have a lot of extra cash on hand. The problem is that this usually correlates with higher stock prices. The company doesn't buy the stock when the market is down, but buys it when it is high.This is a recipe for destroying shareholder value.Companies sometimes resort to rewarding shareholders through buybacks when the sudden surge of cash isn't sustainable. That's because it's better than cutting the dividend and watching the stock price get killed. It's dangerous ground for management. That's why they buy high and not low.Take a look at a counter example: AT&TAT&T Cash from Financing Activities (Source: Old School Value) AT&T Buybacks Cut and the AftermathHere's a comparison of how the stock fared side by side during the bloody period.Stock Price of AT&T vs. Accenture from 2008 - 2011Now bear in mind, I have no ill will towards AT&T or their business. I think it a great company and a strong dividend investment. The point is that when Mr. Market was having a temper tantrum, AT&T could have bought shares at ridiculously low prices. But it didn't.AT&T were actually net sellers of shares during this time. It wasn't that they didn't have the cash. They were paying out dividends the whole time at an increasing rate. From 2012 when the market was on fire with prices at all-time highs, AT&T ramped up share buybacks.Same thing happened in 2007 and 2008. Yes AT&T had some challenges in 2009-2011, but they weren't in critical condition. 2009-2011 was the perfect time to buy a great investment management understood at a cheap price. To do so is a value investor's dream.The point I want you to take away is that share buybacks are great. But consistent share buybacks are even better.

2106243,23479,2014-03-24T16:53:46-04:00,,"Accenture (NYSE:ACN) is set to announce its Q2 FY2014 results on March 27. In the previous quarter, the company delivered good growth for its outsourcing division which has outpaced the industry. The company reported 3% year-over-year growth in constant currency to $7.4 billion. However, soft global demand for consulting services plagued its consulting business as revenues were flat. In this earnings announcement, apart from the growth in outsourcing division, we will closely monitor revenue from the consulting division, as it is critical for Accenture's future growth. Additionally, we continue to observe the consulting order pipeline as it will give us fair indication of whether global consulting demand is on the mend.Guidance For FY14Accenture expects net revenues for fiscal 2014 to grow in the 2% to 6% range (with a midpoint of $29.70 billion) and GAAP operating profit margins to improve to the 14.3% to 14.5% range. However, the company expects a mild improvement in diluted EPS, which should now be in the $4.44 to $4.56 range. The company plans to book new orders worth $32 billion to $35 billion for fiscal 2014. In the outlook for Q2 2014, Accenture expects revenues to range from $6.95-$7.25 billion.Growth In New Business Verticals In FocusAccenture continues to focus its vertical industry practice groups on the provision of leading-edge needs of its clients in emerging areas such as analytics, digital marketing, cloud and mobility computing and communications. Satisfying these needs will not only bolster its growth in the coming quarters, it will focus its client relationships on the highest value, most profitable parts of the business. The company's goal is to enhance its client engagements by operating as much as possible at the strategic, C-level echelon, where they can make both the biggest difference and the most money. In this earnings announcement, we will be closely monitoring the release and commentary for the impact of these efforts in driving Accenture's overall revenues and margins.Outsourcing Revenues To GrowAccording to our estimates, the outsourcing division contributes approximately 43% to Accenture's value. Accenture's outsourcing division has outpaced the industry, and clocked in nearly 6% year-over-year growth in previous quarters. The company also booked $4.4 billion worth of fresh contracts in Q1 2014, and the book-to-bill ratio was at 1.3 during the quarter. We expect this trend to continue in Q2 and Accenture to report mid single-digit growth in revenues and order book. We also anticipate the book-to-bill ratio for the company to improve to 1.4 in Q2.Consulting Revenues Under The LensManagement and technology consulting are important drivers for Accenture's value and account for around 45% of our price estimate combined. This division has failed to deliver growth as revenues have been flat or declining due to two factors. Firstly, the business environment remains challenging as clients continue to shy away from discretionary IT spending. Secondly, Accenture continues to book long-term contracts, which take a longer time to convert to revenue. However, prospects for this division are improving as more companies are looking to improve their efficiency to increase production. In this earnings announcement, we expect the company to report a strong build up in pipeline for consulting, which will help the company to post growth in revenue in the coming years. Additionally, we will monitor the consulting division's book-to-bill ratio, which indicates the revenues from previous bookings.We currently have a $76.09 Trefis price estimate for Accenture, which is 8.13% below its current market price.Disclosure: No positions."
1923521,41381,2013-12-31T16:22:29-05:00,,"As an income-driven investor there are a number of minimum criteria I like to establish before deciding whether I should be bullish or bearish on a particular dividend paying stock.For example these criteria include but are not limited to a dividend yield over 2.2%, a forward P/E ratio of 18.5 or lower, and strong dividend behavior over the last several years. In today's article I wanted to venture into the IT Services sector and highlight several reasons why I'm staying bullish on shares of Accenture, plc (NYSE:ACN).#1: Recent Performance And Trend Behavior Signals a Longer-Term Buying ModeOn Friday, shares of ACN, which currently possess a market cap of $53 billion, a forward P/E ratio of 16.82 and a dividend yield of 2.25% ($1.86), settled at a price of $82.51/share. Based on their closing price of $82.51/share, shares of ACN are trading 7.28% above their 20-day simple moving average, 8.66% above their 50-day simple moving average and 9.38% above their 200-day simple moving average. These numbers indicate a short-term, mid-term and long-term uptrend for the stock which generally signals a moderate buying mode for most long-term investors.#2: Recent Dividend BehaviorSince April 14, 2010, when Accenture began paying a semi-annual dividend, the company has increased its semi-annual distribution four times in the last three-and-a-half years, with the most recent increase having taken place in October of this year. The company's forward yield of 2.25% ($1.86) coupled with its ability to maintain its quarterly distribution over last three-and-a-half years, make this particular IT Services play a highly considerable option, especially for those who may be in the market for a moderate stream of quarterly income.#3: Comparable Dividend GrowthNot only does the company's 2.25% dividend yield and three-and-a-half-year dividend behavior make this particular stock a highly attractive option for most income-driven investors, its dividend growth over the last several years versus one of its sector-based peers is also something income-driven tech investors like myself should consider. From a comparable standpoint, ACN's dividend has grown a solid 148% over the past three-and-a-half years, whereas the dividend growth of its sector-based peer IBM (NYSE:IBM) had only increased 46.15% over the same period.#4: Recapping FQ1, Looking Ahead To FQ2On Thursday, December 19, Accenture reported its quarterly results for FQ1 and a number of factors contributed to the company's solid report which beat EPS estimates by a margin of $0.05/share and revenue estimates by a margin of $150 million.It should be noted that new bookings totaled $8.7B in FQ1, up from $8.4B in FQ4 and a depressed $7.5B in the year-ago period. Secondly, the company's consulting ($4.3B) and outsourcing ($4.4B) segments respectively made up 49% and 51% of bookings vs. 46% and 54% in FQ4. Lastly, the company's revenues in the Americas was only +3% vs. +8% in FQ4, EMEA revenues were +3% vs. +2% in FQ4, and Asia-Pacific revenues only fell -6% vs. -7% in FQ4. In my opinion the company would need to enhance the revenue generated by each of these segments, especially if it wants to meet or exceed analysts' expectations for FQ2.How can Accenture surpass FQ2 estimates?Before I highlight some of the reasons why I think Accenture will meet and/or exceed estimates I think we must first keep in mind that analysts are calling for Accenture to earn $1.04/share on revenue of $7.22 billion. If the company can demonstrate an increase of at least 3.0% to 4.0% in terms of the revenue generated from its Americas segment, an increase of at least 1% to 1.5% in terms of the revenue generated from its Asia-Pacific segment, and an increase of at least 3.5% to 4.5% in terms of the revenue generated from its EMEA segment I see no reason why the company's EPS and Revenue estimates can't be met or even slightly exceeded when the company announces its FQ2 results sometime in early 2014.Risk Factors (Most Recent 10-K)According to Accenture's most recent 10-K there are a number of risk factors investors should consider before establishing a position. These risk factors include but are not limited to:#1 - The company's operations could be adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic conditions and the effects of these conditions on its clients' businesses and levels of business activity.#2 - The company's ability to keep its supply of skills and resources in balance with client demand around the world and attract and retain professionals with strong leadership skills, its business, the utilization rate of its professionals and the results of operations may be materially adversely affected.#3 - The company's operations and its ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if it cannot adapt and expand its services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings by new entrants.ConclusionFor those of you considering a position in Accenture, I strongly recommend keeping a close eye on the company's earnings growth, its dividend behavior and its ability to deliver on its previously established commitments over the next 12-24 months as each of these factors could play a role in the company's long-term performance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in ACN over the next 72 hours.

Accenture projects to hire another 60,000 employees during the year.For the current quarter, the company is projecting revenues of $6.95-$7.25 billion, falling short of the market's projections of $7.28 billion. For the fiscal, it projects earnings of $4.44-$4.56 compared with the Street's target of $4.46.Accenture's AcquisitionsAccenture continued inorganic growth and recently completed the acquisition of independent international consulting and systems integration group, PCO Innovation. PCO specializes in end to end services product life-cycle management (PLM) software technologies that help in bringing to market products and services at a faster pace. The acquisition will help strengthen Accenture's PLM capabilities. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.In October 2013, Accenture spent an estimated $375 million for the acquisition of King of Prussia, Pennsylvania-based Procurian. Procurian is a procurement business process outsourcing company with strong analytics and technology skills and an impressive client list that includes Hertz (NYSE:HTZ) and Kimberly Clark (NYSE:KMB). They have operations in the U.S., India, the U.K., the Czech Republic, China and Brazil. The move will help Accenture strengthen their services in the segment across industries including manufacturing, consumer goods, high-tech and financial services.Last month, Accenture also announced the acquisition of the industrial and embedded software development and services business of Evopro group. Evopro is a Budapest-based software development and engineering services company and provides embedded software used in medical equipment, automotive, building, logistics and transportation industries. It has a presence in Germany, Hungary, Romania, and Turkey. The acquisition will help enhance Accenture's industrial software and automation market skills along with international expansion.The stock is trading at $80.47 with a market capitalization of $54.47 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $84.22 in May 2013."
1832092,25871,2013-11-12T11:20:10-05:00,,"Accenture (NYSE:ACN) is a global management consulting, technology services and outsourcing company with approximately 275,000 people serving clients in more than 120 countries. As of the end of fiscal year 2013, the company had revenues just shy of $29 billion and a market capitalization that was roughly double that amount. Additionally, Accenture provides services to a wide spectrum of industries ranging from Automotive and Aerospace to Energy and Travel. Effectively, Accenture wants to deliver a high performance solution to whatever problem you have on hand.Of course, that is not to say that the company is without risks. Like all equity issues, there is always a reason that potential investors have the opportunity to be compensated well beyond ""safe"" rates of return. For instance, some might point to the consulting and outsourcing segments as demonstrating worse than anticipated sales trends. Or foreign exchange headwinds could prove more complicated than originally anticipated. Demand patterns could require consistent changes to the company's strategy. The business could even be a victim of a slowing or evolving global economy. There's always a reason that a particular company might face challenges; in fact, within Accenture's most recent 10-K management lays out a total of 30 potential threats and risk factors.However, with the above being stated, there does appear to be a variety of growth catalysts for the company. For example, Accenture works with 91 of the Fortune Global 100 and more than three quarters of the Fortune Global 500. Perhaps more impressively, of Accenture's top 100 clients based on revenue, 99 of them have been with the company for at least 5 years. Accenture has worked with 91 of those clients for at least 10 years. In other words, it appears that the Accenture business model is quite sticky. It's one thing to find and obtain clients, it's another thing entirely to maintain, strengthen and extend those relationships.It follows that such a large company with a persistent business model might be hard to replicate. And this type of moat is precisely what we observe. Morningstar analyst Andrew Lange does a solid job of describing Accenture's advantages:Clearly the company has a fundamental advantage over any would-be start-up competitors. In addition to this theoretical benefit, Accenture has also demonstrated that it can use this scale to deliver results. For instance, in the most recent earnings conference call Accenture indicated that they had new bookings of $33.3 billion, which was an all-time high amount and near the top of their previously guided range. With a profitable business, shareholder returns usually follow. Accenture CEO Pierre Nanterme described such a scenario in the latest earnings call:Surely investors are excited about this, much in the way that they would be excited about future increases. Accenture has been able to increase its dividend for 9 consecutive years at an annualized pace of over 20% a year. In viewing the current payout ratio below 40% with a reasonable 2.5% yield, future growth in line with earnings or slightly better appears reasonable.Finally, those still doubting the potential growth story of Accenture will have to go through the likes of David Rowland, Accenture's CFO. As he described in the latest investor conference day:With that, let's turn to the past operating history and possible future endeavors for an Accenture investor.11 Years of GrowthAccenture has grown earnings (orange line) at a compound rate of 17.3% since 2003, resulting in a nearly 48 billion dollar market cap. In addition, Accenture's earnings have risen from $1.06 per share in 2003, to today's forecasted earnings per share of approximately $4.29 for 2013. Further, Accenture initiated a dividend (pink line) in 2005 and has been able to increase this payout at a robust pace. Note that Accenture did not cut its dividend in 2010, but rather switched to a semi-annual payout.For a look at how the market has historically valued Accenture, see the relationship between the price (black line) and earnings of the company as seen on the Earnings and Price Correlated F.A.S.T. Graph below.Here we see that Accenture's market price previously began to deviate from its justified earnings growth; starting to become undervalued during the most recent recession and coming back to fair value as of late. Today, Accenture appears to be fairly valued in relation to both its historical earnings and relative valuation.In tandem with the strong earnings growth, Accenture shareholders have enjoyed a compound annual return of 15% which correlates somewhat closely with the 17.3% growth rate in earnings per share. A hypothetical $10,000 investment in Accenture on 12/31/2002 would have grown to a total value of $45,611.11, without reinvesting dividends. Said differently, Accenture shareholders have enjoyed total returns that were roughly 2 times the value that would have been achieved by investing in the S&P 500 over the same time period. It's also interesting to note that an investor would have received approximately 1.2 times the amount of dividend income as the index as well.But of course - as the saying goes - past performance does not guarantee future results. Thus, while a strong operating history provides a fundamental platform for evaluating a company, it does not by itself indicate a buy or sell decision. Instead, an investor must have an understanding of the past while simultaneously thinking the investment through to its logical, if not understated, conclusion.In the opening paragraphs a variety of potential catalysts, opportunities and risks were described. It follows that the probabilities of these outcomes should be the guide for one's investment focus. Yet it is still useful to determine whether or not your predictions seem reasonable.Twenty-three leading analysts reporting to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ come to a consensus 5-year annual estimated return growth rate for Accenture of 12%. In addition, Accenture is currently trading at a P/E of 17.4, which is inside the ""value corridor"" (defined by the orange lines) of a maximum P/E of 18. If the earnings materialize as forecast, Accenture's valuation would be $107.17 at the end of 2018, which would be a 9.8% annualized rate of return including dividends. A graphical representation of this calculation can be seen in the Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator below.Now, it's paramount to remember that this is simply a calculator. Specifically, the estimated total return is a default based on the consensus of the analysts following the stock. The consensus includes the long-term growth rate along with specific earnings estimates for next two upcoming years. Further, the dividend payout ratio is presumed to stay the same and grow with earnings. Taken collectively, this graph provides a very strong baseline for how analysts are presently viewing this company. However, a F.A.S.T. Graphs' subscriber is also able to change these estimates to fit their own thesis or scenario analysis.Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments, it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk treasury bonds. Comparing an investment in Accenture to an equal investment in a 10-year treasury bond, illustrates that Accenture's expected earnings would be 3.9 times that of the 10-year T-Bond Interest. This comparison can be seen in the 10-year Earnings Yield Estimate table below.Finally, it's important to underscore the idea that all companies derive their underlying value from the cash flows (earnings) that they are capable of generating for their owners. Therefore, it should be the expectation of a prudent investor that - in the long-run - the likely future earnings of a company justify the price you pay. Fundamentally, this means appropriately addressing these two questions: ""in what should I invest?"" and ""at what time?"" In viewing the past history and future prospects of Accenture we have learned that it appears to be a strong company with solid upcoming opportunities.

This is best done by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries. What follows is a specific look at how Accenture fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.ACN data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 4/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - 11/30/2013Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryACN Dividend data by YChartsConclusion:Accenture qualifies for the Enterprising Investor after passing all of the investor type's requirements except for the current ratio requirement. The company does not qualify for the Defensive Investor, though, because in addition to failing the current ratio requirement, the company also is currently trading at high PEmg and PB ratios. As a result, Enterprising Investors should feel comfortable putting the company on a watch list while conducting further research, including a review of ModernGraham's valuation of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) and 5 Outstanding Dow Components.From a valuation perspective, the company appears fairly valued after growing its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $1.99 in 2010 to an estimated $3.98 for 2014. This solid level of growth supports the market's current implied estimate for 6.28% earnings growth, and leads the ModernGraham valuation model to return an estimate of intrinsic value that falls within a safety margin relative to the market price.The next part of the analysis is up to individual investors, and requires discussion of the company's prospects.

1881221,23452,2013-12-05T18:23:08-05:00,,"On Wednesday December 4, 2013, Seeking Alpha's ""Market Current"" reported this:Morgan Stanley cuts Accenture and NetApp, ups Western Digital and BrocadeFirst of all, let me state that I am not an expert on cloud services, so I researched what others had to say about Accenture's Cloud services and I found the following that linked to an IDC Report that states:The report also presented a graph showing Accenture's role in cloud professional services:Then Accenture backed that up by stating the following:Therefore it seems strange to me that this was in the SA Market Current:It is strange in that if there is faster than expected cloud computing adoption and Accenture is a world leader in cloud computing, then how can this be a negative for Accenture?As far as Accenture's financials go and the analyst stating that Accenture trades at 15x estimated FY14 (ends Aug. '14) EPS exc. net cash, she is really missing out on what makes Accenture one the most profitable companies in the world and that is it's free cash flow, which I will demonstrate in the following analysis.This analysis will use the following six free cash flow ratios:Those new to this analysis can find an introduction by going here that will explain in detail how each of these ratios is calculated. When used together, these unique ratios will generate a quantitative picture of a company's underlying fundamentals, including strengths and weaknesses.The ""2014 Mycroft Free Cash Flow Per Share"" estimate, shown in the table above, is generated by taking the trailing twelve months (NYSE:TTM) free cash flow result for Accenture and then adding my Mycroft Michaelis Growth Rate into the equation in order to generate forward looking estimate for 2014. That growth rate is generated by using my FROIC ratio (Free Cash Flow Return on Invested Capital). Basically FROIC tells us how efficient operations are as it zeros in on how much free cash flow is generated for every $1 of total capital employed. Accenture has a FROIC of 63%, which means that for every $100 of invested capital, the company generates $63 in free cash flow. Now my Mycroft/Michaelis Ratio takes that 63% and multiplies it by the firm's free cash flow reinvestment rate. The reinvestment rate that I use is a free cash flow reinvestment rate instead of the standard one used by analysts that simply uses net income:Free Cash Flow Reinvestment Rate = 100% - (Free Cash Flow Payout Ratio).Or;Free Cash Flow Reinvestment Rate = 100% - (Total Dividend/Total Free Cash Flow).By replacing net income in the payout and reinvestment ratios with free cash flow, I am thus able to make my analysis more precise by incorporating capital spending (Cap Ex) into the equation.Therefore from this we can determine that Accenture has a reinvestment rate of 67% and went on to use 33% of its free cash flow to pay out its dividend. Thus by taking 63% (FROIC) x 67% = 42.21%(rounded off at 42%). From there we add the dividend yield of 2.4%(rounded off at 2%) and we have a Mycroft/Michaelis growth rate of 42% + 2% = 44% .Accenture's Mycroft Free Cash Flow per share of $7.17 was generated by taking its TTM free cash flow per share and multiplying it by (100% + 44% or 1.44). Once we have our result, we then take its current market price of $76.03 and divide it by $7.17 and get a Price to Mycroft Free Cash Flow result of 10.60. I consider a Price to Mycroft Free Cash Flow per share result of less than 15 to be good for purchase, and anything under 7.5 to be excellent.The higher you go above 15, the more overvalued a company becomes. I use a Price to Mycroft Free Cash Flow per share result of 22.5 as my sell price, and 45 as my short price.An appropriately priced stock should trade around a Price to Mycroft Free Cash Flow per share result of 15. This benchmark result was determined by backtesting.Buy (opinion) = A Price to Mycroft Free Cash Flow per share result of less than 7.5 is considered excellent (50% below the initial Hold level), and anything under 15 is attractive.The result I give as my Buy opinion in the table above uses a Price to Mycroft Free Cash Flow per share result of 7.5.Hold (opinion) = 15 to 22.5 (I use 15 in the table).Sell (opinion) = 22.5 or higher (50% above the initial Hold level). (I use 22.5 in the table).Short (opinion) = 45 or greater. The Price to Mycroft Free Cash Flow per share result of 45 was determined by going back to the peak of the market (in the year 2000) and averaging the Price to Free Cash Flow per share results for the key players at that time. (I use 45 in the table).The CapFlow ratio result that you see in the first table above is an original ratio I created in order to tell me how much Capital Spending is used as a percentage of Cash Flow. A result of less than 33% is considered ideal and with Accenture coming in at just 10%, means that 90% of the company's cash flow is actually free cash flow and can be used for such things as buying back stock. From that you get great news like this showing up:In conclusion, it seems that Morgan Stanley's analyst, by simply using 15x estimated FY14 (ends Aug. '14) EPS exc. net cash (quantitative reason) in her downgrade, she really missed the big picture of Accenture's amazing free cash flow numbers. When a company has a CapFlow of just 10% and a FROIC of 63%, this means that Management is doing an excellent job in running the company and more importantly, controlling costs. From a qualitative point of view it is one of the few companies that my research identifies as having a perfect score on the ""15 Points,"" outlined by Philip A. Fisher (the idol of Warren Buffett and father of qualitative analysis) in his book ""Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits."" Here are those points:As for the subject of cloud computing I would imagine that any growth in the sector would benefit Accenture greatly as they have 60% of the Fortune 100 as clients. Finally, Accenture is much more than just a cloud computing firm. It also provides 100s of services for clients.Accenture is one of the largest holdings in my client portfolios and is one of the best run companies I've seen. Like Boeing (NYSE:BA) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) it is one of the few companies that you can ""Buy and Hold"" and sleep well at night.Disclosure: I am long ACN, AAPL, BA, IBM.

1906241,23625,2013-12-18T19:25:40-05:00,,"Accenture (NYSE:ACN), the world's largest consulting company by revenue, is expected to report its earnings for FQ1 2014 before the market opens on Thursday, December 19. This year Accenture has experienced significant stock growth despite a large setback in June when the company fell way short on analysts' revenue expectations in its FQ3'13 filing. Year to date Accenture's stock price is up over 13%.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for ACN to report $1.09 EPS and $7.226B revenue while the current Estimize consensus from 10 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is $1.11 EPS and $7.261B revenue. The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case, we're seeing a small difference between the Estimize and Wall Street numbers.Over the past four months the Wall Street consensus trend for EPS has decreased from $1.12 to $1.09 while the revenue expectation has dropped from $7.423B to $7.226B. The Estimize EPS consensus ended where it began at $1.11 and the revenue expectation crept down from $7.266B to $7.262B.Over the previous five quarters for which there is sufficient data, Estimize has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS four times and more accurate in predicting revenue all five times. By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, students and non professionals we have built a data set that is up to 69.5% more accurate than Wall Street, but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market's true expectations.Confidence ratings for each user are calculated through algorithms developed by our deep quantitative research which look at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. We believe that everyone's opinion matters, regardless of who they are, where they're from, or what it says on their business card.The distribution of estimates published by analysts on Estimize range from $1.05 to $1.19 EPS and $7.193B to $7.390B in revenues. This quarter our contributing analysts are expecting Accenture to beat Wall Street on both EPS and revenue.We are seeing a larger distribution of estimates compared to previous quarters. The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A greater distribution signaling the potential for more volatility post earnings, or smaller vice versa.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is anmikyoso who projects $1.13 EPS and $7.390 in revenue. This quarter the analyst with the top confidence rating, who is ranked 30th overall among over 3,300 contributing analysts, is expecting more profit per share and more revenue for ACN than both Estimize and Wall Street.The Estimize analyst community is expecting a strong report tomorrow from Accenture. Over the past five quarters for which we have data ACN has only missed the Estimize EPS and revenue consensus one time each. Our analysts are predicting that Accenture will continue its year-over-year growth in tomorrow's report.Disclosure: None."
1921701,59321,2013-12-30T16:14:20-05:00,,"Over the past 10 years, Accenture (NYSE:ACN) has been consistently growing faster than what the market claims. My analysis shows that, should ACN continue to grow its earnings, book value and free cash flow on a steady basis, the company should be worth $113-$115 a share.Quick BackgroundAccenture is a leading international management-consulting, technology, and outsourcing firm that was previously the consulting arm of Arthur Andersen. ACN has five different operating segments: communications, media and technology; financial services; health and public services; products, and resources. Recently, Accenture has cited that the poor global economy has contributed to contracts converting to revenues at a slower-than-usual pace, and per its 10-K, Accenture noted that it expects revenues to decline modestly or grow at a small rate in the near term. The 10-K also states that the company has been experiencing growth in the field of emerging technology (analytics, cloud-computing, and mobility), which has fallen in line with Accenture's increased weight on catching the faster-growing technology trends.Acquisition SpreeAccenture has been committing itself to its strategy of allocating more of its cash for acquisitions. Much of its acquisitions were used to tap into faster growing technology and industrial markets (analytics, cloud-computing, insight-driven health, interactive/digital marketing, mobility and smart grid), as well as gaining international market share.As per its Q1 2014 earnings transcript, CEO Pierre Nanterme stated on the matter of acquisitions:CompetitionAccenture competes with the likes of IBM (NYSE:IBM), Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH), Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), Infosys (NYSE:INFY), Wipro (NYSE:WIT), as well as plenty of private companies. Out of those five public companies, Accenture is the second largest in terms of market-cap. IBM leads with around $195B. In terms of multiples, Accenture trades in line with its competitors at a P/E of 17, a P/B of 10, and a P/S of 1.9. While its P/B is considerably high, I believe the premium is warranted due to the company's high profitability and the intangible nature of its business, as well as its ability to grow faster than the market (I will quantify this ability in a little bit).As far as pricing power is concerned, I don't believe Accenture will benefit from any such ability, but its ability to continue to gain market share through acquisitions will serve as a competitive advantage, and because the company is highly diversified it will continue to thrive even if it does experience rising pressure from competition. As stated by the CEO when questioned about the fierce competition and pricing power:I would also like to point out that Accenture has been the most profitable and efficient of all of its competitors in terms of return on invested capital (ROIC) and return on equity (ROE). ROE has been around the 50%-70% mark consistently since 2004, and ROIC has also been around the 50%-70% mark since 2004. No other of the mentioned competitors has experienced such high rates of value creation for the same time period.Source: Morningstar.With Accenture's ROIC around 2.3x the average of IBM, Cognizant, and Infosys's ROIC, it is clear to me that ACN has a much better track record of creating value (11years worth) than its competitors.Undervalued Going Into 2013I took a different approach going about valuing ACN. I pretended that it was 2009 and that I was considering investing in the company back then. For some reason I acquired the magical power of forecasting ACN's future free cash flows exactly (2,053, 3,038, 3,885, 2,934, in millions). Using a DCF model, assuming a discount rate of 15%, and a terminal multiple of 8 (historically, FCF multiples for the company have been around 11-19x), I obtained a fair value of $113 for 2009. Accenture has yet to hit that target price, and I believe there may be even more upside as the company has grown considerably since then.Using a residual earnings model in valuing the shares in 2009, I assumed a discount rate of 12% and a terminal multiple of 8. I obtained a fair value of $92 using that model, and because ACN has a history of having high P/B's (around 8-11x), I believe a more accurate value would be $115 (using 10x). Because these models are valuing the stock in 2009, I believe ACN may have even more upside potential, considering that the future does look rosy for shareholders. To keep it safe, though, it is almost certain that ACN should have near-term upside of 37%.Rosy Future for ShareholdersRecently, Accenture raised its semi-annual dividend to $.93, a 14.8% increase from its April 10th dividend of $.81. A raise in dividends is usually a sign that management is confident about the business, and it is obvious that they should be. Accenture has 11 years' worth of evidence that it can generate substantial amounts of FCF. For fiscal 2014, management forecasts that it will hit a FCF amount of $3.2-$3.5B, which is around a 9% increase. ACN also does not have much debt (debt to cash ratio of .006%), and therefore much of that FCF will be lying around for the benefit of the shareholders. In fact, 93% of FCF has been returned to shareholders since ACN's IPO (source: IA day CFO slides).ConclusionWhile slow economic growth and fierce competition may affect Accenture negatively in the near term, the company's strong track record of value creation and consistent innovation in keeping up with profitable trends, as well as returning cash to shareholders, should shout ""buy"" to any passing investor. There is considerable upside (at least 37%), and I would not hesitate going long.Disclosure: I am long ACN. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1750992,21544,2013-10-17T11:27:28-04:00,,"Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) provides management consulting, technology, and business process outsourcing services worldwide. It is organized in five segments - Communications Media & Technology, Financial Services, Health & Public Service, Products, and Resources. This international dividend achiever has paid dividends since 2005, and has increased them every year since then.The company's last dividend increase was in September 2013 when the Board of Directors approved a 15 % increase in the semi-annual dividend to 93 cents /share. The company's peer group includes IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Deloitte Consulting.Over the past decade this dividend growth stock has delivered an annualized total return of 16.50% to its shareholders.The company has managed to deliver a 15.50% average increase in annual EPS between 2003 and 2012. Analysts expect Accenture to earn $4.47 per share in 2014 and $4.95 per share in 2015. In comparison, the company earned $4.22/share in 2013. Over the next five years, analysts expect EPS to rise by 10.14%/annum. The company has also managed to reduce the number of outstanding shares over the past decade from 997 million in 2003 to 715 million in 2013.The consulting business is highly competitive. As a result, consulting companies need to differentiate themselves. In their 10-K, Accenture mentions the following on their differentiation:""A key differentiator is our global delivery model, which allows us to draw on the benefits of using people and other resources from around the world-including scalable, standardized processes, methods and tools; specialized management consulting, business process and technology skills; cost advantages; foreign language fluency; proximity to clients; and time zone advantages-to deliver high-quality solutions. Emphasizing quality, productivity, reduced risk, speed to market and predictability, our global delivery model enables us to provide clients with price-competitive services and solutions. Our Global Delivery Network continues to be a competitive differentiator for us. We have more than 50 delivery centers around the world. As of August 31, 2012, we had approximately 162,000 people in our network globally.""Overall I expect consulting to continue to be a growth business for years to come. Companies always need to fix or upgrade IT systems, solve strategic problems, cut costs, try to increase revenues or increase profitability. In addition, there might always be a need for companies to outsource certain tasks to providers like Accenture, in order to focus on their core competencies, thus creating a consistent revenue stream for the consultant. The core competitive advantage of the company is the stickiness of customer relationships. Once you get a client, and know its systems or processes, they tend to stay with you. That being said, maintaining client relationships is very important for companies like Accenture. Another advantage could be its strong brand name, which is synonymous with consulting in certain business circles.Accenture has a very high return on equity, which ranged between 55% and 75%. This is mostly because the high value added professional services offered to customers do not come with a heavy capital investment requirements. I generally want to see at least a stable return on equity over time. I use this indicator to assess whether management is able to put extra capital to work at sufficient returns.The annual dividend payment has increased by 28.70% per year over the past five years, which is slightly higher than the growth in EPS. This has been achieved mostly due to the expansion of the dividend payout ratio. Future dividend growth will likely be limited to earnings growth, which would likely be around 10% for the next five years.A 29% growth in distributions translates into the dividend payment doubling almost every two and a half years on average. At a ten percent growth, distributions should double every seven years.The dividend payout ratio has increased from 0% in 2004 to 38.70% in 2012. The company initiated a dividend payment in 2005, and had a low payout of 19%. Over the next eight years, Accenture has managed to increase distributions at a rate that was much higher than earnings growth, by expanding the dividend payout ratio. A lower payout is always a plus, since it leaves room for consistent dividend growth minimizing the impact of short-term fluctuations in earnings.Currently Accenture is attractively valued at 17 times earnings, yields 2.60% and has a sustainable distribution. However I find that IBM offers a better value today at 13.30 times earnings, despite the lower yield of 2%. As a result, I recently added to my IBM position. If I can purchase Accenture at 15 times earnings however, which is slightly above the average low P/E ratio over the past decade, I would initiate a position in the company.Disclosure: I am long IBM.

1717512,48501,2013-09-27T13:02:02-04:00,,"Accenture (NYSE:ACN) reported fourth quarter and full year earnings. The top-line numbers were solid and were accompanied by margin expansion. That follows valuations that declined following disappointing third quarter results.That said, the valuations have stabilized and there are visible signs of accumulation. I think common equity shares of Accenture remain undervalued by about 15%. The valuations include the recently released financial data.I think Accenture is a ""buy"" on valuations and favorable industry dynamics. The current share price is a good level to accumulate shares with a trailing stop loss starting at $69 per share.Recent DevelopmentsPeer Company ComparisonsI'll use Infosys (NYSE:INFY), IBM (IBM) and Cognizant Technology Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) to assess the relative financial performance of Accenture during the past few fiscal quarters and years. Although there are some differences among the companies, they are a good peer group for comparison purposes. The management consulting and outsourcing industries are highly competitive growth industries.Accenture's revenue is increasing, but investors are worried about the pace of the increase -- with good reason. On the other hand, IBM's revenue from Global Services is trending lower. But, IBM""s Global Services segment is twice the size of Accenture by revenue. Accenture is beating IBM in the market.Infosys's revenue is trending higher. The company has a higher revenue growth rate than Accenture but is about a quarter of the size in terms of revenue. Also of note, Accenture doesn't have a scale advantage over Infosys in terms of gross or operating margin.In terms of revenue, Cognizant Technology Solutions is also about a quarter of the size of Accenture. Further, Accenture does not have a scale advantage over Cognizant, in terms of operating margin. Lastly, Cognizant's revenue is increasing at a faster rate than Accenture's revenue. Cognizant is beating Accenture in the market.Based solely on this analysis, investors should be bullish on Cognizant and Infosys. They should be neutral on Accenture and bearish on IBM. This is a growth industry and Accenture's management's goal is to grow faster than the industry, so, we'll see if the last couple of quarters were a bump in the road or a sign of a larger problem.ValuationsThe full year report was good: bookings came in strong on outsourcing growth, and revenue growth was roughly inline with the industry. Also, the fourth quarter numbers were solid. Revenue growth was solid and the profitability was inline with my expectations. I'm going to continue to monitor weakness in Asia operations and consulting.For fiscal 2014, I'm expecting revenue growth of about 3% with an operating margin of 14.5% and a net income margin of 12%. That said, management targets revenue growth in the high single digits and EPS growth in the low double digits; the industry grows in the mid-single digits. Also, EPS should be positively impacted by the share repurchase program. There is some room for Accenture to surprise on the upside -- relative to my forecast.Currently, I think Accenture's dividend growth rate isn't sustainable but it will decline to a sustainable rate of 4.5% over the next 4 years. The discounted cash flow model estimates the intrinsic value of Accenture as $87.54. Accenture is 15% undervalued relative to its current market price of $75.87.Using the recent earnings report's twelve trailing months adjusted EPS of $4.36, 21.8% of the market price of Accenture shares is attributable to EPS growth. If I use a forward PE ratio, 16.3% of Accenture's share price is attributable to EPS growth. Consequently, I think the market is mispricing the growth opportunities of Accenture. That is probably a result of the disappointing earnings report following the previous quarter.So, I think Accenture is undervalued by about 15% as investors are currently underestimating the growth opportunities of the firm.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1639742,46131,2013-08-15T19:40:50-04:00,,"OverviewAccenture Plc. (NYSE:ACN) has provided management consulting, technology, and business process outsourcing services worldwide since 1989. Accenture, since its inception and division from accounting firm Arthur Andersen, has helped to unlock profits to many Fortune 500 clients through its expertise in technology. In 2001, Accenture went public with an initial public offering price of $14.50 per share. Since then, Accenture has rewarded loyal investors by increasing to $70/share (August 2013). Recently the share price has seen a sharp decline, reaching a new 6-week low on Wednesday, August 14th.Recent Financial PerformanceBy analyzing the 1-year performance for Accenture, we can clearly see a gradual uptrend, which came to a screeching halt following its earning call on 27th June 2013. In the earnings report, Accenture announced a cut to its revenue outlook for fiscal 2013. In addition, Accenture lowered its expected growth to 3-4% from an earlier stated 5-8%.Excerpts from the 3rd quarter results reported in June make clear that the performance outlook was heavily impacted both by customer geography and service offerings:We can clearly see that Accenture has been heavily impacted by the economic and political turmoil in EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) and the Asia Pacific regions. While economic difficulties tend to have a positive impact on outsourcing as companies seek to reduce costs; consulting services are often seen as not vital to operations and are therefore first on the corporate chopping block.Competition:In addition to economic and political difficulties, Accenture operates in an extremely competitive market environment. Despite this, Accenture has managed to thrive in recent years. However, sophisticated and well-run companies such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), Wipro (NYSE:WIT), Computer Sciences (CSC), and Gartner (NYSE:IT) have made it extremely difficult to pull away from the competition in terms of market share. In addition, privately held companies like Deloitte Consulting LLP, HP Enterprise Services, LLC take a large chunk out of the market pie.Accenture's P/E ratio sits well within the industry norm. And despite the revised lower forecast, Accenture was recently upgraded by Robert Baird Research company to ""outperform"" from ""neutral"" with a price target of $86.However, peers like Gartner have cut their global IT spending forecast for 2013 from 4.1% to a mere 2.0%. In mid-July 2013, IBM reported earnings that appeared pretty solid and beat expectations, however, some of the details raised investor concern. So we can conclude that Accenture is not the only consulting firm in its market space to experience these difficult market conditions.Measures for Long Term:Accenture is not sitting idly by; in fact, it has undertaken one major acquisition in order to fill out its product offerings, with one more possibly in the future:· It expanded its Product Lifecycle Management expertise with the acquisition of PRION Group. Combining PRION Group with Accenture's management consulting, technology and outsourcing capabilities is expected to create a market-leading global PLM offering for a range of industries.· It is in talks to potentially acquire smaller rival firm, Booz & Co. A takeover of Booz would expand Accenture's Strategy & Operations consulting business.According to recent statistics compiled by CIM data, the comprehensive PLM market experienced 11.3% growth in 2012. By organizing its organic growth and strengthening its verticals, Accenture is clearly putting its chips in the right places. Though takeovers always tend to be problematic in the consulting space, the addition of PRION Group (and possible addition of Booz & Co.) will surely position Accenture well in the long run.Analyst Recommendations:Although analyst recommendations tend to err on the high side; at a consensus low target price of $69, it would appear that Accenture is currently priced at a discount. The question remains, however, when could investors expect to see the upside?Conclusion:The consulting and IT industry will most likely remain flat, at best, through the continued economic uncertainties in Europe. Major corporate and government clients will continue to cut costs by eliminating consulting projects. During this time, the focus for consulting firms will also remain on internal cost-cutting measures. However, it would appear that Accenture is thinking of the long term by making strategic acquisitions at what could prove to be a discount. Last quarter's big earnings miss has revised expectations for next quarter; it may be overly optimistic to think consulting revenues will pick up much of the slack (results to be announced on October 28, 2013). So the near future may not look all that rosy for Accenture, however, buying on a downtrend may not be such a bad move for a long-term investor. After all, that's what Accenture's doing.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

These projections are aggressive when compared with GIA's report, which pegs the IT consulting market to be worth $255 billion by 2015. But while industry estimates vary, most consultants agree that after a few years of economic slowdown, the IT consulting market is gaining back lost ground.Accenture's FinancialsAccenture's (NYSE:ACN) Q4 revenues grew 4% over the year to $7.09 billion, ahead of the Street's projections of $6.9 billion. EPS of $1.01 for the quarter was in line with market projections. By segment, consulting revenues grew 2% over the year to $3.8 billion. Outsourcing revenues grew 6% to $3.3 billion. Overall new bookings grew to $8.4 billion, with 54% of those coming in the outsourcing segment.Revenues from Health & Public Services grew 12% to $1.18 billion. Revenues from Financial Services grew 3% to $1.52 billion. Product revenues grew 6% to $1.70, and revenues from resources fell 1% to $1.29 billion. Communications, Media & Technology revenues were flat over the year at $1.39 billion.During the quarter, Accenture repurchased 14.5 million shares for $1.10 billion. Among operating metrics, utilization improved marginally from 87% a year ago to 88%. Attrition for the quarter at 12% was flat over the year. The company ended the year with revenues growing 3% to $28.6 billion.

It expects to end the year with revenues growing 2%-6% and EPS of $4.42-$4.54. The market was looking for EPS of $4.51 for the year.Accenture's Acquisitions and International ExpansionAccenture continued to make acquisitions to expand product offering and international presence. Earlier last quarter, it announced the acquisition of Mortgage Cadence, a provider of loan origination software and electronic document management services. With the acquisition, Accenture will be able to strengthen its mortgage business process outsourcing services by adding an advanced technology platform that will help mortgage lenders increase efficiency while reducing costs.Within the product life cycle management (PLM) segment, Accenture acquired PRION Group, a consulting and systems integrator that specializes in Siemens PLM Software. PRION is among the leading providers of PLM consultancy services and helps its customers with system implementation, data migration and application management.Accenture is also growing its international presence through strategic investments and tie-ups. Earlier this month, it announced the purchase of majority stake in Vivere Brasil, a leading national mortgage-processing technology company in Brazil. The acquisition of majority stake will help Accenture expand within the mortgage processing industry in Brazil. According to market reports, mortgage loans in Brazil account for 7% of the gross domestic product, and the segment is projected to be worth 10% of the country's GDP by 2015.Finally, Accenture entered into a strategic alliance with SAP (NYSE:SAP) to enable customers to procure and implement SAP products through Accenture. Besides benefiting from Accenture's consulting experience, customers will also be able to access end-to-end solutions running on the SAP HANA platform under a single framework. Accenture's stock is trading at $73.51 with a market capitalization of $58.78 billion. It touched a year high of $84.22 in May 2013."

The Senate has passed a bill onto the House and then the President. I don't doubt a solution will be passed relatively soon.With earnings season kicking into high gear, I guarantee that we will hear at least a CEO or two use the shutdown as a scapegoat for future guidance purposes, guiding down. I maintain that it is still difficult to find good stocks these days, and that's why I'm highlighting a select set of excellent value companies which have had ex-dividend dates or paid out a dividend during this past week or early next week; people should place these on their radar.Kraft Foods Group (KRFT)Kraft Foods Group, Inc. (KRFT) operates food and beverage businesses in North America including convenient meals, refreshment beverages and coffee, cheese and other grocery products. On 01Aug13, Kraft reported second quarter 2013 earnings of $1.38 per share. This result beat the $0.66 consensus of the 16 analysts covering the company and beat last year's second quarter results by $0.80. Kraft's PE ratio is below the food processing industry average and signals that investors are not willing to pay a premium for this stock, making it a value story. However, during the past year, earnings growth has lagged its historical five year growth rate. The stock is up 12.65% in the past year compared to the S&P500's 20.51% gain.The company went ex-dividend on 09Oct13 with a $0.525 per share dividend which will be paid on 25Oct13 for a yield of 4.03%. This dividend marks an increase of 5% over the prior $0.50 dividend. It was a pretty quiet week in terms of news pertaining to the company specifically with no press releases being issued. Let's take a quick look at the technicals here to see if it can be bought at these levels or if a pullback is coming. As we can see, the relative strength index is in middle ground territory with a current value of 52.54, while the MACD chart below shows the black line starting to cross over the red line, meaning there is upward pressure on the stock. I anticipate the stock to run upwards for now. I bought some shares recently and will be looking forward to add to my position. Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN)Accenture is engaged in providing management consulting, technology and outsourcing services. On 26Sep13, Accenture reported fourth quarter 2013 earnings of $1.01 per share. This result was in-line with the consensus of the 20 analysts following the company and beat last year's 4 quarter results by 14.77%. Accenture's PE ratio is among the lowest of any stock in the business services industry and signals that investors have not been willing to pay a premium for this company's business prospects, making it a value story.Additionally, during the past year, earnings growth has outpaced its historical five year growth rate. The stock is up 4.33% in the past year compared to the S&P500's 20.51% gain. The company went ex-dividend on 09Oct13 with a $0.93 per share dividend (semi-annual) which will be paid on 15Nov13 for a yield of 2.6%.

I anticipate the stock to run upwards for now. ConclusionI've highlighted these names, because they have all raised their dividend within the past year and are poised to do so again in the coming years. It is important in this market to be able to hold onto companies which raise their dividend rates, because it is a sign that the underlying company is doing well financially. The importance of these stocks I've highlighted is that they are value plays while the broader market is getting choppy. I believe we are at a point in the market where we have to look for value.Disclaimer: These are only my personal opinions and you should do your own homework.

1446731,24157,2013-05-20T09:25:36-04:00,,"Earlier this week, I wrote about how the pressure to innovate and the increasing competitiveness of its industry makes Apple's extraordinarily high return on invested capital (ROIC) unsustainable. Amazing new innovations can bring in massive profits for a brief time. Big profits invite competition and copycats, which, eventually, drive down profits and margins. No company can stay on the leading edge of innovation forever.Profiting From Disruptive InnovationMy favorite aspect of Accenture plc's (NYSE:ACN) business model is it profits from others' innovations without having to incur the costs and pressures of innovation, itself. By establishing itself as the go-to name in IT and management consulting, Accenture has the potential to bring in new business with every major disruptive innovation, regardless of where that innovation comes from.In The Innovators Dilemma, Clayton Christensen explains how companies that do everything right can still struggle when disruptive innovation changes the market. The leaders at Accenture have clearly read this book, as the company excels at identifying new, high growth markets brought about by disruptive innovations.For example, Accenture developed cloud solutions for its customers. Its Cloud Platform and more than 6,700 cloud experts brought in $1 billion in revenue last year, a promising sign for an industry as a whole has been growing by more than 27% compounded annually.In addition, Accenture's holistic view towards serving its clients has allowed it to achieve an impressive diversity in its business. Recently it has significantly grown its digital marketing division, landing contracts from BMW earlier this month. Like cloud computing, digital marketing is a rapidly growing business, with industry revenues growing by 15% in 2012. Not many companies can offer highly technical cloud support and a creative advertising campaign at the same time. Accenture's diverse capabilities differentiate it from its competitors.Figure 1: Widening the Gap Between Returns and CostsSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsHuman Capital Is A Competitive AdvantageMuch of Accenture's success comes from its ability to identify and hire the best talent in different fields of expertise. The company's high-quality personnel enable it to offer better solutions to a wider range of clients.Accenture faces plenty of competition from companies like IBM and its Global Business Services unit, but the quality of Accenture's people enables it to remain the leader in consulting. This strategy is self-perpetuating. Accenture is like a college football dynasty: the best high school recruits want to play for the best college programs, and the best young consultants want to work at the best consulting firm, Accenture.Consistent Track Record of ProfitabilityThe quality of Accenture's strategy manifests in its profitability. ROIC is a key indicator of management's ability to create value for shareholders, and Accenture has had a high and growing ROIC for the past decade. Figure 1 shows Accenture's ROIC versus its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) over the past 10 years.The 30% ROIC that Accenture had 10 years ago is exceptional. The fact that it has more than doubled its ROIC since then is a testament to its high quality management. Few firms can sustain those kinds of returns, but I think Accenture has the ability to do so. In 2012, its asset write-downs totaled only 3.5% of its total net assets, a sign that the company wastes very little of its invested capital. As long as management continues to allocate capital efficiently, Accenture's advantages in quality and diversity of services should allow it to maintain its high returns.More recent data also reflects brightly for the outlook on Accenture. Accenture grew its net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) by 18% in 2011 and 12% last year. Its IT consulting division significantly outperformed IBM's last year, as revenue for IBM Global Business Services declined by 2% in 2012.No matter what time range I review, Accenture's history attests to the quality of its management and business model.Priced for StagnationDespite its impressive fundamentals and strong track record of growth, ACN is priced like a company with almost no growth potential. At its current valuation of ~$80.76, ACN has a price to economic book value ratio of 1.11, implying that it will never grow NOPAT by more than 11% from its current level for the remainder of its corporate life. Contrast this modest expectation with ACN's NOPAT compound annual growth rate of 12.6% over the last 10 years.There does not appear to be any reason to expect ACN's growth to slow down so drastically. If anything, the increasingly high-tech economy and the growth of ""big data"" should increase the demand for ACN's services. On the balance sheet, ACN's $5.2 billion in excess cash more than covers its liabilities, meaning investors don't have to worry about future cash flows being significantly diverted to pay off debts or underfunded pension plans.It's rare to find a global leader in a growing and stable business with almost no growth built into the stock price. Investors should take advantage of the chance to buy such a solid company at a cheap price.For investors who prefer their exposure to ACN to come through a mutual fund or ETF, I recommend Advisers Investment Trust: Independent Franchise Partners US Equity Fund (MUTF:IFPUX) due to its 5.3% allocation to ACN and Attractive rating.Sam McBride contributed to this report.Disclosure: David Trainer owns ACN.

1355871,47721,2013-04-20T09:43:05-04:00,,"Cloud computing is no longer an emerging trend. For instance, salesforce.com has seen 14 years of operation and it has been more than 5 years since it topped 1 million subscribers. Similarly, other organizations operating in cloud computing have made significant progress in cloud-enabling their applications. However, recent innovations in this sector, such as everything-as-a-service (XaaS), are signs that there are still opportunities yet to be tapped into.Realizing these trends and helping its clients to get the most business value from cloud computing along with an anticipation of a greater demand for public cloud, Accenture PLC (NYSE:ACN) has launched the Accenture Cloud Platform. Also, Accenture will invest more than $400 million in cloud technologies, capabilities and training by 2015 in an attempt to deliver the right cloud services from its network of providers, as well as blending its own industry solutions and innovations with third party offerings.How big is the cloud?According to the IDC cloud research, worldwide revenues from public IT cloud services exceeded $21.5 billion in 2010 and are expected to reach $72.9 billion by 2015, achieving a CAGR of 27.64%, far superior to the growth of 6.7% expected to be experienced by the worldwide IT market as a whole over the same period. It is also estimated in the research that by 2015, one of every seven dollars spent on packaged software, server and storage offerings will be through the public cloud model. Within the cloud arena, the size of the Software as a Service (SAAS) solutions market, in which Accenture predominantly operates, is expected to reach $37 billion by the end of 2016.According to Accenture's estimates, by 2016 enterprises will devote 14% of their overall IT product and services spending to cloud, up 5% from 2011. More importantly, by that same time 46% of new spending would be on cloud-enabled technologies. In the same research Accenture estimates that more than one-third of large enterprises have yet to implement any cloud technology, public or private, in their infrastructure. And for platform cloud technologies the ratio of enterprises increases to 50%. The table below lists the key drivers and inhibitors to the growth in the industry.Accenture's CloudAccenture provides cloud services in three areas to help clients improve IT efficiency and agility: It helps clients plan, implement and manage services from its provider ecosystem; it develops Software as a Service solutions built on its proprietary assets; and it provides provisioning, integration and management of services to bridge operations across traditional and cloud environments. In addition, the company helps its clients in implementing SaaS solutions to meet their business needs with the added benefits of increasing flexibility and reducing total costs of ownership. The company's SaaS methodology and toolset enables delivery of SaaS solutions across a wide range of services and leading SaaS solutions including Salesforce.com, Workday, SAP, Oracle and Netsuite.Accenture has already worked on more than 4,000 cloud projects and has more than 6,700 professionals trained in cloud. Accenture Cloud Platform is an important step for the company in order to provide cloud brokering and orchestration services that have recently seen growth in demand and is expected to experience high demand by clients in the future as well. According to Jack Sepple, the global senior managing director of Cloud Accenture, the company's Cloud Platform is already in use in more than 200 projects and has proven technologies and business processes to help clients in making a safe journey to clouds. He further stated that the company is dedicated to moving the company's extensive portfolio of cloud offerings - a large eco-system of alliances, and a large global client base - to the cloud in all forms: public, private and hybrid.Multiples based Valuation In my multiples-based valuation I have given a greater weight to enterprise value multiples as they better capture the core earnings of the company. Based on the valuation, the company is relatively undervalued, compared to the industry. The current price of $77.49 provides an upside potential of 13.5%.ConclusionAccenture's focus towards enhancing its cloud services portfolio through the development of SaaS solutions, employee training and corporate alliances will enable it to capture the forecasted exponential growth in the overall cloud market. According to research, three-fourths of the executives in 414 organizations that were asked suggest that they would rely on the in-house staff for IT services, but the same executives also are expected to increase the use of external services as their reliance on the cloud grows.Accenture has positioned itself as a platform that enables its users to seamlessly integrate the new cloud solutions with their existing IT infrastructure. With its valuable partnerships with large players in the industry, such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the company is bound to reap the benefits from the market trends. Based on my analysis and the upside potential in the stock, I would recommend buying Accenture.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1640312,53462,2013-08-16T10:06:01-04:00,,"Accenture (NYSE:ACN) is one of the leading organizations providing management consulting, information technology and outsourcing services around the world; last fiscal year it made $29.77 billion dollars in net revenue, and got a decent 13.06% of solid cash after capital expenditures, or $3.89 billions of owner earnings as W. Buffett calls it.ACN gets its revenue from five big operating segments:Communications, media and technology (20% of net revenue), financial services (22%), health and public service (16%), products (24%) and resources (18%).Geographically, 48% of total revenue comes from the Americas, 39% from Europe, Africa and Middle East (EAME), and the remaining 13% comes from Asia. The consulting business represents 56% of net revenue, while outsourcing business has the other 44%.In the next section, I will analyze the company and its fundamentals using information available on its SEC filings.Profit margins.The following graphic shows a history of ACN's profit margins for the past five years and last quarter of 2013.As the picture shows, ACN is constantly improving its margins, especially net income, which has jumped from 6.7% to 10.5% in the past 5 years.Income Statement.For the last 5 years, revenue has grown at a modest rate of 4.1% annually. As a result of profit margins improvement, net income has grown at a faster rate of 11.2%, getting from $1.7 billions to $2.6 billions in the 2008-2012 period.For 2013's quarterly results, revenue has behaved almost flat, as you can see in the next picture from MSN money shows.In its most recent 10-Q management explains that net revenues coming from the Americas increased 8% in local currency, driven by growth in the United States, partially offset by a decline in Brazil's.EMEA net revenues decreased 1% in local currency. They also explain that Finland experienced a significant decline, as well as declines in Spain, Sweden and Norway. These declines were partially offset by growth in most countries across the remainder of the region, led by Switzerland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Germany, South Africa and Italy.Net revenue coming from Asia was flat in local currency, as growth in China and India was offset by declines in Australia and Japan.Even though revenue has been slowed down due to macro economic factors, earnings per share have increased substantially faster.As you can appreciate, EPS is growing pretty fast; for the last 3 quarters, it has grown at an average rate of 48.5% (year over year comparison).Balance Sheet.As shown in its most recent balance sheet, ACN holds $5.9 billions in cash and equivalents and have $4.8 billions in receivables, making 90% of current assets.In the liabilities section, it has $7.6 billion for current and $3.5 billion for non-current liabilities.According to the quick ratio, it has $1.58 dollars of current asset for every dollar of current liabilities. They can even handle total liabilities with its current assets; ACN has 7.8% more of current assents than total liabilities, a test that not many companies pass.Another aspect worthwhile noticing, is that it carries no debt, it has liabilities on the balance sheet which most of them are accrued expenses (34% of total liabilities), but not borrowed money.Cash Flow Statement.The cash from operating activities has grown at a rate of 11% over the last 5 years; in that same period, only about 12% of earnings were used in investing activities, which reflects its business is not very capital intensive, and it doesn't need to do a lot of investing to generate cash or remain competitive, it may also reflects the slow growing revenues that we have seen.The remaining 88% of its earnings has been used to improve the financial position of the company and benefit the shareholder; ACN keeps cash in hand, buys back shares and pays dividends to the common shareholder.Its share's buy-back program has continued uninterrupted for 8 years, it used $1.64 billions last year. For the dividends, it has paid cash to shareholders for 7 years; in 2012 they paid a total of $950 millions, showing an increase of 47% with the prior year.Risks.Consulting and outsourcing services are in a highly competitive industry; this could lead to a decline in revenues, which also relies heavily on macro economic trends.The majority of the net revenues come from currencies other than the U.S. dollar, unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse effect on the results of operations.It's also important to note that many of its consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days, therefore, it's very important to maintain its service's quality and competitive fees.Valuation.Right now, the price of the shares is fluctuating around $72 USD, it's P/E ratio is about 16 or 6% earnings yield; its pays a dividend yield of about 2.2%.Using a discounted cash flow valuation, the fair price of a share comes up to be in the range of $75 and $81 dollars per share.Conclusion.Accenture is a well-known name in business consulting and services around the world, it also seems to have a good long-term outlook especially in the information technology business, which could lead to an increase in future revenues as management discuses in their 2013 vision. As far as I can tell, the management team has done a pretty descent job improving the company's profitability and growing earnings per share at an attractive rate; people at ACN are also good cash flow managers, they maintain a very strong balance sheet and benefit their shareholders constantly.I'm confident on its business model and reputation, since it is one of the leading companies in this attractive growing (around 27% annually) industry.This growth stock with lower than average volatility (beta=0.9), seems to be slightly undervalued at $73 dollars, I would recommend, to conservative investors who have a moderate diversified growth portfolio, to start taking a long position on this stock due to its safety, stability and attractive upside potential.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company is investing $400 million globally over the next two and a half years in cloud technologies. This will allow the company to provide the right cloud services to its clients from its network of vendors. An increasing number of businesses are going digital and as technology trends like mobile increase, Accenture will use the cloud initiative to provide further support to businesses making this transition.According to industry analyst firm IDC, the total market size for cloud will grow from approximately $40 billion in 2012 to $98 billion in 2016. This includes projections for software as a service (SAAS) to reach $37 billion, infrastructure as a service (IaaS) to reach $30 billion, system infrastructure software as a service to reach $20 billion, and platform as a service (PAAS) to reach $10 billion by 2016.According to Jack Semple, Global Senior Managing Director of Accenture's cloud initiative:We are not doing data centers, nor are we creating horizontal solutions, or becoming a CRM provider. Instead, this is about integrating those kinds of offers together. So we're going toward a platform that does self-service cataloging with provisioning. Everything will be pre-integrated and pretested by us before we offer it.Our intention is to move up the stack as time goes on so that we can reach further into business processes. So we will make more announcements as time goes on, as we roll out additional enhancements and new services to be offered on the platform. Over the course of time, we intend to push more deeply into critical business services, which are really industry aligned solutions, and our intent is to use the platform to enhance our service capabilities and our software solutions over the long term.Accenture realizes that cloud computing is the way of the future. The company has already worked on over 4000 cloud projects for its clients. Half of the Fortune Global 100 have used Accenture cloud services. Currently, Accenture has 6,700 employees trained in cloud-related services working on 200 projects using Accenture's Cloud Platform.Why Accenture's Cloud Initiative Is ExcitingAccenture aims to be the provider of choice as more and more companies transition to the cloud. Accenture's strategy is to be an independent advisor to their clients and integrate across other company's platforms. The company currently has agreements with 25 different cloud providers including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Netsuite (NYSE:N), and VMware (NYSE:VMW).What this allows for is that customers no longer have to deal with different software vendors. They can sign up with Accenture and Accenture will customize according to the client's needs. Accenture is offering its customers a prebuilt and customizable cloud brokering platform. This helps to minimize the IT governance and integration headaches that commonly occur with multiple providers.In effect Accenture is becoming a cloud broker. Accenture aims to provide its clients with full access to all providers. Accenture's role will be in managing it all seamlessly.Outlook For Accenture StockLast quarter's earnings report from Accenture was mixed. The company reduced its forecast for revenue growth on the back of sluggish corporate spending. European corporate spending is particularly slow for Accenture. Accenture forecasts that its revenue growth will be below the midpoint of its prior forecast of 5 to 8 percent growth for the year ending August 31. In the second quarter consulting revenue fell by 1 percent to $3.8 billion. Outsourcing revenue was however up 9 percent to $3.3 billion.A bright spot for the company is that booking trends are coming in strong. New bookings for this year are expected to come in at the high end of the $31 billion to $34 billion forecast. Current bookings for the second quarter were $4.4 billion, up from $4.05 billion last year.Accenture reiterated its full-year forecast of $4.24 to $4.32 per share in earnings. The average earnings estimate from analysts is $4.26 per share. Of the analysts that follow the stock, 7 have it rated as a Strong Buy, 8 a Buy, and 11 a Hold. The target price on the stock ranges from $72 to $88 with $80 being the median target. I'm bullish on the stock over the long-term.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1527492,24363,2013-06-28T23:25:34-04:00,,"What a difference a day makes. After publishing an article recommending Accenture (NYSE:ACN) as a buy the day before earnings, earnings are released with poor guidance that decimates the share price. At the time of this writing, shares have fallen to $71.00, down from over $80 when I published.This is not my first humbling experience and it surely won't be my last. Of course, it would be preferable to have these sorts of experiences in private among a few colleagues, but that is a necessary trade-off of publishing publicly. What is done is done. The question is where to go from here?A Review of the Earnings CallThe main culprit of this sell-off is the lowered guidance going forward. From Seeking Alpha's Market Currents:Revenues missed expectations due to flat consulting growth, but despite the miss on the top line, ACN delivered record operating income and operating margin. From CEO Pierre Nanterme:Outgoing CFO Pamela Craig highlighted two factors with regards to consulting revenues missing expectations.The first factor:The second factor:In terms of the sectors in which consulting revenues were down, Craig cited resources and products. This likely ties into the ending of the commodity boom, as large resource companies will be re-evaluating their business models and seeking to lower operational costs in the face of lower prices for their products.Regionally, Brazil and Europe were cited as areas of weak growth, and from the Seeking Alpha Market Currents, Asia-Pacific was also weak. This was driven by slower growth in Australia, which will also be tied to the commodity boom.Therefore, two of the broader macro trends, the fall in commodity prices and slowdown in the Asia-Pacific region, are behind the consulting revenue miss at Accenture.Accenture Is Nimble To Adjust To Changes in the Economic EnvironmentOne of the advantages to owning a business like ACN is that it can quickly adjust to the change in the economic environment. I was talking with an employee of ACN after publishing my last article (not the same employee I stayed with), who stated the following:CEO Pierre Nanterme recognizes this shift in the world and addressed it during the earnings report. Given that the challenges facing resource companies appear to be in their infancy, ACN is focusing on serving different market segments. In particular, ACN is focusing on digital:Therefore, although consulting revenues were lower due to macroeconomic trends, I believe this setback will be short lived. As the employee of ACN noted, ACN is one of the most nimble big companies on the market. It is positioning itself for the future, and I suspect it will be successful in executing its strategy.In addition, it was noted in the earnings call that ACN is experiencing double digit growth in China, India and the U.S. These are the markets where the action is and will be, and ACN's success in them bodes well for future earnings.An Updated ValuationBelow is a 10 year chart with ACN's stock price and the following valuation metrics updated to the latest earnings report:These ratios do an excellent job of highlighting the recent price move. The P/E ratio and Price/Book Value are at historic support levels, indicating a floor in price action. The Price/Sales Ratio and Price to Cash Flows do not look as cheaply valued, though.Given that the Price/Sales Ratio and Price to Cash Flows do not look as encouraging, below is a chart using two more valuation metrics involving cash flows over the life of ACN's public trading.EV/Free Cash Flows takes a hypothetical value of a company based on market cap, debt and cash and divides it by free cash flows. Although this measure is still at recent highs, it is at the lower range of the pre-2008 great recession. Therefore, as equity markets continue to recover, ACN has plenty of upside.The second metric, Operating P/E Ratio, divides the market capitalization by operating earnings. Operating earnings, much like cash flows, focus on what the company is generating before the accountants step in. Another way to think about it is the price an investor pays for one dollar of pre-tax operating earnings. Much like the EV/Free Cash Flows, this is also at close to recent highs post 2008, but lows pre-2008, indicating further upside in an improving equity environment.When these 6 metrics are considered in totality, I consider them to indicate ACN is trading at a great price.Moving from ratios to the nominal results, Wall Street's cause for concern becomes more apparent.Revenues appear to be forming a top, and Wall Street punishes companies that are not growing. But I believe Wall Street has got it wrong. Accenture had flat revenues in 2002 to 2003, but has since gone on to more than double revenues. In 2002, shares prices were punished for this lack of growth as well, falling from $30 per share to $15 per share. Even if you bought at the peak back then, you still would have more than doubled your money.This ties back into ACN's anti-fragile nature that the ACN employee was referring to. Back in 2002, the macroeconomic environment went through a shift post the 2001 dotcom crash. ACN did a lot of consulting for dotcom companies and had to reinvent its business model to accommodate this shift in the state of the world, offering more options for resource based companies.Fast forward to 2013, and we are in the midst of another shift, this time out of commodities. As was pointed out in the earnings call, resource companies were one of the companies that cut back on consulting. ACN is once again shifting its business model to better service its clients that are in growing market segments.In terms of ACN's operations, they continue to be solid. Return on Assets, Return on Equity and Operating Margins all increased.This is especially encouraging as it shows it is not cutting into margins in order to gain business, even with the challenges it is facing in its consulting business. A great friend and CPGA Golf Pro Scott Keenlyside once told me:Clients are prepared to pay to work with ACN because they know they are working with the best.My Next MoveFortunately, I was still in the midst of evaluating adding ACN to a client's portfolio and therefore missed the post earnings fallout. Taking the latest price action and earnings call into consideration, it is now simply a matter of position sizing, as I will definitely be looking to pick up ACN at these levels. I strongly encourage my readers to consider a position as well.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in ACN over the next 72 hours.

I knew of the company and its prestigious reputation, but had not spent time delving into its financials. We had discussed her work in the past and it sounded interesting, so I decided to do a quick perusal of the company at large. I was impressed by what I found.A Phenomenal Track RecordACN is a management consulting, technological services and outsourcing company with 261,000 people serving clients in over 120 countries. In terms of its clients, they fall into five broad operating groups:ACN's value proposition is to provide highly trained staff to large companies to take on special projects. Its product is human capital, and as you can see from the chart below, the human capital business is booming.ACN's historical price action is solid. Since June 28, 2002, ACN has returned 320%, blowing away the S&P 500's 60% over the same period. This increase in stock price was closely matched by an increase in revenue per share, which grew 226%. Even during the 2008 recession, the price of ACN only fell 25%, from $40 per share to $30 per share, while the broader market sold off over 50%. Revenue was hurt by the recession, but it was still fairly resilient, demonstrating that the customers of ACN saw the outsourcing services ACN was providing as vital to operations.Year to date, ACN has also outperformed both the market and comparables companies such as IBM and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ:CTSH). In addition, it has sold off less than the broader market during the recent selloff, only down 3.10% this month versus 3.57% for the S&P 500.ACN's earnings have been remarkably stable, consistently averaging an earnings yield of a little over 5.5%. In October 2002, ACN began issuing a dividend with a payout ratio of approximately 33%, providing a yield on average of 2%. This additional stream of cash flows in a company with healthy growth is a nice bonus of owning ACN.Superior Operational PerformanceThe main limitation when comparing ACN's operational performance versus competitors is that many of ACN's top competitors are not publicly traded. This includes firms such as McKinsey & Company, The Boston Consulting Group and Bain Capital. In fact, majority of prominent management consulting firms are not publicly traded, and ACN was only listed in 2001.Therefore, when evaluating ACN's operational performance versus competitors, this caveat must be kept in mind.Making do with what is available, I'll be comparing the operational performance of ACN versus the following 6 companies.Source: FINVIZThese 6 companies are all above $900 million USD market cap and provide consulting services.Starting first with price performance, since January 1st 2001, ACN has had the top share price performance along with Huron Consulting Group (NASDAQ:HURN), returning just over 60%.I've compared the operations of the 6 companies using 2 different operational metrics.The 1st chart compares Return On Assets (ROA), which is calculated by dividing net income by total assets.Net Income / Total Assets = Return on AssetsThis provides insight as to how much of a return a company is generating versus its total assets. The advantage to this metric is in its simplicity, the disadvantage is that net income is potentially subject to accounting creativity.ACN generates the best ROA versus comparables, and more importantly, the ROA is growing. Versus competitors, ACN makes far better use of its assets to generate shareholder wealth.The 2nd chart compares Return On Equity (ROE). ROE is similar to ROA, but it measures total income as a percentage of shareholder equity. ROE demonstrates how well a company uses shareholders money to generate earnings growth.Net Income / Shareholders Equity = ROEOnce again, ACN is leading the pack, although lagging behind IBM. What is especially impressive about ACN's outperformance is that ACN is much larger than the consulting companies in the comparables group other than IBM, yet still operates more efficiently for shareholders. Below is a table of the market capitalizations of each firm.By both ROA and ROE metrics, ACN is among the best of the publicly traded firms.ValuationIt is clear that ACN is a world class operation, but owning a great company at an expensive price is not a recipe for investment success. Owning a great company at a good price is. ACN has rallied over 300% since inception, therefore the question is, is ACN currently available for a good price?Using the same comparables used during operations, I've compared ACN on 3 different valuation metrics.The 1st is a basic Price to Earnings Ratio (PE). Price to earnings is a good starting point, but I'm always cautious when using it as it is a lagging indicator. There are many examples of companies that seemed cheap on a PE basis, then the next round of earnings was released, making them expensive once again. One company that comes to mind where this was the case was BlackBerry (BBRY).On a PE basis, Accenture is not relatively expensive despite the impressive stock price history. In addition, earnings are to be released June 27th, and if they're strong, ACN could be even cheaper on a PE basis.The 2nd valuation measure is the Operating PE Ratio. This is similar to the standard PE ratio, but the earnings used exclude tax effects, non-operating income and expenses, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, preferred stock dividends and accounting change differences. It focuses on how well the company generates earnings operating and how much you pay for those earnings. Below is the formula.Market Capitalization / TTM Operating EarningsAlthough ACN is still reasonably priced by this metric, it is by no means cheap. It is also trading closer to the top of its range, perhaps indicating that now is not the best time to buy. Once again, June 27th earnings are just around the corner, so a strong number could make ACN a great value again.The last valuation metric utilized is Enterprise Value to Free Cash Flow. Enterprise value is the hypothetical takeover price excluding goodwill, such as the value of the branding, using just market capitalization, debt and cash to determine the value of the company. Free cash flows have the same benefits as using operational income numbers, as there is no manipulating cash in the bank.Enterprise Value = Market Capitalization + Debt - CashEnterprise to Free Cash Flow Ratio = Enterprise Value / Free Cash FlowBy this measure, once again ACN appears to be reasonably priced. It is trading at the higher end of its range, but versus competitors it appears fairly valued.Accenture Is A BuyACN outperforms competitors across a variety of operational metrics, yet is still valued competitively. This makes ACN a great addition to a portfolio. In addition, the 2% dividend is fantastic in a world of 0% interest rates. Even if you miss the bottom in the pullback in stock prices that began this month, you are earning far more on your cash than if you kept it in your bank account. And with earnings tomorrow at the time of this writing, the valuation may be even better in 24hrs.With ACN, you are not buying a great company at an expensive price, but a great company at a good price. This is a recipe for investing success.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in ACN over the next 72 hours.

As the stock has nearly doubled, the buybacks have stalled leaving the company with less bang for the investment.As one of the world's leading management consulting, technology services and outsourcing organizations has seen earnings nearly double in the last few years, the stock has seen strong gains.The company, though, hasn't been able to increase the buyback amount and in fact spent less in fiscal year 2012 versus 2011. All signs that the insiders with the best information might consider the stock price expensive.Q1 2013 Earnings HighlightsThe company reported the following highlights for the Q1 2013 earnings report:The company slightly beat analysts' earnings estimates of $1.04 by $0.02. The revenue guidance going forward though disappointed the market. A big concern is that revenue only grew 2% during Q1.Net Payout YieldsThe company was a strong net payout yields stock back in 2011 as the buybacks comprised a higher percentage of the outstanding shares. During Q1 the company bought 3.3M shares for a total of $221M. The company has $4.05B remaining on the share repurchase plan suggesting the company sees limited value if it only utilized 5% of that authorization amount. The dividend yield remains a solid 2.3%.The net payout yield comprises the dividend yield and the net stock buyback yield. As with dividend yields, a high yield suggests the stock might have an attractive value.The below chart highlights the buybacks by quarter compared to the share price:ACN data by YChartsAs the chart shows, the buyback amounts have remained flat while the stock continues to surge.Stock PriceThe stock hit a double top at just over $70 this week. It snapped back on Thursday after an initial plunge to $66 to close at $69. The stock has had a solid return over the last two years leading to the possibility of a peak.6-Month Chart - AccentureConclusionThe company announced the expectations of spending $3.3B on returning cash to shareholders in 2013, yet it only spent a meager $221M on buybacks during Q1. A net payout yield over 7% would be very solid, but the current level of buybacks suggests the stock price in the upper $60s was too expensive for the company to buy.Investors might want to pass on this stock for now until more attractive entry levels present itself in 2013.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1317751,46941,2013-04-03T11:49:45-04:00,,"For years companies outsourced their back offices to India to save costs and eliminate employee headcounts. Now companies are realizing that the only benefit is the low costs and there are no value-added services. As the Indian IT companies lose market share, look for Accenture (NYSE: ACN) to continue to gain market share.Accenture offers management consulting, technology and business process outsourcing services worldwide. In other words, the company is the ultimate solution architect. If you have a problem, chances are Accenture offers a solution. That's what the Indian companies are missing. They can code a program for a problem when given the solution, but they can't develop the solution whereas Accenture can.Strength Lies In Accenture's EmployeesAccenture has 259,000 employees that bring in an average of over $116,000 in revenue compared to Infosys (NASDAQ: INFY) that delivers only $48,000 per employee and has only 155,000 employees. Currently only 70 percent of Infosys staff are deployed on billable projects whereas Accenture has all of its staff deployed on projects.Indian companies rely on Indian universities to recruit cost-effective talent. Accenture on the other hand is recruiting the smartest and brightest from Wharton, Harvard and other Ivy League schools.Attractive ValuationAccenture looks attractive from a valuation standpoint. The company is trading at 17.88 times earnings and has $5.64 billion in cash with no debt. The current annual dividend is $1.62 for a yield of 2.1% and a payout ratio of 38 percent. In terms of management effectiveness, the return on equity is an impressive 61.32 percent.Diamond ClientsFor Accenture, a diamond client is one that spends more than $100 million annually with the company. For fiscal year 2012, the company ended the year with 125 diamond clients, up from 100 in 2010. The closest Indian competitor, Tata Consultancy, has just 16 of these clients.Steady PerformanceThe stock has just been a steady winner. Accenture has climbed from a 52-week low of $54.94 to a high of $78.46. The stock is up 18.98% in one year. Furthermore, in the past seven years, Accenture has returned $15.3 billion to shareholders in the form of repurchases and dividends. Look for that to continue as management has a history of avoiding capital-intensive projects and opting to return cash to shareholders.Growth In The CloudAccenture realized in 2007 that future software growth was in cloud computing. The company has successfully partnered with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), SAP (NYSE:SAP), Workday (NYSE:WDAY) and NetSuite (NYSE:N) to harness an effective cloud computing strategy for clients. Clients are able to have all their software services handled by one company and that's why they choose Accenture.Second-Quarter ResultsSecond-quarter results for the company came in strong. Revenues increased 4% in both U.S. dollar terms and local currency to $7.1 billion. New bookings came in at $9.1 billion, which comprised record consulting bookings of $4.4 billion and outsourcing bookings of $4.7 billion. Operating margins came in at 13.3%, an increase of 20 basis points. Net income for the quarter was $1.19 billion, compared to $714 million in the second quarter last year. On a breakdown per region, revenues for the Americas came in at $3.28 billion, Europe, Middle East and Africa at $2.80 billion, and Asia-Pacific at $978 million.Focus For The Company Is Growing Revenues In Asia-Pacific RegionAccording to Accenture, less than a third of large Asian companies are able to meet their revenue and profit expectations for their international businesses. The report commissioned by Accenture stated that 61 percent lacked an understanding of overseas customers and markets. Thirty-five percent cited their company's weak brand or reputation as their biggest problem.Accenture has identified key points that Asian companies must focus on:Being clear about their purpose for expansion to prevent conflicting strategies; then ensuring resources and capabilities are aligned to those corporate objectives.Differentiating offerings in overseas markets based on deep understanding of customers and localized marketing and product development activities. Both social media and data analysis tools play an important role for success.Building efficient and flexible operations with a focus on scalability and the ability to react to dynamic and volatile environments.Putting in place the talent, leadership and cultures for global growth, which may involve role rotations, offshore placements, cross-cultural training and enhanced internal communications.Accenture is positioning itself in the Asia-Pacific region to help Asian companies grow in international markets. Accenture has moved many of its key executives to the region to grow its consulting business. Accenture realizes that its future diamond customers are found in the Asia-Pacific region.Positioned For Long-Term Corporate GrowthBesides IBM (NYSE:IBM), no other company in the IT space offers the range and depth of product services. Accenture has the strongest relationships with its customers in the IT services business. These days companies rely on a company like Accenture that can deliver. Accenture's reputation lies in fulfilling all the client's needs. It's this basis that hurts the Indian IT services companies the most and why Accenture is poised to gain more market share.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth™ Line (orange line with white triangles) is correlated with the historical stock price line. On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem. If the stock price strays away from the earnings line (over or under), inevitably it will come back to earnings.Earnings & Price Correlated Fundamentals-at-a-GlanceA quick glance at the historical earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs™ on Accenture shows a picture of in-value based upon the historical earnings growth rate of 17.3% and a current P/E of 17.6. Analysts are forecasting the earnings growth to continue at about 11.5%, and when you look at the forecasting graph below, the stock appears in-value (it's inside of the value corridor of the five orange lines - based on future growth).Accenture: Historical Earnings, Price, Dividends and Normal P/E Since 2003Performance Table AccentureThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph, validates the principles regarding the two components of total return: capital appreciation and dividend income. Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid, but not reinvested.When presented separately like this, the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident. In addition to the 14.8% capital appreciation (green circle), long-term shareholders of Accenture, assuming an initial investment of $1,000, would have received an additional $274.91 in dividends (blue highlighting) that increased their total return from 14.8% to 15.6% per annum versus 6.7% in the S&P 500.The following graph plots the historical P/E ratio (the dark blue line) in conjunction with 10-year Treasury note interest. Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as normal as it has been since 2003.A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company's current P/S ratio relative to its historical P/S ratio. The current P/S ratio for Accenture is 1.52 which is historically high.Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long-term returns are a function of two critical determinants:1. The rate of change (growth rate) of the company's earnings.2. The price or valuation you pay to buy those earnings.Forecasting future earnings growth, bought at sound valuations, is the key to safe, sound and profitable performance.The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities. Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions.The consensus of 19 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Accenture's long-term earnings growth at 11.5% (orange circle). Accenture has no long-term debt at 0% of capital (red circle). Accenture is currently trading at a P/E of 17.6, which is inside the value corridor (defined by the five orange lines) of a maximum P/E of 18. If the earnings materialize as forecast, based upon forecasted earnings growth of 11.5%, Accenture's share price would be $108.73 at the end of 2018 (brown circle on EYE Chart), which would represent a 9.8% annual rate of total return which includes dividends paid (yellow highlighting).Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows: All companies derive their value from the future cash flows (earnings) they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time. Therefore, because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run, we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay.Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments, it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds. Comparing an investment in Accenture to an equal investment in 10-year Treasury bonds illustrates that Accenture's expected earnings would be 5.9 (purple circle) times that of the 10-year T-bond interest (see EYE chart below).

Furthermore, this Zacks No. 2 Rank  (Buy) has a solid dividend yield of 2.30% after the customary dividend  hike to $1.62 per share.Accenture Reports Fourth QuarterOn Sept. 27, 2012, Accenture reported fourth-quarter earnings of 88  cents per share, which matched the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Revenue  increased 2.2% year over year to $6.84 billion, supported by growth in  the Financial Services and Health and Public Services segments,  partially offset by lackluster growth in the Communications, Media and  Technology segment.During the quarter, solid growth in Outsourcing revenue mitigated the  shortfall in Consulting revenue. Geographically, Asia-Pacific and the  Americas performed well.Positive Outlook for First Quarter and Fiscal 2013 After considering a 3.0% negative foreign-exchange impact, Accenture  expects net revenue between $7.1 billion and $7.35 billion for its  fiscal first quarter, reflecting a 3.8%-7.5% sequential increase. The  company did not provide a first-quarter update on earnings per share.For fiscal 2013, management expects net revenue to grow 5.0% to 8.0%.  Diluted earnings per share (NYSEARCA:EPS) are expected between $4.22 and $4.30,  compared to $3.84 recorded in fiscal 2012.The Zacks Consensus Estimate rose over the last 30 days on the basis of  the positive earnings guidance.

Earnings per share fell just three cents to $0.88 per share, as the company repurchased for $2.1 billion in shares over the past year. Earnings beat analysts consensus by a penny.For the full year of 2012, revenues rose 9% to $27.9 billion, up 11% on a constant currency basis. Diluted earnings per share rose by 13% to $3.84.CEO Pierre Naterme commented on the results:Segmental InformationConsulting revenues fell 4% on the quarter to $3.74 billion.

On average, analysts expected Accenture to guide for annual earnings of $4.17 per share.ValuationAccenture ended its fourth quarter with $6.6 billion in cash and equivalents. The company operates without the assumption of debt, for a comfortable net cash position.For the full year of 2012, Accenture generated annual revenues of $27.9 billion. The company net earned $2.8 billion, or $3.84 per diluted share. After the 7% jump on Friday, the market values the firm at $48.2 billion. This values the operating assets at $41.6 billion.As such the market values Accenture at 1.5 times annual revenues and 15 times 2012s annual earnings. Currently, Accenture pays a semi-annual dividend of $0.81 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 2.3%.Investment ThesisYear to date, shares of Accenture have risen some 32%. Shares rose from their low fifties in January to $66 in March of the year, after Accenture gave an upbeat outlook for the third quarter. Shares fell back to $55 during the summer, but rose to new all-time highs of $70 on the back of the strong results on Friday.Over the past five years, shares have risen some 75%. Shares steadily rose from lows of $27 in 2009 to $70 in 2012. Between 2009 and 2012, Accenture grew its revenues from $23.2 billion to $29.8 billion. Net income rose from $1.6 billion to $2.6 billion over the same period. Earnings per share rose from $2.44 to $3.84, as Accenture retired roughly 8% of its shares outstanding over the time period.I think shares are reasonably fairly valued. The company has a very strong balance sheet, yet it has not shown much interest in making large acquisitions or significantly boost its dividend yield. The company did spend $2.1 billion on share repurchases over the past year.With shares trading at all time highs, I see few triggers for further gains in the short run. A significant dividend increase or large acquisition, could propel shares higher in the short run. Despite the very strong balance sheet, I suspect both scenarios are not very likely in the near term. Accenture has demonstrated that it favors share repurchase programs over large dividend increases in the past.I stay on the sidelines for now. I will wait for a significant pullback in the shares, and watch how the company makes use of its strong balance sheet.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

894021,36121,2012-09-28T09:37:45-04:00,,"Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) reported fiscal fourth quarter and full-year results yesterday for the period ended August 31, 2012, beating market expectations. The company also issued a forecast for the coming fiscal year that topped Wall Street's estimates. Accenture reported its results after the market closed, but its stock ended the regular session up $1.03, or 1.6%, to $65.28. After the market digested the Q4 and full year FY2012 financial results and management's outlook for the coming year, Accenture's stock jumped $2.63, or 4.0%, in after-markets trading to $68.01.I have been long Accenture's stock for many years and believe the stock is a compelling long-term hold for any investor. I list below several reasons why I own the stock and why I believe the company will continue to perform well in the future.Large, Global, Diversified and Scalable BusinessAccenture is a global management consulting, technology services and outsourcing company, with 257,000 employees serving clients in more than 120 countries. Accenture is diversified by work type, geography, and industry segment. In terms of work type, Consulting constitutes 56% of the company's net revenues, with Outsourcing comprising the remaining 44%. In terms of geography, net revenues are divided amongst the Americas (45.0%), Europe/Middle East/Africa (40.5%), and Asia Pacific (14.5%). Although Asia Pacific represents its smallest geography, it also represents the company's fastest growing region, with 18% revenue growth in FY2012 in local currency terms (versus 13% growth in the Americas and 8% growth in EMEA). Lastly, Accenture operates through five industry operating segments, including Communications/Media/Technology (21% of revenues), Financial Services (21% of revenues), Health & Public Service (15% of revenues), Products (24% of revenues) and Resources (19% of revenues).Very few companies have the breadth and depth of capabilities, global reach and scale, and relationships within the c-suite to compete with Accenture. Accenture is able to win substantial contracts with large multinational companies where small or mid-sized consulting and technology firms cannot compete. For example, Accenture's capabilities and scale allowed the company to win bookings of over $100 million at 11 different clients in FY2012.Any sort of change creates opportunities for Accenture to provide its services to clients. Regardless of whether overall business conditions are good or bad, Accenture is able to identify ways to help clients improve their performance. Clients struggling with the demands of globalization, regulation, cost cutting, growth and innovation, or technological change will all turn to Accenture for their needs.Strong and Growing Free Cash Flow GenerationAccenture generates significant free cash flow due to its robust operating margins and low capital requirements. As a result, the company is able to convert a very high percentage of its EBITDA into free cash flow. In FY2012, free cash flow (defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) was $3.9 billion, or 78% of EBITDA of $5.0 billion. Free cash flow of $3.9 billion was approximately $400 million above the top end of management's previous guidance. The company has been able to grow its earnings and cash flow at a level substantially above revenue growth. In the last five years, Accenture has grown net revenue by 4.5% per year, while free cash flow has grown 11.8% per year, demonstrating the considerable scale and operating leverage inherent in its business.Pristine, Fortress-like Balance SheetAccenture has a remarkably strong balance sheet with over $6.6 billion of cash as of August 31, 2012 and no material debt. Accenture's robust liquidity position provides the company with the financial flexibility to make small acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through regular open-market share repurchases and semi-annual cash dividends.Returning Cash to ShareholdersAccenture returned more than $3 billion to shareholders in FY2012 through a combination of share repurchases ($2.1 billion) and cash dividends ($950 million). That represented a slight increase from FY2011 when the company returned $2.8 billion to shareholders through $2.1 billion of share repurchases and $644 million of cash dividends.Accenture announced an increase to its semi-annual cash dividend to $0.81 per share, a 20% increase over its previous semi-annual cash dividend of $0.675 per share. Based on its current share price and an annualized cash dividend of $1.62 per share, Accenture's cash dividend yield is 2.5%.Accenture's total remaining share repurchase authority at August 31, 2012 was approximately $4.2 billion (roughly 1% of shares outstanding at the current stock price).Strong Outlook with Extraordinary VisibilityAccenture's management provided favorable guidance for FY2013 (above consensus estimates). The company expects net revenue growth in the range of 5-8% in local currency terms. Fully diluted EPS is expected to be in the range of $4.22-4.30, an increase of 10-12% over diluted EPS of $3.84 in FY2012. Operating margin for FY2013 is projected to be in the range of 14.0-14.1%, an expansion of 10 to 20 basis points over FY2012 operating margin. Cash flow from operations is expected to be in the range of $3.2-3.5 billion, with property and equipment additions of $420 million, resulting in free cash flow of $2.8-3.1 billion. Lastly, the company is targeting new bookings for fiscal 2013 in the range of $31-$34 billion.The company achieved record new bookings of $9.2 billion for the fourth quarter of FY2012, bringing the full year total to $32.2 billion, which was $1.2 billion above the top end of the company's guided range. This record high level of new bookings provides extraordinary visibility to the company's near-term outlook and financial performance.Current ValuationAt its current stock price of $65.38, Accenture has a market capitalization of $45.0 billion and a total enterprise value of $38.9 billion. Based on its FY2012 financial performance, Accenture trades at 1.4x net revenues, 8.7x EBITDA, and 17.6x net income. In addition, the company sports a 8.6% free cash flow. Accenture has performed at a high and consistent level for many years, and the strength of its management team and global scale of its business justify a premium valuation to its peer group. Most Wall Street analysts have a price target on Accenture's stock in the high $60s to mid-$70s based on applying a 16-17x earnings multiple to FY2013 EPS ranging from $4.35-4.41. Overall, I believe Accenture's stock is fairly valued in the high $60s and represents a good long-term buy at this price. I would add to my holdings if the stock were to pull back to the low $60s and add substantially more in the $50s.Disclosure: I am long ACN.

893891,27231,2012-09-28T08:57:36-04:00,,"On September 27th Accenture (NYSE:ACN) reported its EPS after the close of trading. We saw that the company was able to overcome a weak macroeconomic environment during the Q4 2012 period and it recorded positive revenue growth of 2% in U.S. dollars and 9% in constant currency versus the prior year's comparable period. This was driven by continued strength in its outsourcing business and stable results in its consulting business. With the exception of weakness in its Financial Services Operating Group, Accenture saw strong operating income growth in its industry operating groups during the FY 2012 period. During the Q4 2012 period, the FSG overcame its declines in operating income achieved earlier in the year to generate the strongest operating income growth in Q4 2012, which offset weakness in the Health & Public Service operating group and the Communications, Media & Technology operating group. We previously entered into a long position earlier in the month and the results that Accenture posted have validated our conviction in the company.Corporate HighlightsAccenture saw its Q4 revenue increase by 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter in reported U.S. dollar terms. We were cognizant of the fact that the strong U.S. dollar has been negatively impacting the results of multinational corporations and while Accenture was not immune to this, we were pleased that the company saw its revenue grow by 9% in local constant currency terms in the quarter. All three of its geographic regions saw at least 8% revenue growth in constant currency terms for the quarter. EPS declined by 3.3% due to a $57.5M tax charge due to the change in the geographic mix of income. For FY 2012 the company generated $27.9B in revenue versus $25.5B in 2011. Negative currency headwinds resulted in a 2% negative impact to the company's 2012 revenue. EPS for FY 2012 grew by 13.3% due to a 12% increase in net income and a reduction in shares outstanding. (Click to enlarge)Source: Accenture's Q4 2012 Earnings ReleaseBusiness Segment OverviewAccenture's Consulting Division's revenues were $3.74B and declined by 4% in U.S. dollars and increased by 2% in constant currency terms in Q4 2012 versus Q4 2011. The Consulting Division generated $4.3B in new bookings for the quarter and this represented 46% of the company's new bookings. For the year, the division saw $15.6B in revenues, an increase of 4% in U.S. dollars and 6% in constant currency terms versus 2011. New bookings were $16.6B for the year and the division saw soft financial performance in Q3 and Q4 2012 due to the challenging economic environment.Accenture's Outsourcing Division's revenues reached $3.1B and increased by 10% in U.S. dollars and 18% in constant currency terms in Q4 2012 versus Q4 2011. The Consulting Division generated $4.9B in new bookings for the quarter and this represented 54% of the company's new bookings. For the year, the division saw $12.3B in revenues, an increase of 16% in U.S. dollars and 19% in constant currency terms versus 2011. New bookings were $15.6B for the year and the division saw continued strength and less volatility throughout the year in comparison to the Consulting Division.Source: Accenture's Q4 2012 Earnings ReleaseCorporate Asset ManagementAccenture continues to reward its shareholders by lavishing generous dividends and share repurchases net of employee stock issuance. In 2012, Accenture continues its ability to convert over 100% of its net income into free cash flows even when we take into consideration net acquisition costs. The only criticism we have about Accenture's liquidity position is that it is extremely liquid and has an ultra-ultra-ultra conservative financial profile in that its cash and cash equivalents represent 35% of the company's assets. The company's cash has risen from $3.3B in 2007 to $6.6B in 2012. We know that the company has incorporated as an Irish PLC in order to enjoy a lower corporate tax rate than the 35% plus state and local tax statutory rate it would face as a US domiciled corporation. Considering the tax ramifications of earnings repatriations and dividends, the one item of note that we would like to see increased clarity on is Accenture's cash holdings by geographic area.(Click to enlarge)Source: Accenture's Q4 2012 financial releaseAccenture spent nearly $640M in net share repurchases during the quarter and $1.644B for the year. Even though the company has increased the annualized per share dividend payments from $.30 in 2006 to $1.35 in 2012, the company still has an ultra-conservative balance sheet. Accenture's cash outlay of $951M for dividends in 2012 pales in comparison to its $6.6B cash position and unless there are issues with regards to jurisdictional taxation of earnings, profits and assets, we would have preferred to see Accenture increase its dividend more than the 20% that was announced recently. The company also has $30M in other liquid assets and $33K in interest bearing debt.(Click to enlarge)Source: Morningstar DirectCONCLUSIONIn conclusion, we're pleased with the performance of Accenture. We can see that it is a better performer in the outsourcing business than HP Services, Dell Services and Xerox ACS. We can also see that it is a stronger performer in the consulting business than its consulting peers. We believe Accenture will continue to shake off the weak macroeconomic environment in order to generate solid revenue and profit growth. We also expect the company to continue to rain cash on its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. For investors worried about the impact of the European debt crisis, the U.S. Fiscal Cliff and the slowdown in growth in the BRIC countries, we believe that such investors would sleep better at night with Accenture in their portfolio.Disclosure: I am long ACN.

897871,25791,2012-10-01T14:53:27-04:00,,"Accenture PLC (NYSE:ACN) recently reported its preliminary financial results based on which we provide a peer-based analysis of the company.Accenture PLC's analysis versus peers uses the following peer-set: IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM), SAP AG ADS (NYSE:SAP), Infosys Ltd. ADR (NYSE:INFY), Wipro Ltd. ADS (NYSE:WIT), Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. (NASDAQ:CTSH), Capgemini (CAP) and Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC). The table below shows the preliminary results along with the recent trend for revenues, net income and returns.Valuation DriversAccenture PLC's current Price/Book of 11.5 is about median in its peer group. Accenture PLC's operating performance is higher than the median of its chosen peers (ROE of 63.6% compared to the peer median ROE of 26.3%) but the market does not seem to expect higher growth relative to peers (PE of 18.2 compared to peer median of 17.7) but simply to maintain its relatively high rates of return.The company's net profit margins have been relatively poor (currently 8.6% vs. peer median of 14.5%) while its asset efficiency is better than the median (asset turns of 1.8x compared to peer median of 1.0x). This suggests a volume driven operating model relative to its peers. Accenture PLC's net margin is its highest relative to the last five years and compares to a low of 5.8% in 2007.Economic MoatThe company's top line performance is not as good as its peers (year-on-year change in revenue is 8.9%) but its earnings performance (12.1% change year-on-year) has been similar to the peer median. Unless the company maintains or improves this relative earnings growth, it is in danger of lagging its peers. Accenture PLC currently converts every 1% of change in revenue into 1.4% of change in annual reported earnings.Accenture PLC's return on assets currently is around peer median (15.8% vs. peer median 15.0%) -- similar to its returns over the past five years (14.7% vs. peer median 14.8%). This performance suggests that the company has no specific competitive advantages relative to its peers.The company's gross margin of 32.2% is around peer median suggesting that Accenture PLC's operations do not benefit from any differentiating pricing advantage. In addition, Accenture PLC's pre-tax margin is less than the peer median (13.1% compared to 18.7%) suggesting relatively high operating costs.Growth And Investment StrategyWhile Accenture PLC's revenues have grown faster than the peer median (8.7% vs. 7.1% respectively for the past three years), the market gives the stock an about peer median PE ratio of 18.2. This suggests that the market has some questions about the company's long-term strategy.Accenture PLC's annualized rate of change in capital of 12.8% over the past three years is around the same as its peer median of 15.6%. This investment has generated a better than peer median return on capital of 64.5% averaged over the same three years. The greater than peer median rate of return suggest that the company may be under investing in growth.Earnings QualityAccenture PLC reported relatively weak net income margins for the last twelve months (8.6% vs. peer median of 14.5%). This weak margin performance and relatively conservative accrual policy (5.7% vs. peer median of 1.8%) suggest the company might likely be understating its net income, possibly to the extent that there might even be some sandbagging of the reported net income numbers.Accenture PLC's accruals over the last twelve months are positive suggesting a buildup of reserves. In addition, the level of accrual is greater than the peer median -- which suggests a relatively strong buildup in reserves compared to its peers.Trend ChartsCompany ProfileAccenture Plc operates as an investment holding company with interest in providing management consulting, technology and outsourcing services. The company's business is structured around five operating groups, which together comprise nineteen industry groups serving clients in major industries around the world, namely, communications and high tech, financial services, health and public service, products and Rresources. The company was founded in 1989 and is headquartered in Dublin, Ireland.DisclaimerThe information presented in this report has been obtained from sources deemed to be reliable, but AnalytixInsight does not make any representation about the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of this information.

864121,27231,2012-09-13T03:24:48-04:00,,"We have been long attracted to Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) because it is the best-of-the-best of (IT) consulting firms. We previously compared it with the IT/BPO Services divisions of Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Dell Inc (NYSE:DELL) and Xerox Corporation (NYSE:XRX) and we found that Accenture simply outclassed HP Services, Dell Services and Xerox/Affiliated Computer Services. In this report, we will be giving Accenture stiffer competition than second-tier BPO firms by comparing it against International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Aon Corporation (NYSE:AON), Towers Watson (NASDAQ:TW) and Marsh & Mclennan Companies Inc. (NYSE:MMC). Even though Aon, Towers Watson and MMC are primarily human resources consulting firms, we have included these three because we have considered investing in those companies from time to time and there are not many consulting related companies available to compare Accenture with.Comparison of Accenture with Peer SampleOperating Margins: We were surprised that Accenture's operating margin was middle-of-the-pack in comparison to these three companies. Still, we can see that these companies generated healthy operating margins of 12-20% in the most recent quarter in spite of weak macroeconomic headwinds. IBM was able to generate a 20% operating margin because 24% of its revenue comes from software solutions, which generated an 88.4% gross margin in Q2 2011 and Q2 2012. Part of the reason why Marsh & McLennan has a higher gross margin than Accenture is because 56% of its revenue comes from risk services and insurance brokerage. That business generated a 23.6% operating margin in the most recent quarter on the strength of a 5% increase and strong expense containment.Source: MRQ Earnings Reports for Accenture, IBM, Aon, Towers Watson and Marsh Mc.Revenue Growth: Towards the end of August, our firm released our report in which we identified Accenture's strong and diversified business model. We were impressed with its revenue diversity by division, by geographic segment and by client group plus this diversity enabled the firm to generate strong revenue growth without resorting to blockbuster acquisitions. This compares favorably to Xerox, H-P and Dell as these companies got into the IT software and services segment through blockbuster acquisitions and these companies have had mixed results from the services business. In its most recent quarter, Accenture generated 6% revenue growth year-over-year in US Dollar terms and 9% in currency equivalent terms. This is stronger than the 5% growth from Xerox ACS (7% currency adjusted). Both Accenture and Xerox ACS outperformed Dell (1% revenue growth in USD) and HP Services (-1.27%).Source: MRQ Earnings Reports for Accenture, IBM, Aon, Towers Watson and Marsh Mc.Return on Equity: The next metric we are using to compare these firms is ROE. We find that IBM and Accenture have absolutely breathtaking ROEs of 77% and 68% respectively. Because Aon, Towers Watson and Marsh McLennan have been involved in major acquisitions over the years, those companies have significant levels of goodwill and other intangible assets sitting on the balance sheet and as such have lower levels of ROE. Accenture and IBM only have between 8-20% of each company's respective assets, represented by goodwill and intangible assets from acquisitions. IBM also utilizes debt for nearly 30% of its assets, compared to 3% for Accenture. Accenture also has cash and cash equivalents representing 36.4% of its assets, versus 15% for IBM. IBM does have over 31.5% of its assets in financing receivables though.Source: MRQ Earnings Reports for Accenture, IBM, Aon, Towers Watson and Marsh Mc.Price to Earnings Growth: While Accenture has the highest FY 2013 PE of the peer sample at 16X FY 2013 EPS, Accenture also has the best record of EPS growth of 15% over the last eight years. Accenture had the second best PEG ratio at 0.99, trailing only Towers Watson at 0.91.Source: MRQ Earnings Reports for Accenture, IBM, Aon, Towers Watson and Marsh Mc.ConclusionIn conclusion, Accenture is an undervalued, industry-leading best-of-breed blue chip professional services and consulting firm. Despite facing global macroeconomic challenges, we see Accenture continuing to put up solid financial and operating performance. In our previous report, we found that it is a much stronger company than three notable IT/BPO Services companies that have been acquired by large hardware companies (XRX, HPQ and DELL). In this report, as we have outlined, we could see that Accenture is truly the best of the best amongst general business and IT consultants. We love asset-light firms that have strong liquidity and free cash flow generation and we can see that Accenture gives us a light to like. We believe that investors should take advantage of market weakness to enter into or add to their position in Accenture.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

957831,24491,2012-10-29T01:32:53-04:00,,"Dividend growth investing is lots of fun, especially if you have a systematic methodology to determining which companies' dividends are safe and which ones' aren't. That is why we created a forward-looking assessment of dividend safety in our innovative, predictive dividend-cut indicator, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. In this article, let's evaluate the investment merits of Accenture's (NYSE:ACN), as well as its dividend under this unique but yet very straightforward framework.Investment ConsiderationsReturn on Invested CapitalAccenture's DividendFor starters, we encourage readers to view President of Equity Research Brian Nelson's video on why using cash flow analysis to assess a dividend is very important: ""Part XVI: How to Assess the Safety of a Company's Dividend."" Accenture's dividend yield is above average, offering just over a 2% annual payout at recent price levels. We prefer yields above 3% and don't include firms with yields below 2% in our dividend growth portfolio. So Accenture falls in the middle ground right now. But will it always stay there?We think the safety of Accenture's dividend is excellent (please see our definitions at the bottom of this article). We measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate in any given year, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges, which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend in any given year. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying these cash outlays well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Valuentum Dividend Cushion™ (click here for more information). The measure is a ratio that sums the existing cash a company has on hand plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends. As income investors, however, we'd like to see a score much larger than 1 for a couple reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future. The Valuentum Dividend Cushion has warned investors in advance of dividend cuts, as in this example here.For Accenture , this score is 3.7, revealing that on its current path the firm can cover its future dividends with net cash on hand and future free cash flow. We also use our dividend cushion as a key decision component in choosing companies for addition to the portfolio of our Dividend Growth Newsletter (please see our links on the left sidebar for more information).Now on to the potential growth of Accenture's dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity it has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. As such, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in 10 years, the company has a nice growth rate, and a nice dividend cushion, its future potential dividend growth would be excellent, which is the case for Accenture. The firm has a solid cash flow profile.And because capital preservation is also an important consideration, we assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss (offering investors a complete picture). In Accenture's case, we currently think the shares are fairly valued, so the risk of capital loss medium. For a read on how we calculate the intrinsic value of Accenture, please click here. If we thought the shares were undervalued, the risk of capital loss would be low.All things considered, we like the potential growth and safety of Accenture's dividend, but the yield is still a bit low for us. We'd wait for a dividend increase or a pullback in the shares to consider it in our income portfolio. However, it is certainly worthy of the income investor's watch list.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

849041,27231,2012-09-06T02:02:36-04:00,,"We have been long attracted to Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) because it is an industry-leading, best-of-breed professional services firm. We remember the old Accenture Tiger Woods advertising campaign and it spelled out its three key services: Consulting, Technology and Outsourcing at the end of the commercial. We like that Accenture has built itself into a worldwide leader in outsourcing services and IT consulting solutions, and because the company stock price is nearly 10% off its all-time high, we believe that Accenture is an undervalued industry leader, as well as a best-of-breed firm.We also believe that Accenture is a better investment opportunity than Hewlett-Packard Co. (NYSE:HPQ), Dell Inc. (DELL-OLD), and Xerox Corporation (NYSE:XRX). We are aware that these three companies have a long heritage in IT and business office equipment hardware. We are also aware that these companies have made blockbuster acquisitions of IT Services and Solutions companies, albeit of a more routine Business Process Outsourcing manner. We had actually considered adding Xerox to our portfolio, but we were unimpressed with its performance since it acquired Affiliated Computer Services in 2010. In this comparison, we are comparing Accenture against the applicable software and services divisions of HPQ, DELL and XRX.Comparison of Accenture with Peer SampleAccenture generates all of its revenue from its consulting, technology and outsourcing services and solutions. However, we noticed that HPQ, DELL and XRX have each generated a significant portion of revenue from services due to acquisitions of BPO companies. HPQ acquired Electronic Data Services (which was founded by Ross Perot in 1962) in 2008; Dell acquired Perot Systems (which Ross Perot founded in 1988 after leaving GM) in 2009, and Xerox acquired ACS (which was founded in 1988 by Perot acolyte Darwin Deason) in 2010. We see that Xerox generates 51% of its revenue from BPO Services in the most recent quarter, while HPQ gets 32% from software and services and Dell gets 21% from software and services.Click to enlargeSources: Most Recent Quarterly Earnings Releases for Accenture, Xerox, H-P and DellWe also find that Accenture has a higher operating margin that the three companies we are comparing it to because Accenture has a Management Consulting and IT Consulting practice in addition to its IT/BPO Outsourcing services. These services enable it to enjoy a higher operating margin in comparison with the three peer competitors because these companies are primarily involved in low-margin BPO services.Sources: Most Recent Quarterly Earnings Releases for Accenture, Xerox, H-P and DellTowards the end of August, our firm released our report in which we identified Accenture's strong and diversified business model. We were impressed with its revenue diversity by division, by geographic segment and by client group, plus this diversity enabled the firm to generate strong revenue growth without resorting to blockbuster acquisitions. This compares favorably to Xerox, H-P and Dell, as these companies got into the IT software and services segment through blockbuster acquisitions and these companies have had mixed results from the services business. In its most recent quarter, Accenture generated 6% revenue growth year-over-year in US Dollar terms and 9% in currency equivalent terms. This is stronger than the 5% growth from Xerox ACS (7% currency adjusted). Both Accenture and Xerox ACS outperformed Dell (1% revenue growth in USD) and HP Services (-1.27%).Sources: Most Recent Quarterly Earnings Releases for Accenture, Xerox, H-P and DellAccenture's Corporate Asset ManagementDividends: We love companies that generate strong free cash flows and that's one reason why we like Accenture. Accenture initiated its dividend in October 2005, with an annual dividend of $.30 per share. In April 2010, it switched its dividend payment to a semi-annual payment structure and its dividend growth has not skipped a beat. Accenture's annualized dividend has increased from $.30 in FY2006 to $1.35 in FY 2012.Source: Accenture's Investor Toolkit WebsiteShare Repurchases: Since its 2001 IPO, Accenture has been a buyback champion. The company has bought back nearly $14B in shares during this time period based on $20.3B in gross share repurchases and $6.5B in stock issuance for employee compensation programs. Since 2004, Accenture has seen its diluted shares outstanding decline by 27% from 2004 to 2012.Source: Morningstar DirectLiquidity Position: Because Accenture is a professional services business that relies on strong human intelligence resources, it is not a capital-intensive business that requires the company to significantly reinvest its cash flows in order to maintain its operations. We can see it in its balance sheet even though ACN's shareholders' equity only accounts for 26.4% of its assets. We see that although the company has $11.43B in liabilities, over 95% of these liabilities are non-interest bearing sources of business-operations working capital. The company only has three sources of financial capital liabilities that have an explicit or implicit cost of capital and those sources are as follows:Source: Accenture's Q2 2012 10-QIn conclusion, Accenture is an undervalued, industry-leading, best-of-breed blue chip professional services firm. Despite facing global macroeconomic challenges, we see Accenture continuing to put up solid financial and operating performance. We see that it is a much stronger company than three notable IT/BPO Services companies that have been acquired by large hardware companies (XRX, HPQ and DELL). We love asset-light firms that have strong liquidity and free cash flow generation and we can see that Accenture gives us a light to like. We believe that investors should take advantage of market weakness to enter into or add to their position in Accenture. In our next report, we will be comparing it against IBM and other consulting firms.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

894321,32121,2012-09-28T11:11:24-04:00,,"Since we last wrote about Accenture on June 25th, 2012, the stock price has appreciated over 22% compared to the 10.4% increase in the S&P 500. We are still bullish.Yesterday, Accenture reported better than expected earnings and increased its full year forecast ending in August to between $4.22 and $4.30 per share. New bookings reached $32.2 billion, a new record, and the company also increased its dividend to $0.81 per share. That's a 2.4% dividend yield at today's price with the possibility of further increases and continued share buybacks. Last year alone, Accenture repurchased over $3 billion worth of their outstanding shares.What makes us really bullish on the stock, however, is the increase in outsourcing, which tends to have much longer duration and a more predictable revenue stream. As the company continues to grow this segment of the business and smoothing its revenue, the business becomes much more predictable and manageable. And while consulting projects tend to be much shorter than outsourcing engagements, making revenue choppy, the icing on the cake on our conviction is that its consulting business reported longer projects with longer duration.The longer consulting projects confirm our view that companies are still flush with cash and in a slow growth environment, will look to streamline processes, improve efficiencies, and generally reduce operating expenses.As a technology driven stock, it has incredible upside potential. Our last price target was $82 and we are in the process of updating our model. But as a dividend paying stock, it may be the most attractive technology stock with price appreciation potential AND an increasing dividend.Cash flow continues to increase, reaching a record $3.9 billion while operating margins expanded further to 13.9%.We still think the stock is cheap and may provide the best of both worlds … price appreciation and dividend growth. For a technology stock, that puts in a very small group.Disclosure: I am long ACN. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

733921,24491,2012-07-19T15:55:19-04:00,,"As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In Accenture's (NYSE:ACN) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $59 per share, near where it is currently trading.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for more info on our methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Accenture posts a VBI score of 3 on our scale, reflecting our ""fairly valued"" DCF assessment, neutral relative valuation vs. peers, and bearish technicals. We use Amdocs (NASDAQ:DOX), IHS, Inc. (IHS), Informatica (NASDAQ:INFA), and Verint (NASDAQ:VRNT) for our peer group analysis.Our Report on AccentureClick to enlarge images.Investment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsAccenture earns a ValueCreation™ rating of Excellent, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. We expect the firm's return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) to expand to 151.2% from 140.7% during the next two years.The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. If the firm's share price fell below $44, we'd take a closer look.Accenture has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 11% in coming years. Total debt to EBITDA was zero last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 0.1%.The firm's share price performance has trailed that of the market during the past quarter. However, it is trading within our fair value estimate range, so we don't view such activity as alarming.The firm sports a very nice dividend yield of 2.2%. We expect the firm to pay out about 35% of next year's earnings to shareholders as dividends. However, we're not considering the firm for addition to the portfolio in our Dividend Growth Newsletter as we think there are better dividend-growth gems out there.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Accenture's three-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 134.3%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of Excellent. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Accenture's free cash flow margin has averaged about 12.5% during the past three years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively strong. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Accenture, cash flow from operations decreased about 2% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 66% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Accenture's shares are worth between $44.00 - $74.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's Medium ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $59 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 19.2 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 9.5 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 5.6% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's three-year historical compound annual growth rate of 2.6%. Our model reflects a five-year projected average operating margin of 13.9%, which is above Accenture's trailing three-year average. Beyond year five, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.2% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Accenture, we use a 10.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $59 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Accenture. We think the firm is attractive below $44 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $74 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Accenture's fair value at this point in time to be about $59 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Accenture's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in year three represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $76 per share in year three represents our existing fair value per share of $59 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

681591,32121,2012-06-25T10:10:06-04:00,,"With so many companies flush with cash and continued uncertainty about growth prospects, companies tend to look for ways to reduce costs. One way to do this is to develop efficiencies within technology and information systems, including the possibility of outsourcing of certain functions to lower-wage countries.Herein lies Accenture, at the focal point of a business strategy that continues to gain traction and will only accelerate in an environment where corporate revenue growth has such murky visibility.Accenture (NYSE:ACN) is a global leader in providing comprehensive consulting and technology services to clients around the globe. It has both the geographic breadth and depth of both industry and business process expertise to lead change in organizations that are looking to become the best in their respective industries. It doesn't matter what industry, as Accenture has 17 focused industry groups, with expertise not only along industry lines, but functional lines as well. In my opinion, there is no other company that can offer the scope of services that Accenture can offer from 200 offices in 53 countries around the world.The reason we are so positive on ACN is because they are consistently at the forefront of secular trends in globalization, mobility, and cloud computing, among others. They already have a pipeline of several billion dollars in a segment of the business that can reach $50B, and are one of the premier business process outsourcing firms in the world.In their latest earnings report, Accenture reported bookings growth of 14% year over year within consulting, and 22% growth in outsourcing. While much of the consulting growth was driven by supply-chain cost savings and business transformation, the more exciting prospects are in outsourcing, with multi-year contracts and predictable revenue streams. For corporations in transition, outsourcing offers them the capability to migrate to a variable cost structure that will smooth out margins even when sales growth is slow.Financially, the company has no long-term debt, a current ratio over 1.5, and free cash flow of $3.6B. And another plus, the stock pays a dividend of over 2%. With operating margins slowly expanding to a recent level of 13%+, ACN is well positioned for any pullback in tech spending over the short-term and while it is a volatile stock, the dividend and financial position will provide a nice cushion if markets turn south.Not only do we like the story, we also like the valuation. Accenture is currently trading at a discount to its 5-year average price earnings, price to book, and price to cash flow. The consensus price estimate on Bloomberg is $69.28, but we think the company has an intrinsic value of $82, calculated using our proprietary methodology.In the short term, we do see some risks. Namely, the possibility of reduced spending by corporations during times of uncertainty and slower growth. But we think this risk is mitigated by the fact that companies are awash with cash and understand that in a slow growth environment, the only way to grow earnings is to reduce costs. Other risks include the ability to attract and retain talent and the underperformance of outsourcing contracts. Regarding the talent issue, we feel that the current labor market situation is conducive to attracting adequate talent for reasonable costs. A situation that could worsen as the job market improves but which is currently very advantageous for 'picking the best'.The verdictAccenture is considered a technology company and though we disagree with that (Business Services is probably more appropriate), it is definitely driven by the same factors that drive technology spending and technology stocks. We feel strongly that they are well positioned for growth in this market environment and will be a nice addition to anyone's well diversified portfolio.Disclosure: I am long ACN."
462401,24236,2012-03-28T06:06:35-04:00,,"I met a couple of really sharp consultants the other day and asked who they worked for. When they said Accenture (NYSE:ACN), I wasn't surprised. I have worked with several Accenture consultants over the years and found them to be top quality, highly skilled consultants. As a business owner, I realized quickly that hiring quality personnel is the most important factor in ensuring a company's success.I am always on the lookout for investing ideas and decided to perform further due diligence on Accenture to determine if an investment opportunity exists. The results of my analysis revealed that Accenture is well positioned for future growth, fundamentally strong, has a loyal client base and employs top notch consultants. Please review the following reasons I am bullish on the name.Latest Performance Results Are StrongAccenture reported outstanding fiscal Q2 results last Thursday. The company beat the street's estimates on both EPS and revenue. EPS for its most recent fiscal year was $3.40, a gain of 28% from the previous year's EPS of $2.66. Accenture's EPS has increased nine out of the last ten years. The company has a very low debt level and generates an annual return on equity of 48.0%. The company raised its fiscal year 2012 EPS outlook to a range of $3.82 - $3.90, above analysts' estimates of $3.82. Accenture appears to be firing on all cylinders.A Market Leader With Strong Global PresenceAccenture is a global leader in management consulting with more than $25 billion in net revenue. Accenture clients include more than three-quarters of the Fortune Global 500. Nearly all of the company's top one hundred current clients are long term customers of over five years. Accenture operates in over 120 countries with more than 246,000 employees.Competitive AdvantageThe key advantage for Accenture is the quality of its people in my mind. Accenture is a well-respected company which attracts highly talented people. As an auditor for Ernst & Young, I was always impressed with the professionalism and thoroughness of the Accenture consultants I interacted with. The retention rate of the company's clients proves this out. Furthermore, Accenture is well-diversified geographically, giving it an edge over the competition. The depth and breadth of Accenture's reach provides the company with a virtually unmatched solutions knowledge base that is invaluable in the consulting business.CompetitorsAccenture's ability to stay on top is a testament to its excellence of execution. The competitive environment is intense. Regarding technology services, one of Accenture's main competitors is International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM). IBM's Global Services Business Unit is a top notch organization. Lesser competitors include Electronic Data Systems Corporation Electronic Data Systems (NASDAQ:EDS) and Computer Sciences (CSC). These companies are smaller, but not to be taken lightly.Accenture's outsourcing business has grown in significance for the company over time. Accenture's outsourcing competitors include Tata Consultancy Services Limited (NYSE:TCS) and Infosys Technologies (NYSE:INFY). Accenture is the top provider of outsourcing. Accenture has done a fantastic job attracting new clients and retaining existing clients. Furthermore, the company has managed to increase the scope of services with existing clients. The company is performing well in a fiercely competitive marketplace.Fortress Balance SheetAccenture generates high returns on equity which have averaged an outstanding 62% over the last five years. The company had no long-term debt and more than $5 billion in cash on the balance sheet as of February 29, 2012. In fiscal 2012, Accenture expects to generate strong free cash flow of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion. This is equivalent to an 8% free cash flow yield based on the company's current market capitalization. Accenture's stock price is up 20% year to date. ACN has a dividend yield of 2.1%, with a 5-year annual dividend growth rate of 31%. As an investor, these are very appealing statistics.Investor Focused ManagementAccenture has generated $13.6 billion in free cash flow, paid out $2.5 billion in dividends and repurchased $10.7 billion of stock over the past five years. The company just upped its annual dividend to $1.35 a share. The raise provided a nifty fifty percent dividend increase, bringing the current yield to 2.1%. Management plans to continue returning profits to shareholders through further share repurchases and dividend payments. Accenture has $5.5 billion authorized for future share repurchases. There is nothing I like better than a company focused on returning wealth to shareholders.ConclusionBased on the above facts, the accent on Accenture's future seems brighter than ever. The company is the market leader in its industry, has strong fundamentals, a fortress balance sheet and good prospects for future growth. Moreover, Accenture has handsomely rewarded faithful investors with dividend increases and share buybacks. With the market's recent run, I believe this stable blue chip stock with a beta of .8 provides a positive risk/reward scenario for long term investors.Use this information as a starting point for your own due diligence and research methods before determining whether or not to buy or sell a security. If you choose to start a position in any stock, I suggest layering in a quarter at a time on a weekly basis to reduce risk and setting a 5% trailing stop loss order to minimize losses.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in ACN over the next 72 hours."

On January 1, 2001, Accenture introduced their new name to the world when they became a public company. The company has spent the past decade building their brand, which has now become synonymous with their commitment to help clients achieve high performance.

During the same period, the company paid out $2.5 billion in dividends and repurchased $10.7 billion of stock. In fiscal 2012, Accenture expects to continue to generate strong free cash flow, which should be in the range of $3.1 billion to $3.4 billion. This is equivalent to an approximate 8% free cash flow yield based on the firm's current market capitalization.Management plans to return the majority of this cash to shareholders through further share repurchases and growing dividend payments. The company recently increased its dividend 50% to an annual rate of $1.35 per share with the dividend currently yielding a solid 2.3%. During the first fiscal quarter, Accenture repurchased 5.3 million shares for $285 million at an average price of $53.36 per share. $5.8 billion remains authorized for future share repurchases.HIGH RETURNS ON EQUITYAccenture's business model generates high returns on equity which have averaged an outstanding 62% over the last five years. This is even more impressive given that the company had no long-term debt and more than $5 billion in cash on the 8/31/11 year-end balance sheet. Accenture reported strong first quarter fiscal 2012 results as revenues increased 17% to $7.1 billion with EPS up 19% to $.96. This represented the company's highest quarterly revenue ever with double-digit local-currency growth in all five operating groups and all three geographic regions. New bookings for the quarter were $7.8 billion, with consulting bookings of $4.2 billion and outsourcing bookings of $3.6 billion. New bookings for the full fiscal 2012 year are targeted in the range of $28-$31 billion. Net revenue growth is expected in the range of 7%-10% for fiscal 2012 with EPS expected in the range of $3.76-$3.84, representing double-digit growth as operating margins expand.Long-term investors should consult Accenture, a high quality firm with a durable brand, strong free cash flows and high returns on equity.

378721,24714,2012-02-21T03:49:38-05:00,,"Accenture (NYSE:ACN) is a maturing consulting firm whose shares have a lot of upside potential. Characterized by strong dividend growth, strong relationships with top companies, and the ""recession-proof"" characteristics that business services firms carry, it can be a great addition to a portfolio as many analysts believe that a bear market is set to return.Accenture shares are up over 50 percent in the last 5 years and 9 percent in the past year. Its total dividends increased from 83 cents in 2010 to $1.13 in 2011. Going forward, dividends will most likely increase as the company's EPS is expected to go up 12.1 percent in the fiscal year ending in August 2012, and then increase by 10.5 percent in the next year. This is very solid growth for the business services industry and Accenture's stock price will probably increase at a rate at least as high as its expected earnings growth.Business services stocks are an important part of a diversified portfolio because of their low volatility and relatively predictable performance. Being a consulting firm, most of Accenture's revenue is generated from long term service contracts. If business service companies begin to lose business, it normally will not affect their bottom lines for a couple of years and will not have as much of an effect on the current stock price.There are plenty of good buys right now in business services. The stocks' low volatilities, predictable earnings, and strong expected growth make them good to hold as the market becomes more at risk for another bear run. Accenture is on the short list of specialized management and technology consulting firms that is publicly traded. I also recommend taking a look at Booz Allen Hamilton (NYSE:BAH), smaller cap consulting firm, and IBM, which has an operating segment focused on consulting.Disclosure: I am long IBM."

447541,20568,2012-03-21T03:19:46-04:00,,"Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)  is scheduled to announce its second quarter fiscal 2012 results on  March 22, 2012, and we notice some mixed movements in analyst estimates.First Quarter OverviewAccenture delivered decent first quarter results, beating the Zacks  Consensus Estimate by 2 cents on the bottom line. The quarter’s earnings  came in at 96 cents, up 19.6% from the year-ago quarter. The  outperformance was attributable to higher revenues and margins, a lower  share count and tax rate as well as favorable foreign-exchange rates.The company’s reported revenue increased 17.0% year over year to $7.07  billion, driven by healthy segment performances and strong demand for  its offerings across the served industries. Geographical contributions  were also encouraging.Despite higher revenue, gross margin fell short of the year-ago figure  due to higher subcontractor costs, recruiting and training costs as well  as an increase in annual compensation. But operating cost control  measures led to an operating margin expansion by 20 basis points.GuidanceFor the second quarter of fiscal 2012, Accenture expects net revenue in  the range of $6.5 billion to $6.8 billion, reflecting a weak sequential  comparison. This figure was arrived at after considering a 1% negative  foreign-exchange impact. For FY12, net revenue growth is projected in  the range of 7.0% to 10.0%. Expectations for new bookings were  maintained in the range of $28.0 billion to $31.0 billion.For full fiscal 2012, the company expects its operating margin in the  range of 13.7% to 13.9% and an annual tax rate between 27.0% and 28.0%.  Diluted EPS is expected between $3.76 and $3.84, lower than the prior  expected range of $3.80–$3.88.For full story on the earnings release, please look in: Accenture Beats Despite Euro CrisisAgreement of AnalystsThe analysts are of opinion that its consulting/outsourcing/offshore  combination continues to support global enterprise clients’ demand for  high-end but cost effective service delivery. Given its global footprint  and client base, Accenture will remain well positioned to benefit from  multiple technology drivers including cloud initiatives, SaaS, mobility,  digital marketing, analytics, and others.Some analysts think further margin expansion is possible over time,  particularly given the company's Global Delivery Network expansion over  the past few years.Out of the 18 and 20 analysts providing estimates for the second  quarter and fiscal 2012, 3 revised their estimates upward in the last 7  days. Also, among the 19 analysts providing estimates for fiscal 2013, 3  increased their estimates in the past 7 days.However, there was only one downward revision in the past 7 days  reflecting the European debt concern that could affect Accenture’s  business growth in the region.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsThe movements in the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the second quarter  and fiscal 2012 were nominal but positive. In the past 7 days, Zacks  Consensus Estimates for the second quarter and fiscal 2012 moved up by a  penny to 86 cents and $3.81, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate  for fiscal 2013 also increased a penny to $4.24 in the past 7 days.RecommendationWe remain encouraged by the company’s resilience to tougher comparisons  and a continued uncertain macro environment. Accenture seems to be in a  growth momentum. This can be inferred from its commentary in the  conference call in which it promised to continue investing in priority  industries (such as Communications) and emerging markets as well as  boost its brand value.Accenture’s deal prospects look bright. Moreover, the company’s  endeavor to expand in Asia is also encouraging. With the west facing  threats of a double-dip, all eyes are now turned toward Asia. With the  continuous emergence of hi-tech innovations there, Accenture could ink  deals in technology services, as well as outsourcing and consulting  services.We are encouraged by the steady flow of new business and believe that  the trend will continue. However, increasing competition from International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE:IBM), a strained spending environment and Accenture’s broad European exposure may temper its growth prospects to some extent.Currently, Accenture has a Zacks #2 Rank, implying a short-term Buy recommendation.

643241,24866,2012-06-07T05:49:51-04:00,,"While Warren Buffett may be attracted to IBM, I believe Accenture (NYSE:ACN) is the true value play in business services. Its free cash flow generation is significantly under-appreciated, despite strong momentum. In this article, I will run you through my DCF model on the company and triangulate the result against a review of the fundamentals compared to IBM and EMC Corporation (EMC).First, let's begin with an assumption about the top-line. Accenture finished FY2011 with $27.4B in revenue, which represented an 18.4% gain off of the preceding year. I model 10.6% per annum growth over the next half decade or so.Moving onto the cost-side of the equation, there are several items to consider: operating expenses, capital expenditures, and taxes. I model cost of goods sold at 69% of revenue versus 18% for SG&A, and 1.3% for capex. Taxes are estimated at 28% of adjusted EBIT (ie. excluding non-cash depreciation charges to keep this a pure operating model.)Taking a perpetual growth rate of 2.5% and discounting backwards by a WACC of 10% yields a fair value figure of $77.90, implying just north of 33%. The market seems to be factoring in a WACC of 12.5%, which is much too bearish in light of the 0.8 beta and 2.3% dividend yield (which has recently been hiked). The stock trades reasonably at 12.4x FY2011 free cash flow.All of this falls within the context of an excellent quarter:From a multiples perspective, Accenture is also attractive. It trades at a respective 15.5x and 13.6x past and forward earnings versus 14.8x and 11.9x for IBM and 22x and 12.7x for EMC.Consensus estimates forecast IBM's EPS growing by 12.2% to $15.08 in 2012 and then by 10.1% and 9.3% in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 13x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $16.45, the stock would hit $213.85 for 8.1% upside. While IBM is not attractive from a reward standpoint, it is a stable business with a beta of 0.66. This perhaps explains why Warren Buffett may have invested a large portion of his holdings in the company. On the other hand, the dividend yield is fairly weak at 1.7%.Consensus estimates forecast EMC's EPS growing by 15.2% to $1.74 in 2012 and then by 14.9% and 19% in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 16x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $1.95, the stock would hit $31.20 for 22.4%. While the company does not offer a dividend yield, it is rated a ""strong buy"" on the Street (source: NASDAQ). Like EMC and Accenture, it is also less volatile than the broader market and thus is fairly safe against a double dip.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: We seek IR business from all of the firms in our coverage, but research covered in this note is independent and for prospective clients.

319639,24866,2012-01-14T16:36:57-05:00,,"In an earlier article here, I explained why Warren Buffett should have invested in Accenture (NYSE:ACN), as opposed to IBM (NYSE:IBM). I continue to maintain that belief given strong performance in the former contrasted with the latter's competitive pressures in cloud computing. Multiples analysis and discounted cash flow (DCF) modeling further confirm my outlook.Although these companies have their noticeable distinctions, they are both service-oriented companies with malleable segments and offerings From a multiples perspective, IBM is slightly the cheaper of the two, but not by a meaningful amount. It trades at a respective 14.3x and 12.2x past and forward earnings while Accenture trades at a respective 15.2x and 12.9x past and forward earnings. This difference becomes insignificant when you consider that Infosys (NYSE:INFY) trades at 18.6x earnings and Accenture offers a relatively high dividend yield of 2.5%. In addition, Accenture is preferred on the Street with a ""buy"" rating versus around a ""hold"" rating for IBM.At the first quarter earnings call, Accenture's CEO, Pierre Nanterme, further noted strong performanceFirst quarter EPS of $0.96 was meaningfully ahead of $0.91 consensus and resulted from double-digit growth in all segments and geographies. Even in Europe, the company performed well. Consulting was up 11% to $4.1 billion while outsourcing leaped 18% to $3B. In addition, employee attrition also declined 12% bps to 12%. These strong results followed a strong close to the end of fiscal 2011.With that said, management has suggested a cautious outlook and all 14 of the latest revisions to EPS have gone down for a net change, however insignificant, of -0.5%. The flexibility in G&A helps reduce vulnerabilities to poor macro trends, but forex headwinds continue.Consensus estimates for EPS forecast that it will grow by 12.1% to $3.81 in 2012 and then by 10% in both of the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 16x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $4.12, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $65.92, implying 22.2% upside. Modeling a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.7% for EPS over the next three years and then discounting backwards at a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of 9% yields a figure of $58.69. This may not be the greatest risk/reward, but it still provides a bit of a hedge against a struggling domestic economy; hence the strong performance in Europe.As for IBM: The company claims that its Power Systems could run Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) at a lower cost, but serious competitive pressures call this in to question. In my view, the market may be unwittingly, and irrationally, assuming an ""everyboy-wins"" scenario for cloud computing. The reality of the situation is that HP (NYSE:HPQ), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Dell (NYSE:DELL) all have solutions of their own and no softy will be slicing the revenue pie.Consensus estimates for IBM's EPS forecast that it will decelerate: Growing 16.1% to $13.37 in 2011 and then by 10.9% and 9.8% in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 14x and a conservative 2012 EPS of $14.25, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $199.50, implying 10.5% upside. Modeling a CAGR of 12.2% for EPS over the next three years and then discounting backwards at a WACC of 9% yields a figure of $206.89. Accordingly, I agree with the ""hold"" rating on the Street.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
428031,25871,2012-03-12T14:21:39-04:00,,"A Dividend Challenger is defined as a company that has increased its dividend every year for 5-9 straight years. Accenture (NYSE:ACN) is a Dividend Challenger that has raised its dividend every year for 6 consecutive years. The complete Dividend Challengers list is compiled courtesy of David Fish. (Open as an excel spreadsheet and look at the tabs on the bottom to find the Dividend Challengers list).About Accenture : from their website""Accenture is a global management consulting, technology services and outsourcing company, with more than 244,000 people serving clients in more than 120 countries. Combining unparalleled experience, comprehensive capabilities across all industries and business functions, and extensive research on the world's most successful companies, Accenture collaborates with clients to help them become high-performance businesses and governments. The company generated net revenues of US$25.5 billion for the fiscal year ended Aug. 31, 2011.""Accenture : A Dividend Challenger with 6 Consecutive Years of Dividend IncreasesSince dividends are paid out of earnings, a clear perspective of a company's historical earnings growth record is a vital component of a dividend investor's prudent due diligence process. The following graph plots Accenture's earnings per share since 2003. A quick glance to the right of the graph shows that Accenture has increased earnings at a compounded rate of 17.8% (see purple circle on graph) per annum.Dividend Challengers: 5-9 Years Straight of Dividend IncreasesWith interest rates hovering near all-time lows, investors seeking income are faced with very limited choices. The traditional high yield available from bonds and other fixed income vehicles are no longer available to meet the goals of retirees needing income to live off of. Moreover, it is almost a certainty that today's low yields are not adequate enough to fight inflation. Consequently, there is a growing investor interest in dividend paying common stocks, especially those that have a long record of increasing their dividends every year.Earnings Determine Market Price and Dividend Income: The following earnings and price correlated F.A.S.T. Graphs™ clearly illustrates the importance of earnings to both price movement and dividend income. The earnings growth rate line or True Worth ™ line (orange line with white triangles) is correlated with the historical stock price line. On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem. If the stock price strays away from the earnings line (over or under), inevitably it will come back to earnings.Here is a link to a live and fully functioning graph on Accenture. We suggest running graphs over numerous time frames as part of a more comprehensive fundamental analysis. This will provide the reader the opportunity to review a more thorough fundamental analysis of the company.Since dividends are paid out of earnings, and therefore represent additional return on top of what the market capitalizes earnings at, they are depicted by the light blue shaded area and stacked on top of the earnings line. Therefore, a quick visual of these two important components is simultaneously revealed: The additional return that dividend paying stocks provide, plus the percentage of earnings paid to shareholders as dividends (payout ratio).Performance Table: Capital Appreciation and Dividend Income AccentureThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph, validates the above discussion regarding the two components of total return: Capital appreciation and dividend income. Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid, but not reinvested.When presented separately like this, the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident. In addition to the 14.2% capital appreciation (Closing Annualized ROR), long-term shareholders of Accenture would have received an additional $19,984.61 in dividends that increased their total return from 14.2% to 14.9% per annum.Note that Accenture paid dividends once a year in November through fiscal year 2009. However, since that time they started paying dividends twice a year, in mid May and mid November. The company's fiscal year ends in August 31st of each year. Consequently, from the table below, it appears that the company cut their dividend in fiscal 2011. However, due to the change in dividend policy mentioned above, the company actually did increase their dividend every calendar year since 2006.(Note: Since this is a Dividend Challenger it has raised its dividend every year for at least 5-9 years, therefore, negative dividend growth rates shown, if any, will be attributed to special additional dividends paid in excess of the company's regularly reported dividend rate)The following graph plots the historically normal PE ratio (the dark blue line) correlated with 10-year Treasury note interest. Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as low as it has been since 2003.A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company's current price to sales ratio relative to its historical price to sales ratio. The current price to sales ratio for Accenture is 1.38, which is historically high.Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long-term returns, and the dividend and its growth rate are a function of two critical determinants:1. The rate of change (growth rate) of the company's earnings2. The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsTherefore, forecasting future earnings growth, bought at sound valuations, is the key to safe, sound, and profitable performance.Therefore, it logically follows that measuring performance without simultaneously measuring valuation is a job half done. At its current price, which is attractively aligned with its True Worth™ valuation, Accenture represents a potential opportunity to invest in a Dividend Challenger at a reasonable price. The important factor is that Accenture has real assets and cash flow underpinning its stock price. This solid economic foundation offers shareholders the potential for both a strong margin of safety and an opportunity for an increasing dividend income stream and potentially attractive future returns.The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities. Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions.The consensus of 23 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Accenture long-term earnings growth at 12%. Accenture has no long-term debt at 0% of capital. Accenture is currently trading at a P/E of 16.5, which is inside the value corridor (defined by the five orange lines) of a maximum P/E of 18. If the earnings materialize as forecast, Accenture's True Worth valuation would be $100.31 at the end of 2017, which would be a 11.6% annual rate of return from the current price, including assumed dividends.Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows: All companies derive their value from the future cash flows (earnings) they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time. Therefore, because Earnings Determine Market Price and dividend income in the long run, we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay.Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments, it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds. Comparing an investment in Accenture to an equal investment in 10-year Treasury bonds illustrates that Accenture's expected earnings would be 5.6 times that of the 10-Year T-Bond Interest. (See EYE chart below). This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component.Summary & ConclusionsThis report presents essential ""fundamentals at a glance"" on Dividend Challenger Accenture, illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported.

319934,24598,2012-01-17T08:50:22-05:00,,"Accenture (NYSE:ACN) provides consulting and outsourcing services to five key client segments on a global basis. The largest segment is products which primarily serves the manufacturing and transportation industries, followed by communications & high tech, and financial services.Within the communications segment, about 55% of revenue is derived from serving large telecom companies while in financial services, about 55% of revenue comes from retail and commercial banks. The health and public service segment is dominated by public service which comprises 74% of segment revenue. Accenture generates about 44% of revenue in the Americas, 43% in Europe and 13% in Asia Pacific.With the exception of health & public service which grew 8%, all segments grew at 18% to 25% in the last fiscal year. In the most recent quarter, fiscal 1Q12, all segments grew at double-digit rates compared to the prior year. Bookings at the company were up 11.6% in the most recent quarter compared to the prior year and down 8% compared to the prior quarter. Some decline in bookings in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter is normal for the business, but the amount of decline appears greater than the historical trend.Growth in prior years has not always been strong, for example revenue declined slightly in 2009 compared to 2008 and was flat in 2010 versus the prior year. Over the last five years and one quarter, revenue has managed to grow 5.5% and EBITDA has grown slightly faster at 6.6%, both at a compounded annual rates. The company has not made any major acquisitions over the period, although a number of smaller transactions have been consummated. Two key areas of investment for Accenture are in sales and marketing and research and development. Both have grown faster than revenue and EBITDA at 10.4% annually.Returns on capital are difficult to assess for services companies because most of the assets are not recognized on the balance sheet. My own preliminary analysis based on the capitalization of research and development and sales and marketing suggests returns are far in excess of the cost of capital which implies that growth should create value for shareholders.With the equity trading at $53.25 per share, Accenture trades at a price to earnings multiple of 12.2 times based on First Call projected fiscal 2012 earnings of $3.81, after netting cash of $7.30 per share from the market value of equity and removing interest income from earnings. The annualized dividend yield is about 2.5% based on the last dividend. Assuming no major accounting adjustments, fair value for a no growth business is typically about 12.5x.Accenture currently faces a few headwinds which likely reflect the rather muted valuation ascribed to the company’s current cash flows and growth prospects. With a large portion of revenue derived from Europe, there is a clear risk of weak operating performance in the future as that region flirts with recession. The weak Euro will also weigh on reported results, although the currency impact should be transitory. Another risk is the weak revenue environment for financial services. Public service is of some concern as well due to austerity budgets in Europe and elsewhere. Offsetting some of these risks is the fact that parts of Accenture’s business tend to reduce costs for companies – especially outsourcing. However, the savings are generally longer-term in nature and such reorganizations take upfront capital to put into place.Although the short-term outlook is choppy, over the long-term, the business should perform in-line, to somewhat above global growth implying the shares should embed some growth premium which is currently not the case, in my view. The forgoing analysis is cursory, but Accenture’s shares look attractive enough to put on the watch list while refining the valuation. Given a strong economy, Accenture’s shares have a good chance of outperforming the market as growth premium is built into the stock. Accenture may also use its large cash position to buy back stock on any weakness, which would ensure the stock stays liquid through a downturn, should one come.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in ACN over the next 72 hours."
313631,20568,2011-12-13T15:34:49-05:00,,"Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)  is scheduled to announce its first quarter 2012 results on December 15  after market close. There have been some changes in analysts’ estimates  following the release of its fourth quarter 2011 results.Fourth Quarter RecapAccenture posted impressive fourth quarter earnings per share (EPS) of  66 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents. The company  reported net revenue of $5.42 billion in the quarter, up 5.2% from $5.15  billion in the year-ago quarter and above the Zacks Consensus Estimate  of $5.31 billion.Reported revenue was within the company’s guided range and included a  three percentage point negative impact from foreign currency. The  meaningful growth in revenues was attributed to higher contribution from  all its operating segments.Accenture witnessed revenue growth across almost all of its operating  groups, with Product revenues seeing the highest growth (up 13.0%  annually). Communications & High Tech revenues grew 4.1%, while  Financial Services revenues were up 9.6% year over year.Revenues from Resources climbed 7.5% from the year-ago quarter. The  improvement in these segments was partially offset by a 9.0% drop in the  Health & Public Services group revenues.Operating margin (as a percentage of net revenue) was 13.2% compared  with 8.2% in the year-ago quarter. The improvement in operating margin  was mainly due to a 14.9% year-over-year increase in sales and marketing  expenses. The increase in selling expenses can also be credited to the  implementation of the sales effectiveness model implemented earlier.GuidanceFor the first quarter of 2012, Accenture expects net revenue in the  range of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion. This guidance includes a 5.0%  negative foreign exchange impact. For fiscal 2012, the company expects  net revenue growth in the range of 7.0% to 10.0%.New bookings are expected to range between $25.0 billion and $28.0  billion. The company also expects operating margin to be between 13.6%  and 13.7%, an annual tax rate of 28.0% to 29.0% and diluted EPS of  $3.00–$3.08.Agreement of AnalystsOut of the 16 analysts providing estimates for the first quarter, only  one analyst downgraded estimates in the last 30 days. Again, for fiscal  2012, three analysts downgraded their estimates over the last 30 days.  For fiscal 2013, two analysts downgraded their estimates in the last  thirty days while no upward revision was witnessed. Therefore, there  appears to be some moderate negative sentiment amon analysts.Specifically, analysts are a bit concerned about the potential impact  on demand given the prevailing uncertain economic conditions, sovereign  debt issues in Europe (40.0% of net revenue) and decelerating growth in  the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region. Some analysts expect  the impact to be modest and thus believe that demand will remain  moderate in Europe, including ACN's consulting business.Some analysts expect IT spending growth to be 3.0% in 2012, down from  5.0% projected for 2011. The downside is primarily due to the tough  global macro backdrop. Additionally, based on the latest survey results,  discretionary IT spending for services in the next six months is  showing signs of weakening from its peak level in August.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter of fiscal 2012  increased by 2 cents over the last 90 days while the same for fiscal  2012 moved up by 5 cents. However, for 2013 estimates moved down by 5  cents to $4.23 over a period of 90 days.Recommendation Accenture posted encouraging fourth quarter results, but business  fundamentals are expected to be tempered in the upcoming quarter. Owing  to lower demand as well as an unfavorable IT spending scenario and  economic turmoil in Europe, the company’s business might suffer.Moreover, recovery of the financial services sector is expected to take  some time. Notwithstanding these headwinds, we are encouraged by the  steady flow of new business from higher tech spending in 2011.The company has a Zacks #4 Rank, implying a short-term Sell rating.ACCENTURE PLC (ACN): Free Stock Analysis Report"
313490,24866,2011-12-13T08:06:22-05:00,,"Warren Buffett made headlines earlier this year when he invested $10.7B in IBM (NYSE:IBM). Around that time, I argued that the company was nowhere close to its peak here. Although I continue to agree that IBM trades below intrinsic value, I believe more attractive services firms exist right now. Accenture (NYSE:ACN) is one such firm. The Street currently rates shares a ""strong buy"", which compares to only a ""buy"" for those of IBM.From a multiples perspective, Accenture is the more expensive of the two. It trades at a respective 17.3x and 13.9x past and forward earnings. IBM, on the other hand, trades for 15.4x and 13.1x past and forward earnings. At the same time, Accenture has the higher dividend yield at 2.3%. Going forward, I expect much greater relative demand for Accenture's services than for IBM's. Whereas macro pressures are causing firms to shift over to Global Delivery in Accenture, IT spending could experience a double dip and significantly challenge earnings for IBM. On the fourth quarter earnings call, Accenture's CEO, Pierre Nanterme, also noted stellar performance:Management further remains committed to returning free cash flow to shareholders, as evidenced by the $2.8B worth of share repurchases. As the balance sheet is healthy and replete with cash, it is likely that the capital allocation policy will become even more aggressive in the quarters ahead. At the same time, the firm is doing well cutting costs. It also has significant control over G&A, thus providing limited vulnerability to macro headwinds. Going forward, investors are advised to watch staffing as a metric for managerial optimism.Consensus estimates for Accenture's EPS are that it will grow by 12.4% to $3.82 in 2012 and then by 10.7% and 9% more in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 17x and a conservative 2012 EPS estimate of $.10, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $69.70. This implies 18.7% upside. Even if the multiple falls to 15x and 2012 EPS turns out being 5.4% below the consensus at $4, there is no downside to the investment by this calculation.As for IBM: fourth quarter results are likely to be an inflection point and indicative of 2012 earnings. On the positive side, computing is becoming less expensive and bound to benefit Watson. Management also contends that IBM Power Systems can operate Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) at lower costs than Exadata can. But with increasing competition from Oracle (ORCL), HP (NYSE:HPQ), Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Dell (NYSE:DELL), I am not terribly optimistic about margins.Consensus estimates for IBM's EPS are that it will grow by 16.1% to $13.38 and then by 11% and 10.3% more in the following two years. If the multiple falls to 13x and 2012 EPS turns out to be just 2.4% lower than the consensus at $14.50, the stock should fall 3.1%. While I believe that the company has solid fundamentals and that this will not occur, in my view, Accenture is the more attractive pick at the current moment from a risk/reward perspective.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
421671,24114,2012-03-08T19:05:56-05:00,,"By Matthew SmithIn the post-recession global economic arena, terms like shrinking budgets, lost revenues, increased debt liabilities, narrowing competitive moat and declining market shares have become common among many business strategists regardless of the industry they are associated with. This has encouraged businesses to make more efficient and thorough use of available resources and existing opportunities in shrinking markets in order to acquire maximum returns on investments.In this article, I will discuss Accenture (NYSE:ACN), a company based in the IT services and IT consultancy industry. Accenture stands to gain from the current economic outlook given the increased prospects of growth and profitability. I have chosen this stock because it has shown impressive signs of growth in recent fiscal quarters and has continued to do so amidst favorable market sentiment.In such an economic outlook where even leading businesses of various industries are haunted by reduced revenues, increased debts and falling cash flows, the global information technology services and consultancy industry mainly stands to gain, as it has been blessed with the ideal opportunity and the perfect global setup to bolster growth levels. This is because countless businesses have traditionally perceived IT services and consultancy businesses as friendly neighborhood Samaritans for their tremendous role in helping businesses stretch their profit margins by efficiently managing their assets and running their operations more effectively.Accenture is the world's largest global management consulting, technology services and outsourcing company with around 244,000 employees serving clients in nearly 120 countries. Accenture combines comprehensive market know-how, unparalleled experience and extensive capabilities across a wide range of business functions to help a diverse clientele achieve maximized revenue and growth. Among Accenture's leading clients are nearly 75% of companies listed in the Fortune Global 500 and 96 companies on the Fortune Global 100.With such a powerful and diverse clientele comprehensively spread across global markets, we can easily claim that Accenture has a lot of ""friends in high places."" As a result, the company had a favorable during the previous fiscal year ending on 31st August 2011, with reported net revenues worth nearly $26 billion. In the following fiscal year, Accenture bolstered its operating profits by 18.5% to nearly $3.5 billion.All these positive financial indicators have impressed upon investors and stock traders favorable sentiment for the company in recent fiscal quarters and this has reflected well on the business' performance in the last three quarters. Currently, the stock is trading at almost $61 which is close to its highest trading price of $63 in the last 52 weeks. Although there was a brief period of reduced global economic activity in the previous fiscal year that brought down the trading price of Accenture to as low as $47, the stock has only gained since then amidst renewed market activity and aggressive trading. In terms of overall invested capital, Accenture is a massive global business with a market capitalization exceeding $84 billion and an average trading volume of nearly $4 million.The company's price to earnings ratio is impressive at 17.8 and on earnings per share of nearly $3.5, Accenture offers investors nearly 70 cents in dividends. These figures have allowed the company to maintain an impressive dividend history with a yield of more than 2.2% which in turn has attracted favorable investor sentiment in predominantly poor market conditions. Accenture has a defensive beta of 0.88, which means that unfavorable market conditions will have a largely reduced negative impact on the business.Accenture faces increasing competition from a group of off-shore service providers all of whom have reported impressive annual upward growth of nearly 30% by offering similar services at a more reasonable price. As a result, where the average cost per employee of Accenture is $110,000, Infosys Technologies (NYSE:INFY) manages it at around $34,000. Additionally, the business faces increased exposure to developing markets as compared to its competitors. For instance, one third of Accentures's overall workforce is placed offshore compared to only 18% for IBM (NYSE:IBM), 12% for Electronic Data Systems (NASDAQ:EDS) and 9% for Computer Sciences (CSC). By spreading its major operations across developing countries, Accenture is highly susceptible to unprecedented government regulations in the private sector.As Accenture mainly deals in three service areas, it faces growing challenges from different competitors on each front. In the Management Consulting services market, Accenture is locked in battle with traditional strategic consulting groups such as Boston Consulting Group and McKinsey & Co. while in technology services, Accenture is fighting against IBM. Due to its sheer size and overall market share, IBM comfortably leads the competition by a huge margin as far as revenue, market share and profitability are concerned. However, Accenture still remains the undisputed top provider of outsourcing.Furthermore, the company has recently announced a string of positive developments that are expected to help the company to strengthen its position in international markets and widen its competitive moat. To start with, the company has recently signed an IT contract worth nearly $1 billion to provide technology services to the Justice Department. Accenture also plans to expand its analytics capabilities with the planned acquisition of Neo Metrics Analytics S.L. The company has also been selected to develop a regional operating model for human services in 12 counties of Southeast Minnesota. Accenture has also been the choice of the Basque Regional Government that is interested in the development of a strategic cost transformation program for the Department of Internal Affairs which is largely responsible for law enforcement and public safety. With these important developments, the company is expected to retain its market share amidst increasing competition from newly established companies mainly from the Indian sub-continent.Accenture has performed well in the last three quarters with an impressive fourth quarter. Although growth margins and recorded revenues have not been as impressive as those of its leading competitors such as IBM, the company has reported high revenue growth and shown positive and consistent signs of upward growth over the previous fiscal quarters. More recently, the company has established a new Research and Development lab in Beijing which is aimed at strengthening the company's stronghold in emerging Asian markets amidst growing competition from newly established Indian competitors operating in the market. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the business is poised to grow and expand its market share in the current fiscal year. With continued positive upward growth and solid performance indicators in the first two months of 2012, I believe that Accenture has the capacity to significantly boost its revenues and increase cash flows. Therefore, I rate the global business as a ""buy"" in the year 2012.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The company was founded in 1955 and is based in Dublin, Ireland.The current Accenture trailing twelve months (ttm) P/E ratio is 16.1 The forward P/E ratio is 14.4, making Accenture an attractive investment possibility.In the last month, Accenture has increased in price 6.98%, with a one-year change of 22.23%. With a performance in the stock of over 20% it is not hard to imagine why Accenture beat the broad market average index of the S&P 500. The year to date difference is an impressive 25.21% better return.The recent history of earnings beats helps to explain the performance of the stock. Take a look at the quarterly trend and the delivery of results above the expectations.   Accenture has an upcoming dividend in the amount of $0.68 that can be gained by buying the stock before the ex-dividend date of October 12, 2011.To minimize risk, a dividend capture strategy can be used to give an investor several choices.In combination with my buying the stock and after checking company updates, I may offer to sell the October $44.00 strike call for $0.64 over the intrinsic value. The option may get exercised early for a gain. If not, after qualifying for the dividend, I will attempt to close out the trade with a gain of near $0.17. Accenture recently reported quarterly earnings, lowering earnings headline risk during the life of the covered call.Taking a look we can see what outcomes are possible. Accenture stock gets called away before ex-dividend date and I make $0.64. I continue through the ex-dividend date and the stock gets called away at expiration and I make $1.32. The option premium falls before expiration day and I close out for a gain of $0.81. Accenture stock falls below $44 and I own Accenture for an average price of 42.68 (factoring in option and dividend payments).     My last step (completed before making a trade on the same day) is to check company announcements and news sources for possible events that may cause the stock price to move. This is especially important during earnings season.I research the different call options and calculate the expected probabilities based on Beta, Bid, Offer, Volume traded the current day, open interest, and time value / implied volatility. The options offer some level of protection from down moves in the stock, and provide revenue to cover the times that the options do not fully cover down moves in the stock. Income is not needed from the option premiums, so a break even from premiums received/stock losses ratio is a win.I use a proprietary blend of technical analysis, financial crowd behavior and fundamentals in my short-term trades, and while not totally the same in longer swing trades to investments, the concepts used are similar. Nothing in the article should be considered investment advice, but you may want to use this article as a starting point of your own research with your financial planner. I use Seeking Alpha, Edgar Online, and Yahoo Finance for most of my data.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in ACN over the next 72 hours."

But if it could then the world will be just fine.After the close, ACN reported record revenues, EPS, operating margin, free cash flow and new bookings for fiscal 2011. All this leading the company to increase the semi-annual dividend by 50% to provide a dividend yield of roughly 2.7%. The board of directors also approved $5B of additional share repurchases.Clearly the BOD has great faith in the global economy skirting a recession to raise the dividend by a whopping 50%. Naturally everything could change if Europe implodes, but ACN knows that risk exists and it still went forward with the bump. Of course, the buyback could be curtailed if something goes awry.The stock remains a top pick in our Net Payout Yields (NPY) model with a decent dividend going from 1.9% to 2.7% and a net stock buyback of a little over $1B during the last 12 months.

With 236,000 employees in 54 countries, and clients in more than 120 countries, it can offer a wide range of knowledge and capabilities. The company’s fiscal year ends August 31, and in 2011 it delivered net revenues of $25.5 billion. It appears in the S&P 500®, Russell 1000® Index and the Fortune Global 500. Incorporated in the Irish Republic, its headquarters are in Dublin.Target clients are organizations looking to benefit from Accenture’s ""high-performance business"" strategy to improve revenue, operational performance, market scope and overall efficiency. They claim to work with 94 of the Fortune Global 100 and more than 75% of the Global 500. Even more significantly, all of their top 100 clients in 2010 (based on revenue) have been with Accenture for at least five years, 92 for at least ten years. Loyalty of that kind cannot be bought, only earned.The company sees its competitive edge as centered on its extensive industry expertise, especially in the area of business transformation, on the wide and constantly expanding range of offered services, and on its history of technological innovation and R & D capabilities. In order to maximize the specialized expertise of its personnel, the company is divided into 19 focused industry groups gathered under five operational headings: Communications, Media & Technology; Financial Services; Health & Public Service; Products (e.g. Retail, Automotive); and Resources. In other words, wherever you are in the corporate or public sector, Accenture has you covered.However, Accenture’s breadth of services means that it faces an equally wide field of competitors. In the consulting field, incorporated partnership McKinsey & Company has 97 global offices, while Boston Consulting Group (BCG) has 70. Technology services competitors include IBM (NYSE:IBM), Electronic Data Systems (NASDAQ:EDS), and Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC). Outsourcing challenges come from the lower operating costs of Indian-based enterprises such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Saytam Computer Services, Infosys Technologies (NYSE:INFY) and Wipro Limited (NYSE:WIT).Dividing Accenture's revenue by geographic region, Europe, the Middle East and Africa combined deliver about the same slice of the pie as the Americas: 43% and 44% respectively in 2011, with Asia Pacific covering 13%. Service-wise, consulting contributed 59% of revenue and outsourcing 41%. Revenue was also fairly evenly distributed between the five operating groups. Whichever way you look at Accenture’s business, the eggs are strategically placed in a variety of baskets.Looking at fiscal 2011 results in more detail, revenue was up 18% on the previous year, and growth was recorded in all operating divisions. Geographically, the largest revenue percentage growth was in the Asia-Pacific region, up 23% in local currency terms. Overall earnings per share of $3.40 showed a 28% increase. Dividends are paid semi-annually and amounted to $1.125 per share in 2011. For fiscal 2012, Accenture expects net revenue growth of 7% to 10% and earnings per share of $3.80 to $3.88, an increase of 12% to 14% on 2011.During the September 2011 Q4 earnings conference call, Accenture CEO Pierre Nanterme referred to two planned acquisitions of companies servicing the insurance and banking sector, one in the U.S. and one in the U.K. Accenture also has plans to expand its services range, particularly in new technology, and extend its geographic reach with a focus on ten priority emerging markets. Mr. Nanterme identified the challenges of globalization, increased regulation and the need for operational efficiency as the key trends driving demand for the company’s services. Responding to a question about European sovereign debt and deficit problems, he observed that the majority of the company’s European clients were in fact global organizations that were to some extent cushioned by the fact that they were operating outside Europe as well as within it.Accenture is shooting at a great many targets, but the sheer breadth of its services, client base and global reach may in the end be its greatest asset when every government and corporation is looking over its shoulder to see where the next economic challenge is coming from. Yet it would not be a great surprise if the company were to suffer some negative consequences as a result of the Europe’s sovereign debt issues.Accenture’s stock price is up about 50% over the last two years as shown below:(Click to enlarge)With Accenture’s upcoming earnings report on 12/15/2011, an investor might consider entering a collar position for the company for protection in the event the company has a negative report.

292261,24389,2011-09-07T16:48:40-04:00,,"Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), founded in 1995, provides consulting, technology services, and outsourcing solutions worldwide. The Dublin, Ireland-based company serves the communications, high technology, electronics, media, and entertainment industries in Europe, U.S., the Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. The company has over 220,000 employees in more than 120 countries.As of Sept. 6, Accenture stock was trading at $51 with a 52-week range of $37.22– $63.66. It has a market cap of $34.9 billion. Trailing-twelve-month P/E ratio is 18.2, and forward P/E ratio is 13.1. P/B, P/S, and P/CF ratios stand at 9.4, 1.4, and 11.3, respectively. The 3-year annualized revenue and EPS growth stand at 2.5% and 10.5%, respectively. Operating margin is 12.5%, and net profit margin is 8.1%. The company does not have any debt problems. ACN yields 1.8% for its shareholders.Accenture has a 4-star rating from Morningstar. While its trailing P/E ratio is 18.2, it has a 5-year average P/E ratio of 21.9. Out of 21 analysts covering the company, 13 have buy, 4 have outperform, and 4 have hold ratings. Wall Street has diverse opinions on Accenture’s future. The bottom line is 7.7% growth, whereas the top-line growth estimate is 16.2% for the next year. Average five-year annualized growth forecast estimate is 11.2%.What is Accenture's fair value, given the forecast estimates? In this article, the 27th in the series, I will show a step-by-step calculation of Accenture’s fair value using a discounted earnings plus equity model.Discounted Earnings Plus Equity ModelThis model is primarily used for estimating the returns from long-term projects. It is also frequently used to price fair-valued IPOs. The methodology is based on discounting the present value of the future earnings to the current period:V = E0 + E1 /(1+r) + E2 /(1+r)2 + E3/(1+r)3 + E4/(1+r)4 + E5/(1+r)5 + Disposal ValueV = E0 + E0 (1+g)/(1+r) + E0(1+g)2/(1+r)2 + … + E0(1+g)5/(1+r)5 + E0(1+g)5/[r(1+r)5]The earnings after the last period act as a perpetuity that creates regular earnings:Disposal Value = D = E0(1+g)5/[r(1+r)5] = E5 / rWhile this formula might look scary for many of us, it easily calculates the fair value of a stock. All we need is the current-period earnings, earnings growth estimate, and the discount rate. To be as objective as possible, I use Morningstar data for my estimates. You can set these parameters as you wish, according to your own due diligence.Accenture’s ValuationHistorically, the average return of the DJI has been around 11% (including dividends). Therefore, I will use 11% as my discount rate.Since we are in the middle of the year, it will be more feasible to take the average of ttm EPS of $3.15 along with the mean estimate of $3.79 for the next year.E0 = EPS = ($3.15 + $3.79) / 2 = $3.47Wall Street holds diversified opinions on Accenture’s future. While analysts do tend to impose subjective opinions on their estimates, the average analyst estimate is a good starting point. Average five-year growth forecast is 11.2%. Book value per share is $5.32.The rest is as follows:I decided to add the book value per share so that we can distinguish between a low-debt and a debt-loaded company. The lower boundary does not include the book value. According to my 5-year discounted-earnings-plus-book-value model, the fair-value range for Accenture is between $52.74 and $58.06 per share.As of Sept. 6, Accenture was trading at a price of $51. I like Accenture as a company. The company has a systematic growth through diversified sectors with a successful business strategy. I see great growth potential as well. However, the market has already priced this potential. The current price of $51 reaches the lower boundary of my fair-value range. On the other hand, the stock has 13.85% upside potential to reach the upper boundary of its fair-value range.O – Metrix ConfirmationIf the math above looks too complicated for you, try estimating the fair value using the O-Metrix as such:O-Metrix = [(Dividend Yield + Growth Estimate) / (P/E Ratio)] * 5The back-testing of this valuation technique on 40 large-caps shows that O-Metrix works very well over the long-term, such as five years. I am also continuously checking on specific sectors, and the formula works very well so far.What is the O-Metrix Score?O-Metrix = [(11.2 + 1.8) / (15.65)] * 5 = 4.15Depending on the benchmark chosen, the market has an O-Metrix score range between 4 and 5. Accenture’s O-Metrix score of 4.15 is within fair-value range. Back-testing of this ranking system shows that companies with higher-than-average O-Metrix scores beat the market with lower volatility. At a price of $51, the company is trading within the C-Grade, average-return zone.SummaryAccenture’s stock has always been priced at a premium due to its high growth potential. The average P/E ratio in the last 5 years was 21.9. However, it is trading with a lower P/E ratio of 18.2, and a forward P/E ratio of 13.1. In the last 5 years, annualized EPS growth was 11.31%. With a market cap of $34.9 billion, I expect the growth to keep its pace.As of Sept. 6, Accenture was trading at $51, at the lower boundary of my fair-value range of $52.74 and $58.06. The stock does not have a debt problem. With a profit margin of 9.15%, Accenture offered 1.8% dividend yield last year. The stock has 13.85% upside potential based on 11.2% EPS growth estimate. Analysts also agree with me: The mean intermediate target price estimate is $64.65, implying significant upside potential. Accenture pays decent dividends and is priced with a fair P/E ratio. I think the current price fairly values the company’s growth potential.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Since the start of 2009, the stock has gone up by more than 80% while the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) has only gone up roughly half of that. The firm currently trades at multiples, in my view, substantially below that of intrinsic value - 16.8x and 13.6x past and forward earnings, respectively.Accenture performed well during 2011, rounding out the the year with impressive 4Q earnings. At the fourth quarter earnings call, CEO Pierre Nanterme noted:These figures are nothing short of stunning for such a mature company. Much of this growth was driven by strong bookings, cost cutting, and margin expansion. Management is looking to further trim G&A and take advantage of global delivery leverage. Bookings grew to $28B, 55% of which came from consulting, the other from outsourcing. Management consulting saw strong top-line growth and tech consulting has yet to realize its full potential, as Accenture further develops its cloud capabilities. And in outsourcing, Global Delivery Network has seen increased demand due a growing need for streamlining services and reducing costs in a tough macro economy.All told, Accenture was successful across the board for fiscal year 2011. It either met or beat all of the goals that management set out to achieve in their forward-looking outlook. Records were recorded in operating margins, free cash flow, and new booking. Below is a chart that evidences Accenture's nature as a free cash flow generator.*Note: The locus of points between individual years has been reduced to a straight line for simplification purposes.In addition to scaling successful operations, management is also committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. The company repurchased an impressive $2.8B worth of shares and increased semi-annual dividends by 50%. Accenture now has $5.71B in cash - representing 15.4% of its current market value - that can be deployed to not only increase buybacks (dividends have a negative tax implication), but also to taking market share away from competitors.IBM (NYSE:IBM), in particular, is likely to have strong growth - and, as I stated earlier, it is nowhere near its peak. IBM too has produced tremendous value creation during one of the worst economic periods in US history. But it has nowhere near the kind of net cash that Accenture has - in fact, it has $18B worth of net debt that is holding back returns. So, while I remain bullish on IBM for the reasons expressed in the article, I find that Accenture is now better positioned to taking on the competition through an acquisition strategy.Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), on the other hand, has $38.2B worth of net cash, which represents 16.9% of its current market capitalization. In the years ahead, I anticipate the software-maker to unlock tens of billions worth of shareholder value as it pursues cloud integration. However, the company remains different enough from Accenture that I do not believe a weighty competitive pressure exists here. And then there is Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), which has $16.9B worth of net cash - a figure that represents a lower respective percentage of market value than for Accenture at 10.6%. I am more concerned about the implications of Oracle's growth on Accenture than I am for Microsoft's. The reason is that, in my view, Oracle will provide more of a competitive pressure to the industry (relative improvement versus absolute).With that said, Accenture continues to impress in all of its segments: communication & high tech; health & public service; products; financial services; and resources. In the last segment alone, revenue was up 18% in local currency for the fourth quarter, driven by ERP and improved global operating models. Given its high cash holding, Accenture is likely to grow through acquisitions and create a stronger economy of scale. As macro stagnation resides, Accenture is well positioned to enter even more segments as it becomes something of a giant conglomerate.Consensus estimates for EPS are that it will grow by 12.6% to $3.83 in 2012 and then by 10.2% and 9.2% in the following years. As the stock flourished during the recession, produces strong FCF growth, and offers a dividend yield of 2.36% complemented by likely increases in share repurchases, Accenture has favorable risk/reward. Like most other analysts, I strongly recommend taking a long position.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The company continues to report strong numbers with 21% revenue growth and 27% earnings growth.More important to us is that all though the stock traded at an all time high during the quarter at $58.21, the company bought back $644M worth of stock at an average price of $56.50. The stock remains a top five pick in our Net Payout Yields (NPY) portfolio, which invests in stocks with high yields comprised of dividends plus stock repurchases.Based on annualized Q3 numbers, the company has a dividend yield of 1.6% and a stock repurchase yield of 7.1% or a NPY of nearly 9%. Using trailing 12 month numbers, the yield is slightly lower.Management is signaling that although share prices are at highs, the company still trades at a relative value compared to the growth opportunity over the next few years. This provides a great non-emotional method of selecting stocks for a conservative portfolio.For now ACN stays in the portfolio, though going forward investors should keep a close eye on when management cuts back on stock buybacks. Conversely, if the stock keeps going up and management allows the dividend to sink even further without raising it, that might signal the company isn't comfortable with long term growth.Per the ACN press release: Share Repurchase Activity - During the third quarter of fiscal 2011, Accenture repurchased or redeemed 11.4 million shares for a total of $644 million, including 9.7 million shares repurchased in the open market. This brings Accenture’s total share repurchases and redemptions for the first three quarters of fiscal 2011 to 29.7 million shares, including 13.1 million shares repurchased in the open market, for a total of approximately $1.4 billion. Accenture’s total remaining share repurchase authority at May 31, 2011, was approximately $1.7 billion.

276319,20568,2011-06-23T11:20:53-04:00,,"Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN)  is scheduled to announce its third quarter of fiscal 2011 results on  June 23 after market close. There have been some changes in analysts’  estimates post its second quarter 2011 results.Second Quarter RecapAccenture posted impressive second quarter results, with earnings per  share (NYSEARCA:EPS) of 75 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 71  cents. Accenture reported second quarter 2011 net revenue of $6.05  billion, up 16.9% from $5.18 billion reported in the year-ago quarter.  Net revenue was also above the company’s guided range of $5.6 billion to  $5.8 billion. The upside in net revenue was attributed to the  significant increase in revenues across Accenture’s operating segments  and healthy demand for its offerings across the industries served.Consulting and Outsourcing revenues increased 20.0% and 13.0% from a  year ago to $3.51 billion and $2.54 billion, respectively.  Geographically, year-over-year increases of 21.0%, 9.0% and 34.0% were  witnessed in revenues from the Americas, Europe Middle East and Africa  (EMEA) and the Asia-Pacific region, respectively.Total operating expenses grew 10.5% year over year, due to higher sales  and marketing expenses (up 13.9%) and general and administrative  expenses (up 5.4%). However, as a percentage of net revenue, operating  expenses plunged 110 bps from the year-ago quarter. The operating margin  was 12.7% versus 12.6% in the year-ago quarter.GuidanceFor the third quarter of fiscal 2011, Accenture expects net revenue in  the range of $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion. Diluted EPS expectation has  been upgraded to $3.22–$3.30 from the previously guided range of  $3.08–$3.16. The earnings guidance surpassed the Zacks Consensus  Estimate of $3.16.Agreement of AnalystsOut of the sixteen analysts providing estimates for the third quarter,  one analyst raised estimates in the last thirty days. For the fourth  quarter also, just one analyst raised estimates over the last thirty  days. However, for fiscal year 2011, two analysts have raised their  estimates in last seven days. There were no other estimate revisions  over the last 30 days. For fiscal year 2012, all of them raised their  estimates over the last seven days.According to some analysts, ACN continues to be the largest independent  consultant in the world. Strong brand reputation and solid client base  enhances the company’s competitive edge. Moreover, analysts are of the  opinion that Accenture is moving on the same line as other offshore IT  companies that are expanding their operations in the overseas market.Moreover, the analysts also believe that the company is intent on  expanding margins through the development of the Global Delivery Network  over the past few years. However, Accenture's margins are currently  below those of competitors International Business Machine (NYSE:IBM) and Hewlett-Packard Company (NYSE:HPQ). The analysts also believe that financial services (21% of net revenue)  will be a primary driver for revenue and bookings, attributed primarily  to post-merger integration, risk and compliance demand. From a  geographical standpoint, the Americas witnessed significant growth,  contributing around 44% of net revenue, while EMEA continued to recover  slowly. However, APAC was impacted by the lingering effects of the Japan  earthquake.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter of fiscal 2011,  increased by 4 cents over the last 90 days while for fiscal 2011 and  2012, estimates moved up by 11 and 14 cents, respectively, to $3.27 and  $3.67 over the last 90 days.Recommendation Favorable trends in Accenture’s businesses, new business wins and  improvement in new bookings are positives for the company. Based on  improving business momentum and increasing technology spending,  Accenture raised its revenue and earnings guidance for fiscal 2011.  Moreover, the company is also expected to gain from the recovery of the  financial services sector. We are encouraged by the steady flow of new  business arising from higher tech spending in 2011.The company has a Zacks #2 Rank, implying a Short-term Buy rating."

New bookings for the quarter were $7 billion, the highest in 10  quarters. The technology consulting and systems integration segments  delivered the strongest gains in bookings. Technology outsourcing and  BPO bookings also grew significantly.Accenture to Hire 64,000 in Fiscal Year 2011Accenture’s headcount stood at 204,000 at the end of fiscal year  2010. The firm plans to hire more than 64,000 people in fiscal year  2011, and had only reached a total headcount of 215,000 at the end of  fiscal Q2’11. Adjusting for the firm’s attrition rate of around 14%-15%  over the first two quarter, Accenture’s headcount could increase by 10%  for the full year 2011.Our base case forecasts suggest a 2% increase in Accenture’s  technology consultant headcount during 2011, to about 17,800 employees.  However, a 10%  increase in technology consultants, to about 19,200 in  2011, would add about 2% to our $51.92 price estimate for Accenture’s stock.  But technology consulting is just one business segment for Accenture.

It is quite rare for a company to have higher economic earnings than GAAP earnings given that the accounting rules enable companies to overstate their GAAP profits so easily.At the same time, the stock’s val­u­a­tion implies that ACN’s prof­its will decline by 9% and never grow again. In other words, the stock mar­ket is pre­dict­ing a per­ma­nent decline of 9% in ACN’s prof­its. Given that most investors are not aware that the company’s operating profits are as strong as they are, the market is probably not giving ACN appropriate credit for its profitability.In summary, the mar­ket is set­ting the profit growth bar quite low for this stock.HIDDEN GEMS:For details on what causes the dif­fer­ence between eco­nomic ver­sus account­ing prof­its, see Appen­dix 3 on page 10 of our report on ACN. See Appen­dix 4 to learn how ACN increased net operating profit after tax (NOPAT) by cut­ting costs and increased its NOPAT mar­gin from 9.0% to 9.2%. See Appen­dix 5 for details on how ACN reduced its invested cap­i­tal while revenue grew and raised its invested cap­i­tal turns from 4.68x to 4.75x. Appen­dix 7 (in the ROIC sec­tion) shows how the com­pany’s increase in NOPAT mar­gin and invested cap­i­tal turns result in an increase in ROIC (from 42.0 to 43.5%).In summary, ACN is gets our “very attractive” stock rating because its economic earnings are strong and growing while its valuation implies economic earnings will decline permanently by 10%.ACN fits the risk/reward pro­file of a great stock to buy.Note: Stock pick of the week is updated every Tuesday.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Analysts also like the stock, which received two upgrades recently, following the company’s third-quarter earnings report.The business services company reported $0.66 eps, beating expectation by $0.03, on 5.3 percent greater revenues over the year-ago period. For the year, the company earned $2.66 per share on revenues of over $21 billion and increased it outlook for annual eps growth to between 13and 16 percent.The 20 percent dividend increase, from $0.38 to $0.45, boosted the yield for the semi-annual dividend to over 2 percent.The company’s fourth quarter results continue the growth momentum from the previous quarter and the outlook looks bright going forward. Both consulting and outsourcing revenues made healthy gains. The company also made internal improvements, repurchased stock, and boosted its operating margin and cash per share.

There have been some changes in analyst estimates post its first quarter results.First Quarter OverviewFirst quarter results were impressive, with earnings per share (EPS) of 81 cents, substantially exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 75 cents.Revenue of $6.05 billion was up 12.3% from $5.38 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. Net revenue was above the company’s guided range of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion. The meaningful increase in net revenue was attributed to the significant increase in revenues across the majority of Accenture’s operating segments.Accenture recorded consulting bookings of $3.72 billion and outsourcing bookings of $2.59 billion. On the whole, new bookings in the first quarter were $6.31 billion, which included a negative 1.0% foreign currency impact against new bookings in the comparable period last year.The operating results showed no improvement, affected by higher sales and marketing expense incurred for the implementation of the sales effectiveness model.GuidanceFor the second quarter of fiscal 2011, Accenture expects net revenue in the range of $5.6 billion to $5.8 billion. For fiscal 2011, the company expects net revenue growth in the range of 8.0% to 11.0% (previously 7.0% to 10.0%). New bookings are expected to range between $25.0 billion and $28.0 billion.The company also expects an operating margin of between 13.6% and 13.7%, an annual tax rate of 28.0% to 29.0% and a diluted EPS of $3.08–$3.16 (previously $3.00–$3.08). Moreover, Accenture also forecast operating cash flow in the range of $2.7–$2.9 billion.Agreement of AnalystsOut of the 19 analysts providing estimates for the second quarter, none have revised their estimates upward in the last 30 days. For fiscal year 2011, one analyst has raised the estimate over the last 30 days, as well as over the last seven days.Similarly, for fiscal year 2012, one analyst has raised the estimate over the last 30 days. The same analyst also raised the estimate over the last seven days.According to some analysts, many of the major currencies have appreciated compared to the USD. Two-thirds of Accenture’s business comes from international markets which should drive the company’s revenue in terms of the U.S. dollar. One analyst expects a 1% net revenue growth during the second quarter and a 2% increase for fiscal 2011.Moreover, analysts believe that the company generates less than 5% of revenue from Japan, most of which originates from the Tokyo region. So analysts expect that the magnitude of loss from the recent earthquake will be minimal for Accenture. But it is too early for them to predict the extent of loss.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsSince there weren’t many estimate revisions, there was no impact on the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the second quarter and fiscal 2011. However, for fiscal 2012, the estimate moved up a penny to $3.16 over the last 90 days.Recommendation Based on the improving business momentum and increasing technology spending, Accenture raised its revenue and earnings guidance for fiscal 2011.We are encouraged by the steady flow of new business, which is the result of increasing tech spending in 2011, although increasing competition from IBM (NYSE:IBM) may temper down growth prospects to some extent.The company has a short-term Buy recommendation (Zacks #2 Rank)."

The company’s services are specifically targeted at organizations operating in the consumer products industry.Accenture will integrate the new unit under its software business, but will use the CAS brand name. Following the acquisition, Accenture will be able to capitalize on CAS Computer’s intellectual property and its global customer base.The acquisition will help in the rapid adaptability of Accenture’s CRM service suite, particularly by customers in the retail segment. The improved solutions will enable retailers to efficiently build an in-store strategy through improved product promotions and marketing within the store, thereby boosting sales.In November 2010, Accenture took over Beijing Genesis Interactive Technology Co.

The company witnessed revenue declines across most operating groups, with the biggest revenue drop of 7.0% reported in the Communication & High Tech segment. Geographically, only the Asia Pacific region reported an increase in revenue, while the Americas and EMEA regions tumbled compared to the year-ago quarter.The company recorded consulting bookings of $3.39 billion in the second quarter. Outsourcing bookings were $3.13 billion. On the whole, new bookings for the second quarter were $6.52 billion.The operating performance of the company was also mediocre, as the operating margin declined to 12.6% in the recently concluded quarter, down from 12.9% reported in the year-ago period.For the third quarter of fiscal 2010, the company expects net revenues in the range of $5.5 billion to $5.7 billion. This takes into consideration a 5% positive foreign-exchange impact, compared to the year-ago quarter.For the full fiscal year 2010, management expects net revenue growth in the range of negative 3.0% to positive 1.0%. The company has lowered its outlook for diluted EPS for the full fiscal year by $0.06 and now expects $2.61 to $2.69. The company targets new bookings for fiscal 2010 in the range of $23 billion to $26 billion.Agreement of AnalystsOut of the 21 analysts providing estimates for the third quarter, nine have lowered estimates in the last thirty days, while only one has made an upward revision during the same period. For fiscal year 2010, eleven analysts have revised their estimates downward over the last thirty days, with no upward revisions.Most of downward revisions to estimates took place as a result of the recent economic turmoil in Europe. As some analysts believe this may have a temporary negative impact on the company's result.However, others believe that the negative news flow from Europe will not impact Accenture's results too much, since there have been relatively positive comments on demand from the company's closest competitor in the region, Capgemini. Also, the company's consulting capabilities help clients reduce cost, so the products should remain attractive in a difficult market. Moreover, a revival in demand for the company's European business is expected, driven by an improvement in client spending.Accenture is keeping a close look at the pace of conversion from pipeline and backlog to revenues, and numbers are coming down slightly as they are actually getting converted. Some believe that the company will be able to achieve the low end of its revenue growth expectation of 7.0% to 10.0% in 2011, even if the European economy deteriorates from the current level.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsThe magnitude of revisions is minimal since the company reported its second-quarter results. Overall, estimates for the upcoming quarter have gone down from 70 cents a month ago to 69 cents currently.For fiscal 2010, estimates have gone down from $2.65 a month ago to $2.63 at present. For 2011, estimates have gone down from $3.02 a couple of months ago to $2.96 currently.RecommendationDespite improving trends noticed in Accenture's businesses, new business wins and tech spending making an upward move in 2010, we remain cautious until revenue growth shows more sustained momentum.We maintain our short-term Hold recommendation."

Though total outsourcing revenue declined by about 6% in the recent quarter, new outsourcing bookings of $3.1 billion suggests positive growth in the future, led by the company’s technology outsourcing business.We have upgraded our Trefis price estimate for Accenture’s stock from $49 to $52 in part to reflect the improved outlook for outsourcing.  Below we discuss the importance of technology outsourcing to Accenture’s stock and how greater demand for outsourcing services is likely to lead to growth in Accenture’s headcount.Technology Outsourcing 21% of Accenture’s StockWe estimate that outsourcing constitutes 32% of the $52  Trefis price estimate for Accenture’s stock and that technology outsourcing accounts for the majority of this value (21% of Accenture’s stock).In 2009, technology outsourcing contributed $5.7 billion to total outsourcing revenues of $8.9 billion.  Due to the cancellation of some outsourcing deals throughout 2009, we had expected outsourcing revenues to remain flat in 2010; however, with new bookings at their highest levels in 3 consecutive quarters, we now expect slightly positive revenue growth in outsourcing.As a consequence of new bookings, we expect a rise in headcount of Accenture outsourcing professionals.Technology Outsourcing Headcount Expected to IncreaseWe believe technology outsourcing is one of the divisions where we will see additional professionals as the bookings for current quarter have been strong with 5 deals of more than $100 million each.Technology outsourcing consists primarily of software Application Outsourcing and Infrastructure Outsourcing.

First, the numbers were pretty strong, with the main drag being currency-related.From the earnings write-up (“Accenture shares rise on earnings beat”):Future bookings, at $6.6 billion – more or less equally divided between consulting and outsourcing – were also good, keeping the company on pace to continue hitting their estimates. Management granted that clients were being conservative about undertaking costlier, longer-term projects and preferred to focus on cost-cutting and expense management solutions that would make a more immediate impact on the bottom line, and this had led to some pricing pressure.Overall though, margins have been rising and attrition is down, which all fits into the thesis I laid out last September.Free cash flow for the quarter came in just under $1 billion, and the company continues to use some of that to retire shares. Cash on the balance sheet now stands at $4 billion, for a company with a market cap of $20 billion.In Q&A with analysts, management was optimistic that the recent margin expansion could be maintained. Overall gross margins for the quarter were 32.5%, and operating margins were 14.2%; these compare to historical ranges of 28% to 30% for gross margins, and 10% to 12% for operating margins. The margin boost has really helped hold the line on results, so if they can maintain those profitability levels when business rebounds, you’re looking at “incremental” earnings in the $500 million range.How is the global landscape looking? China and Latin America are still growth opportunities “regardless of the economy”; Spain, Italy, and France were cited as places that are lagging, with Scandinavia and Germany doing relatively better in Western Europe.Although guidance for the next fiscal year was not given (next quarter’s guidance was raised), an important longer-term point was raised in response to a question about expectations for next year relative to previous downturns. From Bill Green, CEO, Accenture:Accenture has been flat over the last six months (S&P 500 up 5%), though the stock is off less than the S&P 500 over the last year (-20% vs. -30%).For a large-cap stock, I find the price relative to the earnings power here to be surprisingly favorable. Even in a bad global economy, Accenture has been well-managed and its services are still in-demand at profitable rates. As the company redeems restricted stock or otherwise repurchases shares on the open market, it will increase EPS and reduce the large cash hoard – typically a good thing to have, but overkill in this case.Consulting may be a competitive business and the intellectual or human capital involved may be difficult to quantify for purposes of investment returns, but I believe the stock will be a double-digit gainer and handily outperform the market over time.Disclosure: None"

For the same period last year, free cash flow was $396.0 million. The reduction in free cash flow was driven primarily by an increase in day services outstanding (DSO) since August 31, 2009.

While it's difficult to say for sure with how broad the potential for financial problems to spill over into other industries, one company I follow that recently announced earnings (and didn't see the stock drop 20%) was consulting firm Accenture (NYSE:ACN).The underlying story with Accenture continues to be the great cash flow the firm generates, which leads to a pristine balance sheet in a time when that becomes an extremely valuable asset. Accenture ended the quarter with more than $3.6 billion in cash and no debt, after turning out more than $900 million in FCF for the quarter. On a trailing twelve month basis, the stock still trades for a single digit multiple to free cash flow – roughly 8x, after backing out the cash on hand.I see that multiple as being very low relative to the continued growth Accenture has delivered throughout the organization – be it geographically (organic double-digit growth in the Americas and Asia) or operationally (more than half of segments). Guidance was also very good, with a surge in orders for outsourcing support driving a 22% increase in bookings as companies look to Accenture to help cut and contain costs in a challenging economic environment.If there is one specific near-term catalyst I had to pick with Accenture, it would be the expanding operating margins the company should realize because attrition rate (employee turnover) seems likely to head lower given the tough job environment. A paucity of jobs, particularly well-paying ones, should increase the chance that existing consultants who might otherwise leave for greener pastures stay on board; this will result in higher productivity levels and ultimately flow through to profits.Regardless of whether it takes some incremental profitability improvements for Accenture to get the respect and multiple it deserves, the company continues to use its cash flow to diligently buy back stock. Because consulting is not a high capital expenditure industry, most of the free cash flow can be returned to shareholders via dividends (raised 19%) and buybacks ($2.3 billion spent in the last year). Lest it be left unsaid, these buybacks will inevitably translate to higher earnings per share, and if the market continues to ignore Accenture's persistence on this front, they'll eventually be able to take themselves private.Bottom line, the market doesn't seem to be a buyer of Accenture's great quarter and strong outlook. CEO Bill Green added later in the conference call that ""Credibility means everything,"" and in an environment where actions speak louder than words, the combination of continued profitability on top of a balance sheet that supports billions in share buybacks should not be ignored."

Although the $20 billion consulting giant, Accenture (NYSE:ACN), continued to beat the market’s expectations with its Q1 results, the company lowered its outlook for the coming year. Revenues of $6 billion were in line with the market’s expectations and represented growth of 6% over the year while remaining sequentially flat. EPS of $0.74 was significantly higher than the Street’s expectation of $0.68 and grew by 23% over the year. Sequentially, EPS grew by 9%.During the quarter, Accenture repurchased or redeemed 21.8 million shares for $690 million, of which 14 million shares were purchased on the open market.The company’s Resources group continued to show substantial revenue growth of 16%, driven by strong consulting growth in natural resources, utilities and energy across all geographic regions. The Public Services operating group grew by 7% over the year.Revenues from the Americas grew by 11% over the year. EMEA revenues remained flat in US dollar terms due to U.S. dollar appreciation. In local currency, EMEA revenue grew by only 4%, primarily on account of a decline in the U.K. Asia Pacific continued to grow substantially, by 22%.Accenture expects growth to come from operational excellence, rapid and sustained cost management, and M&A execution. The company expects outsourcing to meet the increasing demand for cost savings. Besides continuing demand for standard BPO operations, the company is seeing demand for application outsourcing, improvement in IT effectiveness, and post-merger integration services. Since Accenture is anything but a plain vanilla outsourcer that relies on labor arbitrage, the company is very well positioned to meet these demands.Accenture prioritized its operational focus during the year to manage supply and demand of resources in order to achieve the proper balance of skills in each market, improve SG&A and manage its cost structure through optimizing resource mix through subcontractors and consolidation.   For Q2, the company expects revenues of $5.45-$5.65 billion. The company revised down its outlook for the year from 9%-12% to 6%-10% growth. Annual bookings are expected to be $24-$27 billion with EPS of $2.78-$2.85.Given that today’s market is looking for providers it has confidence in, instead of experimenting with new vendors, Accenture rightly feels that its activity in the outsourcing space will pick up. Last week’s Satyam debacle in India will add to its case. All of this prompts me to reiterate that its global delivery model and capabilities will stand the company in good stead.The stock is currently trading at $33.44 and continues to be a good stock to hold.Disclosure: None"

It is able to offer outsourcing solutions to the financial services sector, which is looking to cut costs through outsourcing. Accenture’s technology consulting practice saw good growth as there was increased demand for systems integration and ERP solutions. Since Accenture has much more than plain labor arbitrage to offer as an outsourcer, it is best suited to compete with the various low-cost IT firms. Today, most companies are spending their IT budgets on transformational projects with focus on strategic use of technology. Accenture is one of the few companies that are able to offer this, thanks to the investments the company has been making in building these capabilities.Accenture continued to acquire companies during the quarter and concluded the acquisition of George Group, a management consulting firm focused on driving performance improvements through strategic process improvements, accelerated innovation, and streamlined operations.For the coming year, Accenture plans to implement a three-pronged strategy.

Cowen expects the August quarter's results to be at least in-line with Street's expectations, with sequential improvements in gross and operating margins. Cowen said that during the past five quarters, Accenture and its IT Services peers maintained a consistent positive view on demand trends. However, considering the increased uncertainty created by the recent events taking place in the market, the financial credit crisis and the increasing prospects for longer sale cycles and spending freeze, sector commentary from the Accenture could turn more cautious. On Sept. 19, Wachovia downgraded the IT offshore outsourcing sector to market weight from overweight, citing the recent chaos among major financial service providers, who are a key source of business for the IT offshore outsourcing sector. The financial service providers are expected to cut back further on IT spending in 2008 and 2009, given the increased level of turmoil in the equity and credit markets. Wachovia also downgraded its rating on Accenture to Market Perform from Outperform. Then on Sept 22, Deutsche Bank said it believed Accenture's fundamentals were intact despite the macro concerns. The firm did lowered its estimates on currency headwinds, however, but expect an in-line Q4. Key issues for the conference call: Commentary on forward guidance, sale cycles and spending freezes."

A quarter of 2009 is gone and the annual budget is still in flux at some companies. Accenture operating chief Steve Rohleder made the annual budget comments on its fiscal second quarter earnings conference call. The company reported earnings of 63 cents a share in its fiscal second quarter, a penny better than Wall Street estimates (statement). However, Accenture’s revenue was $5.27 billion, below estimates of $5.54 billion. Rohleder said:Accenture’s read on its client base goes something like this:Simply put, there is a lot of IT work that needs to be done, but there’s a mass pause. Accenture CEO Bill Green added:Green continued:When asked whether things have improved in March Green noted that companies are now recasting their 2009 priorities. Meanwhile, many clients have laid off workers and that makes priorities—and who will actually do the work—fuzzy.

Its 14 times forward P/E is lower than the 18 times forward P/E that industry rival EDS (NASDAQ:EDS) was recently bought for.

But Wagner notes Accenture is rapidly gaining market share and revenues are sharply up as demand for its services is so strong, it's been able to keep its prices high. Wagner notes one other thing going for Accenture: Independence.

And India continues to be a strong leverage point for Accenture’s outsourcing activities, with a new consulting center opened in the last quarter. This was also reflected in the 40% increase in staff being strongest in India and the Philippines (41% increase YoY Q1).
The more general question was, given the financial crisis, real estate crisis, oil crisis and any other calamity, how was Accenture going to handle the expectations of a rougher market in the weeks following early November 2007. At the time, CEO Bill Green believed that Accenture was strategically positioned to meet customers’ needs on a long-term basis to handle the economic turmoil of the market. So far, he has been right. Its revenue growth for Q1 was the strongest in Asia (29%), with European markets coming in second (25%) and the Americas last (11%) by percentage.
Accenture’s original guidance for 2008 Q1 was $5.46 billion. Q1 posted revenues came in mid-December reflecting an increase of 19% to $5.67 billion, beating expectations. This performance was split $3.5 billion from consulting and $2.2 billion from outsourcing. YoY gross margins were flat at 30.1% for Q1, and SG&A expenses, while at $970 million, were slightly less by percentage of revenue, showing improved cost management. Its net income posted at $506 million, which is 25% higher than was posted during the same quarter, the previous year. Accenture reaffirmed its full year revenue growth outlook of 9% to 12% versus what analysts believed would come in at 11.2% growth. However, cash was $120 million to the negative due to increased spending in operating activities ($31 million), and property/equipment purchases ($89 million).
Q2 revenue guidance has been adjusted to now project between $5.5-5.7 billion, which again is higher than analysts’ estimates of $5.3 billion.
So far, the practice of customer satisfaction through long-term client relationships has been profitable. Much of the earlier market fear was based on Accenture’s business consisting 22% in financial services.
The company's overall cash balance, after adjustment, totaled $2.47 billion versus $3.3 billion at the end of August. Given Accenture’s strength, and with a hefty cash balance in the bank, is it then conceivable that it might want to increase its leverage in India? There are numerous Indian services companies that would entertain the idea of being acquired by Accenture.
Of course, the other option is for Infosys (NYSE:INFY) and Accenture to merge, which I am sure is crossing some people's minds."

In my article Death of Indian Outsourcing, I had talked about how outsourcing companies need to come up with solutions to fight the growing inefficiencies of the cost structure in India. Labor Arbitrage strategies need to change for those in the outsourcing business who are using India as a key competitive advantage, including Accenture and IBM (NYSE:IBM), besides the 3,500 odd Indian companies. Last week, Accenture (NYSE:ACN) reported its Q2 financials for fiscal 2008. The company's revenues of $5.61 billion for the quarter met analyst expectations, and recorded an 18% increase year on year. Segment-wise, Consulting Revenue contributed $3.35 billion, or 60% of the revenue, and Outsourcing Revenues brought in the balance $2.26 billion. Both the segments grew by 18% year on year. Region-wise, Americas contributed $2.32 billion or 41% of the revenue. The American contribution is marginally down from 43% recorded the previous year. The EMEA contribution increased marginally from 49% to 50% to reach $2.79 billion, and Asia Pacific regions recorded an impressive 35% growth to reach $0.5 billion for the quarter. Its EPS grew by 42% for the year to $0.64 and was substantially higher than market expectations of $0.56. During the quarter, the company repurchased 16.3 million shares at a total cost of $549 million. For the year, the company reaffirmed its revenue growth to be in the range of 9-12%. However, the company increased its diluted EPS outlook by $0.19 to a range of $2.55 to $2.60. For Q3, it is projecting revenues of $5.85 - $6.05 billion. Today, potential outsourcing clients are looking for a vendor who comes with the ability to handle multiple processes, applications and infrastructure outsourcing. The outsourcing game is also become increasingly global, with offshore centers spreading well beyond India to China, Malayasia, Phillippines, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and elsewhere. There is also “near-shoring” interests from major multinationals. All these dynamics make the business more complex, and Accenture’s experience of operating as a true global multinational will likely stand them in good stead over the longer term. Accenture is also investing in technology partnerships that can help scale and improve the margins of its outsourced services. SaaS vendors are a good place to go for such partnerships, and as Michael Gregoire, CEO of talent management SaaS vendor Taleo discusses, these partnerships are becoming increasingly common. Lars Dalgaard, CEO of SuccessFactors, also offers a similar perspective, that BPO vendors have given up having their own technology, and are now partnering with SaaS companies. Accenture’s stock has been improving steadily as well. Since the Jan ’08 record low of $31.91, the stock has crossed $36 recording a 13% increase in the last two months.

that it will acquire NJ based and privately held Origin Digital in a
deal that is expected to close within the next 30 days. While terms of
buyout were not disclosed, I'm sure we'll read about the price at some
point in one of Accenture's future public filings.For the past few years, Origin Digital has been working primarily
with broadcast clients to streamline the content workflow problem of
signal acquisition, ingestion, transcoding, management, syndication and
delivery of live and on-demand video assets through its web-based
management tools. Its system is pretty robust and many of the major
CDNs work with or use the company for some of these services that the CDNs
don't do themselves. With Accenture taking Origin Digital's products
in-house it will be interesting to see if these services are still
going to be available to the CDNs and whether or not it will continue
to be able to re-sell them.While I never thought of Accenture as one who would be in the
digital media services business, acquiring Origin Digital gives it a
real offering in the market with the types of customers Accenture does
business with. Origin Digital's products work as advertised, it is a
small nimble company with some smart technology folks and more
importantly, Accenture looks like it plans to focus on the bigger pain
point with video owners, that being the workflow. We should know more
about Accenture's offering in the market when it officially launches the digital media portion of its website this summer.We keep hearing and reading a lot about the content delivery market,
but it's all the other pieces around delivering video that is the real
complex part. Since no standards exist when it comes to video over IP,
content owners need to figure out how to get their content in the right
format for all the syndication services and devices, while at the same
time figuring out how to scale their business and keep costs down with
that growth. The workflow for Internet based video is going to be the
biggest problem the industry as a whole is going to face 24 months from
now. Sure, we'll always need delivery, but as the business for online
video content on the web really begins to take off, and there is money
to be made, content owners are going to be struggling to figure out how
to put their content in all of the necessary formats, for all the
different devices, for all the different players and with different
levels of protection. Not to mention if you need to do this around the

Since Accenture beat by a nickel in the current quarter, the $1.88-$1.93 guidance actually would appear to indicate that earnings per share in the second half will be lower than analysts were forecasting."
24136,20422,2007-01-16T03:00:44-05:00,,"After the market closed on December 20, 2006, Accenture (NYSE:ACN) reported results that exceeded analysts' expectations. The next morning the price jumped up. For the first quarter of 2007, ending November 30, 2006, Accenture reported net revenues of $4.75 billion, an increase of 14 percent over the same period last year. GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.46, an increase of 28 percent over the first quarter of fiscal 2006. New bookings were $5.5 billion, while consulting recorded $3 billion in consulting bookings. Operating margin expanded by 50 basis points to 12.8 percent. Utilization, a key measure of staff working on revenue producing engagements, was 86%, a very good number.
By the way, Accenture expects net revenues to be $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion for the 2nd quarter of 2007.
Key drivers
The key drivers for Accenture are bookings, utilization and rate per billable hour. Since bookings are higher than sales, they may be able to generate more billable hours which will drive revenue higher. However, utilization has remained above 80% for the last 15 quarters. With last quarter’s utilization at 86%, I expect there will be some decline in billable hours due to lower utilization. This will result in lower revenue in the 2nd quarter 2007, keeping in mind that the 2nd quarter includes the Christmas and New Year’s holidays.
New contract bookings for the three months ended November 30, 2006 were $5,479 million, a decrease of $62 million, or 1%, from the three months ended November 30, 2005, with consulting bookings increasing 6%, to $2,955 million, and outsourcing bookings decreasing 9%, to $2,524 million. The average size of their outsourcing contract new bookings has decreased when compared to outsourcing contract bookings for the three months ended November 30, 2005.
While their total bookings are higher than reported revenue, they were lower in the 1st quarter of 2007 compared to the 1st quarter of 2006. The lower bookings are entirely from lower outsourcing bookings. Consulting generally has rate per hour, resulting in higher operating margins, while outsourcing usually has lower hourly rates resulting in lower operating margins, especially in the first year of the contract. As the mix of services moves in favor of consulting, the margins will increase.
As long as bookings remain higher than sales Accenture should continue to grow. Many companies are embarking on re-development of their technology that supports their business. This trend should contribute to Accenture booking new business.
On the other hand, utilization will likely drop some as consulting services become a larger part of the total services delivered by Accenture. Remember, outsourcing contracts typically have higher utilization rates than consulting services.
In summary, bookings should continue to grow with higher margins, while utilization should fall slightly, staying above 80% for now.
Management
The management of Accenture are long term employees of the company with substantial experience in the consulting and outsourcing business. As a result they understand the consulting and outsourcing business very well. The only negative is there is likely to be minimal outside perspective that can be brought to the company. This has not been a problem for Accenture in the past.
Other considerations
In the latest quarter Accenture repurchased 24.4 million shares totaling $723.7 million. At November 30, 2006, the company had $1.4 billion of share repurchase authority remaining, or 4.3% of the total market cap of $32.67.
The Company was engaged by the National Health Service in England [NHS] to design, develop and deploy new patient administration, assessment and care systems for local healthcare providers and, subsequently, to provide ongoing operational services once these systems were deployed. On September 28, 2006, the Company entered into a tripartite agreement with the NHS and Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC), an unrelated third party, under which the Company agreed to transfer to CSC all of its rights and obligations under the NHS Contracts, except those relating to the Picture Archiving Communication System. The Company expects to substantially complete the transfer during the second quarter of fiscal 2007.
In connection with the transition and wind-down of Operational Services work related to the NHS Transfer Agreement, the Company expects losses not to exceed $125,000 in fiscal 2007. On October 4, 2006, the Company remitted approximately $50,000 in settlement of liabilities in connection with the NHS Transfer Agreement. In addition, during fiscal 2007 the Company will repay approximately $120,000 to the NHS, representing the difference between the deployment and services billings that the Company received under the NHS Contracts during their terms and the amounts the Company is entitled to retain by agreement under the NHS Transfer Agreement. This amount was recorded in other accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of November 30, 2006. The Company’s remaining obligations under the NHS Contracts are immaterial.
Accenture benefits from Pre-Tax Earnings Yield of 11.4% and Pre Tax return on Capital of 135%. These are nice numbers is you are a value investor.
Conclusions
Accenture should continue to experience positive growth in the low double digits. In the 2nd quarter. I expect a slight drop in revenue and EBIT due to lower utilization and the payment to NHS. After that growth and earnings should continue to grow at low double digits through 2007.

39381,20861,2007-06-26T06:05:51-04:00,,"After reading an article in BusinessWeek (online dated July 2, 2007) about the top 100 tech companies ranked by ROE, I discovered that Accenture’s (NYSE:ACN) ROE is 66%. I then calculated its ROE for the last five years (as of August 31 for the corresponding year) and, to my surprise, I found that the ROE has reduced over the period of five years, following its astonishing high level of 131% on August 31, 2002. The following table gives a snapshot of some important numbers pertaining to its ROE for last five years.  The reason I have calculated two ROEs is to demonstrate the effect of a dual share class that has given rise to minority interest; this amount is significant as it distorts the net income. This is evident from the fact that the ROE calculated by considering net income before minority interest varies from 75% to 131%, whereas the other ROE (calculated just from net income) varies from 51% to 55%. NOTE : Return on equity (ROE) is defined as (net income / shareholder’s equity) A close look at the different components of book value reveals the following:    From the above table three things are clear: 1. The high ROE in 2002 was because of a large deficit in retained earnings that in turn reduced the book value. This started in the year 2001 ($1.43 billion deficit) when the company broke from its traditional partnership type organization and became public. The table shows that this was reduced in subsequent years and in 2006 was $1.6 billion 2. Additional paid in capital has decreased since 2002 and treasury stock has increased since then. Both together have decreased the book value. 3. As the company’s net income before minority interest grows and its effect of minority interest is reduced, so the difference between two ROEs will also be reduced.  The above figure shows the amount of treasury shares held by the company, a figure which has been changing every year. As a conservative estimate, let us assume that the number of treasury shares would have remained 6 million on August 31,2006 instead of 36 million. The amount against treasury shares would have been reduced from 869 million to 144 million. This would have increased the book value by at least 725 million, thus making the book value around $2.6 billion, making the two ROEs 37% and 53% (ROE with net income before minority interest) instead of the present 51% and 75%. Conclusion So, if you are comparing Accenture to its competitors and are impressed by its ROE, you might want to look at the details of its competitors’ book value and make sure you are comparing apples to apples."

He goes on to say (correctly) that the systems integrators would intuitively seem more interested in maintaining the status quo because the value proposition of SaaS inherently removes some of the financial opportunity the SIs capture in an enterprise-wide deployment.
I'm very skeptical about the big SIs truly embracing SaaS models anytime soon for the reasons Phil points out and others. If you give credence to the age old assertion that for every $1 spent on enterprise software another $8 is spent on systems integration consulting, it stands to reason that no other industry is more beholden toward maintaining the traditional ""big iron"" on premise software model than the established SIs.
SIs really make their money from complexity and customization. Right now, SaaS represents neither. But to be fair, even the most successful SaaS vendors have yet to push into enterprise-wide use save for a few rare customer cases. If we're to come to a day when someone like SfDC or Workday are to be deployed across a global enterprise, it's going to require a  lot of customization and integration work. In other words, stuff that makes the big SIs hearts go pitter patter.
This situation is analogous in many ways to the software testing tools market. My firm has a long-standing interest in the software testing space, most notably Mercury Interactive. Even as the company was growing in prominence and dominating the testing market while also emerging as the lead dog in application performance management, Mercury could never get material traction with the large U.S.-based SIs.  It seemed that every time Mercury held an analyst meeting or earnings call, someone would ask about progress with Accenture and others.  And every time the answer would be the same; Mercury tried to foster interest but it was slow going.  The reason Mercury had such difficulty gaining traction within Accenture was the exact reason the SaaS vendors will continue to struggle on this front for awhile longer...tools were highly valuable and necessary, but neither complex nor in need of much customization. 
Ultimately, Mercury turned its attention to the large Indian SIs (particularly Tata) and made no bones about its belief that success in that channel would perhaps FINALLY draw Accenture to the table.  As my friend Sadagopan can attest, SfDC is taking a similar approach and the Indian SIs appear more willing to embrace the potential of SaaS now.
Note: At the time of this writing I, and/or funds I maintain discretionary control over, maintained a long equity position in MERQ, CRM. We did not maintain a position (long or short) in ACN.  We also may, at times, carry derivative options on underlying positions as a hedge."
29183,20171,2007-03-12T04:56:46-04:00,,"The board of directors of Large Cap Watch List member Accenture (NYSE:ACN) approved a $1.5 billion share buyback authorization. The only question we have is: Why so little?
The amount is consistent with the company’s share repurchases in each of the last two years, so the amount was probably already factored into street expectations. The company generated $2.7 billion in cash from operations in its August 2006 fiscal year, and only needed $300 million to invest in new equipment given the knowledge-based (rather than asset-based) nature of its business.
So it would seem the company should be able to afford something more like $2 billion. But even that would cause cash to pile up further on the balance sheet, which already shows a $2.7 billion hoard against virtually no debt. And speaking of debt, maybe they should consider taking some on to recapitalize (use for share repurchases). It seems like a reasonable value at 9x free cash flow, which by our reckoning values the company as though it will not grow - and the strong cash flow should be sufficient to support a reasonable amount of debt.
The board should certainly be considering all of these options. If they don’t do it, a private equity buyer might."

Accenture, the giant consultant firm, says it wants to double its ranks of 13,000 ""management consultant professionals.""
Meanwhile, Accenture said it wants to add all those consultants in the next three years. Can you clone consultants?
The company said ""the plan to nearly double the number of these professionals will enable the company to expand the breadth and depth of its management consulting services globally, in developed markets such as the United States, United Kingdom and Germany, as well as in rapidly evolving markets such as India, China and Brazil.""
In other words, it seems that globalization is driving Accenture's consultant hiring orgy. We can't wait. Just imagine the management buzzwords these additional consultants can create. The models for business prowess will also multiply–as will the billable hours. The one downside: The return on your IT projects may not improve. After all, someone has to pay all of these new consultants."

The conference will give investors a strong  sense of the chemistry among company’s re-fortified management team. In August, Accenture switched around some operating group heads and also promoted some new folks into the top seats for certain vertical and horizontal practices. 
Analysts do not foresee any continuity issues as the successful CEO and COO remain unchanged. A key focus point during the Analyst Day will be pricing trends. Last year, management indicated that pricing was increasing enough to cover salary increases. Currently, we sense that pricing is improving more than in the past, and look for commentary on both salary inflation and pricing improvements. In addition, expect management to comment upon buckets of margin opportunity from various levers. Analysts believe that some room for efficiency gains likely still exists on both the selling & marketing and general & administrative fronts."

4382098,105561,2020-10-28T12:46:01-04:00,Adobe has seen 18% CAGR on revenue since 2013 with subscriptions revenue growing at 44% CAGR.A healthy balance sheet puts Adobe in a prime position to make significant acquisitions over the coming years.Adobe's Experience Cloud has seen a more significant drop in growth than its competitors but is still on track to gain market share.An ever-increasing move to independent online content puts Adobe's consumer-friendly suite of tools in a prime position to gain significant market share.,"Adobe (ADBE) has been a dominant force in media creation since it was founded in 1982 and released postscript the first international standard for computer printing and sparking the desktop printing revolution. The company has seen massive success with its digital content creation package creative suite, and since moving to a SaaS (Software as a Service) model in 2012 has seen revenue have a compound annual growth of 18%.The company's continuing growth of its digital media SaaS business and expansion to offer Experience Cloud a suite of analytic, marketing, campaign management and e-commerce tools looks to continue to push its share price higher. Strong revenue growth combined with high cash generation, low indebtedness and willingness to expand inorganically through acquisitions makes Adobe a prime target for investors looking for safety in a highly volatile market.Since moving to a SaaS model in 2013, Adobe's shares have risen over 1,300% vs. the S&P 500's 150% gain for the same period. Adobe has continued to outperform with limited impact from the COVID-19 outbreak and has seen shares bounce 80%+ since March lows. Adobe has an ESG rating in the top 17% of MSCI's ESG rankings with a rating of AA, with the rise of ESG. This rating is likely to help keep the momentum behind increases in Adobe's share price.Adobe's bold move into a fully SaaS model for Creative Cloud (CC) back in 2012 was the catalyst for the exponential growth seen by the firm in the last five years. Shantanu Narayen's appointment as CEO in 2007 sparked a move into the then $5.5 billion SaaS industry ($102 billion in 2019) with Adobe's first subscription product (Photoshop Express) in 2008. Since 2008, Adobe has seen subscription revenue grow from $42 million to $9.99 billion. This growth implies a CAGR from the CC release in 2012 ($673 million in Sub revenue) to 2019 of ~47% and a total revenue CAGR of 14%.The move to subscription opened Adobe's creative software to a much wider audience reducing the significant upfront cost (often over $1,500 for the suite). Adobe's SaaS model also provides greater certainty of revenue streams during challenging economic periods as firms have to maintain subscription payments rather than being able to delay an upgrade, such as in 2009 where revenue dropped 20% from the year prior due to the GFC. Lower prices allowed for both professional and home use taking advantage of a quickly growing online content market fueled by independent content creators.Source: Company Filings & Consensus Analyst EstimatesAdobe's suite of both creative and office applications appeals to a broad and ever-growing audience, as the prevalence of online media in everyday life grows so too does demand of application software for its production. Online video creation for YouTube and other platforms has been one of Adobe's main driving factors. YouTube's total users growing from 480m in 2010 to over 2.0 billion in 2020 and channels generating over $10,000 in revenue each year growing at 60% YoY, the boom in independently created online video is only picking up steam. The move to short-form video since the growth of Snapchat in 2015-16 has taken off over the last few years with TikTok doubling its userbase each year with over 30 million US adults using the app. This shift in content demand could detract from the prevalence of YouTube where content is much more often externally edited. Although as the market develops, high competition from content creators will push higher quality content as was with YouTtube and push creators to use external software.Adobe faces significant competition on an individual app basis, e.g. GIMP for photo editing or Avid (AVID) for video editing however, Adobe can offer a full suite of applications to fulfill the whole production process placing it one step above. Adobe's real competition comes in the form of an ever-changing mobile online content market. With apps like Tik Tok and Instagram Reels providing in-app editing often sufficient to edit short content, to Instagram continuously improving its in-app photo editor.With COVID accelerating a change in the way the world consumes media away from traditional media to independent creators, social media and increasingly online, Adobe sees its total addressable market for CC at $29 billion and $31 billion in 2021 and 2022. Adobe could see growth above the predicted 22% per annum growth in TAM on its creative cloud revenue, gaining market share in the mobile space with its expansion of apps and taking advantage of a claimed 4 billion potential users in the consumer market or 700 million users in the communicator market.Source: Adobe Financial Analyst Meeting – Nov 4 2019Covid is unlikely to have a material impact on the Document Cloud business which is by far the largest consumer of Adobe's e-sign and PDF products. Even given the move to work from home, the majority of these products are purchased as licenses per employee and not per install. I do expect growth to slow while economic conditions are weaker with less hiring and company expansion limits the expansion of current customers.Revenue in Adobe's Experience Cloud comes from multiple products, including analytics tools, cross-channel marketing and automation e-commerce and campaign management. Experience Cloud accounts for around 27% of total revenue up from 24% the year prior. The online experience, marketing and e-commerce industry have exploded over the past five years with firms becoming ever more reliant on online sales and presence to succeed. Adobe saw its Experience Cloud revenue grow 37% in 2019 to $2.67 billion and 26% in 2018. Adobe sees its TAM for Experience Cloud being around $84 billion in 2022 up from $56 billion in 2020, although this sector has continued to outpace estimates each year.COVID 19 has had a significant effect on the growth of Adobe's digital experience segment. Growth in Q1 2020 fell to 20.8% YoY down from 30.9% the quarter prior and significantly lower than the 2019 average of 37%. Growth in the segment continued to lag total revenue growth in Q2 at 8.1% vs. 14% total and in Q3 7.4% vs 13.8% total. The still positive growth indicated that Adobe isn't losing customers already using their Experience services. Instead, as businesses limit new spending, putting projects on hold and cutting risk on new ventures, firms' willingness to adopt new services has been severely limited.Source: Company FilingsRecent ISM services PMI reports have highlighted the return to normal for business activity with business activity in the September report at 63% (above 50% indicates an expansion of business activity and below 50% indicates a contraction) significantly up from the reading of 26% in May and 41% in June. This positive up-move in the ISM business activity number would suggest that firms are beginning to resume projects and expansions put on hold due to COVID. We can expect this optimism to bleed through into Adobe's top-line figures although with a lag as firms need time from deciding to continue (what the ISM number shows) projects to getting projects underway with contracts signed. I would expect Adobe to see a significant boost in Experience Cloud revenue from Q4 2020 or even Q1 2021 after the election uncertainty is removed.The ISM business activity report also noted Arts, Entertainment & Recreation as having the largest boost in business activity of the 16 industries that indicated an expansion. Growth in these sectors' activity will boost Adobe's digital media segment revenue as firms return to growth and adoption of new software.Source: ISM Report on BusinessCompetition for Adobe within this space is fierce. Salesforce (CRM), SAP (SAP) and Oracle (ORCL) offer similar product lines to Adobe and currently hold significantly more market share. Adobe's Experience Cloud revenues have suffered far worse than its top competitors. Adobe saw Experience Cloud revenue growth of just 16% in the 12 months up to Sept 1, 2020, compared to last year. In comparison, Salesforce saw revenue growth of 28.7% over the same period. Oracle Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Human Capital Management (HCM) revenues were up 32% in 2019 totalling $3 billion and again 32% up to June 2020 (Oracle's full fiscal year 2020) to around $4 billion. In comparison, Adobe's Experience Cloud grew 23% over the same period year over year. SAP doesn't disaggregate CRM revenues in its financial reports but grew revenue by 7.4% over this period, although CRM only accounts for around 15% of total revenues.Adobe is well known for inorganic growth into new markets. Over the past decade, the firm has acquired eight businesses with a combined disclosed real purchase price of over $9.0 billion. With a further 13 undisclosed deals, this number is likely much higher. Combined S&P 500 M&A transactions value in 2019 totalled $344 billion with an expectation for a significant fall this year as firms delay deals. However, with smaller firms struggling through the pandemic, a considerable boost in deal potential could shine through in 2021 for larger financially stable firms like Adobe.Source: Company FilingsWith a current net cash position of over $1 billion expected to rise to over $3 billion by the end of FY2020 and low levels and improving solvency ratios (Debt/Equity ratio down to 40% from 45% in January), Adobe is poised to make significant acquisitions in 2021 and beyond. Current economic conditions stand to create multiple opportunities for Adobe to expand its business and provide a boost to its return on investment. This is especially true for Adobe's digital experience segment as smaller target firms struggle to stay afloat as businesses pull back on spending.With Adobe's 2018 acquisitions of both e-commerce firm Magento and marketing automation firm Marketo, the company significantly expanded its coverage on both markets and boosted its digital experience segment revenue by ~40% in 2019 with revenue from these two acquisitions accounting for 30% of total segment sales and boosting revenue by around $700-800 million in 2019.Valuing subscription-based businesses based on the present value of future cash flows can be considered less taxing than that of other revenue streams due to the recurring nature of customer payments. Calculating future revenue comes down to two main factors: what's the churn rate (the percentage of subscribers cancelling subscriptions within a given period, typically one year) on current subscribers and most importantly for Adobe what will subscriber growth be in the future?As with many subscription-based businesses, Adobe has very stable margins. Gross profit margins for Adobe have been around 85-86% for the past five years with EBITDA margin remaining around 35% for the past three years. Most operation costs are on marketing which scales with revenue growth and is its primary driver. Second is R&D which can be unlinked from revenue growth (updating Photoshop to add a feature cost the same if there are 3 or 4 million users) but so driving it as new products and developments are the biases of future growth.Assuming Adobe manages to slowly improve these margins over time as they become more efficient and grow in scale, applying this and Adobe's relatively low CapEx (smaller amounts allow for a more significant margin of error with little effect on the result) allows us to with a high degree of certainty forecast Adobe's future free cash flow. However, there is one big caveat - future revenue growth is difficult to predict and even harder during the midst of a pandemic and political uncertainty.The below chart shows both the consensus analyst revenue forecasts and a more optimistic rebound in growth for 2021 outlook. With research predicting SaaS will grow by between 21% and 14.9% from 2020 to 2030 and 2026, the analyst consensus growth rate below with a CAGR of 14% could be on the conservative side. With revenue by far the largest variable in the valuation of Adobe when using a present value model finding a likely range of values allowing for some error remains the most accurate approach.Source: Analyst consensus estimates (Refinitiv I/B/E/S)Using analyst consensus revenue, operating margin, tax rate and assuming both debt remains at current levels and there are no acquisitions, we get a value of between $475 and $557 allowing for some variation in the discount rate and exit multiple. Given a current share price of around $470, this implies an upside of 1-18% within the next twelve months. The more optimistic revenue scenario provides a share price target in the next twelve months of $584 to $687, implying an upside of 24-46%.COVID has significantly depressed analysts' expected market return of the S&P 500 through 2030. The average annual return of the S&P 500 has been 10.1% since 1970. However, given the long-term economic impacts of both the COVID-19 outbreak and potential tax increases and greater regulation on mega-cap tech from a democratic US government, analysts have predicted market average annual market returns as low as 7.1%.The expected market return has a significant weighting in the cost of equity section for the WACC (weighted average cost of capital) calculation, which is used as the discount rate in this model. Using an expected market return of 10.1% gives a WACC of 7.6% while an expected market return of 7.1% gives a WACC of 5.5%. This significant difference in the discount rate provides substantially different valuations ($500 for a 10.1% expected market return and $583 for a 7.1% expected market return).Exit Ev/EBITDA (Enterprise value/earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) multiple selection becomes difficult when talking about high growth tech names. S&P 500 average EV/EBITDA multiples have been between 11x-14x on average for the last few years. However, the current average multiple on the S&P 500 of 15x reflects valuations continuing to climb after drops in top-line sales in the S&P from COVID. The choice of a 16x exit multiple (1.3% implied perpetual growth rate) lies within a reasonable range for a high growth tech firm in an industry expected to have double-digit revenue growth out to at least 2030.As always with DCF models, this valuation should be taken with a pinch of salt, often with these models, a percent or two change in inputs such as revenue growth, discount rate, terminal value or CapEx can have significant effects on the end valuation. However, given Adobe's limited CapEx, using the sensitivity analysis above, we can get a rough idea of the real effect of revenue growth on Adobe's valuation.Looking elsewhere for valuation comparable company P/E multiples lie on both sides of Adobe's current forward 12-month P/E of 45x. Looking at the CRM industry, Salesforce has a forward P/E of 75x. At the same time, CRM competitor Oracle sits at 14x and Microsoft (MSFT) at 33.5x. Adobe, however, is experiencing revenue growth well over both Microsoft and Oracle and aligns much more with Salesforce's level of growth in the segment. In the Digital media segment, Adobe faces competition from Autodesk (ADSK) with a forward P/E of 57x and Avid Tech with a forward P/E of 11x. However, with Adobe's industry-leading suite of creative software, the firm can easily justify its premium valuation.Although DCF models are purely an estimate of value given expectations of future cash flows, this is a positive outlook for Adobe even when looking at all assumptions from a conservative standpoint. A healthy cash position building over the coming few years, limited debt and the opportunity to increase borrowing at historically low rates make Adobe a prime target for investors looking for strong balance sheets during very uncertain times.Adobe is in a prime position to take advantage of both low rates and its strong cash generation to leverage Acquisitions going into 2021, further expanding on the growth of revenue across multiple segments. Adobe's dominant position in the digital media creation space puts it in a prime position to take advantage of a rapidly expanding market of social media and short-form content with limited competition.Adobe is a prime example of how to do SaaS right and has, since 2013, assured stable revenue streams able to weather some of the most turbulent economic conditions in recent history. Although Adobe sees valuation metrics exceeding some competitors, I believe the firm can maintain high growth over the next decade and justify its current premium."

The company's digital focus helped it deliver its best third quarter in its history despite the current pandemic conditions.Adobe's third quarter revenues grew 14% to a record $3.2 billion, surpassing the market's projections of $3.16 billion. Remaining Performance Obligation (RPO) exiting the quarter grew 18% to $10.34 billion.

Creative ARR grew to $8.29 billion, and Document Cloud ARR grew to $1.34 billion. Digital Experience segment revenues grew 5% to $838 million. Digital Experience subscription revenue grew 2% to $729 million. Digital Experience subscription revenue, excluding Advertising Cloud revenue, grew 14%.Adobe forecast revenues of $3.35 billion and an adjusted EPS of $2.64 for the fourth quarter, compared with the market's forecast of revenues of $3.36 billion with an EPS of $2.64. Adobe has also withdrawn the annual fiscal 2020 targets that were issued in December 2019.Last quarter, Adobe launched new capabilities allowing marketers to accelerate data collection across channels to enable faster experiences on real-time insights. It announced the general availability of Data Governance capabilities in its Real-Time Customer Data Platform as well as early traction with its Customer Journey Analytics service, providing customers with a full view of the Customer Journey both online and offline.Adobe recently entered into a strategic tie-up with IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Red Hat to drive real-time data security for its enterprise customers in regulated industries. The partnership will help accelerate digital transformation and enable companies to deliver more personalized experiences across the customer journey, driving improved engagement, profitability, and loyalty. Initially the partnership will focus on deployment flexibility with hybrid cloud to enable brands to manage and deliver their content and assets within any hybrid cloud environment, from multiple public clouds to on-premise data centers.As part of the agreement, Adobe will join IBM's partner ecosystem as a strategic partner and will provide CX solutions for the IBM Cloud for Financial Services. IBM will also extend Adobe Experience Manager to professionals in this industry to help them meet their security and regulatory requirements. Finally, IBM iX, the business design arm of IBM Services, will extend their offerings across all of Adobe's core enterprise applications to accelerate how global brands use data to design, implement and scale personalized customer experiences to instill trust across every aspect of their business.The current remote working and living conditions have given a strong boost to the digital signature market. According to a recent report, the global digital signature market was expected to grow from $1.5 billion in 2019 to $23.9 billion by 2030, translating to a 29% growth rate. The growth has certainly accelerated during the recent months due to the increased adoption of these services by smaller organizations as well.Adobe has been addressing this market with its Adobe Sign offering, a part of the Adobe Document Cloud family of apps. The service is well-integrated with other enterprise-related apps and uses a cloud-based system for signatures and document management. Adobe Sign offers a web-based platform along with mobile apps that allows users to scan, sign, and send their documents from anywhere.Adobe's e-signature capabilities are very similar to those offered by DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU). But Adobe Sign offers a lot of their integration options only with its enterprise level plan, thus making it difficult for SMBs to leverage Sign. DocuSign, on the other hand, has an extensive integration library that is available to its users without having to sign up for an enterprise price tier. DocuSign has managed to build a product that outshines Adobe Sign on account of integration and flexibility.The market is pleased with Adobe. Its stock is currently trading at $486.78 with a market capitalization of $233.5 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $536.88 in August.

4375557,105308,2020-09-21T16:12:01-04:00,"Adobe has been hitting quarterly revenue records for the past 24 consecutive quarters by harnessing the power of its subscription-based business model.Its operating expenses/gross profits ratio has been undergoing a prolonged decline, indicating further net income margins expansion.Based on prudent estimates and a set of quite reasonable future valuation scenarios, we believe that Adobe should be able to deliver double-digit CAGR returns in the medium term.","Back in February, we published an article titled ""Adobe: Not Expensive Despite The Recent Rally."" Since then, shares have run further by around 23%. The continuous rally in Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) shares has been the result of its COVID-19-proof subscription-based business model, which, over the past couple of quarters, has delivered robust financial performance, despite the underlying economic challenges. Source: Google FinanceHowever, with Adobe trading near all-time highs, we need to revisit the stock's investment case and assess whether its current valuation leaves room for further gains ahead.In the article, we will:Adobe's Q3-FY2020 results were another great display of the company's ability to keep on growing under any economic condition, indicating robust demand for its Creative Cloud once again. Adobe's Creative Cloud is utilized by professionals all over the world. Because of how vital the company's tools are for creative artists, video editors, VFX specialists, and various other jobs in the field, Adobe's customers are unlikely to ever cancel or pause their subscription, under any economic environment, including the recent pandemic.Adobe's continuous support, updates, feature releases, and its whole ecosystem, in general, make sure that, once a professional signs up, a predictable stream of cash flows is added to its ARR. The more Adobe expands its client base, the higher its subscription-based revenues get. During Q3, Adobe hit a new quarterly revenue record of $3.23B, a 14% increase YoY. To highlight the power of its subscription-based model mentioned earlier, Adobe has been hitting quarterly revenue records for the past 24 consecutive quarters.In other words, since Q3-FY2014, there hasn't been a single quarter in which Adobe has recorded fewer revenues than the one before it. If this is isn't impressive enough, even though Adobe's creative suite is an industry-standard, and therefore quite a mature product, it still manages to grow sales at a double-digit rate. This is during a pandemic which has caused budget cut all over the world.Further, management's Q4 revenue guidance came in at $3.55B, suggesting an 18.7% increase YoY, powered by Adobe's typical year-end seasonal strength and its strategic shift related to its Advertising Cloud business. Considering that many businesses and individual professionals may have been reserved with their spending during the past few months, Adobe was expected to deliver a more humble sales growth than usual, which indeed landed just below 14%. However, based on management's encouraging guidance, it seems like Adobe's growth levels are picking up again, which is great news for investors.When it comes to profitability, the company's net income has been consistently on the rise over the past few years, due to increased revenues and Adobe's prolonged margins expansion. Over the past four quarters, Adobe has managed to achieve net income margins of 31%, which are some of the juiciest in the tech sector. Since Adobe doesn't need to increase its R&D spending proportionally to its client base growth, the company's net income margin expansion trend is likely to continue due to its economies of scale.Because of how fast Adobe has been growing its profitability - as a matter of fact, its current 5-year EPS CAGR is 52% - investors have always been pricing its stock based on its future earnings. Hence, shares have always traded at a bit of a premium. On the back of such an EPS growth, as well as Adobe's subscription model of predictable cash flows rapidly expanding, its shares have advanced by around 68% over the past year.Let's re-examine, therefore, whether Adobe's shares remain investable, making it a worthwhile capital allocation option for current investors.As we mentioned, Adobe's valuation has always been a bit pricy, based on two factors. The first is the company's snowballing EPS growth. The second is that, as with most of the company's enjoying recurring cash flows, the stability and predictability of their business model add an extra layer of reassurance for investors, hence the premium. Still, while shares are currently reading at just under 60 times its LTM (last twelve months) earnings, the company's forward P/E is just around 43, due to strong profitability growth expectations.This has always been the case with Adobe over the past few years. Valuing the company based on its future earnings is how the stock is intended to be priced.This is exactly what we are going to do.First, let's illustrate why the company's profitability should continue growing at a much faster rate than its revenues. As the graph below displays, since 2014, when Adobe ditched its creative suite and went subscription-only, the company has been able to harness the power of the economies of scale attached to its business model.As you can see, while Adobe's operating expenses have been growing over time, their growth rate is slower than its gross profit's one. As Adobe grows its user base, its per-user cost, when it comes to operating expenses such as advertising and R&D, goes down over time. Therefore, Adobe's operating expenses to gross profits ratio has been undergoing a prolonged declining trend, currently sitting at just over 62%. This ratio declining over time is partially the reason Adobe's net income margins have been expanding, as shown earlier.Source: Data from Seeking Alpha, AuthorBelow, analyst estimates indicate an FY2025 EPS estimate of around $21.75. We believe that these estimates are quite prudent since they assume a massive deceleration of Adobe's current EPS growth. Keep in mind that Adobe is almost always beating these estimates. Still, we are going to emulate these figures in order to be prudent.Source: Seeking AlphaBy plugging in Adobe's current price ($460.45), an FY2025 EPS of $21.75, and different potential future valuation scenarios, we get the following results:As you can see, based on a reasonable future valuation range of 30 to 50 times earnings, Adobe is expected to deliver solid annualized returns. Based on the company's subscription-based revenues, and the overall leaning of tech stocks towards a premium in valuations, we believe that future P/E of around 40 is a fair multiple. This would suggest double-digit annualized returns in the low teens, in the medium term.Source: AuthorAdobe's decision back in 2013-2014 to go subscription-only has transformed its business model into a frictionless way to gradually grow its revenues at a rapid pace, while strategically planning its future moves and spending based on its predictable stream of cash flows.Quarter after quarter, sales have been hitting new records, while management's guidance points towards a similar future trajectory, with acceleration in sales picking up. Further, Adobe's profitability is set to advance at a faster pace, due to its prolonged net income margin expansion, powered by a declining operating expenses/gross margins ratio.At the same time, some risks remain. As with every company in the sector, Adobe may face some levels of increased competition in the future, which could threaten its dominancy in the sector. Adobe's competitive advantage of continuously being able to finance new tools, features, and content due to its great financials is a strong asset. Still, we can't exclude any potential competition challenges in the future. Further, the biggest risks in terms of investor returns is Adobe not delivering to its own and to the market's expectations, possibly leading to steep losses, as shares are priced with these expectations in mind. Still, considering the company's robust performance over the years, Adobe's management has displayed world-class execution skills, so this may be quite unlikely as well.Overall, we believe that Adobe's organic growth, coupled with its prolonged net income expansion trend, points towards robust profitability growth in the future. Based on relatively prudent estimates and a set of quite reasonable future valuation scenarios, we believe that Adobe should be able to deliver double-digit CAGR returns in the medium term. Hence, we are likely to be adding to our position, opportunistically."
4375535,103480,2020-09-21T15:13:09-04:00,"Adobe shares slipped ~15% despite beating Wall Street's targets in Q3, a signal that the stock has run too hot relative to its fundamentals.
        In Q3, Adobe's growth slipped to 14% y/y and the company further expects deceleration to 12% y/y growth in Q4, vs. ~20% y/y growth last year.
        While Adobe has still managed to grow earnings above its revenue growth rates due to cost optimization, this strength is already baked into Adobe's >40x P/E ratio.
        Longer-term, Adobe is a rare software product with de minimis competition and fantastic execution, but look for strategic entry points.","Betting against Adobe (ADBE) has never been a successful strategy. The software giant behind the creation of the PDF and the owner of not one, but several flagship applications like Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Lightroom and many others, has been one of the biggest long-term success stories in the tech sector. Though now a dinosaur in tech-years (Adobe turns 40 years old in 2022, making it one of the oldest tech companies in the sector and approximately the age of Google (GOOG) and Facebook (FB) put together), Adobe has averted the curse of most legacy software companies by pivoting fast and early into the cloud. Today, nearly the entirety of the company's ~$12 billion annualized revenue stream is recurring - a remarkable feat.As a software product that also doesn't rely on complex implementations or expensive investments, Adobe's business has also fared better in the coronavirus economy versus many other enterprise software companies. Year to date, Adobe's ~40% rise makes 2020 one of Adobe's best years, beating a ~3% gain in the S&P 500.Yet after the company reported second-quarter results which featured decent beats to Wall Street's expectations (which was a relief after a rare miss to expectations in Q2), shares of Adobe still peeled back ~15% and fell victim to the market-wide tech rout.My take on Adobe: this is a company with a broad, bullish future. Several key highlights that underpin Adobe's bullish thesis are:In spite of these strengths, however, it's difficult to argue with one fact: Adobe is quite expensive, especially after its generous year-to-date rally. For the next fiscal year FY21, Wall Street analysts are calling for consensus EPS of $11.17, representing 12% y/y earnings growth. That puts Adobe's forward P/E multiple at 41.9x. The company's PEG ratio, meanwhile, sits at 3.5x (P/E ratio divided by expected EPS growth percentage) - whereas the typical marker of a ""value"" stock sits much lower at a 1.0x threshold. Adobe's fall from recent peaks despite a broad-based beat in Q3 illustrates that investors are feeling cautious on Adobe's valuation as well. With the rise of headlines about tech valuations in a bubble, I'd be careful of investing in Adobe near peaks. The bottom line here: Adobe is a fantastic company that will continue to grow both fundamentally and its share price in the future. But to optimize your gains, wait until Adobe falls back down to a more appropriate valuation. Historically speaking, Adobe has tended to trade at around a ~30x P/E multiple - which, against next year's $11.17 consensus estimate, would represent a $335 share price - reverting Adobe back to where it was trading in April. I find it difficult to believe that Adobe can meaningfully expand beyond its current >40x P/E multiple when it has traded much lower in the past. Wait on the sidelines for this stock to consolidate lower before diving in.Let's now review Adobe's most recent quarterly results in greater detail. While the results were largely positive in beating Wall Street's estimates, Q2 also unfortunately marks the second sequential quarter of low-teens revenue growth for Adobe - a fall from grace from the recent quarters last year in which Adobe had managed to grow in excess of 20% y/y.Take a look at the earnings summary below:Figure 1. Adobe Q2 resultsSource: Adobe Q2 earnings releaseAdobe's revenue grew 14% y/y to $3.22 billion. This growth rate matched last quarter's 14% y/y growth rate, in which Wall Street had been expecting 15% y/y - an unusual earnings miss for a company that usually beats estimates by a comfortable margin. This time around, though, Adobe's guidance and Wall Street were both anchored to the company's new growth reality, and Adobe beat Wall Street's $3.16 billion consensus (+12% y/y) by a two-point lead. Last quarter, Adobe had noted that enterprise bookings came in slightly softer as companies quickly ratcheted back on spending to preserve cash. The company didn't specifically call out any enterprise trends in the Q2 earnings call, but did mention that SMB clients continued to see a downward impact from the coronavirus. However, overall demand remained at elevated levels, per CFO John Murphy's prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call:Unfortunately, Adobe does expect the current pattern of deceleration to sustain at least into Q4. The company's revenue guidance of $3.35 billion for next quarter implies growth slowing down again to 12% y/y:Figure 2. Adobe Q4 guidance Source: Adobe Q2 earnings releaseSlightly slower growth, however, did not prevent Adobe from achieving outsized profit expansion. Adobe's pro forma operating income grew 22% y/y to $1.40 billion, representing a very rich 44% operating margin - up three points from 41% in the year-ago quarter. Figure 3. Adobe operating incomeSource: Adobe Q2 earnings releaseLike other software companies, Adobe managed to expand margins through a conversion of its sales process to a virtual format (versus a typical in-person sales approach, which requires travel spend) and heavier reliance on its self-service channels. We don't believe, however, that this pace of margin growth is sustainable because A) once the coronavirus subsides, sales spending will ramp back up, and B) Adobe has noted it intends to pick up its pace of hiring. CFO Murphy noted as follows on the earnings call:We think both the slowdown in revenue growth plus a potential crimping in margins due to ramped-up hiring are additional reasons to be cautious on the stock while it's trading at historically high multiples.There's little doubt that Adobe is one of the most successful software stories of our age, and the fact that the company is still managing to grow ~15% y/y across a variety of product categories even after hitting its ~$12 billion revenue scale is impressive. However, at its current prices, investors are looking at far more risk of a multiples contraction than there is reward. Watch and wait on this one to drift lower from the sidelines."

Whether the global economy is in expansion mode or undergoing one of its most challenging periods in recent history, the San Jose-based company continues to deliver strong and consistent financial results, quarter after quarter.This time, revenue growth of 14% topped consensus and management's own guidance, which tends to be conservative even during times of macroeconomic stability - let alone nowadays. Better yet, adjusted EPS of $2.57 landed ahead of expectations by 16 cents, the widest gap of the past five years at least, supported by top-line momentum and stronger margins.Credit: Brayve DigitalBy now, we should all be very familiar with the key trend propelling Adobe's financial results higher in 2020: a shift to remote business and lifestyle leading to accelerated digital transformation. Fiscal 3Q20 was yet another chapter in Adobe's story as perhaps the only dominant force in the digital creative space.Of course, tailwinds alone are not enough. Even before 2020, Adobe seemed to have the right product suite for digital creators and, to a lesser extent, e-commerce operators. The company once again reported record traffic to adobe.com, widespread adoption of creative cloud app, and use of video and imaging software, including Photoshop and Lightroom.I was particularly impressed to see net new digital media ARR (annualized recurring revenue) of nearly $460 million leading to a total of $9.6 billion, well above guidance of $340 million - suggesting that the future revenue pipeline looks strong. Guidance for the upcoming quarter was even better at $540 million, just about in line with the same period last year, when COVID-19 was not yet part of everyone's vocabulary.Source: DM Martins Research, data from company's press releaseFurther down the income statement, operating margin shot through the roof: YOY expansion of about 280 bps to 43.5%. Although scale helps to explain some of the upside, perhaps the bulk of it should be credited to savings from travel and entertainment and facilities operations driven by the remote work dynamic. The management team is still ""promising"" to ramp up these costs, including investments in growth, as business normalizes in the next quarter and through fiscal 2021.Following yet another quarter of predictably solid performance, Adobe has reinforced my bullishness. In my view, this is a stock to be bought at current prices and held for the very long term, with minimal periodic selling justified only by portfolio rebalances if or as share prices continue to climb.Data by YChartsYes, ADBE is expensive - and this has been the case since I started covering the stock in 2017, back when shares were worth about one-third what they are now. As the chart above depicts, ADBE has managed to outperform the white-hot Nasdaq index (QQQ), the software sub-sector (IGV) and even the cloud computing space (CLOU) over the past year.For this reason, I understand why some value-oriented investors might choose to take a pass on this stock today. On my end, I cannot think of many other stocks in the market that check all the criteria in my storm-resistant growth investment philosophy: (1) market dominance, (2) a reliable source of recurring revenues, (3) a business model that seems to do well in economic expansion and contraction, and (4) deep pockets."
4375839,105510,2020-09-23T02:06:05-04:00,"Digital Media remains the crown jewel within Adobe, with recurring revenue rising a very impressive 23% YoY in the latest quarter.While Digital Experience is decelerating, overall margins are trending positively.The current multiple seems expensive, but the growth and margin expansion outlook within Digital Media alone more than justifies the price tag.","Adobe's (ADBE) latest quarter was no surprise – yet another beat and raise on strength in Digital Media, which offset the lagging Digital Experience segment. On balance, Digital Media remains the key to the ADBE story. As a best in class software asset capable of delivering sustainable, double-digit recurring revenue growth while also benefiting from operating margin expansion, I see the segment as ADBE's crown jewel.On the other hand, the path ahead for the Digital Experience segment is relatively less visible and will require a higher level of investment to drive its growth trajectory. That said, at current prices, I believe the Digital Media segment alone justifies Adobe's current market cap, with Digital Experience upside essentially a free option to the valuation case.For the latest quarter, ADBE reported broad-based momentum in Digital Media, with enterprise and education channels as well as Document Cloud contributing to net new annual recurring revenue of >$458m. Specifically, Document Cloud ARR increased ~$98m for the quarter, while Creative Cloud contributed the remaining ~$360m.Source: Earnings Script and SlidesClearly, Adobe is benefiting from the heightened demand for creative content and digital workflows. For instance, Creative Cloud generated record traffic and improved retention through increased customer engagement, while Document Cloud saw a rebound in enterprise offerings, specifically with Sign, as enterprise bookings grew >200% YoY. Building on the momentum, the company also released Document Cloud Resource Hub for Education and plans to pursue FedRAMP Moderate status.By revenue, the Digital Media segment rose 19% YoY, with Document Cloud rising 22% YoY and Creative Cloud up 19% YoY. Total Digital Media net new ARR additions of $458 million drove the overall Digital Media ARR balance to $9.6bn (+23% YoY).Source: Company FilingsSomewhat surprisingly, management guided 4Q net new recurring revenue at $540m, which implies an ARR balance of $10.2bn, signaling continued YoY strength in the near term. Yet, relative to historical 3Q/4Q seasonality, the ARR guide points toward some slowdown – ARR has typically risen at a 6-7% QoQ pace (vs. the implied 5-6% for the upcoming quarter). This highlights ADBE's status as a work-from-home beneficiary; that said, ARR is still moving at a healthy pace, which is a positive, in my view.Source: Company FilingsWithin the Digital Experience segment, Advertising Cloud was the key detractor, driving a relatively flat revenue growth YoY. Subscription revenue ex-advertising cloud grew 14% YoY, though, as the company continues to work with customers to wind down the transaction-driven ad network business in Advertising Cloud.Source: Earnings Script and SlidesOn the whole, Digital Experience subscription revenue growth decelerated to 7% YoY in 3Q, but current guidance is calling for another step down to ~1% YoY in 4Q. That said, promising leading indicators such as the rising adoption of Adobe Experience Platform and the AEM cloud service across both existing and new customers, as well as significant QoQ growth for Commerce offerings, point toward a business well-positioned to capture a potential recovery in customer spend.Source: Company FilingsOn the bright side, CFO John Murphy commented that he believes 2Q was the trough, and with the demand coming through the pipeline, reacceleration is possible should the macro backdrop begin to normalize.On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin hit a record 43.5% (+280bps YoY), benefiting from stronger revenue, subdued travel and facilities expense, as well as a hiring slowdown (though this will ramp back up from 4Q). On balance, non-GAAP EPS of $2.57 was well above consensus at $2.41.Source: Earnings Script and SlidesWith operating margins expanding significantly to 43.5%, the focus appears to be firmly on growth going forward, with future margins set to fluctuate in line with spending patterns. Thus, given the plan is for investments to be focused particularly on 4Q, the current 4Q guide for EPS of $2.64 and ~18% YoY revenue growth implies ~40-50bps QoQ contraction in operating margins, by my estimates.Source: Company Filings, Author's EstFurther, while COVID has provided savings from lower travel and slower hiring, expect this to normalize as the economy opens up. Management interestingly noted that it does not expect the travel budget to return to pre-COVID levels given the success of the recent virtual shift.As of 3Q, Adobe has pulled back on its share repurchases, citing the ongoing uncertainties, but it still did buy back ~1.5m shares in the quarter for $617m. That implies ~$2.9bn in the $8bn buyback authorization, which runs through FY21.Source: Company FilingsHistorically, the company has used up the share repurchase capacity before the expiration date, but I wouldn't count on this trend continuing in the near future. Per management, in the current environment, Adobe's priority for capital allocation (in order) is reinvesting back into the business, strategic M&A, and then share repurchases.This might sound strange given ADBE's current multiple, but I think its core Digital Media business remains underappreciated by investors. For one, the asset has a track record of 20-30% YoY recurring revenue growth rates and looks set to sustain >15% YoY ARR growth going forward. Plus, the competitive intensity has been limited, allowing it to sustain margins in the mid-50s%, with a clear path toward reaching 60% segment margins in the coming years.Source: Company Filings, Author's EstThus, the current ~$227bn EV the market assigns to ADBE implies a fwd <30x EV/EBIT multiple on Digital Media EBIT alone. This screens cheaply relative to software peers with similar growth/margin profiles, which typically trade at a premium. With that in mind, I see upside to ADBE valuations from Digital Media should it continue to execute in line with expectations, with improvements in the Digital Experience segment representing option value to the valuation.Key risks include below-trend growth in ARR or subscribers on COVID-19 enterprise and SMB weakness, product launch disappointments, as well as the post-COVID pace of expense growth."
4374336,92586,2020-09-15T06:33:03-04:00,"Adobe is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter results on Tuesday. History suggests that the company will likely deliver an all-around beat.I expect to see the same dynamic at play: favorable trends in remote work, schooling and digital content creation pushing revenues higher.Adobe is a stock to own, not trade, as shares have climbed much more often and further than they have corrected.","It is time for software giant Adobe (ADBE) to deliver, perhaps, another of its trademark ""bare bones all-around beat."" The San Jose-based company is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter results on September 15, after the closing bell.Over the past five years at least, Adobe has met or slightly surpassed EPS expectations each quarter, while also delivering revenue growth of at least 14%, even through the thick of the COVID-19 crisis. This time, analysts expect sales growth to decelerate to 11.5%, which is very much in line with guidance. Consensus EPS of $2.41, on an adjusted basis, is also aligned with management's outlook.Credit: NeowinLast quarter, Adobe benefited from trends in remote schooling, social content creation and widespread use of digital documents as a result of the ""COVID-19 economy."" Top-line headwinds came from the company's smaller experience segment, hurt by weakness in professional services and the unwind of the advertising cloud business. The bottom line benefited from lower expenses, a result of Adobe's ""wait and see"" approach to the pandemic and its implications.Regarding the top line, I would be surprised to see a different dynamic at play in fiscal third quarter. Technology trends are here to stay, and Adobe's subscription-based model implies that previous tailwinds in customer acquisition are likely to be ""sticky."" On the flip side, advertising cloud should remain a soft spot, although this time fully captured by guidance and unlikely to catch anyone by surprise.The management team promised more investment in the business, now that the thick of the economic crisis seems to have been left behind. Therefore, I anticipate richer expenses in fiscal third quarter - although not beyond expectations, since Adobe has control over the cost levers and will likely keep expenditures within budget.Below is the yardstick against which Adobe will be measured this Tuesday.Source: Adobe's investor relations page My investment management diligence prevents me from aggressively adding any particular stock to my All-Equities SRG - an allocation of around 10% is my upper limit. But if I were given a hall pass and could choose one name to concentrate a portfolio into, ADBE would likely be my top choice.I explained a few months ago that this stock is the poster child of my storm-resistant growth strategy due to the company checking all the necessary boxes: (1) market dominance, (2) a reliable source of recurring revenues, (3) a business model that seems to do well in economic expansion and contraction, and (4) deep pockets.Data by YChartsThe perceived problem with this stock is, and likely always will be, its rich valuations. The chart above shows that ADBE is more expensive than other names within its peer group, at a forward EV-to-sales ratio of nearly 18x. Not only that, but the multiple has expanded the most so far this year, outpacing high flier salesforce.com (CRM). Probably for this reason, I often hear potential investors say that they would rather wait for a pullback before buying shares.But at least until now, ADBE has climbed much more than it has corrected. Take September as an example. The stock has been down 9% from the peak reached earlier in the month. But even so, investors who waited since last earnings season for this pullback have missed out on a 19% rally that has beaten the S&P 500 (SPY) by a solid eight percentage points. In fact, buying shares ""on the dip"" now would still be pricier than buying them three weeks ago. The story keeps repeating itself, so why bother trying to get the timing right?For this reason, I believe that ADBE is a stock to own at current prices, before or after earnings (absent an unprecedented hiccup in performance in fiscal third quarter), not one to trade in anticipation of a better entry point."
4375469,105812,2020-09-21T11:28:46-04:00,"Adobe's business is centered around digital media and digital experience.Adobe's comprehensive product offering is unmatched in breadth, even by it's most formidable competitors.Adobe's financial results in Q3 showed continued strength, despite slowing growth in the Digital Experience segment.Adobe is still a buy for longterm investors.","Adobe (ADBE) provides tools, applications, and services that help their customers do everything from creating digital content to orchestrating data-driven, personalized marketing campaigns. Adobe's business is centered around digital media and digital experience, against the backdrop of artificial intelligence and machine learning, meaning the company should continue to benefit from global digitization-this makes Adobe an attractive long-term investment.Adobe primarily generates revenue from two business segments: Digital Media and Digital Experience.Digital Media: This segment can be broken into two subsegments: Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Document Cloud. Creative Cloud is a subscription-based offering of cloud-based applications, tools, and services that allow creative professionals to design, create, and publish content. This segment includes well-known names like Adobe Photoshop and Premiere. Document Cloud provides document-related services through products like Adobe Scan and Adobe Sign.Digital Experience: This segment is a subscription-based offering of cloud-based software applications and services that help data analysts and marketers create, manage, execute, measure, and optimize the customer experience across multiple channels.Adobe estimates their total addressable market (NYSE:TAM) at ~$128 billion. This figure represents 10x current TTM revenue. Specifically, Adobe places their Digital Media TAM at $44 billion (5x TTM revenue) and their Digital Experience TAM at $84 billion (25x TTM revenue). So, while there is plenty of room for growth in both segments, Digital Experience is clearly the bigger opportunity.But revenue growth in the Digital Experience segment slowed to 5% and 2% in Q2'20 and Q3'20, respectively. Is there a problem?Let's take a closer look at that segment before diving into financial metrics.Adobe's Digital Experience segment, also called the Experience Cloud, is composed of a variety of cloud-based software applications and services, all built on Adobe Sensei (artificial intelligence platform) and the Adobe Experience Platform (collects and prepares data). The underlying Adobe Experience Platform can ingest data from internal sources and third-party sources, such as cloud storage infrastructure like Microsoft (MSFT) Azure or Amazon (AMZN) Web Services, customer retention management software like Salesforce (CRM), enterprise resource planning software like SAP (SAP), and payment platforms like PayPal (PYPL).The graphic below provides an overview of Adobe's Experience Platform (i.e. the foundation of the Experience Cloud).Source: Created by the author using information from Adobe Investor Relations.As a whole, the Experience Cloud provides businesses with a variety of tools-relating to analytics, marketing, and commerce-that help collect and analyze customer data in real time, build identity profiles, create targeted marketing content, and deliver personalized digital experiences across marketing channels.Adobe has been restructuring the Digital Experience segment in recent quarters, primarily through the discontinuation of the Adobe Advertising Cloud. This has negatively impacted revenue growth within the segment. And, in the short term, it will continue to negatively impact growth. But meanwhile, by reducing the costs of revenue associated with Advertising Cloud, which are high relative to other areas of the Digital Experience segment, Adobe's overall gross margins have improved by 125bps YoY to reach 86.8% in Q3'20.Additionally, by leaving advertising to other businesses that focus on advertising, like The Trade Desk (TTD), Adobe can focus on other core competencies, like content, analytics, and marketing. So, to summarize, Adobe is cutting costs associated with Advertising Cloud to focus resources on three growth opportunities. These three growth opportunities are enumerated below, along with a description of the corresponding products:1. Data & Insights: Products include Adobe Analytics, Audience Manager, Customer Journey Analytics, and Real-Time Customer Data Platform. These products focus on analytics, allowing businesses collect and analyze customers' data. For example, let's say you run a business and you notice a large increase in traffic on your website. Adobe Analytics can help you analyze that data and determine how these potential customers are reaching your site. Are they clicking on email ads? Search results? Social media? You can also gather other information, such as conversion rates from each of these segments (i.e. the number of people who made a purchase). Likewise, the Real-Time Customer Data Platform would allow you to use all that data and analysis to create customer profiles, which can then be utilized through other applications.2. Content & Commerce: Products include Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Target, and Magento Commerce. These products focus on targeted content delivery and providing e-commerce functionality. For example, Magento Commerce could help your businesses easily build and manage an online storefront. And Adobe Target would allow you to automate the personalization of webpage content, using relevant data to create the best experience for each customer in terms of page layout, recommendations, etc. The following video shows Adobe Target in action.3. Customer Journey Management: Products include Adobe Campaign, Marketo Engage, and Journey Orchestration. These products help businesses personalize marketing campaigns, and manage customer journey from beginning to end. For example, Journey Orchestration utilizes data to help plan future marketing campaigns. Let's say you have two customers with items in their carts; one abandons the cart and the other completes the purchase. What do you do next? Through Journey Orchestration, the customer that abandoned the cart could receive marketing material that offers a discount on that product, and the customer that completed the purchase could receive marketing material that offered deals on complementary products. Accordingly, Adobe Campaign helps create multi-channel marketing campaigns (i.e. mail, email, mobile push notifications), using data to determine which channel is most appropriate for each customer.The graphic below puts the entirety of Adobe's Digital Experience segment in perspective, from the foundational platforms (Adobe Experience Platform and Adobe Sensei) to the top tier applications I've just discussed.Source: Created by the author using information and graphics from Adobe.Adobe has grown revenue at 21% since 2014. This trend is shown in the graph below:Source: Created by the author using data from Adobe Investor Relations.But in Q3'20, revenue growth decelerated to 14.0%. This is slightly worse than the deceleration to 14.2% in Q2'20. In general, 14% revenue growth isn't bad. But this was largely driven by the deceleration in the Digital Experience segment. And I think some investors are concerned about that, as Adobe's stock price has dropped nearly 8% since reporting earnings on September 15.But I think these investors are missing the bigger picture. While the deceleration in revenue is not ideal, I believe the trend will reverse and revenue will reaccelerate eventually.Why do I think that?As I mentioned earlier, Adobe is in the process of discontinuing the Adobe Advertising Cloud. Management warned investors this would negatively impact revenue growth in the short term. And it has. But long-term, Adobe's Digital Experience segment addresses an enormous market. Adobe estimates their Digital Experience TAM to be ~$84 billion, or ~25x TTM revenue within that segment. That's an enormous amount of room to grow.More importantly, remaining performance obligation (RPO) reached $10.34 billion in Q3'20. This represents 18% YoY growth. RPO is the combination of deferred revenue and backlog (i.e. unearned revenue + performance obligations not yet invoiced). RPO growth of 18% is 400bps above the revenue growth figure for Q3'20. This is a strong indicator that Adobe's revenue growth could reaccelerate in future quarters. Will it happen next quarter? I don't think so. It seems more likely that revenue growth will reaccelerate by Q2'21 (i.e. one year after Adobe started to discontinue Advertising Cloud).Despite slowing revenue growth, free cash flow (NYSE:FCF) growth remains strong. Since 2014, Adobe has grown free cash flow at 29% annually. This number accelerated to 30% YoY in Q3'20, as TTM FCF reached $4.9 billion. FCF growth is depicted in the graph below:Source: Created by the author using data from Adobe Investor Relations.Likewise, Adobe's profitability has increased substantially since 2014. EPS has grown at 59% annually during that time, though growth has slowed to 40% annually since 2016 and profits only grew 22% YoY in the most recent quarter. But if revenue growth reaccelerates, I would expect this metric to reaccelerate as well.Finally, Adobe's balance sheet remains strong, with $5.3 billion in cash and short term investments compared to $4.7 billion in debt and lease obligations. Book value has increased at 9% annually since 2014. And return on equity has been trending upward over the same time period, reaching 33% in Q3'20. This indicates very efficient generation of profits, and represents more the double the S&P 500 average of 14%.Adobe has significant competition across various markets. In marketing, digital experience, and digital commerce platforms, Adobe competes with Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce, SAP, and many other companies.But Adobe's comprehensive offering, including both Digital Media and Digital Experience, creates an ecosystem of products that no competitor can match. Products like Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro are the gold standards in graphic design, photo editing, vector graphics, and video editing, respectively. And while Adobe was not a first mover in the Digital Experience market, they have become a market leader, as is evidenced by their leadership position in several Gartner Magic Quadrants, including multi-channel marketing hubs, digital experience platforms, personalization engines, web content management, and digital commerce platforms. Additionally, Adobe's Digital Experience platform has been named a leader by Forrester Research.Source: Adobe.As indicated, Adobe is often a leader alongside Salesforce, Oracle, and SAP, but even these formidable competitors cannot match Adobe's offering in the Digital Media segment. Simply put, Adobe stands alone in terms of the breadth of its comprehensive offering. And both segments of Adobe's business are further fortified by high switching costs and network effects.Accordingly, Adobe trades at ~18.3x sales. A high valuation compared to the S&P 500, which currently trades at 2.4x sales. But more importantly, this is a high valuation compared to its competition.Data by YChartsInvestors should be aware of this. Adobe is an excellent company, and I believe an investment today will outperform the market over the next 5-10 years. But will the stock be up tomorrow? Next week? Next year? Maybe. Or it may be down 20%.Adobe is the third largest SaaS provider in the world, behind Microsoft and Salesforce. The breadth of their product offering is unrivaled by any competitor, and they are considered a leader in many of the markets in which they operate. And while growth in the Digital Experience segment has slowed in recent quarters, I believe it will reaccelerate eventually. And when it does, the higher gross margins attained through discontinuation of Adobe Advertising Cloud should make the company is even more profitable.Additionally, Adobe still has a tremendous market opportunity, which they estimate to be ~$128 billion. And that number may expand as they enter new markets. But even if it doesn't, the current estimate represents more than 10x trailing twelve month revenue.Will Adobe's stock price rise 10x in the next 10 years? I highly doubt it. The days when Adobe could produce a 900%+ return in 10 years are in the past. But that doesn't mean this is a bad investment. If Adobe keeps revenue growth around 15%, and is afforded a PS ratio near 18x (as it is today), Adobe stock could double over the next five years, and possibly triple or quadruple over the next decade.Adobe has a strong history of innovation, execution, and strategic acquisitions (i.e. Omniture, Neolane, TubeMogul, Magento, and Marketo all helped the Adobe Experience segment become what it is today). And with exciting new markets on the horizon, like augmented reality (Adobe Aero), I believe Adobe will continue to be a leader in Digital Media and Digital Experience for many years to come. For this reason, Adobe is still a buy for long-term investors."
4374594,69905,2020-09-16T04:18:11-04:00,Adobe's Q4 2020 guidance points towards 12% y/y growth rates.Adobe's Q3 2020 profit margins are astoundingly high at 43%.The stock is not overpriced at 16x its 2021 revenues.,"Adobe (ADBE) continues to steadily grow and report resounding results. Even though the stock has vastly outperformed the S&P500 (SPX) in 2020, investors are only being asked to pay 16x its 2021 revenues.Given Adobe's very high-profit margins and its well-diversified portfolio, I believe that long-term investors have a lot to be content about owning this investment. Here's why:Source: author's calculationsIn the graphic above, I've not included small revenue sources outside of its two core segments, such as Publishing.We can nevertheless get a clear indication of Adobe's biggest revenue driver -- its Digital Media segment.Adobe's Digital Media segment holds its Creative Cloud, a unit is responsible for designing and creating content. Within its Digital Media segment, Adobe holds its Acrobat family of products and strong suites such as Adobe Sign, and Photoshop.Meanwhile, its smaller segment, Digital Experience which reaches close to 26% of total revenue, is focused on data, insights, and commerce. Adobe is divesting of Advertising Cloud.Incidentally, as a reminder, it was not long ago that Adobe made two large acquisitions, $5 billion for Marketo and $1.6 billion for Magento. Both of these businesses are integrated within Adobe's Experience segment.Hence, one could make the case that these acquisitions were not particularly strong uses of capital.Having said that, this has certainly helped to diversify Adobe's revenues away from being overly contingent on its Digital Media opportunities. Digging further into Adobe's Q3 2020 results, during the earnings call, Adobe's CEO Shantanu Narayen put a spotlight on Adobe's Creative Cloud and Document Cloud units as benefiting from the current environment and being strong revenue drivers for Adobe -- both included within Adobe's Digital Media segment. Narayen proclaimed that whole ranges of users from students to social media influencers to business communicators are turning to Adobe to create and amplify their stories and that during this ''new era'' of digital storytelling, Adobe is well-positioned.Continuing the theme we heard last quarter, Narayen declared that customers are turning to Adobe to assist them in customer acquisition all the way through renewals, through digital.However, when all is said and done, investors are still having to contend that this household name is now reporting slowing growth rates.Source: author's calculations, *company guidanceAdobe, like any public company, typically low balls its guidance to allow for ample room to beat estimates. However, even if we base our assumption that Adobe can beat its Q4 2020 guidance by as much as 1% to 2%, its growth rates would still be a shadow of the growth rates it reported in the same period a year ago, which saw growth rates top 20% y/y.On the other hand, it appears that analysts are expecting even less than 12% growth rates from Adobe.Source: SA Premium ToolsPut simply, as long as Adobe is able to report at close to mid-teen growth rates, this should allow Adobe to easily beat analysts' low expectations for the company.Superficially, the stock appears richly valued.While Adobe trades for 19x forward sales, readers should keep in mind that Adobe is right now within its Q4 2020 quarter, thus meaning that investors should be thinking of its forward sales as 16x its 2021 revenues.Accordingly, paying 16x forward sales is not particularly cheaply valued. But it's not exuberantly priced either.Investors in Adobe are investing alongside a highly profitable free cash flow machine.Consider this, in other stock, investors are paying 20x forward sales for companies where they have no idea of their ability to generate strong free cash flows.While Adobe for its part is reporting solid teen growth, with its Remaining Performance Obligation (''RPO'') are up 18% y/y and bookings during the quarter over 15% y/y.What's more, during Q3 2020, disciplined management of working capital and onetime savings around travel and facilities and in-person events, altogether played a role in Adobe's cash flows from operations reaching a record $1.4 billion during the quarter, compared with $923 million in the same period a year ago -- more than $500 million increase y/y.As a way of comparison, ServiceNow (NOW) is another company that is benefiting from the world's digital transformation, and despite having non-GAAP profit margins of just 28% compared with Adobe's non-GAAP profit margins of 43%, it trades at approximately to 20x its forward sales.In sum, this reinforces the thesis that Adobe is not exuberantly priced relative to intrinsic value.Adobe continues to tick along and is the kind of stock that investors should consider if they are not looking for much excitement. Moreover, despite being unexciting, the stock is up more than 50% in its year-to-date performance, vastly outperforming the S&P500 which is only up 6% over the same period."
4368015,21702,2020-08-12T13:21:28-04:00,"Adobe is the premier global provider of tools for creating print, digital, and video content.The company's move to a Creative Cloud subscription service delivers many benefits to itself - and more importantly - to customers.Q2 results were excellent given the current economic contraction due to COVID-19.But Q3 guidance was light in my opinion, and the company's stock appears fully-valued and then some.","Adobe (ADBE) dominates the global market for content creation software with its two iconic products: Photoshop and Illustrator. Both products have continually developed and grown - both organically and through acquisitions - over the years to offer its customers a superior suite of tools for print, digital, and video content creation. With the advent of the Creative Cloud, Adobe has created a software tool that creates even more: a steady and growing stream of cash.Adobe's strategy has progressed from single-point solutions to the bundled ""Creative Suite"", to the ""Creative Cloud"" - which is now offered exclusively through a subscription model. The Creative Cloud software-as-a-service (""SaaS"") model has many benefits for Adobe (and its customers):And, as we all know, the Document Cloud continues to be supported by one of Adobe's earliest creations: Acrobat and the ubiquitous PDF file format. With the global explosion in the number of mobile devices, the need for a file format that is usable on any screen, on any device, is now more critical than ever before. It should be no surprise that Acrobat is now a $1 billion business.Adobe's Q2 EPS report was nothing short of fantastic. Highlights include:The results were a confirmation that the company's new recurring model was a success. That's impressive considering current COVID-19 induced macroeconomic uncertainty.Adobe does not pay a dividend, it returns capital to shareholders through its buyback program. During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.6 million shares. The company ended the quarter with $3.04 billion in cash and cash equivalents - up a whopping ~50% yoy and an estimated $6.27/share based on the 485 million fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter.Due to uncertainty with respect to the COVID-19 global pandemic, Adobe has withdrawn its previous full-year 2020 guidance, but the company did provide Q3 guidance:Source: Q2 EPS reportNote the typical summer seasonality in that the Q3 guidance for EPS of $1.78/share is well below Q2's $2.26/share - so it is important to view the guidance in relation to last year's Q3 EPS of $1.61/share, which equates to an increase of 10.6% yoy. Meantime, the important Digital Media Segment revenue expectations show strong growth: 16% growth yoy overall and ~$340 million new ARR.It's hard to make any long-term predictions about EPS growth-based performance during the acute macroeconomic stress as a result of COVID-19, but Q3 guidance appears to be on the light end of the spectrum. As a result, Adobe's revenue and EPS growth may be slowing. That's a risk considering the company's current valuation: a P/E=54 and a $200+ billion market cap.A counter-argument is that Adobe has a wide-moat when it comes to competition, the balance sheet is strong and easily able to navigate the current economic contraction due to COVID-19, and there is excellent visibility into the short- and mid-term revenue stream.From an employee standpoint, software developers are easily able to work from home. As a result, working through the COVID-19 pandemic should not be a problem for the vast majority of Adobe's workforce.Adobe is a leading SaaS provider with a very successful long-term track record. The move to the exclusive subscription model for its Creative Cloud bundle has many advantages for both the company and its customers. However, given the combination of relatively light guidance for Q3, combined with a stock that is arguably fully-valued, it's hard for me to pound the table that the stock is a buy here.The company could earn $9.75/share this year, for a forward-looking P/E=45. Too rich for my taste. If I was a shareholder, I'd HOLD. If not, recommend investors put ADBE on their watch list and wait to pick-up shares on a significant market pull-back. I'd be a buyer under $400.Source: Yahoo Finance"
4370960,104442,2020-08-26T16:54:10-04:00,"On the one hand, ADBE - as a digital leader with a huge economic moat - is a clear beneficiary of an increasingly digital world.On the other hand, ADBE is fueling the digital transformation and enabling individuals, companies, educational & public institutions to continue business or even increase sales despite a challenging market environment.In this article, I want to discuss the key reasons why ADBE is a must-have for investors in the the long term by presenting its strengths and weakness.Furthermore, I will evaluate if Adobe is worth an investment in the short term despite its recent run-up by presenting my fair value calculation based on a DCF approach.","Today, I would like to publish my first article about another of my favorite tech stocks named Adobe (ADBE), which is unfortunately still missing in my article collection on Seeking Alpha, among a few others.To be honest, I am a bit surprised that Adobe enjoys so little attention from investors. In my opinion, Adobe is an absolute necessity in an increasingly digital world, not only for businesses and creative individuals, but also for far-sighted and long-term oriented investors. At the same time we are consciously or unconsciously in daily contact with Adobe's products through its Acrobat Reader, Photoshop and PDF-documents.While the stock tends to enjoy less public attention, Wall Street seems to agree with me. The following chart compares Adobe's performance against the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 index over the last five years. As you can see, Adobe has achieved an impressive performance of around 541%, outperforming the two major indices by far.(Adobe's performance vs. S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100. Source: YCharts)Even in a comparison with the tech mega-caps, Adobe has no need to hide itself, as the following chart shows. Adobe follows closely behind Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in the rankings, which has delivered an impressive performance of over 600% over the last five years (see following figure).(Adobe's performance vs. tech mega-caps. Source: YCharts)Going forward, what can be expected from Adobe stock and what are the reasons that could lead to a further upside in Adobe's share price? Considering the recent run-up despite a challenging environment due to the pandemic, is the stock worth an investment right now? What are potential catalysts and obstacles? What is Adobe's fair value?These are the questions I would like to address in the context of this article.(Adobe analyst meeting slide. Source: Adobe)First, Adobe offers a wide range of software solutions in the areas of design, marketing and entertainment (e.g. photo, audio, video, augmented/virtual reality, 3D, document editing and processing, analytics and customer insights, e-commerce, advertising, e-learning) and addresses nearly the complete range of potential target groups (e.g. individuals, freelancers, small-, medium- and large enterprises, educational, public and private institutions, consumers, students).The following figure illustrates Adobe's whole range of product offerings and software solutions.(Display of Adobe's whole range of software solutions and product offerings. Source: Adobe Financial Analyst Meeting, November 4, 2019)Second, with regard to competition, it is hard to name a direct major competitor to Adobe's offerings. This demonstrates the company's unique market position, huge economic moat and global leadership in its own niche.For instance, the following graph illustrates Adobe's peers according to Seeking Alpha. But none of them is a direct competitor to Adobe in the areas of creativity, design and document processing. You will see similar results on other platforms.(Adobe's potential peers. Source: Seeking Alpha)Additionally, the recent acquisitions of Magento and Marketo will enable expansion of Adobe's ecosystem by further integration of solutions in the areas of e-commerce, marketing, artificial intelligence and machine learning.Furthermore, by using Adobe's services, you will experience that Adobe's company policy is designed to monetize all of its software and product offerings as soon as possible. On the other hand, customers are willing to pay due to the provided value of these offerings.Third, Adobe has a huge total addressable market (TAM) with regard to its software solutions and product offerings. According to the company's financial analyst presentation in 2019, the projected TAM for Adobe's main segments is amounting to $128B in 2022.In this context, it is noteworthy that Adobe's business consists of the two main segments called Digital Media and Digital Experience. Digital Media comprises the business areas of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud.Digital Media appeals to all target groups and includes software solutions for content creation, photo, video, graphic, movie design as well as designing e-learning, training and social media content. Document Cloud focuses on Acrobat, PDF mobile and web services (such as create, sign, edit, share, compress).According to the company's presentation in 2019, the Digital Media segment has a projected TAM amounting to $31B in 2022.Digital Experience, on the other hand, focuses on corporate clients and offers product solutions and software offerings in the areas of advertising, marketing, analytics, e-commerce as well as data insights, customer journey and content management.The Digital Experience segment has a projected TAM of $84B in 2022 according to the company's presentation in 2019.The following figure illustrates a detailed breakdown of Adobe's TAM in the different segments.(Breakdown of Adobe's TAM in the different segments. Source: Adobe Financial Analyst Meeting, November 4, 2019)Fourth, Adobe has demonstrated double-digit revenue and profit growth for years. For the past five years, the average revenue growth rate was 22% and the average net income as well as EPS growth rate was 62% for the past five years.At the same time, the company had a very strong net margin and net income expansion during the past five years. While revenues more than doubled since FY 2015, net income has almost grown fivefold during the same time period (see following figure).(Net margin breakdown for FY 2019. Source: Adobe 10K FY 2019)While, according to the company's financial analyst meeting in 2019, Digital Experience has an about twice as high projected TAM, revenues for FY 2019 in the Digital Media segment were more than twice as high as in the Digital Experience segment.Consequently, based on the company's TAM projections for both segments amounting to $128B for 2022, there is still an enormous growth potential from an operational point of view (see following figure).(Adobe's revenues by segment. Source: Adobe 10K FY 2019)Additionally, as can be seen from the figures for 2019, around 90% of Adobe's revenues consist of subscriptions, i.e. recurring revenues with high customer loyalty and stickiness.(Revenue breakdown for FY 2019. Source: Adobe 10K FY 2019)Moreover, the company has exceptional gross margins with 85% in total which is also a result of its recurring revenue model and customer loyalty (see following figure).(Gross profit breakdown for FY 2019. Source: Adobe 10K FY 2019)Fifth, turning to Q2 2020 results, Adobe reported double-digit growth rates despite a very challenging market environment due to the global pandemic:The following figure summarizes the year-over-year growth rates of the different segments.(Revenue growth by segment Q2 2020. Source: Adobe Q2 2020 results)Sixth, turning to guidance, the company expects $3.15B in revenue, representing a probably conservative double-digit year-over-year growth rate of 11%. Digital Media is expected to grow by 16%, whereas Digital Experience is expected to be flat.The growth slowdown in the Digital Experience segment is a result of two main factors: 1) delays in general enterprise spending and the significant global decrease in advertising spending due to the pandemic, which impacted especially the Advertising Cloud revenue; 2) according to the management's statements during the earnings call, Advertising Cloud offerings consist of subscription-based as well as transaction-based solutions. Transaction-based solutions will be eliminated going forward, which will negatively impact revenues. Consequently, Advertising Cloud will not be an area of growth for now. While the elimination of these offerings will negatively impact revenue, it will improve overall margins.The following figure summarizes Adobe's Q3 2020 financial targets. (Adobe Q3 2020 financial targets. Source: Adobe Q2 2020 earnings release)Seventh, besides double-digit growth rates, a very loyal customer base and a high-margin business, the company also has a very healthy balance sheet with $4.1B in (long-term) debt against $4.35B in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of Q2 2020.With regard to the company's valuation, let us begin with the market cap and a comparison with a potential peer group. Since it is really hard to name a direct competitor to Adobe, considering its market leadership and unique positioning, I have chosen some major players from the media, entertainment and advertising sector as comparison, which also have dominant market positions in their own sectors. As can be seen in the following chart, Adobe currently has a market cap of $229B.(Adobe's market cap compared to major players. Source: YCharts)While Adobe has a relatively low market capitalization in comparison to major players, its market cap is relatively high if revenues are included (see following figure).(Adobe's revenue compared to major players. Source: YCharts)Despite its relatively high valuation, Adobe's revenue growth in the most recent quarter is not significantly higher compared to the peer group (see following figure).(Adobe's revenue growth compared to peer group. Source: YCharts)The discrepancy between valuation, growth and revenues becomes clearer when the forward EV to revenues multiple is included. As can be seen in the following graph, Adobe has by far the highest multiple. Now one could argue that Adobe deserves a higher valuation because of its Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business model and is in line with smaller SaaS companies. Nevertheless, in this context it is noteworthy that Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), another major SaaS player, has a valuation only half as high with a forward EV/S multiple of 9.(Adobe EV to revenues (forward) multiple vs. peers. Source: YCharts)Additionally, as you can see in the following graph, Adobe's current P/S ratio is approximately 50% higher than its average for the past five years.(Adobe's P/S ratio over time. Source: Morningstar)Since the comparison with a potential peer group may be misleading, it makes sense to additionally conduct a valuation using the DCF method.In order to choose a conservative approach, I have chosen a growth rate of 15% per year in terms of the free cash flow, which is largely in line with analysts' estimates for the next few years provided by MarketScreener.(Adobe's FCF growth according to analysts' estimates. Source: MarketScreener)Furthermore, I have chosen a multiple of 32 for the last FCF, which corresponds to the five year average of Adobe's Price/Cash Flow multiple and is 33% lower compared to its current multiple (48.36), according to Morningstar.(Adobe's valuation over time. Source: Morningstar)Additionally, I have used a discount rate of 6% considering the following factors: a) the dominant market position on a global scale and the current ""crisis-resistant"" business model in view of the increasing digitization trend; b) the company's current and future double-digit growth rate estimates despite a challenging environment; c) negative, zero or nearly zero interest rates on a global level including massive quantitative easing provided by central banks; d) not even a minimal interest rate increase in sight from the central banks. Nevertheless, I would only apply this discount rate to fundamentally very solid companies as it is the case with Adobe.Considering all these factors, and based on my valuation method, the fair value is $808.45, which corresponds to an undervaluation of the stock of 70% (see calculation below on the left side).Since I used a discount rate of 6% and was often asked by readers what the fair value would be by applying a discount rate of 8%, I also calculated the corresponding fair value.The fair value with a discount rate of 8% is $679.95, which corresponds to an undervaluation of 43% (see calculation below on the right side).(Fair value calculation. Source: Author's calculation)The calculation does not include the impact of the ongoing and potential buyback programs. Further share buyback programs are likely to provide a further boost to the share price. The current share buyback program of the company has $3.4B available for share repurchases.On the one hand, Adobe is a clear beneficiary of the increasing digitization of private, public and business environment which was also fueled by the global pandemic.On the other hand, Adobe enables individuals, companies, educational & public institutions to continue business or even increase sales despite a challenging market environment.Adobe has a unique market position, a huge economic moat and a strong niche as a SaaS company serving the digital areas of design, advertising, commerce, entertainment and analytics. Additionally, Adobe covers the whole range of target groups and sectors and is an absolute necessity in all areas of creativity.Additionally, Adobe's strong market position is highlighted by the double-digit growth rates it has achieved over the past years and is projected for the future.In general, Adobe sees a TAM of $128B in 2022 for its software offerings with a trailing twelve months revenue of $12B per Q2 2020, which represents an immense growth opportunity going forward.However, Adobe is also confronted with short-term headwinds. The Advertising Cloud in particular - as a part of the Digital Experience segment - is struggling with stagnating growth due to the reduction in advertising expenditures and the cost-cutting measures of corporate clients. Yet, with economic recovery as well as rising advertising and corporate spending, this area could grow disproportionately.Based on my fair value calculation, the stock has an upside potential of 70% and could be worth $808 per share. Which means that the stock still has upside potential left despite its recent rally.If you already own the stock, you may not want to chase the recent rally.If you do not own Adobe yet, it should be at the top of your watchlist for the next market pullback.Nevertheless, even if the shares appear fundamentally undervalued, unexpected events are always to be expected on the stock market and there is no guarantee of rising share prices. Investors should always bear in mind that stock prices are volatile and should not be influenced by price movements alone, but rather should pay attention to the underlying fundamentals. In this respect, investors should always pay attention to their individual risk tolerance.PS: If you liked my article and you want me to write more articles of this kind in the future, then like, comment and share this article.

In an age of digitization, Adobe’s products have an enormous total addressable market, making Adobe a very compelling long-term investment.My investment thesis can be summarized as follows:(1) Adobe's products enable businesses to create and publish digital content and provide audiences with personalized digital experiences. There will be enormous demand for these products in the coming years.(2) Adobe’s Software-as-a-Service business model generates strong recurring revenue, with exceptionally high gross margins (mid-80%).(3) Adobe has consistently posted incredible financial results over the last five years, growing revenue at 21% annually and profits at 60% annually.Adobe is one of the most diversified software companies in the world. And at the end of 2019, Adobe was the third largest SaaS provider in terms of revenue, behind Microsoft (MSFT) and Salesforce (CRM).The chart below shows Adobe’s three business segments:Source: Created by the author using information from Adobe 2019 10K.Adobe focuses investments on two of these segments: Digital Media and Digital Experience.The Digital Media segment includes cloud-based applications that provide creative professionals with tools for designing, creating, and publishing creative content. Customers include a variety of creative professionals, from photographers and video editors to graphic designers and game developers. The graphic below depicts some of Adobe's Digital Media products.Source: Adobe Investor Presentation (January 2020).The Digital Experience segment is an array of cloud-based applications built on Adobe's artificial intelligence platform, Adobe Sensei. These applications provide functionality in analytics, marketing, advertising, and commerce - all of which are aimed at managing customer experience. Customers of this segment include advertisers, marketers, merchants, data scientists, and developers. The graphic below depicts some of Adobe's Digital Experience products.Source: Adobe Investor Presentation (January 2020).The global software-as-a-service market is presently valued at roughly $158 billion. This figure is expected to reach $307 billion by 2026, an 11.7% CAGR. Adobe, as the third largest provider of SaaS in the world, is well positioned to capture gains.Adobe estimates its total addressable market (TAM) at roughly $128 billion by 2022. The graphic below shows the breakdown between different revenue segments:Source: Created by the author using the Adobe Investor Presentation (March 2020).Over the trailing twelve months (TTM), Adobe has generated $12 billion in revenue. This represents less than 10% of the estimated TAM of $128 billion by 2022. Management clearly sees ample room for growth in the coming years.Digging deeper, the majority of this opportunity comes from the Digital Experience segment. Digital Media presently accounts for $8.4 billion of Adobe's TTM revenue, which represents 19% of the estimated TAM. But Digital Experience accounts for only $3.4 billion of Adobe's TTM revenue, representing only 4% of the estimated TAM.It's easy to understand why management sees the Digital Experience segment as the largest growth opportunity. There is ample data that suggests providing a personalized customer experience can dramatically improve conversion rates; for instance, a 2018 report by Epsilon found that 80% of consumers are more likely to make a purchase when brands offer personalized experiences. As a result, more businesses are focusing on providing this type of interaction for their customers.According to Gartner, Adobe is already a leader in the digital experience platform market.Source: Adobe Press ReleaseBut Adobe’s Digital Experience segment provides more than personalized experiences; it is an array of products that provides solutions in analytics, marketing, advertising, and commerce - each of which is poised to grow quickly.Analytics: Adobe’s Analytics Cloud gathers and processes customer data from every interaction, across multiple channels (web, mobile, social, video) in real time to create customer profiles. Leveraging machine learning and AI, customer interactions are turned into actionable insights through predictive modeling, which helps improve marketing spend.The customer journey analytics market is expected to reach $27 billion by 2026, growing at 21% per year.Marketing: Adobe’s Marketing Cloud uses customer data and AI tools to help users manage, deliver, and automate personalized experiences. These experiences can be dynamic and synchronized across multiple digital channels, including web, mobile, email, video, and others.The marketing cloud platform market is expected to reach $12 billion by 2023, growing at 8% per year. And the customer experience management market is expected to reach $23.6 billion by 2027, growing at 18% per year.Gartner has recognized Adobe as a leader in web content management. And, as seen below, Gardner also recognizes Adobe as a leader in multichannel marketing hubs.Source: Adobe.Advertising: Adobe’s Advertising Cloud DSP (demand-side platform) provides programmatic omnichannel advertising capabilities, allowing users to buy, measure, and optimize advertising campaigns across connected and linear TV, video, display, audio, search, and social media. The demand side platform market is expected to reach $30 billion by 2025, growing at 30% per year.As seen below, Gartner recognizes Adobe as a leader in Ad Tech.Source: AdobeCommerce: Magento Commerce enables enterprise merchants to create highly customizable online stores across a range of industries. The e-commerce software market is expected to reach over $20 billion by 2027, growing at 16% per year.The Forrester Wave recently recognized Adobe as a leading provider of both B2B and B2C commerce suites.Source: Magento.The above synopses make it evident that Adobe not only competes in multiple quickly growing markets, but that it is often a leader in those markets. Additionally, while Adobe has many competitors, no single competitor is present in every market in which Adobe operates. That is to say, Adobe’s product offering is beyond robust and unparalleled in terms of breadth.In terms of financial performance, Adobe has been a powerhouse over the last 5 years. Since the end of fiscal 2014, Adobe has posted the following metrics.Data by YChartsAs the above chart indicates, Adobe has executed exceptionally well during this time period, a testament to the strength of their SaaS business model and the demand for their products.However, in the most recent two quarters, revenue growth decelerated to 19% and 14%, respectively. This was primarily due to a strong deceleration in the Digital Experience segment. On the Q2 earnings call, Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen noted that second quarter coincided with the peak of the COVID pandemic. During this quarter, Digital Experience revenue grew only 5%, due to delays in enterprise bookings and weakness from small and medium size businesses; this effect was most pronounced in the Advertising Cloud, as there was a significant reduction in global advertising spend during this time. However, these short-term headwinds should reverse as the global situation improves.Annualized Recurring Revenue:Annualized recurring revenue (ARR) is a useful metric for analyzing the Digital Media segment. It indicates the annual value of subscriptions, services, and ETLA license agreements for Creative Cloud and Document Cloud products. Digital Media ARR was $4 billion at the end of fiscal 2016. That number has increased to $9.2 billion as of Q2'2020, representing 27% annualized growth. Increasing ARR is an indicator of a healthy, stable business. And while ARR has grown only 10% YTD, it is still moving in the right direction despite the recession. And as businesses reopen and advertising spend returns to normal, ARR growth should re-accelerate.Source: Adobe Investor Presentation (March 2020).Deferred Revenue:Deferred (unearned) revenue can be misleading, but it can also be a gauge of future performance. According to a report published in the Quarterly Journal of Finance and Accounting, increasing deferred revenue tends to have a positive impact on sales growth, gross margins, and profit margins. The effect on margins is partially a result of mismatched revenue and expenses - that is to say, once deferred revenue is added to the balance sheet, the company has incurred certain expenses (labor, marketing), but they have not yet recognized the revenue associated with these expenses. So, financial statements for that period will reflect the outflow of capital, but not the inflow, which results in compressed margins for the current period and expanded margins in the following period(s). But there is more to it. Deferred revenue essentially represents customer payments made in advance; so increasing deferred revenue means more payments are being made in advance, which implies that those customers are not even considering switching products. And if they are willing to pay in advance, maybe they'd be willing to pay a little more too. In this way, deferred revenue may be seen as a proxy for pricing power, and pricing power translates directly into gross margin expansion, which trickles down the income statement.Here, again, Adobe's metrics are solid. At the end of fiscal 2016, Adobe had roughly $2 billion in deferred revenue on its balance sheet. That number has increased to $3.46 billion as of Q2'2020, representing 17% annualized growth. As discussed above, this has positive implications for sales growth, gross margins, and profit margins in the coming years. While investors shouldn't rely too much on this statistic, the trend here is still positive.Increasing Switching Costs:One of Adobe's strongest competitive advantages, apart from its brand name and intellectual property, is the high switching costs associated with its products. After a customer invests the time to become proficient with an Adobe product, switching to a different product can be costly in terms of effort and productivity (i.e. the customer would have to spend time learning to use the new product, which would diminish productivity). Likewise, the more products a particular customer uses, the higher the switching costs become. And as the graphic below indicates, customers' usage has expanded significantly in recent years.Source: Adobe Investor Presentation (March 2020).In 2014, 66% of Adobe's top 100 customers had 3+ products in the Digital Experience segment. That number increased to 90% by the end of fiscal 2019. This indicates that switching costs are increasing, strengthening Adobe's competitive advantage.The Bull CaseAt ~$520 per share, Adobe is currently valued at 69x earnings and 21x sales, a premium compared to the broader S&P 500 in both cases. But Adobe is a premium company with an enormous addressable market, so I believe the valuation is warranted.Presently, Adobe's market cap is ~$252 billion, meaning Adobe would be a ~$504 billion business by 2025 if the share price were to double, as I asserted in the title of this article.Assuming the PS ratio remains unchanged at 21x by 2025, Adobe would need to grow revenue at 15% per year for the stock to double. This seems doable, considering Adobe has grown revenue at 21% annually since 2014.But what if the PS ratio contracts to a more conservative 15x by 2025? In this scenario, Adobe would need to grow revenue at 23% annually for the stock to double. This would be more difficult, but Adobe's revenue growth has actually accelerated to 23% annually since 2016. And I believe this is sustainable over the next five years, as Adobe should benefit from its strong competitive advantages and its leadership position in an expanding market.Of course, the above assumes shares outstanding remains constant, which is unlikely, as Adobe has repurchased 5 million shares already in 2020, and 50 million shares since the end of fiscal 2014. But share buybacks (theoretically) increase the value of remaining shares, which only strengthens my thesis. For example, if Adobe were to repurchase another 50 million shares over the next five years, assuming a PS ratio of 15x, Adobe would only need to grow revenue at 20% annually for the stock price to double, rather than the previously stated 23%.The chart below summarizes the above calculations. Sales growth estimates are paired with PS ratios that would result in 100% return over the next five years.Source: valuation created using the author's estimates.I chose a PS-based valuation model because I believe there is too much guesswork involved in a DCF. Adobe has an innovative research division and may generate additional FCF from products that don't currently exist. For example, Project Glasswing could translate into Adobe being a major player in the augmented reality market. While this PS-based valuation method doesn't account for unanticipated revenue streams, per se, it does provide a range of PS ratio vs sales growth scenarios that may help investors decide if Adobe is capable of returning 100% over the next five years.Finally, while past appreciation is no indication of future performance, Adobe's stock has already risen 583% in the past five years (and 1,830% in the past decade). This past appreciation may make some investors leery, but I see it as a sign of strength. This stock has outperformed the S&P 500 by over 500% since 2015, and it will continue to outperform for all the reasons I've discussed in this article: market leading products, an enormous and expanding TAM, strong competitive advantages, and exceptional financial performance.Data by YChartsThe Bear CaseBefore moving on, let's take a look at Adobe's future from a more bearish perspective.As mentioned previously, Adobe's revenue growth has decelerated in 2020, dropping to 19% in Q1'20 and 14% in Q2'20. This was largely driven by weakness in the Digital Experience segment related to the pandemic. So, what if this trend continues and Adobe is unable to maintain 20%+ revenue growth over the next five years?In the chart below, I've used the same PS ratio scenarios as in the bull case, but I've changed sales growth to 14%. I selected this number because it represents Adobe's slowest revenue growth over the last 12 quarters. I've also included the annualized return for each scenario on the right. For reference, the S&P 500 has returned ~8% annually since 1957 (the year the index was introduced).As you can see, the outcomes are less desirable. But Adobe still beats the market in 2 of the 4 scenarios, assuming the market grows at historical rates over the next five years.Even in the worst case scenario, which assumes 14% sales growth and a PS ratio of 12x, the return is 2% per year through 2025. While that almost certainly isn't a market-beating return, if this was the worst thing that happened to your portfolio over the next five years, I think you'd be okay.So, while it certainly wouldn't be ideal if slower revenue growth became the new normal, the downside potential doesn't look that bad.As the world's third largest SaaS provider, Adobe has seen strong growth over the last decade. But the world is undergoing a digital transformation, and we are still in the early stages of that process, so the next decade looks very bright as well. Adobe has a strong brand name and an enormous market opportunity in both Digital Media and Digital Experience, and I believe Adobe will continue to yield marketing beating returns.For that reason, Adobe is a strong buy."

Fully aware of the narrowing breadth of the rally and tech's greatest outperformance since 1999, Chaikin suggests it just might be different this time.","This week's Alpha Trader podcast features hosts Aaron Task and Stephen Alpher talking with Marc Chaikin, founder and CEO of Chaikin Analytics.Prior to the chat with Chaikin, Task and Alpher discuss the remarkable run in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and the beginning of Q2 earnings season, with many of the country's largest banks set to report results this week.For Tesla, it appears poised to enter the S&P 500 as soon as this month, and at its current capitalization north of $300B, it would be a top ten market cap stock in that index. As for the banks, Q2 is widely expected to be their worst quarter since the financial crisis. They've been pretty well sold already though. The question before the court: Has what's sure to be an ugly Q2, and what might be a soft outlook been priced in yet?Market momentum fueled by Fed liquidity and bearish market sentiment is a better guide than trying to parse the Covid-19 statistics, says Chaikin.At this point, Chaikin - noting daily record highs in the Nasdaq 100 (NASDAQ:QQQ) and a lagging S&P 500 (SP500) - isn't too worried about narrowing breadth and the sort of tech outperformance we haven't seen since 1999. This time is different, says Chaikin, fully aware of the meaning of that phrase. So much money today, he says, is pegged to strategies that force money into the mega-cap growth stocks leading the Nasdaq 100. Chaikin's tech favorites - Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and his stock of the week, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM).There's plenty more, including why Chaikin likes high-quality biotech like Regeneron (NASDAQ:REGN), why he's not bottom-fishing in roughed up sectors like financials (NYSEARCA:XLF) and energy (NYSEARCA:XLE), and why it pays to lighten up whenever a stock spikes higher on earnings.Listen to or subscribe to Alpha Trader on these podcast platforms:"
4359126,102936,2020-07-17T15:33:47-04:00,"Many retail investors dismiss computer-assisted trading out of hand. This is a mistake.Software can process thousands of facts in fractions of a second, identify opportunities and reduce risk.Bias, human emotion, a belief in one’s intellect and superior investment skills, are major obstacles to investment performance. Software doesn't have those self-defeating tendencies.","An algo is a tool, like a calculator. If you don’t know how to build a house, a nail gun won’t help. If you don’t know how to build a car, a hundred highly-sophisticated robots won’t help. If you do however know how to build a car, robots can dramatically reduce your cost and improve the quality of the final product. Why? It doesn't go to work hungover, after an argument with its wife, preoccupied by the loss sustained by the local team in the weekend football game. It makes precision routine rather than random.The software we created and use has two components. The first utilizes longstanding credit analysis techniques first developed by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company a hundred or more years ago and still used today by the rating agencies (Standard & Poors, Moody’s). The techniques are, at their core, detailed analysis of the components that affect return on assets. Alfred Sloan, in his classic memoir, My Years At General Motors, describes employing the duPont model at General Motors in the early 1900s. The du Pont company and family were the largest investors in GM at the time.We’ve taken these financial statement analysis techniques and coded them into software so that every quarter we can comb the financial statements of the roughly 3500 non-utility companies with market caps of over $5 million and identify both persistent and emerging trends.After completion of the financial statement trend analysis, our software analyzes prices and assesses probabilities based on volatility over the last nine and a half months. It measures simple moving averages and deviations from those averages.In this article, Adobe (ADBE) is used for illustration purposes only because it happens to be the first stock alphabetically in our list of Quality Compounders. The Quality Compounders are the top one to two percent of US public companies in terms of profitability, growth and financial strength. Our software sorts companies as follows:Using this methodology, we identify the one hundred highest and one hundred lowest quality US companies. We go over each carefully, and whittle the lists down where appropriate. It's ok, for instance, for a Quality Compounder to have an average return on assets, say of 12%, if it has high growth, for instance over 15% annually. Low-quality companies, which we call Dirty Dogs, can cover interest payments as long as they can’t cover dividends with free cash flow and debt is consistently increasing. With the market’s current focus on dividend yield, and the disregard by many investors (retirees) of free cash flow coverage, any company with declining margins, increasing debt and a high yield qualifies as a Dirty Dog.Three numbers reflect the quality of Adobe as a business:We present the crucial trends in graph form because their significance can be picked up at a glance. To see any graph or table in this article enlarged, double click on it. The first set (below) show three important trends: free cash flow, financial strength and growth in intrinsic value:The lighter blue line in the top graph is return on assets. Strong free cash flow growth and neutral return on assets are common. As companies grow their base, maintaining returns on incremental capital gets more and more difficult.The middle graph (above) indicates improving financial strength. The notes in the left column indicate exceptional financial strength. The bottom graph indicates steadily rising intrinsic value, but not as fast as stock price. These trends suggest that going forward, the annual returns generated by an investment in ADBE may be modest, perhaps in the area of five percent. This mediocre return in an exceptional quality company is due to a stock price that has risen much faster than estimated intrinsic value. This won’t, however, discourage us from taking short-term long positions in the stock based on signals generated by the Algo as described below. For our approach to work, all we need is a reliable financial statement trend and a stock with volatility that exceeds that trend.The following series of graphs show Adobe’s gradually improving margins and asset turnover, the two components that make up return on assets. Profitability graphs: Source of the three graphs above: Risk Research Inc.Each week we prepare eleven-page reports (of which the three above are examples) on each Quality Compounder and Dirty Dog.Probabilities AnalysisThe second component of our software capitalizes on excess volatility through probability analysis. Trading with the use of probabilities software is completely different than trading based on charts or earnings or fundamentals or any other approach relying largely on judgment, or the weighing of a variety of conflicting facts. The software often suggests we do things as investors or traders that are completely contrary to our intuition. That’s where its usefulness lies. It's based on facts not conjecture, on established trends not predictions of the market, economy or interest rates, all of which are, in our opinion, unpredictable. It disregards bias.The strategy incorporates both trend-following and mean reversion. The trend following aspect is based on the observation that, over time, stock prices tend to follow the two-or-three-quarter free cash flow trend of companies. There are exceptions of course – companies that have never generated any free cash flow at all, and yet have stocks that have done quite well. Wayfair (NYSE:W), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Chewy (NYSE:CHWY) come immediately to mind. I wouldn’t be surprised if that is also the case with Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) although I haven’t run the numbers recently. But in general, on average, over time, stock prices track free cash flow.In the short term however – say one week to one month - stock prices are much more volatile than underlying financial performance. In that volatility lies opportunity. If you take a ruler and draw it through the middle of hourly stock prices over the last three months, and then measure the median and average deviation from that line, you have the essence of our Algo. It measures the deviation, calculates probabilities based on volatility and distance, and weighs the possibility that a better price will be achieved by waiting against the return likely to be achieved at the current price using the last nine and a half months as a guide.The software is designed to capture swings of approximately 10 percent, average holding period is about one week, ranging from 24 hours to 1.5 months.Here’s the Adobe long term (logarithmic) chart as an example. Source: TD Ameritrade, ThinkorswimIf a long-term investor were to use our approach to take five- to 10-year positions, he or she would calculate the maximum distances above and below that line each year. The distances that recurred three or more times – the recurring extremes so to speak – would indicate the buy and sell levels in relation to the line now. We’re shorter term investors and so instead of using this daily chart over the last eight years, we use hourly numbers over the last nine and a half months, as does the ADBE chart below. Source: TD Ameritrade, ThinkorswimThese charts are meant to illustrate principles only. In practice we use numbers not charts, and the numbers are very precise – small fractions of a percent – much more accurate than moving average lines on a chart. Here's a screenshot of part of the computer printout that we use to make actual position changes.Source: Risk Research Inc.We run the program all day, every day. As the moving average changes, and volatility increases or decreases, the indicated buy sell levels change. The software reviews all recent runs, and selects the levels with the best returns.It's crucial, following this approach, to find stocks with established and reliable financial statement trends. Since we maintain a diversified long/short portfolio, we look for both highly-profitable companies, and companies with established records of deteriorating financial strength and profitability.In the case of Quality Compounder Adobe Systems, over the nine months the spread between highs and lows in any three-day period averaged about 6%. The maximum spread was 26%, which occurred in the three days ended March 20. During those three days, not coincidentally, the recent low for the stock was achieved. The median spread between the highs and lows was 14%, which also happened to be the average.The Algo, weighing all these factors, determined that the maximum profit could be achieved by settling for a 8.5% spread, which occurred four times in the eight months, all but one of those occurred in the month ended March 27. The average holding time was three days. The annualized return translates into 1020%. The current sell at level is $468.90. The Algo has determined that price is likely to be hit within the next 1.5 months, and very possibly within the next week. The buy sell levels fluctuate constantly, and the buy at level now indicated is $412.88. This is undoubtedly due to increased volatility, which causes the Algo to wait for a better price and thus capture a greater profit potential.The following two graphs show the results of following the Algo in Adobe over the last nine months. Source, TD Ameritrade Thinkorswim.Below, a close-up of the period in March that accounted for most of the trades. Source, TD Ameritrade Thinkorswim.Cash ManagementThis approach is all about probabilities, not certainties. In that respect it's no different from all investing, no matter what analysts and others might say about sure returns or retiring rich. Cash management and position sizing are absolutely crucial. Risk management dictates a minimum cash position of twenty percent and that’s after allowing for a 100% coverage of the sale price on shorts (no margin). The reason: The guiding principle of the Algo is that history repeats. To the extent history doesn’t repeat, the Algo gives premature or even inaccurate signals. The precipitous decline early in March had us closing out our shorts at a profit and the Algo was then telling us to go 100% long. Had a major bear market gained momentum rather than reversed, and continued for months or years, our portfolio would have suffered grievous losses. As things turned out, we did very well.The solution to unpredictability – the survival solution – is to maintain a substantial cash position, and be willing to hold losing positions for extended periods in extreme scenarios. A week ago, many of my positions, only days old, were losing. I was able to get out of those at a profit earlier this week. That is common.This is a screen shot of our current exposure:An investor has to be prepared for any market eventuality. The indicated cash position can be substantially greater if the portfolio is unbalanced either long or short on the principle that cash is a hedge. As we currently follow 72 highly profitable, well-positioned companies, opportunities constantly present themselves and it's generally possible to be at least 50 percent invested, although we are currently 60% in cash. That includes our short portfolio. We build positions with a portfolio size of 2% per transaction and a maximum of 6% invested in any one company, long or short.ConclusionThe bias by most retail investors against the use of computer software as an aid in making investment decisions is unwarranted. Computer software can weigh thousands of facts and make recommendations in fractions of a second. It can weigh probabilities, upon which all sound investment decisions are made.Bias, human emotion, a belief in one’s intellect and superior investment skills, are major obstacles to investment performance. In fact, in the short term, most market moves are irrational and reversed within a month. This is for a variety of reasons, including the fact that price movements on any particular moment or day are determined by a tiny fraction of investors that are ill-informed and/or emotion driven. Whatever news is driving the market today will likely be forgotten in a week or two.Computer software can protect us from our own worse self-defeating tendencies."
4357608,105567,2020-07-09T01:01:13-04:00,"Adobe continues to show strong revenue growth and profitability.Although competition could be a problem, Adobe's products are superior and their revenues are sticky.With this in mind, I have arrived at a target price using a 10-year DCF model.","Adobe Inc. (ADBE) is a company with outstanding growth and profitability. However, the company is now more richly valued than ever before. So what can we expect moving forward? My take is that, while we may see a pullback in Adobe and overall tech stocks, the company will remain a great investment over the next 10 years. Source: customers.microsoft.comAdobe is a software company operating in three main segments; Digital Media, Creative Cloud, and Digital Experience. Adobe has enjoyed double-digit growth over the last decade and has benefitted in recent years with the transition to the cloud. Since the market bottomed in March, the stock has rallied well past its pre-COVID price and is now trading at an all-time high of around $450.While the valuation certainly seems rich, there are many things to like about the company. To begin with, let’s have a look at the income statement from the latest quarterly results:Source: 10-QThere’s not much to say about the last six months at Adobe other than “well done.” Revenue has grown by over 16% and EPS increased by 58%. Not only did the company continue its strong growth trajectory, but it also increased its profitability. As we can see, most of the expenses come from R&D and Sales and Marketing, which increased proportionally less than revenues. Let’s move on to the balance sheet:Source: 10-QAs a software company with not many operating costs, Adobe’s balance sheet could be said to be lean. Goodwill represents around 50% of the company’s total assets. While total liabilities are a similar size to last year, it is worth noting that the company has accrued over $3 billion in long-term debt. This was done to carry out the acquisitions of Marketo and Allegorithmic.With the stock trading at an all-time high, it is still a good time to buy Adobe? Below I discuss the good, the bad, and my take on the company as an investment.In the section below, we will go through the strengths and opportunities that the company has.It doesn’t take much to find good things to say about Adobe. The company has been growing at double-digits for the last decade. Over the last 10 years, the company has achieved a CAGR of 13.97%. Most impressive, however, is the fact that over the last 3 and 5 years, revenue has grown at over 22%. But with a company like Adobe, investors often focus on deferred revenue.Source: YChartsAs we can see, since around 2015, deferred revenue has surpassed revenue, which could be seen as a good thing, since this shows future strength. However, in the last few months, this difference seems to be getting smaller. While deferred revenues may have been a bit weaker in the last few quarters, fellow SA contributor ALT Perspective pointed out that this was also the result of a change in Adobe’s accounting, therefore “debunking” the issue.But what can we expect moving forward? Adobe continues to thrive in areas that still have plenty of room to grow. Digital marketing will continue to grow as we continue to move into the cloud and e-commerce begins to take off. This segment grew by 16%. On top of that, according to Adobe, Creative Cloud’s addressable market could grow to up to $13 billion by 2022.Lastly, and to some extent controversially, Adobe has gone on an acquisition spree and I’d like to mention its latest purchases; Allegorithmic. The company is responsible for Substance, which is considered a reference in 3D texture and materials. Adobe’s acquisition is a result of the natural evolution of this industry. In the future, real and virtual reality will become increasingly mixed, and the company is bridging this gap leveraging its already existing technology with cutting-edge innovations like Substance.Of course, the other great thing that Adobe has going for it is profitability. There are very few companies that can achieve a 30% income margin and equally good levered FCF margin. As a value investor, this cash-generating ability combined with the reliability of predictable revenues makes the stock very appealing. Furthermore, Adobe’s profitability has been improving over time.Source: YChartsSince 2014, management has managed to significantly increase the EBITDA margin thanks to lower spending on SGA and marketing. This shows the ability of the company to grow organically and continue to generate cash well into the future.In the section below, we will go through the weaknesses and threats for Adobe.The first and most obvious problem Adobe faces is competition, which can come in two forms. Adobe is an established giant in the space and the only companies that can take Adobe on are the other tech giants. In this regard, Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) could be the best set to do so. Of course, Adobe has more direct competition such as salesforce.com (CRM) and ServiceNow (NOW), but the company is protected by the stickiness of its revenue and superior offerings. However, a company like Google could easily leverage its technology and, through an acquisition or two, give Adobe a run for its money.But this is far from Adobe’s biggest problem. The issue Adobe faces is not competition from businesses, but rather from people. In today’s information age, it is becoming increasingly easy to find incredibly powerful and useful applications for free. The reality is that more than ever people are not only capable of creating and finding these apps, they have come to expect them. With the plethora of free apps on Google Play, Adobe may be forced to change the way it does business. Not because of its generally great products, but because of changes in demand and people’s expectations.Adobe’s valuation has always been high, but even by its historical standards, Adobe is overvalued:Source: MorningstarNo matter which way you look at it, Adobe is at its most expensive. Above we can see the P/S and Price/Cash flow history for both the S&P and Adobe. What’s most concerning is not how much higher valuation is for Adobe than the general market, but the fact that cash flow is now over 3x as expensive as it was back in 2010. Of course, all tech companies now seem overvalued, and perhaps there is a reason for this. Easy credit, changes in the way we live, and continued advances in technology make these companies seem ever more attractive. But many of us still have painful memories of 1999.Given Adobe's track record, I have used Finbox to arrive at a target price based on projected growth and profitability measures.Source: finbox.comI have projected Adobe to maintain a 10-year revenue CAGR of around 16%, which is on the low side of my expectations. I have also factored in an improvement of profitability, whereby EBITDA margin increases to up to 50% of revenues. This results in an unlevered FCF 10-year CAGR of 22% and a target price of $509, assuming a 9.5% discount rate. This means an implied upside potential of around 11% for Adobe.In conclusion, although Adobe is already richly valued, there is still significant upside potential simply by viewing the stock purely in terms of cash flow. This valuation is on the low side of the spectrum as it doesn't even account for the expansion of multiples and the effect of future expectations on the stock price.The bottom line is, Adobe is a fantastic company that, in my opinion, combines the growth of technology with the stability and cash-making ability of an income/value stock. Even though Adobe will have to work hard to stay fresh, it will take a long time before we can consider Adobe’s market leader position under any real threat."
4355306,102639,2020-06-24T09:30:12-04:00,"Adobe has been hitting new all-time highs and is now trading near its upper long-term share price channel again.The last time it happened in mid-February, the stock tanked and reached for the other side of the price channel within weeks.Inevitably, questions about whether this uptrend can continue, and what price can we expect Adobe to reach, abound.There are also doubts on the sustainability of Adobe's high valuation metrics, slowing growth in deferred revenue, and its financial strength following a mega acquisition and continued share buybacks.Based on the price chart, Adobe is on track to hit $730 from 2022.","Today, Adobe Inc. (ADBE) registered a fresh all-time high again, a feat it has achieved umpteen times since it surpassed the previous record a month ago.

In the past ten years, the stock has also found itself trading within the multi-year price channel as illustrated in the earlier posted chart. Thus, it was fair that several among my investor friends wondered if Adobe could break out of this strong resistance, or should we be expecting a retesting of the support in the coming weeks and months?It wasn't just the cues from technical charting that raised concerns. Some of the naysayers questioned about:While I hadn't been following closely with the developments at Adobe, the seasoned user of Seeking Alpha's platform in me knew that these doubts wouldn't be difficult to answer. The quest to dispel the concerns motivated me to write this article. The idea was, if I could address them, we will look for an opportunity to buy or accumulate more shares. Otherwise, we will stay away, trim out holdings in Adobe or sell out.The spoiler alert is that the mentioned worries about Adobe are largely unfounded. Although we have seen several variations of the acronyms featuring the hot favorite tech stocks such as FANG, FAANG, and FAAMG, the A's are referring to Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)(GOOGL) and Apple Inc. (AAPL). Perhaps its nigh time we should consider MAGAFAN to incorporate all?Source: Adobe (November 2019)As with many of the tech stocks, Adobe has enjoyed a remarkable rebound and is even trading higher than before COVID-19 became a buzzword. Since a trough in March, Adobe has risen 53 percent, neglecting fears of an oft-mentioned 'second-wave' along the way.Data by YChartsComparing Adobe to its peers, Autodesk, Inc. (ADSK) and Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM), the former is the only one with a Neutral quant rating (see the table as follows), while the latter two are tagged 'Very Bullish'. This is a two-level difference, and from the quant factor grading breakdown, it isn't so obvious why Adobe deserved such an inferior rating.Source: Seeking Alpha PremiumAll three software companies scored a 'D' for Value where the coloring system clearly screams 'red flag!' It's thus understandable why a few of my investor friends expressed reservations on Adobe's valuation, even if its peers are no better. Nevertheless, while Adobe's Growth score is lower than Autodesk and Salesforce.com, it more than made it up with superior grades in the other three categories - Profitability, Momentum, and EPS Revisions.Source: Seeking Alpha PremiumSure, Adobe's other quant factor grades look decent, but what about the original concern being the valuation is too rich? Pulling up the price-to-sales ratio chart indeed shows Adobe trading at a high of 17.88 times, surpassing the ratio it was at when it hit a record high back in February. This is also higher than the 12-16 times range it traded since late 2017.Data by YChartsThe stock market is forward-looking, you say. Right, I agree with the concept. Let's look at the price-to-sales ratio on a forward basis then. The numbers certainly look much better in the coming years. An analyst is projecting Adobe to be achieving revenue of $32.45 billion in the fiscal year ending November 2028. That would bring its price-to-sales ratio to a mere 6.51 times.Adobe Inc.Source: Seeking Alpha PremiumPerhaps relying on the forecast of a sole analyst is too risky. That's fair. Nevertheless, looking at the consensus estimates up till the fiscal year ending November 2022 provided by 11 analysts, we still have Adobe trading at a decent price-to-sales ratio of 12.40 times on a forward basis. That would bring Adobe back to the low-end of the 3-year historical range mentioned earlier, as its revenue growth is forecasted to be on an increasing trend from 13.96 percent in the current fiscal year to 15.90 percent in the fiscal period ending November 2022.The buoyant projections for the revenue are also trickling well to the bottom-line. The consensus EPS estimate will rise from $9.77 in the current fiscal year to $13.07 two years later. The forward price-to-earnings ratio would correspondingly shrink from 44.91 times to 33.56 times. This compares with the 41.95 times for Salesforce.com in its fiscal year ending January 2023.Adobe Inc.Salesforce.com Inc.Source: Seeking Alpha PremiumHence, a mini-conclusion here is that Adobe's valuation does seem rich currently, but when viewed on a longer term and in the context of its peer group, we could say it's par for the course.Nothing beats plotting dozens of quarterly numbers on a chart for clarity. Thus, the first thing I did when posed with the question in this sub-section header was to pull up the following chart.Data by YChartsAfter Adobe's quarterly current deferred revenue exceeded that of its reported revenue from late 2014, it has remained so to date. However, the trend looks set to reverse. Plotting the current deferred revenue over the reported revenue shows the ratio declining from around 1.2 times to 1.062 times based on the Q2 FY2020 numbers.Adobe has long stated the strength of its deferred revenue provides forward revenue visibility. John Murphy, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer at Adobe, reiterated at the Q4 FY2019 earnings call that deferred and unbilled revenues serve as ""an indicator of the health of the business going forward."" At the rate the ratio is falling, we could see the reported revenue higher than the deferred revenue once again. What's going on?For readers who have not followed Adobe for quite some time or new to Adobe's reporting, you may not be aware that the company switched from accounting standard ASC 605 to ASC 606 for the fiscal year 2019. Following the adoption of ASC 606, Adobe includes ""unbilled backlog"" together with deferred revenue as Remaining Performance Obligation or ""RPO"".RPO has become important to Adobe as its Adobe.com cloud offerings gain prominence in its business. According to Adobe, its Adobe.com cloud offerings, typically billed monthly, are reported as unbilled backlog, whereas channel offerings billed annually upfront are reported as deferred revenue.Take the latest reported quarter as an example. John Murphy said that the RPO ""grew by 19 percent year-over-year to $9.92 billion exiting Q2 FY2020 and was relatively flat quarter-over-quarter. The strength in acquisition from Adobe.com during the quarter drove a mix-shift from deferred revenue to unbilled backlog. We exited Q2 with $3.46 billion in deferred revenue.""Hence, even though the deferred revenue in Q2 fell $150 million from the prior quarter, RPO remained ""relatively flat quarter-over-quarter"", thanks to the rise in the unbilled backlog. Similarly, while the deferred revenue exiting Q2 FY2020 rose only $330 million from a year ago, the RPO was higher by $1.55 billion. That is, the majority of the gains in RPO was contributed by unbilled backlog from Adobe.com cloud offerings.With that, I hope the concern over a lower deferred revenue/reported revenue ratio is considered debunked.Again, instead of pouring over the wall of text in the financial filings and crunching the numbers, it's more convenient to generate the chart showing the net financial debt changes over the years. From this, we can understand why long-time shareholders of Adobe are getting uncomfortable that its net cash position has dwindled from as much as $4.5 billion in 2018 to a mere $237 million at the end of Q2 FY2020.Data by YChartsIn September 2018, Adobe announced the acquisition of Marketo, a $4.75 billion mega-deal that IDC Sales Technology Research Director Gerry Murray and Program Vice President Melissa Webster said would solidify ""Adobe’s position as the market leader in marketing campaign management.""The purchase, which was financed with a combination of new debt and cash, brought Adobe into a net financial debt position, a territory it stayed far away for years. Nonetheless, it quickly got back into net cash and looks set to continue rebuilding its cash position with its strong free cash flow.Data by YChartsOne operational improvement that helps Adobe's cash flows is its effort in reducing the Days Sales Outstanding ('DSO'). Its DSO has been on a downtrend since 2017 and is now at 40.2 days, down from more than 50 days before 2018. Data by YChartsJohn Murphy said in the latest earnings conference call that Adobe would ""cease pursuing transaction-driven Advertising Cloud deals"" in view of the extensive global decline in advertising spend amid the operating environment as COVID-19 rages on. The discontinuation of the transaction-driven Advertising Cloud offerings is expected to contribute to a further improvement in the DSO as well as overall gross margins.While Adobe is a no-brainer beneficiary of the work-from-home phenomenon, it is by no means unscathed from any negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic. In Q2 FY2020, executives noted ""some increase in customer requests for billing concessions.""There isn't much clarity offered such as the quantum involved except that the management would ""continue to be focused on working with our customers to ensure their success while managing our cash flows."" We can only monitor quarter to quarter on the impact on its cash flows and guidance by the executives.Meanwhile, Adobe is expected to continue share repurchases. In Q2 FY2020, Adobe repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares at a cost of $850 million. It still has $3.4 billion (as of June 11, 2020) remaining out of the $8 billion repurchase authority granted in May 2018 which goes through 2021. This amount can be fully funded without debt given the free cash flow of $4.4 billion.I set off to answer three major concerns spelled out by my investor-friends and mentioned in the background section. Since they could also be what readers are worried about, I decided to share my findings in this article. While some doubts about Adobe is unfounded, the stock is seemingly trading near a multi-year price uptrend channel.It does not necessarily mean that the share price is due for a correction, as the stock should ""breakout"" or inch its way gradually upwards within the price channel. Nevertheless, if a correction does happen, it would be a great opportunity to buy into Adobe in the sub-$300 range towards the support level perhaps some time in Q3 (see the Yahoo price chart posted at the beginning of this article).In the longer run, should the price channel hold, the stock could reach $730 by 2022 as reflected in the chart. The strengths of Adobe's product offerings and the staggering scale of user engagements provide it with the runway for further revenue and earnings growth, and consequently, share price appreciation. Adobe's FY2019 revenue of $11.2 billion is a small fraction of the estimated $128 billion total addressable market in 2022 its management guided.Source: Adobe (November 2019)"

It had a strong quarter for its Digital Media segment but its Advertising Cloud revenue was impacted by the COVID crisis. But what's interesting is how Adobe quickly de-emphasized the low-margin and capital-intensive parts of its business to focus on growth.Adobe's second-quarter revenues grew 14% to a record $3.13 billion, short of the market's projections of $3.16 billion. Adjusted EPS of $2.45 was ahead of the Street's forecast of $2.32.Adobe's Subscription revenues grew 17% to $2.87 billion and Product revenues fell 20% to $153 million. Services & support revenues declined 7% to $126 million.By segment, Digital Media segment revenue grew 18% to $2.23 billion. Creative revenue grew to $1.87 billion and Document Cloud revenue was $360 million. Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) grew to $9.17 billion. Creative ARR grew to $7.93 billion, and Document Cloud ARR grew to $1.24 billion. Digital Experience segment revenues grew 5% to $826 million. Digital Experience subscription revenue grew 8% to $707 million. Digital Experience subscription revenue, excluding Advertising Cloud revenue, grew 18%.Adobe forecast revenues of $3.15 billion and an adjusted EPS of $2.40 for the third quarter, compared with the market's forecast of revenues of $3.26 billion with an EPS of $2.46. Adobe has also withdrawn the annual fiscal 2020 targets that were issued in December 2019.The shift to remote work has driven a surge in demand for digital documents. Usage of web-based PDF services was up nearly 40% quarter over quarter and the number of documents shared in Acrobat increased 50% year over year. Usage for Adobe Sign, its cloud-based electronic signature solution, grew a whopping 175% since the start of the fiscal year. Mobile usage exploded with Acrobat Reader installations increasing 43% year over year and Adobe Scan installations, up 66% year over year. To capitalize on this trend, Adobe plans to focus on Adobe Sign, web-based PDF services and availability of PDF functionality through APIs.During the second quarter, Adobe recorded historic highs in Adobe.com traffic across both Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. Demand for its professional video products was particularly high with strong engagement for Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects. There was a 75% q-o-q increase in monthly active users for video editing software Premiere Rush. Mobile traffic, member sign-ups, and monetization continue to accelerate. Adobe Fresco has seen a greater than 40% increase in downloads since the start of 2020. Photoshop Express has surpassed 20 million in monthly active users.Adobe announced that for its Creative business, it will increase its investment in two exciting areas, providing new solutions that address the unmet needs of the communicator segment and ensuring that the web browser is a first-class authoring platform.In Customer Experience Management, key customer wins in the quarter included IBM (NYSE:IBM), Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), Safeway, Astellas Pharma (OTCPK:ALPMF), and Allianz (OTCPK:ALIZF). US Census Bureau is relying on Adobe Experience Cloud to modernize citizen experiences. Adobe's client list for its Experience Platform includes 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and over 10 billion active customer profiles are running on the Adobe Experience Platform.Adobe has integrated Sensei, its AI and machine learning framework, into the Experience Platform to provide market-leading solutions across content and commerce, customer journey management, and customer data and insights. To further its lead, it plans to increase its investment in AI and machine learning, next-generation applications and services on the Adobe Experience Platform, and accelerated integration of its content and commerce offerings.While the Digital Media segment saw strong demand due to the COVID crisis, the significant global decline in advertising spending affected Adobe's Advertising Cloud revenue. Its advertising offerings consist of Advertising Cloud software solutions as well as Advertising Cloud transaction-driven solutions.Adobe made the strategic decision mid-quarter to cease pursuing low-margin transaction-driven Advertising Cloud deals. This resulted in a shortfall of about $50 million in its Q2 revenue target. Adobe will continue to offer its Advertising Cloud software solutions to its Digital Experience customers, but it will not be an area of growth moving forward. Adobe now expects approximately $200 million total Advertising Cloud revenue for the full fiscal year, compared to $360 million in fiscal 2019. This decision is expected to increase the overall profitability of the Digital Experience segment in the long term.Its stock is currently trading at $428.01 with a market capitalization of $206.22 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $429.27 last week.

In this piece, I will explore its offering expansions, and its path forward.I rate Adobe a buy at $450.","Source: Adobe 2019 Analyst DayWhen it comes to content creation, Adobe (ADBE) is the industry standard in the same way that Nvidia (NVDA) is the industry standard for high-quality GPUs. In my previous article on the company, I highlighted that its software is essentially a language, which all design industry participants must speak in order to work in the industries in which they participate.This has fashioned the company into a de facto monopoly, and its ~86% gross margins communicate as much. Like many of the incredible companies within my coverage universe, Adobe does not rest on its laurels, and it has proven that its willing to reinvest those gross profits into its various burgeoning lines of business.Today, I am going to analyze Adobe’s three core business segments: Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud. I will demonstrate that these business segments are rapidly growing and portend future growth based on each segment’s total addressable market and recent revenue trends. To this end, Adobe estimates that it will have a $128 billion total addressable market in 2022 with only ~$15B worth of revenue.In light of this analysis, I rate Adobe a buy today, and a very strong buy anywhere below $450.Source: Adobe 2019 Analyst DayAdobe Creative Cloud is the ecosystem for creators interested/working in photography, design, video, or web design. The Creative Cloud features over 20 apps that utilize the cloud to enable individuals to access the Creative Cloud Library from a desktop or mobile device.The service includes tools and capabilities such that teams can stay in sync throughout a project. Additionally, Adobe recently released an update to bring extended AI capabilities to its platform to boost Photoshop and other Creative Cloud applications. For example, now AI detects small elements that are detailed, such as hair. The platform will include new features including screen design, 3D, and AR. These updates, though seemingly small, are improvements that further solidify the power of Adobe's platform in creative communities, and thereby its moat.Source: Adobe Creative Cloud updates add more AI and learning toolsAdobe’s Creative Cloud helps teams, students, and individuals meet their everyday creative needs by offering a complete platform that is continually improving. Adobe fuels creativity for all, as its platform provides the infrastructure to create anything you can imagine, which has led the Creative Cloud segment to generate strong, growing revenues, as can be seen below.Source: Adobe 2019 Analyst DayWhile the chart above was the best I could find for a pictorial representation, here's data from Adobe's recent quarterly earnings report:Creative Cloud ARR increased to $7.93 billion in Q2 of 2020, a 21% year-over-year increase. Creative Cloud ARR also increased by 21% in 2019 to $6.48 billion. Hence, there has been consistently robust growth from the segment.Source: Adobe 2019 Analyst DayAdobe anticipates that there will be a $31 billion total addressable market for its Creative Cloud in 2022. In the financial analysis portion of this article, I will employ these metrics (below and above the image) to ascertain the value of Creative Cloud in my ""sum of parts"" valuation.I will assume 15% revenue growth in Adobe’s Creative Cloud over the next 10 years, as the company currently has 27% of its addressable market and the platform is consistently growing at 21%.Document Cloud is a steady contributor to Adobe’s revenue, but this is expected to increase precipitously as the total addressable market is expected to nearly double from 2021 to 2022.Source: Adobe 2019 Analyst DayThe Document Cloud enables 2 billion Adobe Reader and Acrobat users to create trillions of PDFs. The service is expanding to include e-signatures, workflows, and document intelligence. Adobe has focused on improving the Document Cloud by using a methodology consistent with Creative Cloud; that is, utilizing the cloud to access the variety of Document Cloud integrations from anywhere at any time.Source: Adobe 2019 Analyst DayDocument Cloud ARR increased to $1.24 billion in Q2 of 2020, a 34.6% increase year-over-year. In 2019, ARR increased to $1.22 billion, a 25% year-over-year increase. For this segment’s growth over the next 10 years, I will estimate 20%, as there is significant room for Adobe to capture in this market and as the company grew revenues by over 25% the past two years.This segment is perhaps the most compelling to me as an investor in Adobe. The Experience Cloud enables businesses to develop media, then immediately deploy said media via an in-house demand-side platform (DSP). As you will come to find out, there have been near term headwinds for this segment, in light of the COVID-19 situation, but long term this segment should prove to be a massive winner.Experience Cloud focuses on helping businesses provide the best customer experience featuring innovative tools for data, commerce, personalization, and more. This segment is designed to help businesses achieve their goals by providing content optimization and AI-driven analytics to best serve each of their individual customers.Adobe Experience CloudThe video above highlights that Adobe is powering next-generation experiences that businesses' customers find simple and informative. This has resulted in rapid revenue growth from the segment, as is illustrated below.Source: Adobe 2019 Analyst DayDespite such meteoric growth in the past, however, Experience Cloud revenue increased to $826 million in Q2 of 2020, a paltry 5% year-over-year growth. This growth was lower than Adobe anticipated due to the COVID-19 impact.In its Q2 earnings call, Adobe said that COVID-19 impact resulted in a $50 million shortfall in revenue from the experience cloud as businesses stopped spending on advertisements. The company reported that Experience Cloud revenue increased by 18% in the past year, excluding advertising revenues. This is relatively low for this segment, as it is expected to grow rapidly through 2023.Source: Adobe 2019 Analyst DayAdobe believes that its Experience Cloud will continue to grow at high rates once business returns to normalized spending on advertising. In 2019, Adobe increased its Experience Cloud revenues by 31% to $3.21 billion. While this segment hasn’t grown significantly in 2020 due to the virus, the company expects growth to be strong as there remains a huge $84 billion total addressable market in 2022. Therefore, I will estimate a 22.5% growth over 10 years as the Experience Cloud is rapidly growing to create the optimal multi-cloud infrastructure that powers businesses’ customer relations.Source: Adobe 2019 Analyst DayAdobe is in a strong financial position as the company is generating free cash flow and has plenty of cash on hand. Adobe also sports an 87% gross profit margin, which further illustrates that the company operates as a de facto monopoly. Source: Ycharts.comAs can be seen above, Adobe has leveled its spend in R&D and SG&A to remain a consistent percentage of revenue, all while steadily increasing free cash flow per share. This highlights Adobe’s strong business approach and the extent to which the company will continue to generate strong free cash, which will result in an increase in its share price over time.Now, let's determine what we should pay for the company.So as to illuminate the math behind this valuation, here are some notable assumptions I used to create this valuation.Last note, if any of this was unclear to you, please feel free to ask your questions regarding the valuation in the comments section below. It would be two articles alone to write out every bit of math employed in this valuation. The present revenues for each segment can be found in the company's Q2 2020 earnings release. You can then take those revenues and apply a conservative FCF to equity margin that you can then divide by the total shares outstanding.This is everything you need to create a very conservative projection of intrinsic value for each component of the company's business.Now, let's check out the results.Source: www.news.adobe.comBased on Adobe’s current $210.75 billion market cap, we can expect about a 15% return on an investment today. Therefore, I am bullish on Adobe and label it a buy as it is expected to generate market-beating returns as it is better than our 9.8% benchmark.Adobe is one of those company's that Peter Thiel really relishes. That is, Adobe is a monopoly, plain and simple, but one that doesn't find itself at the crosshairs of political theatre, a la Facebook (FB). The company has positioned itself at the forefront of the transition to the cloud, which is utilized by all its business segments.In light of my sum of parts valuation of Adobe, its three main revenue drivers look to deliver strong growth, which makes it a strong investment today. I am bullish on Adobe and view it as a long-term hold as it will accelerate the transition to digital, as it has since 1982.As always, thanks for reading; remember to follow for more, and happy investing!"
4354715,104608,2020-06-19T13:49:11-04:00,"Adobe reported Q2 revenue below expectations, which is surprising given the company's history of beating guidance.Q3 revenue guidance was also below expectations and can be attributed to the global pandemic and the company accelerating their strategy of eliminating low-margin revenue.Valuation appears to be a little aggressive to build a new position at ~15.5x forward revenue and over 42x forward P/E.","Adobe (ADBE) continues to be one of the leading software players in the market even during these volatile times. The company has successfully transitioned to a SaaS-subscription revenue model, which now represents over 90% of the company's revenues. These revenues tend to come with higher margins, have high visibility, and tend to be stickier than license revenue. Also, every consumer and enterprise are familiar with the Adobe logo as the company's brand awareness is very high.The company reported an okay quarter with revenue growing 14% compared to the year ago period, but came in below expectations. Yes, there was a small headwind from the global pandemic, but the bigger issue is the company's Q3 guidance. For Q3, the company is expecting revenue growth of only ~11%, which is well below the company's historical range of 20%+ revenue growth. In addition, the company noted they are accelerating their strategy of eliminating some of their low-margin transaction-driven offerings within their advertising cloud segment. While this will cause a revenue headwind in the near term, eliminating the lower margin business will ultimately push margins higher.Investors have typically traded ADBE in a safe fashion, that being the stock has a strong history of revenue growth, margin expansion potential, and a bright history ahead of themselves. However, investors should continue to look at valuation before making an investment.Data by YChartsSince reporting earnings last week, the stock is up ~7% and is up nearly 25% year to date. The stock has been a big outperformer this year, partially due to the company's highly recurring and visible revenue stream. However, with revenue coming in below expectations for Q2 and guidance for Q3 also coming in below expectations, investors should start to focus more on valuation at this point.While valuation does seem a little bit excessive at this point, long-term investors should remain confident in the name. The company is shedding their lower-margin revenue stream, which will ultimately give the company more margin flexibility in the future. Revenue growth is likely to be hampered in the near-term given the pandemic's effects on enterprise spend, however, spend is likely to return to normal at some point and enterprises will need to continue their IT and application spend.For now, I remain on the sidelines given high valuation, but I remain a long-term bull on this name.Revenue during the quarter came in at $3.1 billion, growing 14% compared to the year ago period and actually came in below expectations for ~$3.2 billion. Over the past several quarters, revenue growth was around 20%+, however, given the challenging macroeconomic environment, it is not a surprise revenue growth slowed down. The company's transition to a subscription-based revenue model has made revenue streams easier to predict and more recurring in nature, rather than their legacy license revenue. Subscription revenue grew 17% during the quarter and represented over 90% of the company's overall revenue.Source: Company PresentationRevenue during the quarter was weak primarily due to lower than expected enterprise demand, with the company noting delays in enterprise bookings and consulting services implementations. Given the global pandemic, it was not surprising that companies slowed their spend on non-essential investments, and focused more on keeping their doors open and transition employees to a work from home model.In addition, the company's advertising cloud experienced ~$50 million of headwinds due to the macroeconomic environment. Again, enterprises were able to cut some of their advertising expenses during the quarter as consumers were locked down in their homes and were unable to spend accordingly. Given the headwinds in this area of the business, the company decided to accelerate their strategy of eliminating low-margin transaction-driven offerings as enterprise customers are likely to shift their buying strategies in the new economic environment we are in.Source: Company PresentationGiven the company's subscription-based revenue model, gross margins tend to be consistently high and stable. During the quarter, gross margins came in at 86.7%, up from 85.2% in the year ago period. In addition, the company reported operating income growth of 27% during the quarter, which represented an operating margin of 42.7%, up from 38.3% in the year ago period. However, there were a few factors that could have benefited the strong operating margins during the quarter. First, there were a lot less travel expenses given a majority of companies worked from home for the past several weeks. In addition, the company reduced their hiring during the quarter and have accelerated their elimination of the lower-margin advertising cloud revenue.While the 42.7% margin during the quarter was strong and showed signs of meaningful expansion, the higher operating margin base makes further expansion even more challenging from here. While revenue missed expectations during the quarter, the much stronger than expected operating margins led to EPS of $2.45 during the quarter, above expectations for $2.32.Source: Company PresentationRevenue for Q3 is expected to be $3.15 billion, which implies growth of only 11% for the quarter, decelerating from the 14% growth during Q2 and below the more typical range of ~20% revenue growth. Revenue guidance also came in below expectations for $3.28 billion. The company also noted their Digital Media segment revenue is expected to grow 16% during the quarter, down from 18% in Q2, and Digital Experience segment revenue is expected to be flat compared to the year ago period, down from 5% growth in Q2.While there could be some level of conservatism baked into management's guidance given the uncertainty of the global macroeconomic environment, even if Q3 were to beat guidance, it could still end up coming in below original expectations for the quarter.The company has a history of very strong revenue growth on top of both margin expansion and continued leadership position within the market. For that reason, investors have loved this name and have seen the stock go up nearly 25% this year.While the company reported Q2 revenue and Q3 guidance below expectations just last week, the stock has continued to go higher as investors flock to ""safe-haven"" names during this period of volatility. Given the big outperformance so far this year and the stock currently trading at somewhat excessive forward multiples, I think investors should use a little more caution before entering into a position in this name.Data by YChartsData by YChartsThe stock currently trades at ~15.5x forward revenue, which seems to be at the higher end of software companies in the current market. While ADBE has very recurring revenue which is highly visible, the company reported Q2 revenue below expectations and guided Q3 below expectations. Revenue growth may be under some pressure over the next several quarters, which will cause lower revenue and could mean an inflated valuation multiple (given lower denominator in the equation). At ~15.5x forward revenue, which is the high point over the past year, investors may need to use some caution.With operating margin now above 40%, investors should also consider looking at forward P/E before investing in the company. Forward revenue multiples are a great method to use for companies with an operating loss or who are on the path towards margin expansion. However, companies with a longer history of generating profits can also be valued on their forward P/E.Over the past year, ADBE has traded at a forward P/E in a typical range of 32-40x. Currently, the stock is trading ~42x forward P/E, however, there may be some continued pressure going forward. Q3 revenue guidance came in below expectations and margins will benefit from both minimal corporate travel during the quarter and the company shedding their low-margin business. Q3 margins should actually see some benefit for these factors, which may make continued margin expansion slightly tougher going forward given these near-term benefits.While current valuation may point more towards excessive than justified, long-term investors should remain confident in the business model. The company has a long history of growth and it is challenging to believe growth will not return in some form over the next few years. I remain on the sidelines for now given valuation, but encourage long-term investors with a position in the name to hang on."
4353508,69905,2020-06-12T10:58:10-04:00,"Q3 2020 guidance points towards 11% year-over-year growth, but this slow down is very likely to be temporary.Adobe is very free cash flow generative, and it continues to deploy large sums towards share repurchases.When all is considered Adobe is not expensive, and very far from bubble territory.","Adobe's (ADBE) Q2 2020 results and guidance demonstrate that Adobe is performing very strongly despite COVID. Even though the stock has been on an astonishing run this past couple of months, I lay out my reasoning why I do not believe that stock to be fully priced, yet.On the one hand, Adobe's Digital Experience segment is performing less strongly than I had been expecting. On the other hand, Adobe's Digital Media segment remains unstoppable.On balance, paying 15 times forward sales for this strong free cash flow generating company is not exuberant. This stock is worthwhile considering, here's why:Source: author's calculations, ***Q3 2020 guidanceDespite everything that has been happening in the world, Adobe still came out with relatively strong guidance for the quarter ahead. Of course, this market a dramatic slowdown from its performance in 2019, with Q3 2020 pointing towards an 11% revenue growth rate.But given just how much uncertainty there is in the market right now, with many companies being disseminated, investors should be reassured that Adobe is still able to push out some revenue growth -- and double-digit growth is not shabby.Furthermore, what I like the most about Adobe is that despite investing for growth, Adobe is still able to generate very strong free cash flow. Indeed, during Q2 2020, Adobe's $3.1 billion in revenues ended up as approximately $1.1 billion of free cash flow.Investors have become fully accustomed to volatility. I can see this throughout all my articles (there are many), seeing stocks soar and rapidly fall no longer raise eyebrows.But these stocks certainly do reflect the underlying company's potential -- even if at times, things get slightly skewed. Here, with Adobe, we can see that its balance sheet is remarkable strong, with a net neutral cash position (where debt and cash fully offset each other).However, we can see that its ability to be highly free cash flow generative, even during highly turbulent times, is a reminder that Adobe could easily be more leveraged.But the fact that it is not, is certainly key here, because it adds to its flexibility and allows Adobe to be opportunistic, particularly when the share price is attractive, as it has been.Indeed, we can see that in this quarter, Adobe deployed 13% more capital towards repurchases than it did in the same period a year ago.Put another way, whereas most companies had to cut back on essentially all capital deployment, not only did Adobe match its shareholder returns from last year, when the economy was at peak strength, but it actually increased its shareholder returns.Again, it appears that balance sheets are irrelevant until they actually matter.Looking further ahead, we can see that Adobe asserts that it still has a further $3.4 billion it intends to deploy towards share repurchases into next year. What's more, my back of the envelope calculations implies that Adobe is committing itself to repurchase approximately $800 million to $900 million towards repurchases per quarter.But it's not all rosy.Below we can see how Adobe's segments break out into Q3 2020:Source: author's calculations, using Q3 2020 guidanceWhat we can see is that despite management's attempts to diversify and grow its Digital Experience segment, for now, Digital Media still has an overarching impact on Adobe's potential. Surely this doesn't matter? Growth is growth, right? Well not quite.It demonstrates that despite Adobe having recently deployed $5 billion for Marketo and approximately $1.6 billion for Magento, this may have not been the most attractive return on investment.Having said that, I don't blame management, but it is something to be mindful of. That Adobe remains hugely concentrated in its Digital Media segment, which includes Photoshop, Acrobat family of products, and Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects.Nevertheless during Q2 2020 management declares that Creative Cloud and Document Cloud continue to be top performers, reinforcing the thesis that Adobe's ability to assist companies along their digital transformation is very well positioned and likely to succeed irrespective of COVID.Adobe is a highly divisive stock.On the surface, many investors believe that paying 15 times forward sales, is simply too expensive.However, compared with many other SaaS businesses, Adobe is quite attractively valued. Because in Adobe's case, it continues to deliver solid growth, even if it dips slightly into Q3 2020.However, realistically, over the near-term to medium-term, we can reasonably expect Adobe to grow at approximately mid-teens. However, as pointed throughout, unlike many other SaaS players, Adobe is actually organically highly free cash flow generative -- meaning that it doesn't rely on frequent acquisition to supports its growth.Put another way, Adobe's revenues are actually worth 'something'.It would be unreasonable to contend that Adobe right now is a cheap as it was when I wrote, Adobe: Now At A Bargain Price, Finally; but that's looking in hindsight, as most stocks have rallied since March lows.However, focusing on the past is beside the point. Adobe's near-term prospects remain strong, and I believe that investors are not fully pricing its growth prospects. Accordingly, I remain bullish this stock and believe it could be worth considering for readers."

Though this number may seem low, it is important to bear in mind that Adobe's own management expects negative tax rates in 2020 ( minus 10%, 10% and minus 85%, in Q2, Q3 and Q4 respectively).Also important to consider is that post '08, the U.S. has experienced easy money at very cheap rates.

Yes, admittedly, I fall into this category.The PE ratio for ADBE NTM is 40.7x which when considering its 5 year range of 24.2 to 41.8x is definitely in the upper most end. The bulls will argue that the COVID-19 spurred race to digitize will allow industry leaders like ADBE to opportunistically capture more market share and grow. The bears will question the extent and the impact of the growth.Predicting the growth of ADBE is not an easy task or one that can be achieved with a high probability of accuracy, though the Q2 '2020 numbers look incredibly encouraging. However, the impact of the growth on the current valuation can be explored using the PEG ratio.Adobe's NTM PEG Ratio is currently 2.6; the 5 year range is 1.0 to 2.7 placing the current PEG ratio, like the PE NTM Ratio in the upper most end of the valuation spectrum. Unlike the PE, the PEG gives a good idea of Adobe's valuation incorporated with growth. The industry benchmark PEG ratio is 2.4, which means relative to the industry Adobe is 1.1x more expensive (same as NTM PE). This implies an estimated NTM EPS growth rate of 15.7% (= 40.7/2.6). Though it must be said that PEG cannot account for the fortress of cash being built in ADBE's balance sheet and its consequent impact on future growth.The Base Case DCF model (50% weight) and 85th Percentile EV/FCF CompCo (50% weight) imply a new fair value of $505 for Adobe.The key drivers for the new price target are strong adoption of Adobe's digital offerings, its ""shock-proof"" business model with steady revenue streams, superior financials with $4.35Bn in cash and over ~30% of revenue being generated in free cash flow.The key limiting factors are the current excited broader bull market trend and its ability to continue (Adobe fell 27% in the macro sell-off in mid-March), the regime of unusually low tax rates and low cost of capital (based on your views of whether these will stick given the big stimulus by the Fed and upcoming election) and extreme upper end of 5 year historical valuation ranges.Ultimately, a combination of macro-economic views, risk-profile and investment horizon will be essential in determining Adobe as an investment candidate in today's market.I have seen the stock rise 30% from $340 to the current market price, defying the broader performance of the XLK and SPY and illustrating its strong fundamentals and growth potential.To leave you with something to think about, consider the 10 year returns of Apple (AAPL) of 845%, Microsoft (MSFT) of 698%, Salesforce (CRM) of 714% and then finally the returns for Adobe - a staggering 1350%.In effect, an investment of $10,000 after dividends would have become $136,000 in Apple, $98,500 in Microsoft, $81,400 in Salesforce and $160,000 in Adobe (note: Adobe has never paid dividend and still returned more).Adobe also has a relatively small market cap, and as the larger companies face the law of large numbers and diseconomies of scale the probability of their continued growth and returns diminishes.Let me know what you think in the comments below, and what stock I should cover next!"
4353777,92586,2020-06-15T06:00:00-04:00,"Adobe is probably the poster child of my storm-resistant growth approach to equity investing.The company has market dominance, recurring revenues, a cycle-agnostic business model, and deep pockets.I would not wait for a pullback before buying, as a correction may not happen until shares have already climbed higher from here.","I was drafting the most recent weekend update report to my Storm-Resistant Growth (a.k.a. SRG) community. All of a sudden, it hit me, just as my thoughts and the words on the screen started to form at the same time:The realization came after the San Jose, California-based tech giant posted fiscal second-quarter results that were ""meh"" compared to what Adobe is used to delivering. But then again, these are very unusual times. If a company can perform just about as well in early 2020 as it does any other time, there's something special about it that should be looked at a bit closer.Credit: MicrosoftWe have all heard of Photoshop and Acrobat. Others a bit more familiar with design and photography are well aware of Illustrator and Lightroom. Most companies that run an e-commerce business and do online marketing probably know of Magento and Marketo. These are all Adobe products.It is hard to think of large-scale companies that can properly compete across Adobe's product suite. This is especially true of the digital media business, which accounts for over 70% of Adobe's revenues. Meanwhile, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and a few others can still give Adobe a run for its money in digital experience and publishing.Below is a snapshot of Adobe's position in the content management space. In the graph, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shows up as the dominant force, but only because of its much broader application Office software. When it comes to pure-play digital media and asset creation, Adobe stands head and shoulders above its direct peers (most of which are likely shoved in the ""others"" slice below).Source: Apps Run the WorldFew mega-cap names, if any, can match Adobe when it comes to recurring revenues. Nearly 92% of the company's sales in the most recent quarter came from subscriptions, a substantial increase over the 67% of five years ago (left chart below). The shift to recurring revenues helps to explain the smooth climb in all key financial metrics since 2015 at least (right chart below): revenues, op profit, earnings per share and free cash flow.Adobe also has the benefit of having a fairly well diversified product portfolio. For example, the COVID-19 crisis did not spare the company's professional services and ad cloud businesses, especially in the small- and mid-size enterprise vertical. However, creative media and digital document benefited from the lockdown due to remote work and schooling, increased use of social media and demand for digital content creation. The net-net impact to Adobe was balanced at least, if not positive.Source: DM Martins Research on the left, YCharts on the rightAdobe's market dominance and recurring revenue model have allowed it to produce steady flows of cash. As a result, the company's net cash position has consistently improved over the past decade - see graph below. Notice that the sharp drop in reserves around 2018 was a result of the Magento and Marketo acquisitions, which consumed a total of over $6 billion.Despite the investments in inorganic growth, Adobe has also managed to return cash to shareholders. The orange line below shows a steady decrease in share count driven by stock buybacks. Equity retirement even accelerated around the time of the large 2018 acquisitions. I estimate that about one-fourth of this year's EPS growth can be credited to the stock repurchase efforts of the past decade.Data by YChartsMaybe the number one reason to be bearish ADBE are the valuations. The chart below shows that the stock's current EV to revenue multiple of 16.2x is the highest among some of its key peers - including higher-growth names like Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK). The multiple has also been rising consistently over a multi-year period.But I believe that quality comes at a price. Of course, mid-March 2020 would have been a better time to back up the truck and accumulate shares on weakness, which I pointed out on March 13, when I called Adobe ""another potential winner out of the bear market"". Still, I would not necessarily wait for a pullback before hopping onboard, as a correction may not happen until shares have already climbed much higher from here.Data by YCharts"

With its recent impressive Q2 results, my conviction on this company's management and fundamental quality has been bolstered. The implied fair value as a 50% weightage of my DCF and CompCo models each implies that ADBE should trade around $430.1) Adobe is an Industry Leader with technologically differentiated suite of superior product offerings and loyal customer base.Adobe's award winning products are market leaders in their categories, and enjoy a strong brand and name retention amongst its customers such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Acrobat. With diverse product offerings at the forefront of their categories, Adobe has been successful in venturing in new areas, often complemented with efficacious acquisitions and their simultaneous integration, to capture more of the $128Bn market through its Digital Media and Digital Experience business segments.Adobe's strategy for digital media and experience, as outlined in their 10K shows the potential for growth and scale.For digital media, which accounts for 69% of revenue, Adobe has targeted growth across all consumer segments. With expansion into new categories and technologies like 3D and AR through Adobe Aero and Substance suite of products, Adobe is ready to optimize pricing strategy to move customers into higher priced and better value offerings. Finally, by enabling data-driven customer engagement through AI and ML in the multi-surface Adobe Sensei platform, Adobe will increase customer loyalty and further safeguard its single largest revenue stream.For digital experience, which accounts for 29% of revenue, Adobe wants to hone its competitive advantage and leadership position through synergistic offerings with other businesses. The intent to expand customers to include Chief Information Officers at an enterprise level has also been made clear. Adobe intends to utilize its sales force to market and license Experience cloud products including its partnership with Microsoft (MSFT). The promise of Magento Commerce which allows customers to create content and promotions for storefronts powered by specific AI suggestions is also relevant to Adobe's growth and digital experience strategy.Source: Created by Author using data from ADBE's 10K and Investor HandoutAdobe is also uniquely positioned in terms of scale. Currently over 600Mn people are avid users of Acrobat on mobile devices, and with the recent Google Drive integration, an additional 1Bn consumers can be targeted.In terms of growth, look towards the burgeoning demand for Adobe's new applications. For mobile applications like Photoshop on iPad, Lightroom and Photoshop Express demand continues to grow. With more than 35 million new Adobe IDs in Q1 '20, mobile is proving to be a strong pipeline for paid mobile-only as well as desktop subscriptions. In Q2' 20 mobile traffic, member sign-ups and monetization continued to accelerate. Adobe Fresco has seen a greater than 40% increase in downloads since the start of 2020. Photoshop Express has surpassed 20 million in monthly active users.A good indicator of an industry leader is also the innovation and R&D. In 2019 alone, Adobe filed for 500 patents and 300 technical papers. This opens Adobe to future product development. Adobe has data from trillions of transactions, tens of millions of products and thousands of retailers, which gives it the unique ability to assess the global digital economy in real-time. One example of this is that of 3M (NYSE:MMM) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) who are reaping the benefits of the Adobe Experience Platform and now cumulatively have over 10 billion active customer profiles running on Adobe Experience Platform. In terms of total addressable market, in just creative and digital cloud alone, over $44Bn remains untapped.Source: Adobe Q1 '20 Investor HandoutSource: Adobe Q1 '20 Investor HandoutAdobe's industry leading position is well established, and seems to be reinforced by well-thought out and tested strategies for growth along with a culture that promotes innovation.2) ""Shock-proof"" subscription based business model and competitive moat fortifies ADBE against the COVID-19 crisis.Net new Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue or ""ARR"" was $443 million (Q2 '20), and total Digital Media ARR exiting Q2 grew to $9.17 billion. Q2 Creative revenue was $1.87 billion, which represents 17% year-over-year growth. There has been a radical transition to shift the majority of the sales from resellers/channel to Adobe.com since 2012 and this environment during COVID-19 is showing the benefits of the move. The subscription model has created a competitive moat around at least 70% of ADBE's total revenue in the face of ""the Great Lockdown"" caused by COVID-19 (though Digital Experience may take a minor hit).Highlights:Subscription Model Growth:The strong financial results, especially in the backdrop of companies facing downgrades and defaults, has reinforced Adobe's competitive moat.[ Press Release (for more details): ADBE_Q2_2020_Press_Release.pdf ]CEO Mr. Narayen explained, during the Q1 '20 earnings call, that due to the predictable and stable nature of the company's revenue structure, there had been little to no impact on Adobe.com for the creative and document cloud. However, in Q1 '2020 there was a small, $40Mn or $0.07 EPS hit caused due to the cancellation of the Adobe Summit in light of COVID-19.Now, in the Q2 '2020 Investor Handout, the company reported that the shift to remote work has driven a surge in demand for digital documents, with use of web-based PDF services up nearly 40% quarter-over-quarter, and the number of documents shared in Acrobat increasing 50% year-over-year.Mr. Narayen detailed the digital strength of the company in the Q2 call:However, as outlined in Adobe's Q1 '20 earnings call, there were anticipated delays in enterprise bookings, especially with small and medium sized business customers, and consulting services implementations as companies prioritized employee and financial well-being.With focus on core business components, companies also aggressively cut advertising costs which caused a shortfall of approximately $50Mn on Adobe's Advertising Cloud revenue estimate.Despite the short-term challenges, the mandate to digitally transform has taken on heightened urgency. Enterprises continue to recognize Adobe's leadership in customer experience management. Key customer wins in Q2 '20 included IBM, Walgreens, Safeway, Astellas Pharma and Allianz.In light of this the company has provided slightly deflated Q3 estimates, tending to err on the side of conservatism, as they have historically.Source: Adobe Q2 '2020 Investor HandoutIt is abundantly evident that Adobe has both the correct management and business model to navigate this crisis, and possibly emerge even stronger in light of enhanced digitization globally.3) Adobe has elite fundamentals, high growth and a stellar balance sheet with experienced management at the helm.Adobe's subscription-based business model and data-driven operating model (DDOM) has presented operating income margins of ~30% growing at a 3Yr CAGR of 50% while revenue grows at an ~22% CAGR.The exceptional growth coupled with cost discipline and efficient scaling has rendered ADBE $3.2Bn in Unlv.

With disciplined management, Adobe has figured out the right balance between cash to distribute to investors via buybacks and to pump back into the company to fuel further growth.Source: Created by Author using computations from DCF and CompCo modelsAdobe is a truly world class company, and the market knows it: the company trades currently at a 50 P/E multiple (1.7x Industry Average).However, the market has overestimated COVID-19's impact on ADBE while discounting its ability to generate similar strong performance that it has historically shown.Though the CMP of $400 is near its 52Wk high, the DCF model and CompCo models built suggest that the average fair value of ADBE is ~$460. With a 13% margin of safety, the fair value as suggested by both qualitative and quantitative approaches should be between the range of $400 - 460 (16-34% upside).To be safer, the average is used implying a $430 price per share.Assumptions used in DCF Model to build financial projections:Assumptions used to formulate Weighted Average Cost of Capital:CompCo Companies and data:Rationale for company selection:In conclusion, Adobe is an undoubted industry leader with a growing base of loyal users. Adobe has also withstood the brunt of the COVID-19 crisis well - highlighting its ""shock-proof"" subscription based business model and competitive moat of strong product demand, performance and recognition. With impressive gross and net income margins, as well as high FCF generation and ample cash reserves, the company is being navigated through the current crisis with adeptness by an experienced management team.Adobe currently trades around $400. However, as implied by a 50% weightage of a bear case DCF modeled after Adobe's 10 year CAGR performance and 50% weightage to an EV/FCF that places Adobe in the 85th percentile of comparable companies yields a price target of $430.This represents a potential $30 or 7.2% upside and 3.6% upside from a consensus price target of $414 (source: Factset). The price target of $430 has an embedded margin of safety with the mid-range of estimate being used as well as being modeled using the bear case scenario for Adobe.To note: despite withdrawing 2020 annual guidance, Adobe's fundamental business and strategy have not significantly altered to question a change in outlook.

Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.Adobe (ADBE) has hands down been one of the best success stories among ""legacy"" software stocks of the past several years. After undergoing a painstaking transition from a license software company to becoming a SaaS offering, Adobe has claimed its place as one of the largest and most unique software companies in the industry with a portfolio of brand-name products across various businesses.Investors have parked their faith in Adobe all year long, despite evidence from Adobe's most recent Q2 results that the company has been adversely impacted by the coronavirus. Year to date, shares of Adobe are up 22%, versus ~6% down for the S&P 500.Data by YChartsGiven this outperformance, I think it's an appropriate time for investors to begin trimming their positions in Adobe. It's important to recognize that Adobe's growth came in below estimates in Q2 - and are expected to flag under estimates yet again in Q3. The stock's resilience largely owes to the fact that Adobe still managed to grow operating income and EPS at a double-digit pace this quarter, but that is due to the fact that Adobe saved dramatically on the cancellation of customer events and other sales-related travel this quarter. These are not sustained savings, like layoffs and headcount reductions would be.There's no doubt that Adobe still holds a portfolio of flagship products that are irreplaceable and have little competition in the software arena, including Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Reader, and other household names within the Adobe Creative Cloud portfolio. There's little doubt that Adobe can continue to grow both its business and its earnings. At the same time, however, valuation makes us take a second look and step back from this stock. Wall Street's consensus EPS target for Adobe this year is $9.71, giving Adobe a P/E ratio of 41.8x. Even when we think about Adobe from a PEG perspective and consider this quarter's EPS growth of 34% (again, very few believe this rate of growth is sustainable - FY21 EPS estimates call for just 14% y/y growth), Adobe's PEG ratio of 1.22x implies a fully-valued stock.The bottom line on Adobe: this is a great company, but investors coming in now don't have much room for upside left.Let's now review Adobe's most recent results and some of the commentary surrounding it, especially around the impacts of the coronavirus. Take a look at the earnings summary below:Figure 1. Adobe 2Q20 resultsSource: Adobe 2Q20 earnings release Right off the bat, investors should be aware that Adobe suffered a rare miss in growth estimates this quarter. As recently as last year, Adobe had been capable of pulling off steady ~20% y/y revenue growth. This quarter, however, Adobe's revenue growth slipped to 14% y/y and hit only $3.13 billion, shy of Wall Street's expectations of $3.16 billion (+15% y/y).A current-quarter miss would be bad enough - but Adobe expects the weakness to sustain. Adobe's Q3 guidance calls for $3.15 billion, which implies revenue deceleration worsening even further to just 11% y/y growth, and falling far short of Wall Street's $3.28 billion expectations (+16% y/y). Each of Adobe's two main segments are expected to see weakness: Digital Media is expected to see growth slip two points from 18% y/y this quarter to 16% y/y next quarter, while Digital Experience will fall from 5% y/y growth this quarter to flat in Q3.Given this dour news, it's incredible that Adobe was able to hold on to its vaunted valuation multiples (and which is also why I'd recommend investors trim their positions while they have a chance).Figure 2. Adobe guidance updateSource: Adobe 2Q20 earnings release Let's now put some context around these numbers. There were two main weaknesses in the quarter. The first, and probably the most important one, was enterprise demand. Per CEO Shantanu Narayen's prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call:The second piece of weakness was Adobe's advertising cloud. In 2016, Adobe spent $540 million to acquire an adtech platform called TubeMogul. Unsurprisingly, digital advertising has been one of the hardest-hit segments within tech this quarter as all companies treated their marketing spend as discretionary expenses that were the first to be cut in an effort to conserve cash. Adobe was already in the process of beginning to phase out some of the transaction-oriented business with the Advertising Cloud (aka, ad buys on behalf of clients), but with the weakness seen in the second quarter and expected weakness continuing into the third, Adobe has decided to accelerate the downsizing of this segment. Per Narayen's remarks:The one major bright spot to call out was Adobe's Document Cloud. As expected, the coronavirus has helped to accelerate the process of moving paper processes online. Adobe's Document Cloud saw respectable 22% y/y growth in the quarter to $360 million in revenues, putting it at a slightly larger quarterly revenue run-rate than Docusign (DOCU), its most significant pure-play competitor.Yet amid this revenue shortfall, Adobe still generated superb earnings growth, which is the major guardrail that Adobe had that prevented the stock from diving.Figure 3. Adobe profit trendsSource: Adobe 2Q20 earnings release As shown in the chart above, Adobe's pro forma operating income grew 27% y/y to $1.335 billion, representing a pro forma operating margin of 42.7%. That's up substantially from just 38.3% in the year-ago quarter. But is it sustainable? A good chunk of this quarter's margin improvement came from the fact that Adobe had to cancel customer events and ground employee travel. Once the economy fully re-opens, Adobe will put on events again in an effort to drive sales growth.Adobe also noted that it ""reduced the pace of hiring,"" but the company - which reports total headcount, unlike most other software companies - still added roughly 600 net new employees in Q2 to end at ~23.0k, roughly the same as the number of employees Adobe added in the previous Q2.We should note as well that Adobe will continue to see optical strength on margins as the company continues to phase out the Advertising Cloud. The low-margin adtech revenues will disappear from Adobe's top line - so the denominator will shrink and margins will appear to grow, but it's not due to any added efficiencies or cost saving.Again, we note here that Wall Street's consensus estimate for FY21 pro forma EPS is only $11.10, or 14% higher than this year's consensus of $9.71. We wonder why Adobe can manage a >40x P/E ratio when its expected earnings growth is only about average.Investors have piled into Adobe as a safety trade. Yes, Adobe's revenue growth has decelerated somewhat due to delayed enterprise demand, but on the whole customers' usage of Adobe products is largely un-impacted (the same cannot be said of retail and travel companies amid the pandemic). But right now, with Adobe trading at more than double the S&P 500's valuation, investors are paying a hefty price for that safety. I'd lock in any gains now and wait on the sidelines until the price begins to unwind again.I'm launching The Daily Tech Download, a Seeking Alpha Marketplace service, on June 22.

4348008,102007,2020-05-15T12:46:59-04:00,"Adobe reported strong Q1 2020 results and management gave upbeat Q2 guidance indicating continued growth despite headwinds.While there will be impacts from the pandemic, Adobe is demonstrating the resilience and growth potential of its business model.We think the stock is one of the best SaaS success stories that has significant runway to grow for years to come.","Adobe (ADBE) is famously successful in its transition to a subscription-based model and it continues to post impressive growth. Its bread and butter creative and document software are the leaders in their respective categories and will likely drive the bulk of the future growth for years to come. It also has leading positions in marketing, analytics, customer engagement, and e-commerce. We think the recent Q1 results and Q2 guidance reassured investors that the growth story remains intact at this SaaS giant.Digital Media remains the largest segment accounting for 70% of Q1 revenue. This segment includes many popular products including creative cloud and adobe acrobat pro. This is the strong SaaS offering that Adobe has relied on to achieve its success. The segment boosts both the popular creative tools such as Photoshop and Lightroom that are used across multiple platforms and devices. From the early days of software license sales, many users have made the transition to cloud subscriptions. Another important product in this segment is the document cloud product suite which are the widely used applications for editing, sharing, scanning documents. We believe both of these segments still have ample runway for growth as the world moves towards digital workspace and cloud workflow.(Source: Public Filings)Digital Experience segment houses the marketing, analytics, and Magento e-commerce products. Accounting for 28% of the total revenue, this segment has been more affected by the pandemic as sales growth slowed down to 15% in Q1, and management expects further softness in Q2. However, we think this segment has the potential to become another high-growth area once the economic condition improves due to its torque to e-commerce. The short-term impact on marketing and analytics will result in a temporary slowdown but we think the rebound will also be swift coming out of this.(Source: Public Filings)Lastly, the core strength of Adobe's SaaS model is its strong bookings based on signed contracts. Adobe defined its annual value of subscriptions and services in its Digital Media segment as ARR and it has a combined $8.7 billion of bookings at the end of Q1, underpinning strong revenue visibility and stability. The Digital Experience segment also generates the majority of its sales from subscriptions. We think the reason SaaS players have outperformed the broader market is their cash flow resilience and revenue visibility supported by long-term contracts. Enterprise software players also benefit from an increased focus on digital workflow and cloud solutions as companies move towards remote working and collaboration.(Source: Public Filings)While Adobe is better insulated from the pandemic due to its SaaS model and the accompanying predictability and visibility, management still took down the Q2 growth rate citing macro uncertainty on the earnings conference call. For Q2, Adobe is expecting Digital Media revenue growth of 19% and Digital Experience growth of 12%. Both of these figures are below historical trends which highlight the impact from COVID-19 as customers delay spending and implementations. However, the absolute rate of growth remains strong in light of the economic disruption within the broader business community. As a result, we think investors will continue to pay a premium for Adobe and its SaaS peers simply because of their stability and secular tailwind. Growth is hard to find under the current economic condition and Adobe is still delivering double-digit growth across the board. Another effect from the current pandemic is a likely reduction in expenses to Adobe as it cuts back traveling and events. The company recently canceled its annual summit and we expect similar recalibration.While Adobe appears well-positioned during this pandemic, there will undoubtedly still be negative impacts to be felt in the coming quarters. First of all, some customers will defer purchasing decisions on products and services. Secondly, Adobe's creative products are used by many small businesses and independent creators. Some of them are likely impacted by the downturn and could reduce spending on Adobe products. However, given the essential nature of Adobe's software to creative professionals, we expect the impact to be minimal and only limited to cases where an entire business is shut down. Ultimately, given the small exposure to transactional revenue, we think Adobe is well-insulated from the current economic downturn. Adobe reported 2020 Q1 revenue of $3.1 billion representing a 19% growth from last year. The company is expected to maintain double-digital growth for the next couple of years which is in-line with other peers. The company has a market cap of $13 billion and trades at ~12x EV/2021 sales. We think Adobe is fairly priced at current levels given its superior product portfolio, dominating market shares in large addressable markets, and SaaS strength. (Source: Public Filings and Bloomberg)Adobe is up ~11% in 2020 so far which is better than most of its peers except ServiceNow (NOW). We think Adobe's track record of growth and shareholder value creation has not been disrupted by the pandemic. In a world of increasing uncertainties, Adobe's SaaS model should garner increasing appreciation from investors. We believe its performance this year so far has demonstrated the appeal of stable and predictable cash flow.(Source: Bloomberg)Adobe is the world's leading SaaS player having successfully transitioned its portfolio of software to a subscription model over the years. The company is well-positioned to weather the current storm based on its impeccable balance sheet, stable revenue underpinned by large deferred revenues, and mission-critical nature of its products to businesses including creative professionals and various businesses. We think it is difficult to find high-quality growth stocks in today's environment as the pandemic has reached every corner of the corporate world. However, the relative strength of Adobe's portfolio is earning itself a premium over other industries. As the economic uncertainty prolongs, we think investors will increasingly appreciate the uniqueness of Adobe's growth profile. Long-term investors should be rewarded in this all-weather SaaS juggernaut over time."

It's not because its valuation has come down by 10% from its all-time highs, but rather because there are simply very few alternatives that are able to lock in customers with as tightly as Adobe.Adobe's Digital Media segment, its largest segment accounting for approximately 75% of Adobe's total revenue, is well positioned to support enterprises along their digital journeys.Indeed, Adobe's product suite line-up is nicely diversified into being an industry leader for creative professionals, and this segment is guided to be up 19% in Q2 2020.Having said that, Adobe's smaller segment, its Digital Experience segment, which accounts for approximately 25% of total revenue as of Q1 2020, is guided to be up 12%.Given this segment exposure to analytics, commerce, content, and advertising, this level of growth looks middle of the road. Particularly, after coming off Q4 2019 growing at 24%. However, given this segment's exposure to what is shaping up to be a particularly challenging advertising environment, investors should be content that Adobe is still able to grow this segment in the double digits.Adobe today trades for 52x trailing earnings, which for this value investor is typically outside his comfort zone.However, the combination of Adobe's visibility, together with its recurring share repurchases that have supported its GAAP EPS to grow with a 3-year CAGR of 37%, reminds us of the bargain opportunity available here.For Adobe to continue to grow, its business model requires that sales reps travel to conferences and meet with customers. Consequentially, although Adobe notes that it has a very strong self-serve website, there's still a significant amount of hand-holding required to get customers to sign up. This will play a role in dampening Adobe's near-term prospects over the next several quarters as social distancing continues to be in effect.Next, critically, investors are pricing Adobe for not only strong recurring revenues driven by customers that are already locked in but Adobe's business will also demand revenue growth from new customers adopting Adobe for their needs. On this front, there are some question marks about Adobe's ability to upsell and cross-sell to customers, as the economy goes into a global contraction.Adobe's bounce back from its March lows has been in part coincided with overall investor optimism towards equities.Having said that, despite this bounce back, investors thinking slightly longer term than a few quarters will be rewarded by investing in Adobe, as it continues to be an industry leader and the only platform for many creative fields.Adobe's Q2 2020 and possibly Q3 2020 results will not be as strong as shareholders have become accustomed to, but looking out further into late 2020 and early 2021, this highly profitable enterprise, which is growing its EPS with a 3-year CAGR at 37%, is very attractively priced."

4352312,20715,2020-06-06T09:13:27-04:00,"Adobe is set to report second-quarter earnings results on Thursday and it has performed extremely well, from a fundamental perspective, over the last few years.The weekly chart shows that the stock is in overbought territory based on the 10-week RSI and the weekly stochastic indicators.Sentiment toward the stock is neutral compared to other stocks and far less bullish than it should be for Adobe.","The software industry has been one of the top performing groups so far in 2020. According to Investor’s Business Daily’s sector performance statistics, it is the second-best performer so far this year behind the auto sector. It is one of only nine sectors out of 33 that are in positive territory through June 4. One of the leading stocks in the software sector is Adobe (ADBE) and the company is set to report second-quarter earnings results on Thursday.Adobe has been in the portfolio of my Hedged Alpha Strategy service since last October and the stock has performed well for subscribers. One of the reasons the stock was recommended was due to its fundamental strength. Over the last few years, the company has seen its earnings grow by 37% per year and they increased by 33% in the first quarter. Analysts expect Adobe to report earnings of $2.33 per share for the quarter and that would be an increase of 27.2% over the second quarter of 2019.Revenue is expected to come in at $3.16 billion and that would mean an increase of 15.2% over last year. Over the last three years, revenue has increased by an average of 24% per year and it was up by 19% in the first quarter.Analysts expect earnings to grow by 24% for 2020 as a whole and revenue is expected to increase by 16.2%.Adobe’s management efficiency measurements are extremely strong with a return on equity of 38.9% and a profit margin of 38.9% as well. Both of those figures are well above average. In terms of valuation measurements, the stock is a little pricey currently with a P/E ratio of 59 and a forward P/E of 39.5.Software stocks as a whole and tech stocks in general have gotten caught up in the rotation out of growth stocks and into value stocks over the last three weeks. Adobe has managed to keep up with the overall market and has performed better than the tech sector as a whole.The overall fundamental picture for Adobe remains strong and I look for the earnings report to keep that status intact. The company has beaten earnings estimates in each of the last eight quarters and I expect that to be the case again.Adobe’s stock fell during the overall market downturn in February and March, but one thing it did do was stay in its upward trend. The trendline on the chart is the one I was watching to determine if I needed to issue closeout instructions. The stock did fall below the trendline during the one week in March, but it didn’t close below that trendline and the stock remained above our stop. The green arrow on the chart represents when I recommended it while the red arrow represents when I recommended closing the first half in order to lock in profits and reduce risk.Like the trendline, the 104-week moving average was penetrated on an intra-week basis, but the stock never closed below it. The stock has since rebounded nicely and hit an all-time high.The big rally off of the March low has caused the 10-week RSI and the weekly stochastic indicators to enter overbought territory. That isn’t really anything new for Adobe as you can see by how much time the indicators have spent in overbought territory in the last few years.I am keeping Adobe in the portfolio, but I am watching closely for any warnings signs that the stock may turn lower.Looking at the sentiment indicators for Adobe, they haven’t changed much at all since I recommended the stock in October. There are 27 analysts covering the stock at this time with 18 “buy” ratings, eight “hold” ratings, and one “sell” rating. This gives us a buy percentage of 66.7% and that percentage was at 63% in October with 17 “buys” and 10 “holds”.The short interest ratio is at 2.09 and it was at 2.08 in October. The ratio has been up and down a little since the beginning of the year, but it has nearly doubled in the last few months. The number of shares sold short has dropped during this period, but the average daily trading volume has declined at a more rapid rate.The put/call ratio is at 1.40 and that is well above average and it is higher than we have seen in the past for Adobe. There are 112,648 puts open and 80,200 calls open at this time. I have written about Adobe on several other occasions and the ratio has been as low as 0.85 and as high as 1.18 when I have written those articles. Looking at more recent readings, the ratio did spike to 1.76 in early April and has drifted a little lower over the last few months.I would say that the overall sentiment outlook is neutral, but given the fundamental strength and the price performance, I think the sentiment is still more pessimistic than it should be for Adobe. From my perspective, that is a good thing as there are still enough doubters that can help push the stock higher if they shift to a bullish stance.Obviously, I am still bullish on Adobe for the long run. The stock wouldn’t be in the portfolio if I wasn’t still bullish on it. I am a little concerned about the stock being in overbought territory according to both the 10-week RSI and the weekly stochastic indicators. That’s a minor concern because, as I said earlier, the stock has been known to remain in overbought territory for extended periods of time.If you own the stock already, I suggest holding on to it. If you are looking to add the stock to your holdings, I don’t know that right now would be the best timing. I would recommend waiting for a pullback so that the upside potential is in line with potential downside risk. My subscribers are already sitting on a gain of over 30% for the trade as a whole and over 40% for the second half. Our downside risk is somewhat limited.Because the sentiment isn’t over-the-top bullish, I can see Adobe surging above the $400 level next week if the company beats on the EPS and revenue estimates and then we could see a little pullback in the ensuing weeks. If the stock surges above $300 and then pulls back down to the $375 area, that could be a better entry point. If for some reason the stock were to fall after earnings, I would look to get in anywhere below the $325 level. The high from last summer and the trendline look like they could converge in the $315-$320 area and that could act as powerful support. Getting in anywhere near the $325 area would give you a place from which to set a stop below the potential support."

Glance at the company's financial results quickly, and one would forget that the world has been upside down lately.Adobe has been one of the largest holdings in my All-Equities SRG portfolio since its inception, and will remain so in the foreseeable future.","With a record-size EPS beat and a slight but rare revenue miss, Adobe (ADBE) breezed through a challenging fiscal second quarter. The SaaS company posted respectable top-line growth in the mid-teens. Adjusted EPS of $2.45 increased by an impressive 34%, although a look under the hood reveals some cost tailwinds that were unique to the past few months.In the aggregate, Adobe proved once again that it can perform well in a range of scenarios, from economic expansion to global pandemic. Shares climbed by as much as 4% in after-hours trading.Credit: Office SnapshotsAdobe's fiscal second quarter was a bit unusual in a few ways - but then again, what hasn't in this economy? Starting with revenues, the $30 million miss to expectations can be fully explained by Adobe choosing to wind down the transaction-driven ad cloud business more quickly than expected. If not for it, revenues would have topped estimates by an inch, as is usually the case.The large digital media segment, accounting for more than 70% of revenues, was a net beneficiary of the shelter-in-place economy. Remote schooling, social content creation and widespread use of digital documents helped to drive web traffic and app downloads higher. The nearly half a billion dollar sequential increase in creative and document ARR (annual recurring revenues) was impressive, and topped guidance by more than $50 million.The problem, even if minor in the grand scheme of things, was Adobe's smaller experience segment. In addition to the changes in the advertising cloud business that ate into the company's revenues, professional services took a hit due to delayed client spending and the struggles of small- and mid-sized companies ahead of the current recession.Source: D.M. Martins Research, using data from company's earnings releaseWhat came further down the income statement (see table above) impressed me the most. Op margin shot through the roof, which allowed Adobe to top EPS consensus by the widest margin of the past five years at least.But here again, the COVID-19 crisis played a role. Sure, getting rid of a low-margin business helped with profitability. But it looks like Adobe played quite a bit of defense in the second quarter. The company held back on hiring and saved on other operating costs, preferring a ""wait and see"" approach to the pandemic and its implications. In the third quarter, Adobe is committed to investing in growth once again, which explains EPS guidance of $2.40 that lagged expectations by seven cents.Adobe's earnings report looked good, even if not outstanding. But more importantly, I believe a quick step-back is in order. Considering all the disruptions caused by the novel coronavirus, Adobe's performance reflected the resilience of the subscription-based business model. Glance at the company's financial results too quickly, and one would miss the fact that the world has been upside down for the past three to six months.Data by YChartsThe chart above explains in a visual way why I am highly bullish ADBE. The company has built a solid recurring-revenue business (subscription sales accounted for nearly 92% of the total) that has resulted in all key financial metrics smoothly heading up and to the right over the past several years.""Well, that's boring!"" Yes, exactly. I'll take predictability, market dominance and deep pockets with my eyes closed during these highly uncertain times, even if valuation is rich at a forward P/E of about 40x.I don't know what will happen to the economy and the markets going forward. This is why I stick with what works. Adobe has been one of the largest holdings in my All-Equities SRG portfolio since its inception, and it will remain so in the foreseeable future."
4333602,41961,2020-03-23T09:49:02-04:00,"Adobe's best in class content creation and visual editing tools are almost required knowledge amongst content creation professionals.Recent reported results suggest strong growth, with the coronavirus pandemic representing a modest, temporary drag on results.Adobe's share price pullback of almost 25% gives investors interested in long-term growth something to consider.","While not much has fundamentally changed about the Adobe (ADBE) business within the last two months, the company's share price has fallen almost 25% within the last month on broader economic worries about the impact of the coronavirus. If one doesn't believe that the economy will completely implode on itself and fail to recover over the next 12 to 18 months, Adobe is definitely a business to put on the watchlist as a long-term buy-and-hold opportunity.Adobe's Photoshop, Premiere Pro and Premiere Effects are best in class image editing and video creation tools, and almost required software for any design professional. Industry forces which emphasize educational design instruction on Adobe software packages create new cohorts of graduates well trained on these tools, which employers in turn support with Adobe software.Adobe's unique ability to tie together such best in class content creation tools with rich analytical insight around user demographics and engagement statistics for content consumption is something that really helps close the loop for most developers. Adobe's acquisitions of Omniture and Magento in particular have helped the business to lay a solid foundation to equip developer customers with behavioral targeting and web analytics that provide additional audience insight to those developers.Adobe's place in the creative economy as the provider of tools to help content creators appears to be firmly intact, irrespective of what happens in the near term. Fast mobile networks, devices with high processing capabilities and a shift to content monetization via digital advertising have all come together to create strong demand for digital content creation and accompanying analytics and marketing tools.The consumption of content via mobile device is rising as ultra fast mobile networks make it easier and more efficient to view rich media and large video streams. Rising CPMs for video pre rolls, and a trend toward higher video conversion rates, coupled with increasing video inventory create demand for well edited video content.While the coronavirus pandemic may depress near term advertising demand, particularly amongst certain hard hit sectors of the economy such as food retail and hospitality, continued consumption of high quality, image rich content will almost certainly continue. In fact, increased media and video consumption may quite possibly accelerate over the next 3 to 6 months during times of economic uncertainty and more limited user mobility. Content creatives of all types look to Adobe's tools to develop the highly interactive rich imagery that's necessary to attract and retain viewers.The overall success of Adobe's strategy has been consistently seen by the business over the last few years.Adobe has averaged revenue growth of approximately 23% over the last 3 years. Adobe's retention of revenue is also very good, with a gross margin consistently near 85% and net margin above 25%. Consistent with the company's strong financial discipline and various growth opportunities, Adobe sports returns on invested capital near 20%, which is exceptionally good. Free cash flow generation is often 30% or higher of the company's revenue, resulting in a business that can largely control its own destiny as far as financing investment and growth.These strong results have continued through most recent reporting, in spite of uncertainty created by the coronavirus pandemic. Reported results for Q1 showed revenue which grew 19% year on year to $3.1B. Digital Media, the bulk of Adobe's revenue, grew 22%, while Digital Experience experienced growth of 15%.Interestingly, revenue guidance for Q2 of $3.2B was surprisingly strong in spite of all the turmoil created by coronavirus concerns. Growth in both the Digital Media and Digital Experience segment is expected to experience modest declines, with Digital Media expected to now grow 19% and Digital Experience expected to grow some 12%.While the company explicitly highlighted delayed decision making amongst large enterprise as the principal reason for delay, with focus in this segment shifting to contingency planning and more caution in budgetary spending, the effects of this pandemic are more likely to delay Adobe's more concerted push into the SMB segment. In late 2019, Adobe made considerable effort to reposition its Digital Experience Product Portfolio to more explicitly target SMBs (Small & Medium Business).Adobe's integrated suite of content creation and content analytics provides functional capabilities such as lead management, email and customer marketing alongside content creation tools, which allow it to be considered as a holistic provider of choice. While larger businesses with more sophisticated internal IT departments may still look at individual point solutions and select best in class, Adobe's integrated suite approach is likely to find favor within the SMB segment in particular who value the convenience of an all in one platform with multiple marketing, content creation and analytical capabilities without having to manage the complexity of numerous point applications and multiple platforms.Unfortunately, SMBs are most likely the ones who will be under the most significant economic distress in the near term. Thus Adobe's traction in its digital experience segment, particularly among this segment is likely to slow, with SMBs having less resiliency to cope with large downturns in their business and being more focused on staying afloat.However, any setback there is likely to be temporary rather than something of long term consequence.Adobe's share price has fallen back recently to below the $300 range, which is starting to be indicative of attractive value. Adobe's forward P/E of just under 30 is below its 5 year average, and toward the bottom of the range of where it has traded over the last few years. In times of significant uncertainty, playing defense with secular, cash rich businesses is a strategy that can assist greatly in value preservation.With large sections of industry such as airlines, hospitality, and retail now coming to an indefinite halt to prevent rapid spread of the coronavirus, Adobe is a name that people interested in a quality, high growth asset should keep on their watchlist for long-term total return."

Net-net, given the recent market selloff, I believe it is a good time to start a position in one of the best balanced SaaS plays in the market.Source: MicrosoftAdobe offers a balanced growth and profitability profile that few SaaS providers have today. Historically, the stock has performed well and has been a steady grower.Here is a five-year graph:Source: KoyfinAs the market has come to realize Adobe's profile, it has also grown more expensive. However, every few months there is an opportunity to buy in big. You can see the quick rebounds in the EV/S ratio here. We had one in summer 2019 and one in March 2020.Source: KoyfinHowever, if we dive in deeper into the trailing P/E ratio, we see a curious trend. The earnings power of the business is growing faster than the value the market attributes to each dollar of earnings. It is getting cheaper on a P/E basis, which leads me to believe Adobe's earning power is still underappreciated in this five-year view.Source: KoyfinThis led me to build up my own valuation models, which suggest that now is a good time to start a position and in the volatility ahead to add significantly to a world class SaaS name.Digging deeper into valuation, I took a series of valuation approaches to better understand the fair value of the business today. Looking at analyst estimates and my own haircuts to those, I come to a fair value of $390/share, a slight premium to today's price.Waiting for market selloffs is a good time to add to positions, along with adding today at a discount to FMV.Across a variety of valuation metrics, one can see that Adobe trades at a discount. Here is the dashboard:Diving into comparables, we can see that Adobe trades at a premium on a P/E basis and a discount on a few metrics. Looking at a DCF, you can see my model below which shows a fair value near to current prices:Long rumored, we could see Microsoft (MSFT), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), or SAP (SAP) coming in to buy Adobe if the price really deteriorates. This essentially creates a floor on valuation and how much the stock can drop. Further, given the cash positions of many of the listed potential acquirers, it would not be surprising to see them acquire Adobe at a premium to the fair value.I see this outcome as a non-zero possibility, and one to seriously think about as you build a position in the name. Adobe sits at the intersection of advertising, creativity, and collaboration, key trends that will continue for the foreseeable future.As with any investment, we must also consider the risks. Given Adobe's exposure to advertising revenue, it may take a hit from a lack of demand and dampened global spending.Some good statistics are coming out on the changes due to COVID. Although these are short-term headwinds, they could present good dip-buying opportunities.Source: HubAnother consideration is valuation for Adobe. We can see that the market has started to approach its shift first to SaaS and then its foray into digital experiences. The market may selloff around the board and multiples may compress in mid-growth technology for some time. This trend could affect Adobe as well.Third, we have to consider execution. Digital ads are a competitive space with many major players at scale. Collaboration is an exciting play with many startups and emerging companies like DocuSign (DOCU) and others. I believe in Adobe's management and their track record speaks for itself in this avenue. It will be able to use its brand and existing assets to continue driving market-beating returns for shareholders in my view, but execution is always a risk.Overall, on a variety of tests, Adobe trades slightly below fair value. A market pullback, as we saw in March 2020, presents a good opportunity to really build into a position. In the meantime, it is a good time to start a position at slightly below fair value. Looking at the upside case, one can view a position today as having significant upside potential combined with downside protection, making it a safer play than many other players in SaaS."
4332154,103480,2020-03-16T09:29:21-04:00,"Adobe's completed transition into becoming a subscription-focused company will serve it well during the coronavirus scare, providing it a steady stream of recurring revenues.Despite being an ""old"" software company, Adobe is still growing revenue at ~20% y/y.The company also has plenty of balance sheet liquidity with ~$4.2 billion in cash to weather any near-term cash shortages.With shares off ~15% from recent all-time highs despite being a safe, predictable business, it's a good time to invest in Adobe.","This article was highlighted for PRO+ subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.Amid the market meltdown over the past week, investors should look to buy stocks in one of two categories:Adobe (ADBE), in my view, falls into that latter bucket. The software publisher best known for products like Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Acrobat has long been one of the most solid names in the sector, having weathered countless other crises since its founding in 1982.Make no mistake - the general market downturn has affected Adobe shares as well. But the stock is relatively sheltered compared to the broader market, having lost ~25% from its all-time highs near $390 relative to an S&P 500 that has shed 20%.It's a good time, in my view, for investors to pick up shares of Adobe at a discount and to bank on the stock's relative safety to weather the downturn.A few years back, Adobe embarked upon a massive overhaul of its business to become a pure subscription-based company. Instead of selling license packages for its suite of products, Adobe started charging its customers via annual and monthly subscription fees. While this had the impact of lowering revenues in the near term and splitting payments over a long time horizon, we can see one of the biggest positives of that decision during uncertain times such as today.Adobe's impact from the coronavirus isn't zero - there are certainly some Adobe resellers whose businesses will be impacted by new customers' willingness to invest in software products during a macroeconomic crunch. But on the whole, Adobe's large stable of existing customers remains on solid ground.In a shareholder letter that accompanied Adobe's fourth-quarter results, Adobe wrote as follows:We note as well that Adobe's guidance for the second quarter calls for 16% overall y/y revenue growth, with 19% y/y growth in the core Digital Media segment (which provides roughly two-thirds of Adobe's overall revenues). And despite a general fear that the coronavirus would halt or severely slow down new business, Adobe still expects to sign on $385 million of net-new ARR (about 5% of FY19's total digital media revenue of $7.7 billion) in the quarter.Figure 1. Adobe guidanceSource: Adobe Q1 earnings releaseThere's a lot to like about Adobe's most recent results, even if doesn't yet give us a clue on the impacts of the coronavirus. See the earnings summary below:Figure 2. Adobe 1Q20 resultsSource: Adobe Q1 earnings releaseRevenues grew 19% y/y to $3.09 billion in the quarter, beating Wall Street's expectations for $3.05 billion (+17% y/y) by a comfortable two-point margin. Subscription revenues saw even faster 23% y/y growth to $2.83 billion, and made up a whopping 91% mix of Adobe's overall revenues.If we assume the impact of the coronavirus is slight, and even bake in a point of natural quarter-over-quarter deceleration - we'd think that Adobe's 16% y/y growth forecast for Q2 is rather conservative.Adobe's finance chief, John Murphy, also called out that mobile app subscriptions are contributing greatly to Adobe's growth, especially across Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Stock. Other Adobe initiatives like Document Cloud, which is industry leader Docusign's (DOCU) most significant competitor, also continues to perform well. We note as well that Adobe drove tremendous growth on the earnings front, showing us exactly how lucrative fully mature subscription software companies can be. Operating income jumped 35% y/y to $937 million, while GAAP EPS grew 43% y/y to $1.98. Pro forma EPS of $2.27, meanwhile, beat out Wall Street's expectations of $2.23 and grew 33% y/y.Another positive to be said about Adobe is its cash-rich balance sheet, plus its incredible ability to generate gobs of operating cash flows each quarter.Companies across the U.S. have been instructed to draw down their credit lines to preserve their liquidity in the face of any macroeconomic slowdowns prompted by the coronavirus. Adobe, on the other hand, is already cash-rich. Its most recent balance sheet, shown below, carries $4.2 billion of cash:Figure 3. Adobe 1Q20 balance sheetSource: Adobe Q1 earnings releaseWe note as well that Adobe generated a stunning $1.32 billion in operating cash flows in Q1 alone, up 31% y/y. Adobe's strong balance sheet position and the fact that its subscription business continues to throw off huge cash streams gives us a lot of comfort that Adobe is well-equipped to weather any near-term disruptions.Investors' flight to quality is likely what has kept Adobe shares from losing as much as its counterparts in the software sector - but still, the fact that Adobe offers a combination of growth and safety while trading at ~25% off highs makes it a compelling buy case for your shopping list during the current bear market reversal. Continue monitoring the stock's moves for an entry pint over the next several weeks."
4332241,69905,2020-03-16T13:56:25-04:00,"During these very uncertain times, Adobe makes a lot of sense.This highly cash-generative business has just gone on sale.Investors should not attempt to time the market.Buying great companies when there is blood on the street works.","Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), like the rest of the market, is in free fall. Investors are no longer being driven by common sense. Right now, it's all panic. And for good measure, too: a global recession is on the cards.Yet, despite all this, or because of all this, in a turnaround event, I'm highly bullish Adobe at this valuation. Here's why:Adobe reported its Q1 2020 results last week. CEO Shantanu Narayen who is always very measured and positive of Adobe's prospects could have held Adobe's investors' call with heavy rhetoric, yet devoid of tangible facts. However, that was not to be.Indeed, during these very uncertain times, Adobe signposted to investors that Q2 2020 would see its revenues grow by approximately 16% compared with the same period a year ago.This is a marked departure from what investors have become accustomed to seeing from Adobe, which was growing steadily its revenues at approximately 20% - but there again, everything in the near term will be very surprising, and not the good kind.The answer, of course, comes from Adobe's subscription-based business model.This is the reason why investors were up until recently being asked to pay a huge premium for this enterprise. Investors craved steady and predictable results and were willing to pay significantly for this.Now, that the black swan arrived, the business is being put to the test, and thus far, Adobe's business is holding up.Yes and no. The good news is that Adobe is by far one of the leaders at the pinnacle of the digital revolution.Furthermore, Adobe is a strong cash flow generative business, with impressive GAAP margins (including stock-based compensation) hitting close to 30%.The problem, though, is that now that crunch time has come, will enterprises continue to plow ahead and invest in their digital operations? Or will all but non-essential investments, including IT infrastructure spend, be deferred? I believe the latter.In fact, Narayen notes that Adobe is already seeing enterprises' appetite for increased digital consumption being curtailed and deferred.Source: author's calculationsHowever, as noted above, Adobe's biggest contributor is its Digital Media segment. And this segment is still guided to grow by approximately 19% year over year in Q2 2020. This segment's operations include household names such as Photoshop, Acrobat family of products, and Adobe XD, to name a few. In essence, this segment is responsible for driving digital content creation and consumption globally.As a value investor, I do not believe in the folly of market timing. I believe in buying great companies cheaply and holding onto until its valuation more closely approximates intrinsic value.Looking back, over the past three years, Adobe has been compounding its bottom line 'clean' GAAP EPS in the high 30s percent.Put another way, although its revenues have only been growing at close to 20%, its consistent share repurchases have boosted its EPS figures, allowing shareholders to benefit from rapid rates of compounding.Having said that, previously, investors were paying a premium for certainty in an uncertain world. Now that doomsday has arrived, and Adobe has shown it can successfully navigate challenging market conditions.In fact, I believe that, right now, more than ever before, Adobe makes for a very attractive investment opportunity as part of a well-diversified portfolio.Every investor wants a bargain. But bargains only come out when the outlook is grim. There are no other times when stocks go on sale. And right now, I believe we can all agree: the outlook is the worse it has been for a long time."

It is a pioneer in the creative economy and rightly so.I will analyze recent channel checks to see how customers and resellers view the product. Then I do a valuation analysis to show that the business is fairly valued, and there is still room to grow from here.I recommend a buy and hold.Source: Microsoft websiteI spoke with a former Adobe executive to understand how the business is performing. The channel check provided a few interesting insights.First, he thinks of the business in two areas: Creative and Analytics. Most of the revenue is coming from Creative (~75%). Analytics helps drive new customer growth, because in Creative, the business is well-known now and slightly saturated.The second key area is elevating the spend on existing customers by offering new products and services. This is a big area of focus.Third, the Creative Cloud can be used across functions - sales, marketing, and HR. Because there are many different use cases, it is easy to see upsell within organizations.I conducted a series of valuation tests that show Adobe trading near fair value. Wait for opportunities with macro sell-offs to buy big.In the below analysis, you can see I conducted a series of valuation tests to come to a fair value on Adobe. We can see that several comparable/market tests show that Adobe is undervalued on a profitability basis (operating income specifically).What is most interesting is my DCF calculation of intrinsic value shows fair value significantly above current levels, even with the run-up in the stock recently.Source: Internal valuationOn a comparable basis, you can see that the business trades at a discount on its profitability basis. It is a balanced growth and profitability mix (efficiency near 40%), which is rare in pure SaaS plays.Source: Internal valuationOn a relative basis, you can also see Adobe trading near the trend line of similar stocks, suggesting it is relatively not cheaper than peers. Adobe is the red dot in the matrix, slightly below the trend line. You can see that it is still below the trend line as other tech stocks have recently done well. The R-squared of 0.38 is significant here, but it has historically been ~0.40. That means that 38% of the variation in stock price can be attributed to the efficiency score (LTM FCF + Revenue growth). Of course, the higher the efficiency number the higher the expected multiple.Source: Public CompsAlso looking at the historical valuation, we can see it is trading at fair value on an EV/EBITDA basis (LTM). We can see Adobe trading at values similar to 2018 and 2019 figures, and above 2017. This was during the transition to SaaS.Source: KoyfinOn a price/earnings basis, the stock also does not look particularly cheap. There is a lot of volatility in this chart, suggesting there are often good times to really dig in and buy the stock when it hits those historical lows.Source: KoyfinThe counter-argument for these valuation posts is to mention the steady share price growth and solid execution over the past few years.Given that the market has realized this company's potential, there is little room for execution error. The valuation is something to closely watch.Second, it is important to look at macro factors and how businesses will view the spend on Adobe. Nobody knows the true impact of COVID-19, but this is an area to track.Third, I would keep track of emerging startups in the space and others like Dropbox (DBX), Box (BOX), and DocuSign (DOCU) who are in the collaboration space, the mainstay of Adobe."
4325004,105308,2020-02-18T15:08:11-05:00,"Adobe shares have recently rallied to new highs, considerably outperforming the market.While valuation multiples may appear high at first glance, future EPS growth is enough to justify it, and deliver to expectations.Adobe's moat is enormous, and the stock is a great long-term hold.","Over the past year, Adobe (ADBE) has had an enormous rally, considerably outperforming the broader market. The stock has returned ~46%, vs. ~25% of the S&P 500, as the chart illustrates below. Various authors have claimed that the stock is not attractive at its current levels, and therefore should not be chased. However, I view the stock as being fairly priced, considering its enormous moat and explosive EPS growth.Adobe is leading and defining the future of digital media and digital marketing. As my friend and fellow S.A. author Louis Stevens illustrated in his latest article on Adobe, the company is virtually running a monopoly. Adobe has masterfully taken advantage of the recurring SaaS revenue model, offering its products through a monthly subscription. Its suite includes the most advanced and definitive tools creators can utilize, with software like Photoshop, Illustrator and After Effects being must-haves for practically any kind of digital creator. Furthermore, since creators are automatically subscribed to the whole suite, there is no need to look for any substitutes, since they are ""forced"" to buy the rest of the tools as well. Source: Adobe.comAdobe's creative suite is the industry standard. Whether it is the most demanding Hollywood movies or your average Netflix series, it's most likely that they were edited with Adobe's products.While some alternatives do exist, none have managed to effectively penetrate Adobe's fortress. The synergy amongst the products, which also makes heavy use of the cloud, is impenetrable. That is, even if there was a product that could compete with, say Photoshop, the software's compatibility and integration with, say Premier, makes for such a smooth experience, that it wouldn't make sense to consider switching to an alternative. Additionally, Adobe's heavy integration with the cloud allows for all apps to be synchronized, as well as for creators to save massive amounts of data. That creates another layer of compatibility and convenience that prevents deviation towards other creative bundles. Adobe's moat is truly remarkable.Adobe's transition to the subscription model, along with the company's juicy ~85% gross margins, have helped EPS to be growing dramatically over the past few years. Since 2015, EPS has grown 10 times higher, currently at ~$6. In addition, EPS growth has seen little to no slowdown, which is the reason why I believe Adobe's valuation is justified, that is by the earnings alone.To demonstrate my point, the graph below illustrates the stock's current and forward P/E ratio. Looking at the current P/E, the stock has always been priced between a multiple of 45 and 75. While the valuation may seem pricey, a better indication is the forward multiple, which hovers at reasonable levels, between 25 and 40. Adobe's EPS has been snowballing so rapidly, that forward earnings always deliver to the market's expectations. However, is the current multiple of 63 times earnings rich? Once again, future earnings expectations as well as my DCF calculation below, suggest that no, it's not. For FY2020, analyst consensus EPS is projected to be $9.81. Should the stock be trading at a lower multiple, say a P/E of 45, at $270/share, the stock would be too cheap with a forward multiple at ~27. That's lower than many of the consumer staples stocks that display minimal to no growth. Moreover, Adobe has been historically beating expectations, which could imply an even lower multiple in the future. Taking things a little further, FY2021's EPS is projected to be 11.62. That implies that within two years, Adobe's EPS will be almost double its current levels. Not only is this another exhibit of the stock's non-stopping earnings expansion, but it also demonstrates that the current valuation is not sky-high, in terms of future profitability.But enough with the napkin math. Below, I performed a DCF calculation. As you can see, I set the initial FCF at $1.95B. I then set the growth rate for the first and second year at 40% and 37% respectively, which is slightly lower than the earnings expectations mentioned above, just in case underdelivers. The growth rate then significantly declines over time, with a terminal value of 4%. The DCF valuation model implies an intrinsic value of ~420/share, suggesting a further upside of ~11%.The main risk that Adobe could face in the future is, of course, cheaper competition. Affinity, for example, a British competitor, offers their photo software for a one-time fee of £48.99. A creator who, say only utilizes photography editing, will find this alternative much more valuable. Adobe's all-in-one subscription has a higher, recurring price range, in this case. However, for professional creators who make use of a creative suite, Adobe's product line is without a doubt the best there is. Moreover, while the recurring revenue model may be a pricing drawback in terms of competition, it keeps Adobe incentivized to keep the software updated continuously, with new features and functions.Another potential risk, is Adobe's management failing to deliver to the market's expectations. Considering that the stock is consistently being priced for growth, any misstep could send shares significantly lower, especially at these multiples.Adobe's recent rally has attached high expectations in terms of earnings growth. While shares may look pricey, should the company meet analyst expectations, the company is in fact trading at fair multiples. With earnings projected to almost double within the next two years, investors' hype that has been reflected in the share price, is not without justification. Moreover, Adobe's moat remains enormous, with competition failing to penetrate its fortress of products and cloud integration. While competition may arise in the future, that doesn't seem to be the case at the moment, nor has it been in the past. As long as management meets expectations and keeps software innovation ahead of the curve, I see Adobe as a robust long-term hold."

Generally speaking, I believe it to be premature to buy stocks on weakness at this moment. Yet, I think certain names deserve a closer look.Near the top of my list of stocks worth betting on at current levels is Adobe (ADBE). The company reported fiscal 1Q20 results on March 12. Due to the highly predictable recurring revenue business model, it was no surprise that Adobe delivered yet another all-around beat. Sales and earnings have both met or exceeded consensus expectations each of the past 15 quarters.Credit: CXO HeraldRather than focusing on recent results, which included 15%-plus growth in both the digital media and digital experience segments, a look towards the future is probably more relevant. Adobe delivered an outlook for fiscal 2Q20 that I would describe as encouraging, given the circumstances. See guidance table below.To be fair, revenue projection of $3.175 billion fell a bit short of consensus. The guidance seems to have been hurt by ""some enterprises delaying bookings, postponing services implementation and reducing expenses"" in the short term due to the global pandemic. Business in China seems to have been impacted by the coronavirus spread in the first quarter, and softness is likely to spill into the second period of the fiscal year.Source: company's earnings releaseStill, the management team seems unfazed about the long-term prospects of digital investments. I tend to share the optimism, since the secular paper-to-digital trend and Adobe's dominance of the digital asset creation and document management spaces should not be impacted by the current health crisis.Lastly, adjusted EPS guidance for 2Q20 topped consensus by a couple of cents, although a lower projected tax rate may have been the key tailwind.Last week, I shared a thought with my SRG community:I stand by my assessment of the company, and believe that Adobe's most recent earnings day reinforced my views. The graph below helps to further illustrate how stable Adobe's revenues, margins and earnings have been since 2015, particularly as recurring revenues have evolved to now account for nearly all of the company's top line. The business model, in my opinion, seems resilient to anything but a more severe recession.Data by YChartsSince the market peaked on February 19, ADBE had lost 25% of its market value by the end of the company's earnings day (although shares have been climbing fast intraday on Friday). I reinforce my views that the discount seems unjustified in the case of ADBE. Nibbling at current levels will probably prove to be a smart move in the long run."
4321158,104941,2020-02-04T08:45:46-05:00,"Adobe reigns supreme for content creators and operates as a de facto monopoly. I explain why this monopoly could generate market beating returns in this decade.Their monopoly is strongly evidenced by their massive gross margins and ample free cash flow yearly.Adobe is one of the best, most innovative companies on earth, and its financials further evidence this assertion.","Source: spinningclock.comAdobe (ADBE) offers a suite of creative products that they sell via a subscription model. Their industry leading products have created a virtual monopoly for the company, which is poised to beat the market over the coming decade, even at today's valuation.Customers of their ""creative cloud"" suite of products pay monthly for the ability to access these products. The list of products contained in the creative cloud is extensive, to say the least. Here's a list of tools it has to offer their enterprise creators:And in each of these categories, there are bevy of products that digital creators can leverage. Here's just one such example:Source: Adobe.comAs you can see above, Adobe hosts the perennial creator classics within their suite of ""Design and Layout"" products. These products include Photoshop, Illustrator, and Acrobat Pro. Each of the above categories, i.e., design and layout, photography, video and motion, etc., have a similar number of products that service every need a digital content creator could have.And the cost: the entire service starts at $80 a month for all the aforementioned apps and services. For a business that creates digital content or any type of creative content for that matter, subscribing to Adobe's suite of products is a no-brainer. What's more, Adobe's suite of creative products has become the industry standard; in that, mastery of their products has become table stakes for any individual looking to work in the professional world of design.This dynamic cannot be stressed enough, as it has become the moat by which Adobe commands their 85% gross margins. A few lesser alternatives to Adobe exist, but businesses and individuals working for those businesses cannot abandon Adobe, as the network effect has created a dynamic where Adobe is the universal language of digital design.The .PDF MonopolyIn addition to their suite of creative products, they also possess a monopoly on software for the ubiquitous PDF type document via their Acrobat Pro offering, to which I'm sure many of you are subscribed.By offering this service within their enterprise subscription, they only further build their moat against competition.So as we've seen, Adobe is the industry standard for digital design and content creation, with a powerful moat to boot.But would it make sense to buy the stock today if you were looking to beat the market over the next decade?Let's investigate.In my last couple of articles, I began using what I deem the L.A. Stevens Valuation Model. My name is Louis Alexander Stevens, if anybody was wondering about the name. It consists of three steps:Source: Data compiled from YChartsAssumptions: Over the last five years, Adobe has grown their free cash flow to equity by ~29.6%, while growing their top line at a rate of 21%. I chose a growth rate of 20% for their free cash flow over the coming decade, because they simply have so much free cash flow, which they can leverage to accelerate growth or return capital to shareholders.That is, their gross margins are 85%! It's an unfathomable display of a monopoly. For that reason, I expect them to be able to continue to grow their free cash flow at 20% during the 2020s.So at the current share price of $351, you would be technically beating the market throughout 2020, but there is little margin of safety, and the beat would be marginal at best.Let's move on to step 2 and 3 to find a more complete picture of Adobe's valuation.Discounted Cash Flow Including Effects Of BuybacksSurprisingly, despite Adobe's meteoric growth, they have bought back a good bit of their shares over the last decade or so, relatively speaking.Source: YChartsIt's been a bumpy road of buybacks (certainly does not look like a LMT shares outstanding chart), but with Adobe's valuation soaring throughout the last decade, they were able to raise ample cash through dilution, with which they've executed a number of acquisitions.Let's smooth out that reduction in share count: In the last 10 years, Adobe has reduced their share count by 7%.Alright, so conservatively, we can project that they will once again reduce their share count by another 7% by 2030. That is, with their 85% margins, they better either reduce share count by at least 7% or re-accelerate revenue growth.Source: Data compiled from YChartsIn the above model, you can see that in this case we accounted for the effect of a 7% reduction in share count, which was what Adobe was able to execute from 2010-2019.The result of the 7% share count reduction was an increase in the annualized growth rate of .88%, which may not sound like a lot, but over the course of 10 years, it can be huge.This increased the rate at which our free cash flow per share grew each year, resulting in an annualized growth rate of 20.88%, instead of the 20% which we modeled.Alright, onto the last step:At the fair value of $93.67, we implicitly assume that once the 10 years have concluded, growth prospects will precipitously decline, or nearly, evaporate. While this may be a prudent way to invest, it also completely eschews my fundamental principle of buying fantastic companies at better prices and holding them for a lifetime.So let's normalize for post-10y growth.Source: Data compiled from YChartsTherefore, Adobe remains a good buy even at today's valuation that sports a P/S of 15x. But with gross margins of 85%, who needs P/S?For Adobe, the greatest risk is that a low price competitor will enter the arena and begin stealing market share. This low price competitor, Affinity, already exists; however, Affinity struggles due to the network effect previously mentioned in this article.Digital design companies, i.e., the customers of Adobe, could see Adobe's subscription model as too costly and jump ship to Affinity, but as I said, Adobe's position as the industry design language makes this rather difficult.Of course, a challenge all companies, including Adobe, face is executional risk. That is, if Adobe's management team does not cultivate a culture of innovation or does not steward investor capital properly, then indeed a competitor could begin to take their legs from underneath them.Adobe was an extremely strong buy last year, below $300, and I added modestly at the time; however, due to my work in Central America, I was unable to communicate my position. What's more, I wish I would've added more!Notwithstanding, Adobe remains a compelling buy today; hence, I rate the stock a buy, as one can expect approximate returns of 14.54% annualized over the coming decade.Will there be ebbs and flows to the share price, which could increase those returns in the event you added on the ebbs? Of course!As always, let me know what you think in the comments, and happy investing!"
4320907,41961,2020-02-03T07:31:51-05:00,"Adobe has delivered strong long-term returns of over 35% annually over the last 5 years.The business is a toll taker in the content creation economy.While Adobe always looks perpetually expensive, the company's strong earnings growth implies its valuation is actually reasonable, rather than excessive.","There’s always a challenge with exceptionally high-quality, fast-growing businesses as to what price an investor should be willing to pay and how long these high-growth businesses should be held. As a more value-oriented investor who has an appreciation for businesses growing quickly, that’s often the difficulty that I faced myself over the years. However, my experience has generally been that paying a reasonable price for a high-growth business leveraging strong secular trends with sustainable competitive advantages is generally very rewarding over the long term.This has also been the case for my investment in Adobe (ADBE), which is a core holding of the Sustainable Growth portfolios.While Adobe isn’t considered a toll taker in any traditional sense of the word, such as in the context of a toll road operator, or even a Mastercard (MA) or Visa (V) that imposes a toll on digital commerce, I certainly view the business as one that is able to extract a toll on the ""creative economy"".The reason that I maintain this view is that the Adobe suite of software is an essential tool kit for creatives and designers looking to develop highly interactive, rich imagery. Adobe’s Photoshop product is the go-to software tool for any retouching or editing of immersive images. Beyond Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro, Premier Effects and After Effects provide best-in-class video software creation and editing tools.Given Adobe's market dominance of the space, there’s an expectation that digital creative professionals entering the workplace have a practical knowledge and ability to use Adobe products like Photo Shop and Premier Pro to create content. This expectation is reinforced in academia, where the training courses for many creative design professionals heavily lean on the family of Adobe products to assist the learning experience in educational institutions. As these Adobe-trained creative design professionals enter the workplace, they expect Adobe software suites to execute their design tasks. The retraining effort to master alternative products is so time-consuming and prohibitive that there generally isn’t a value to businesses to move to anything else beyond Adobe software. No marketing and design departments will get fired for choosing Adobe software for its designers to use.The demands on content creation tools to simplify and assist with the development of visually rich content will only increase over the coming years. Advertising as the core plank of media monetization is a trend that is accelerating. Ultra-powerful mobile devices, coupled with high-speed networks and the advent of 5G, will increase video and rich media content consumption on the go. Powerful imagery and visually attractive content are becoming table stakes to generate strong CPMs in an environment where mobile content monetization is proving less lucrative than desktop. Social media campaigns create the need for uniformity of content experience across different platforms and different interfaces, resulting in the need for consistent media development.Adobe's Magento and Marketo acquisitions in 2018 for almost $6.5 billion combined have provided the foundations for the business to develop its digital experience segment, which contributes approximately 30% of revenue.This business unit contains the Advertising cloud, Analytics cloud and Marketing cloud, which are important elements for Adobe to ""close the loop"" for publishers and provide linkages for the interdependency between creative development, user engagement, lead management, conversion and attribution. It’s a fairly ambitious strategy that Adobe has pursued to allow publishers to see the effectiveness of content they create and understand who is viewing this content and, ultimately, how the leads that are generated convert into revenue.There were concerns after Adobe's Q3 earnings that the company may have overpaid for recent acquisitions, with its digital experience growth forecast to decelerate somewhat. Q4 results, however, appear to have calmed market nerves and also demonstrate that Adobe has been able to smooth over some of the market pains from the Marketo acquisition and how it attacks the SMB channel. Q4 digital experience growth smartly rebounded once again in the quarter and showed 24% growth for the quarter.There hasn’t been a time over the last five years where one could say that Adobe has truly been on sale. Apart from a brief period towards the very end of December 2018, it has typically traded at a price-to-earnings ratio above 30 times earnings for most of the last five years. However, in spite of this relatively expensive multiple, the business has managed to yield shareholders a five-year compounded return of 38% annualized.What’s confounding about Adobe, and what potential investors in businesses like this one who are put off by high P/E ratios miss, is the fact that extremely strong growth in both revenue and earnings and high rates of return on invested capital lead to compounded earnings growth that makes stock multiples dramatically compress with flat or static share prices.This has been true with Adobe as well. In the last 3 years, where the company has maintained a forward P/E greater than 30 times earnings, it’s also happened to grow revenue at an annualized rate of 24% compounded, with operating income growing at just under 30% compounded and earnings per share growing at 37% compounded over this period of time. In this context, Adobe's current forward P/E of 35 times earnings may appear reasonable if it’s able to deliver future growth consistent with what it has been able to do in the past. Given that the company retains core competitive advantages in digital content creation and that the secular trends underpinning this business appear firmly in place, the prospects for this appear good.For those investors who are currently in Adobe, the business is a dangerous one to look to take profits on given the long runway of expected growth ahead. For those who are new investors to the business, looking to take the plunge, the company has never really been cheap in the traditional sense, yet has provided strong returns. With the business currently trading at 35x forward earnings, marginally above its 5-year average forward P/E of 31x earnings, near-term weakness on macro trends brought about by coronavirus concerns may be as good a time as any for entry into the business."
4331918,20715,2020-03-13T15:51:12-04:00,"Adobe posted fiscal first quarter earnings last week and it beat on both the top and bottom line.Even as the overall market has cratered in recent weeks, Adobe has been able to maintain its upward trend so far.The sentiment toward the stock has been shifting to a more optimistic stance, but it still isn't extremely optimistic.","At the beginning of each month, I create a list of stocks that meet certain fundamental criteria that I believe set them apart from other companies. The list usually ranges from 200-300 stocks on a month by month basis. After the list is created, I save the stocks to a file in StockCharts.com so that I can scroll the charts every few days, looking for opportunities. After the carnage we have seen in the market over the last few weeks, I found a few handfuls of stocks that I would consider still in an upward trend-even after falling sharply in the last few weeks.One of those companies is Adobe (ADBE). The software manufacturer came out with earnings last week and it beat both the EPS estimate and the revenue estimate. The company earned $2.27 per share for the quarter and that was better than the $2.22 analysts had predicted. The company posted revenue of $3.09 billion and that was higher than the estimated figure of $3.04 billion.Beating estimates is nice and sometimes it leads to gains by the stock, but with the market falling so dramatically in the last few weeks, the positive news seemed to go unnoticed. To me the more important thing is that the company saw earnings growth of 33% for the fiscal first quarter when compared to the previous year. Adobe has seen earnings grow by an average of 37% per year over the last three years and that is a very solid earnings growth rate.Revenue was up 19% from the previous year and the company has averaged revenue growth of 24% per year over the last three years. For 2020 as a whole, analysts expect earnings to grow by 24% and revenue is expected to increase by 17.7%.As attractive as the earnings and revenue growth rates are, the company's management efficiency ratings are just as attractive. The company boasts a return on equity of 38.9% and a profit margin to match (38.9%).These fundamental stats are what had me watching Adobe and waiting for an entry point last fall. I recommended the stock to subscribers of the Hedged Alpha Strategy back on October 7, 2019 when the stock was trading in the $275 to $280 range.When I recommended Adobe, it had just tested its 52-week moving average and the 10-week RSI and weekly stochastic readings were both down near oversold territory. It felt like a low-risk entry point on a quality stock.I did recommend to subscribers that they lock in some gains on January 7, 2020 and the gain ended up being around 23%. We are still holding the second half of the recommendation and the company looks like it could be ready for another rally. The stock dropped below its 52-week moving average earlier this week, but it bounced back.It is also worth noting that if you connect the lows from December '18 with the October low, you get an upwardly-sloped trend line that the stock hit this week as well. Very few charts look this good right now. Yes, there are stocks that are more oversold, but very few haven't broken below the trend lines established in the last few years.Back in October, the sentiment toward Adobe was less bullish than it is today. There were 27 analysts covering the stock back then with 17 ""buy"" ratings and 10 ""hold"" ratings. This gave us a buy percentage of 63%. Today we have 28 analysts covering the stock with 20 ""buy"" ratings and eight ""hold"" ratings. This puts the current buy percentage at 71.4% and that is in the average range.The short interest has fallen over the last six months and so has the short interest ratio. The ratio was at 2.08 in October when I recommended the stock and it is now at 1.23. There were 5.5 million shares sold short back then and now there are 4.61 million shares sold short. We also see that the average daily trading volume has jumped from 1.76 million shares to 3.76 million shares. So the ratio has dropped due to both sides of the equation-the numerator getting smaller and the denominator getting bigger.While the sentiment has shifted from slightly more bearish than average to slightly more bullish than the average stock, it hasn't reached a point that I consider extreme optimism toward the stock.Obviously I am still bullish on Adobe, otherwise it wouldn't still be in the portfolio. The fundamentals are just as strong as ever and the fact that the stock has been able to maintain its upward trend is also encouraging. Very few stocks can match Adobe's fundamental readings and even fewer look like they are still in the upward trends from the last few years. Sure, if you step back to a monthly chart and look at the last 11 years, there are probably far more stocks that you would say are still in upward trends.The shift in the sentiment is a minor concern, but the way the stock and the company have performed, the increase in optimism seems to be warranted.I had a target of $370 when I originally recommended the stock and it hit that target before the recent pullback. Given the recent earnings and the technical developments, I think the stock can get to $400 over the next year or so.Of course the impact of the coronavirus could impact Adobe just like it could any other company, but the impact should be minimal for a software company compared to the impact other industries will see.When we see massive selling like we saw in 2000-2002 and in 2007-2009, even good, fundamentally sound companies like Adobe saw their stock prices fall. Keeping that in mind, I would keep an eye on the 104-week moving average. If Adobe should fall below that trend line, I would consider getting out. The stock hasn't closed a week below that moving average since 2012."

The company's stock has been on a hot streak for some time now, and we feel that it's a great opportunity to evaluate the company's long and short-term prospects. While the long-term growth runway remains vast for Adobe, investors may want to pump the brakes before heavily accumulating shares at these prices. The stock has managed to outrun its fundamental growth, likely limiting near-term upside in the stock.Adobe has successfully transformed its business into a multi-faceted software company that drives the majority of its revenues through a subscription model. The company's revenues have grown rapidly, averaging 21.92% per annum over the past five years. The company's Digital Media and Experience segments are now the core drivers of Adobe. Source: Adobe Inc.This has been extremely lucrative for Adobe. The company has become an outstanding cash flow engine.Source: YchartsThe company is converting 36% of its rapidly growing revenues into FCF, which is largely being put back into the stock to retire shares (Adobe doesn't currently pay a dividend).Source: YchartsWith a shrinking float on top of rapidly growing (and high margin) revenues, Adobe's bottom line has simply exploded since 2015.Source: YchartsThis is the obvious driver behind the stock's meteoric trajectory over that same time period. However, it's not the reason that investors should be bullish moving forward. Despite Adobe's already strong run, there is still a lot of long-term upside to be tapped by investors. The primary driver of this is Adobe's second largest operating arm - its Digital Experience business.Source: Adobe Inc.In the current way that companies go to market, data (and how to manage it) has become an invaluable resource. This includes everything from customer management, to advertising, to analytics, artificial intelligence and so much more. Have you ever looked up a pair of boots online, and then notice that you are bombarded with ads for boots as you visit other sites? This is just touching the surface of what data management has become. This segment of Adobe's business only represents 29% of Adobe's revenues - but the size of the business has roughly doubled just in the past three years to approximately $3.2 billion.This sector has tremendous room to grow for Adobe. Between various applications within Digital Experience, Adobe sees a total addressable market of roughly $84 billion by FY22.Source: Adobe Inc.While it's certainly possible that momentum slows down for Adobe as sustained growth at such high rates becomes increasingly harder to maintain - even moderate success from Adobe in grabbing share leaves room for years of double-digit revenue growth. The company's concentration in subscriptions gives the business a stable revenue stream, and established margins (selling software on subscription is very non-capital intensive) mean that cash flow should be strong for the foreseeable future. While the company doesn't offer a dividend (our normal focal point), Adobe is poised to deliver strong capital gains because the company likely will be earning much (much) more per share in 10 years, than it is today.Adobe's stock has reflected this strong operational momentum and growth. The stock has easily outpaced the market since 2015.Source: YchartsWhile we are bullish on Adobe over the long term, investors who buy shares tomorrow expecting continued jubilation may come away disappointed. The stock's share price has started to outrun Adobe's impressive growth.Source: YchartsAdobe's TTM PE ratio of 58.29X is near the highest level it's been since 2016. The company's forward multiple based on FY2020 analyst estimates is still almost 36X. If we look at value from an FCF standpoint, the stock's current FCF yield of just 2.34% is its lowest of the past 10 years.Source: YchartsThis points us to a couple of questions. How much further upside is there for Adobe at its current valuation? The stock has already appreciated a whopping 31.72% just in the past three months. Is this a sign of multiple expansion - has the company's performance drastically accelerated and justified a ""new norm"" for valuation? Or has a great company and stock simply run rampant in a strong market?This isn't a bearish call on the company, or its long-term prospects. Investors who accumulate here will likely do well over the next 5-10 years. However, the stock seems to have outrun itself and no longer leaves much margin of error for Adobe's operating results. At these lofty multiples, a softer than expected quarter or guidance (or deceleration of growth) will result in a sharp reaction from share prices. These events are difficult (impossible) to predict the timing of but between market events and Adobe itself, a 15%-20% correction on shares is completely plausible (or the stock trades sideways until the business catches up to the stock price). Either way, it's typically not a wise decision to swim after a boat that has already set sail.Adobe has transformed itself into a cash flow machine, and the company's growing and subscription-based revenue streams instill confidence that Adobe's success isn't going anywhere. With that said, the stock is simply overheated and investors chasing shares at this point are asking for short-term disappointment. Perhaps investors are willing to accept the premium on shares and ride out the short-term valuation concerns for long-term gains (and that's OK) - investors just need to be aware of both short and long-term circumstances before jumping in with two feet.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."

What's more pertinent is the fact that Adobe's top-line growth rate is demonstrably slowing down. Why is this so relevant? Surely, I grasp that all companies slow down eventually?Companies do slow down, but the reason why Adobe is so highly prized is that it has had strong predictable growth into highly innovative next-gen opportunities.Again, my sole contention here is to question the upside potential. This is not the same as arguing that anyone short this stock.After all, Adobe has plenty going for it. Indeed, when questioned on the call as to prospects, Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen pointed out that Adobe's growth is being driven through new customer acquisition across all geographies.Furthermore, Narayen argues that its Digital Experience segment, which holds the eCommerce platform Magento, continues to benefit from customer cross-selling and up-selling opportunities.Having said that, little-discussed but nevertheless key is the fact that for Q4 2019 Adobe's Digital Experience grew by 24%, while looking ahead to Q1 2020 it's guided for just 16%. Then, looking further ahead to full year 2020, this segment is expected to grow by just 15% year-over-year.In other words, given that Adobe's Digital Experience was up 31% in 2019, this growth rate of just 16% for 2020 appears fairly unremarkable.For now, investors are happy to give Adobe the benefit of the doubt.Unlike many of its SaaS peers, Adobe is not only growing its top line at a rapid pace, but it has demonstrated that its ability to convert its revenues into strong cash flows stands head and shoulders above its peers.Part of the bullish thesis should find support from the fact that Adobe continues to aggressively repurchase its own shares. For 2019, Adobe returned $2.7 billion to shareholders in the form of cash at an average price of $273. In other words, highly accretive to its shareholders.Thus, we go full circle: to acknowledge that Adobe is a fantastic company, is important.But when expectations are so high, there is more downside than upside potential. Indeed, it's not good enough to know that a company is great if every other investor already knows this too - and the stock is pricing in its full potential many years' hence.Source: author's calculationsThe table above highlights Adobe's cash flow multiple and compares it with its peers. To argue that Adobe is undervalued because its peers are so incredibly overvalued carries some weight - of course.However, to pay up 39 times Adobe's cash flows when it's only expected to grow at less than 20% over the medium term speaks of an unsatisfactory investment potential.As you know, there is a large difference between a great company and a great investment.Successful investing demands understanding an opportunity before others price it in. It is not about jumping on the wagon that everyone else has long ago recognized and priced in.I declare that even though Adobe is one of the best opportunities in this space, investors are not forced to participate in this overvalued sector. There are plenty of other compelling investments aside from Adobe."
4317684,101959,2020-01-17T17:35:07-05:00,"Adobe continues to grow impressively, even from its large base.The company's guidance for future total addressable markets is intriguing.Although the company looks expensive, projected rates of return still look interesting. I am considering opening a starter position to average in.","The market has gotten a little nutty in the last few months. Stocks like Tesla (NYSE: TSLA) and Beyond Meat (NYSE: BYND) have exploded with much less in the way of news than one might expect. It's starting to feel a little euphoric to me, but for the most part I intend to maintain some dry powder in reserve. It is important to keep perspective, which is why I am currently building a watchlist to deploy money into on any weakness.One of these names is Adobe (NYSE: ADBE). A case could certainly be made for the company's valuation in comparison to software peers, which just came off of a banner year in 2019. The stock is currently up 45% from its lows last year, and is trading right around its 52-week high. With that, at a forward P/E ratio of 29.55x, and a price to sales ratio of 14.89X, waiting for a pullback or at least averaging into a position seems prudent.In a lot of ways, the company's stock price is well deserved. Sales grew 24% last year, earnings grew 25%, the company is highly profitable, and it holds a dominant position in a sticky business. The company's shift to software-as-a-service, which you are likely as sick of hearing about as me, has really paid off. This transformation has occurred under the leadership of CEO Shantanu Narayen, who has helmed the company since 2007 and overseen the stock price ballooning by 7X.I love hearing from analysts and fellow investors that a company that is well entrenched ""isn't going anywhere"". That's great, but what is it going to do for me over the next 10+ years? Stagnant sales, especially without a dividend (but honestly even with one since cost cutting can only go so far) isn't interesting to me. This isn't the case, of course, with Adobe. The company provides guidance for where it sees its total addressable markets headed, and the company definitely has a few irons in the fire. From the earnings call:For those of you not actively following Adobe, the company splits its segments into ""clouds"", where the Creative Cloud and Document Cloud (notice that these aren't the largest TAM's) are what many people think about when they hear Adobe. Creative Cloud comprises Photoshop and Illustrator, and the Document Cloud has Acrobat and the company's e-signature business. The Experience Cloud, which contains Adobe Sensei, specializes in customer experience management, and boasts customers like 3M (NYSE: MMM), McDonald's (NYSE: MCD), and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). With a TAM expected to be at $84B in a couple of years, management obviously sees the Experience Cloud as a huge opportunity, and the most recent quarter saw 20% subscription booking growth.In Document Cloud, Adobe's positioning with Acrobat isn't nearly as strong as it is with Photoshop. There are legitimate competitors (I use one myself) that do the job cheaper or even free. However, this is increasingly a smaller part of the business, and I'm more interested in the e-signature process, which directly competes with DocuSign (NYSE: DOCU). I own DOCU, and I wouldn't be shocked if Adobe ended up purchasing the company to further its ambitions in the space.The Creative Cloud is where Adobe really shines. The company maintains such a dominant market position (I like to think of it like Microsoft (NYSE: MSFT) with Windows) that schools teach students how to use its software. It's nearly an insurmountable obstacle for new entrants into the space when nearly every creative professional is trained and adapted to using the company's products. SourceThe last big thing I want to talk about before looking at valuation is the recurring revenue piece of the business. I don't think it can be overstated what a difference it has made for companies like this. There was a time when software piracy and continuous releases plagued the industry, and the SaaS model has absolutely helped the entire sector. It improves customer stickiness, and it provides more stability to the business. Long term, I am bullish on SaaS companies that can prove that they provide strong value to their customers, like Adobe.Looking at the long-term valuation graph, Adobe is overbought. Earnings have grown over the long term at ~17%, but at a blended P/E ratio of 42.31X compared to its already high average of ~33X, waiting for a pullback seems warranted here.Looking at the shorter term, earnings have grown much faster, at 34.4% per year, making today's valuation seem much more reasonable. That being said, if I were to buy today, it would be a starter position with the intent of averaging in over the medium term as there will more than likely be another decent pullback at some point to add more.Looking at analyst estimates for growth and my handpicked 10 year average P/E ratio (it was a little lower on the 15 year and much higher on any shorter time horizon), an investment today could yield nearly 10% annualized returns even with significant valuation compression. That being said, there is no guarantee, of course, that the company will meet its earnings targets or that it will trade anywhere near its long-term valuation multiples. However, I won't be betting against this company to meet its growth goals, and barring near-term downside risk, I see Adobe as a name that will continue to be a long-term winner.If you liked this article and would like to read more like it, please click the ""Follow"" button next to my picture at the top and select Real-time alerts.Financial statistics were sourced from Morningstar, with the charts and tables created by the author, unless otherwise stated."
4329877,105055,2020-03-05T11:18:00-05:00,"Adobe's Creative Cloud is the epitome of ""moat."" It is the tool of choice, and competitors are far behind.With ongoing share buybacks, Adobe is returning capital to users rather than squandering it.Growth may slow over the coming years, but there is still significant upside to the stock.","My past few articles have been on, primarily, software companies with a significant market advantage. Today, I'd like to continue that trend with a leader in the creative world, Adobe (ADBE).Adobe has, over the last few years, helped change the software landscape. They may not have been the first company to offer software as a service (SaaS), but they've certainly been among the best to play the game. Adobe's software used to sell for thousands of dollars; now, it can be had, in its entirety, for $50/month. This pivotal swing opened up the market, allowing almost anyone to try their hand at creativity.It doesn't matter what you want to do, if it's creative in nature, Adobe likely has a tool for you in their Creative Cloud offerings. If you're going to edit photos: Photoshop. If you want to edit movies: Premiere Pro. How about editing sound: Audition. The list goes on.The wide net that Adobe casts means that users might come for Photoshop ($10/month) and find that they're interested in creating a podcast too. That bump up takes them to $50/month, where they have access to all of the software Adobe creates. Whether they use it or not, this is a tremendous value for the user who, in the past, would have had to shell out $2,500 to be able to get a copy of everything Adobe offered.Competition is a significant risk for many companies, but it seems less so for Adobe. For a moment here, I'd like to focus on their biggest tool, and most significant draw, it's even a verb in the English language: Photoshop. I'll spare description of the tool, as I am sure that many are familiar.Photoshop has, in my opinion, two competitors worth talking about, GIMP and Affinity Photo.Image: Google Trends for search terms related to competitor apps.GIMP is free and open-source. Being free was a huge draw several years ago when Photoshop would cost a user $300, but now that the tool is available for $10/month, it's much harder to break the network effect.Affinity Photo is a $50 tool with much of the same functionality as Photoshop and GIMP. $50, while not being excessive, is still a leap from the $10 that Adobe charges to get you started with Photoshop.So, why do these tools not pose a threat? Network effect. Photoshop has been the primary tool of photo editing for so long that it's easy to find tutorials, or filters, or brushes. This ease of getting started and learning leads to fresh eyes that create more content, thus locking them in, and the next generation.It's not just Photoshop, either. Premiere Pro and After Effects see the same sort of lock-in on the video side of things. By costing only $50/month, teenagers aspiring to make movies have access to the same tools used to create Hollywood blockbusters.While I don't believe there are any significant competitive threats, there is the possibility of reduced commercial spending should a recession take hold.Being a leader in their space, and a necessary tool for many creatives, Adobe is likely the last place commercial buyers will look to cut. Consumers, however, may see things differently.As Adobe does not offer a breakdown of consumer vs. commercial spending on Creative Cloud, it is difficult to assign a value to this risk. In 2009, Adobe saw revenues drop 19% on the backs of the financial crisis. However, the company was selling software by the piece back then, not as a much more affordable subscription, so a revenue drop today would likely be substantially less.A chart is worth a thousand words. Per Adobe's last 10K, the company made 89% of its revenues from subscription services. This year, it'll likely cross 90% with growth and a stagnant ""Product"" segment.Subscriptions are also growing at quite a steady pace. In FY19, Adobe was just shy of $10B in annual revenues from subscriptions ($9.994B), which was a 25% jump over FY18. FY18 was in itself a 30% leap over FY17. Growth will continue to slow, and there's no doubt about it. For 2020, I believe Adobe will still achieve a 20% growth in revenues.Subscriptions are all fine and dandy, but is this company making money? Oh, you bet they are. Adobe has been consistently growing net-income since the advent of its Creative Cloud. Probably the best thing about subscriptions of pre-packaged software is that they're cheap from a cost of goods perspective, and Adobe is benefiting there.That 29% operating margin is, at least in part, being returned to shareholders via share buybacks. Adobe bought back 9.88M shares in 2019 at an average price of $270.23, thus returning $2.67B to investors. The company still has, as per the 10K, $4.25B in remaining authorizations, which is roughly 2.5% of outstanding shares at today's prices.Given the cheap equity available, there have been many companies financing buybacks with debt. Not Adobe. Over the last several quarters, Adobe has aggressively paid down its long-term obligations. At its highs in November of 2018, debt has fallen from $4.1B down to just shy of $1B in the last report. All debt obligations are covered by available cash and short-term investments with $2.65B on the balance sheet.Valuing Adobe is difficult, and it has to take more of a storied approach than a quantitative one. Why? Well, quite simply, they're a mind-share monopoly with almost impenetrable walls. Their product is not expensive, so customers are willing to pay monthly for access to it, and as long as prices remain accessible, customers will have a difficult time making inroads.That said, let's give it a shot. There have been no signs on the horizon that growth would halt in Adobe, but it is my opinion that said growth will continue to slow. 20% growth in FY20 seems more than achievable, however.I also believe that net margins will continue to expand over time to a target of ~35% by FY25 thanks to cheaper delivery costs and the network effect continuing to assist with sales & marketing. 35% would be too excessive for 2020, so my assumption is a slight bump to 30% for the year.This would leave us with FY20 revenues of $13.4B, and a net profit of $4.02B. Assuming no share buybacks occur in FY20 (even though they will), I have Adobe's EPS at $8.33 for the year. Adobe's average P/E over the last five years has been hovering around 36, but we should assume that drops a little thanks to slowing growth. At a P/E of 30, Adobe's price is $249.90, and 34 it is $283.22.I like setting ranges. In the middle, I am a small buyer, a little bit here and there. If it jumps out of the top bound, I wait for a pullback, and if it goes under that lower bound based on macro trends only, I am likely a big buyer. At the time of writing, Adobe is firmly between those bounds, but given market volatility, anything could happen between now and publish time.It is also worth noting that Adobe will more than likely buy back 5-10M shares over the next twelve months. I did not factor this into my math given the uncertainty of the statement. If Adobe were to buy back 10M shares, however, this would act as a significant buffer to the valuation.With the stability of the Creative Cloud and the moat that is built around it, Adobe is a great buy-and-hold in the tech space. The company is well managed, returning capital to investors, and maintaining double-digit growth."
4317785,99986,2020-01-19T12:04:08-05:00,"Adobe was up over 40% last year, outperforming both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite.The company's earnings trend remains strong, with double-digit annual EPS growth expected for FY-2020.While the fundamentals remain strong, the stock is beginning to get overbought at current levels, more than 25% above its 20-month moving average.Based on this, I believe investors would be wise not to chase the stock at current levels.","Adobe (ADBE) had yet another exceptional year in 2019 with a 40% return, managing to easily outperform both the S&P 500 (SPY) and the Nasdaq 100 Index (QQQ). This marked the stock's third year in a row of a 1,000 basis point or better outperformance vs. the S&P 500, with the stock now up over 390% since the cyclical bear market ended in February 2016. Adobe's earnings trend continues to remain healthy, as does top-line growth, with strong double-digit annual EPS growth expected for FY-2020. However, the stock is beginning to get a little overbought at $349.00, making the stock more susceptible to a 10-20% correction. Given this fact, I believe investors would be wise to wait for a pullback before adding any new exposure. (Source: TC2000.com)Last year was yet another incredible year to be a shareholder in Adobe, with the stock trouncing the performance of the major averages, and not missing a beat to start the new year. The stock is up 6% thus far in 2020, adding to its 45% gain in 2019, helped by coming off of robust fiscal Q4 2019 report. Not only did Adobe manage to put up a top-line beat of $17.8 million, nearly 1% above estimates, but they also returned significant cash to shareholders, repurchasing 2.8 million shares at an average price of $275.36. This should continue to help drive annual EPS growth, with a 0.5% lower share count this quarter alone, bought back at attractive prices. Let's take a closer look at the company's growth metrics below:As we can see in the below chart of annual earnings per share [EPS], Adobe has been an earnings powerhouse, having grown annual EPS from $1.33 in FY-2013 to $7.87 in FY-2019. Even more impressive, the company's annual EPS growth rate is expected to accelerate in FY-2020 to 25%, a 900 basis point improvement from the 16% growth rate in FY-2019. This is incredible growth for a mega-cap that's already managed to more than quintuple annual EPS in six years and will give the company a seat among the top earnings growers among large caps for FY-2020. (Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)As legendary investor William O'Neil has pointed out in the ""A"" of his CANSLIM criteria, the best growth companies with the most outstanding performance managed to consistently grow annual EPS at a rate of 24% or more. Given the current earnings estimates for Adobe in FY-2020 of 25%, the stock is one of the only mega-caps to hold this esteemed title heading into the new year. If we compare this to other mega-caps, Microsoft's (MSFT) annual EPS growth for FY-2020 is estimated at 13%, Salesforce.com's (NYSE:CRM) yearly EPS growth for FY-2020 is forecasted at 13%, and Mastercard's (MA) is 18%. Therefore, Adobe has one of the most impressive annual EPS growth rates among its mega-cap peers. To summarize, from an earnings trend standpoint, Adobe is one of the clear leaders, and still has a strong runway for growth. Moving over to quarterly revenue growth rates, Adobe reported revenues of $2.99 billion in fiscal Q4 2019, translating to 21% growth year-over-year. While this marked a 300 basis point sequential deceleration from fiscal Q3 2019, this slowdown isn't enough that I would consider it to be alarming. However, it is a 2-year low for quarterly revenue growth. If we look forward to fiscal Q1 2020, revenue estimates are currently forecasting ~$3.06 billion in revenue, translating to only 18% growth year-over-year. This would mark yet another quarter of sequential deceleration, and would mark yet another new low for revenue growth rates. Ideally, investors are going to want to see a minimum of $3.14 billion to prevent further deceleration. However, this would require a top-line beat of nearly $80 million vs. estimates, a far cry from the near $20 million beat on estimates last quarter.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)If we take a look at the chart below showing quarterly revenue growth rates, it's evident that Adobe is likely to see some slowdown as we head into FY-2020. Based on current estimates, FY-2020 revenue will be lucky to come in above 20%, a slight step down from the 24% revenue growth rate in FY-2020. I would not consider this lower revenue growth rate a severe issue for Adobe, but it is a minor headwind as the stock heads into FY-2020. This is because Adobe had exceptional earnings growth with stable revenue growth rates in FY-2018 and FY-2019. For FY-2020, however, Adobe will have robust earnings growth with declining revenue growth rates, barring some gargantuan top-line beats.Given that the highest quality growth stocks have accelerating or stable revenue growth, this is a slight knock against Adobe here on a fundamental basis. Unless Adobe can report revenues of $3.14 billion for fiscal Q1 2020, this will be the first time in nearly three years that both the quarterly revenue growth rate and two-quarter average revenue growth rate (white line) slow for two consecutive quarters. To summarize, while the earnings trend looks exceptional, Adobe leaves a little to be desired in FY-2020 when it comes to top-line growth. Based on this, I see the stock as more of a Hold vs. a Buy at current levels, as it's harder to justify paying up for the stock when there's the risk of sequential deceleration on the horizon.(Source: YCharts.com, Author's Chart)Moving over to the technical picture, Adobe continues to trade in a strong uptrend but is now nearly 25% above its 20-month moving average (green line). While this is not an extremely overbought signal, further upside from these levels short term has generally led to consolidations or corrections of 10% or more. Therefore, this is not an ideal spot to be adding exposure. Instead, the best time to be adding exposure to Adobe has been on 10% pullbacks towards the 20-month moving average, not when it's already 25% above it. Based on this, while I do not believe investors should cash out here, I think a better entry will be ahead later this quarter or early in Q2.(Source: TC2000.com)Finally, from a valuation standpoint, Adobe is getting expensive at current levels. The 16x price to sales ratio has been a brick wall for the stock for over 20 years now, with the most recent major peak for the stock occurring at just over 16x price to sales in August 2018. While the general market weakness exacerbated much of the correction following this valuation, Adobe has a decelerating revenue growth rate heading into this valuation vs. a stable revenue growth rate at the time of the August 2018 peak. Therefore, the stock is at a similar valuation, but with a less impressive revenue growth rate, and a slowdown on the horizon. Given this fact, it's hard to argue for adding any exposure at only 5% below a significant resistance level for the stock from a valuation standpoint.(Source: YCharts.com)Adobe is arguably one of the most impressive growth stocks in the mega-cap space; however, a lofty valuation, a high likelihood of further sequential deceleration in top-line growth and a semi-extended chart have made the stock unattractive currently. I do not believe this justifies liquidating positions for investors, but I see this as a terrible spot to be rushing to add new exposure above $349.00. Adobe is already beginning to get expensive at a revenue multiple of 15.4, and the stock is heading into a quarter where it won't be very easy to prevent top-line deceleration. In summary, I see Adobe as a Hold at current levels, but believe both investors and traders would be wise to be patient before adding any new exposure here."
4314187,20599,2019-12-26T14:32:02-05:00,"Fresh record high set for Adobe's stock.Last week, the company reported better-than-expected fiscal Q4 results.A six-year business transformation, led by CEO Shantanu Narayen, is reaping the benefits.","Shares of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), known for products like Photoshop and Acrobat, joined a list of a handful of stocks that hit a fresh record high in the previous week. For those who follow the performance of the company on a regular basis, a new all-time high doesn't come as a surprise.In essence, Adobe has benefited immensely from the decision to turn its focus from packaged software to the cloud business. A six-year transformation is reaping the benefits for its CEO Shantanu Narayen, who was included in the list of the 10 best CEOs in America in 2019 by Glassdoor.A week ago, Adobe reported better-than-expected results for the fiscal fourth quarter. The California-based company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.29 a share, slightly better than the expected $2.26 a share. Furthermore, revenue came in at $2.99 billion, the number which exceeded the $2.97 billion expected from the market.Creative Cloud business is growing at a rapid pace as the company cements its place as the leading brand when it comes to making and editing creative content. In addition to Document Cloud and Experience Cloud businesses, Adobe has created a set of rapidly growing businesses with an immense potential.The current rise in shares price has seen Adobe become the third most valuable U.S. business software company, lagging behind Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) only. This can be explained with two main advantages compared to the rest of the playing field: subscription model and network.Instead of selling expensive software packages and licenses as it used to do in the past, Adobe has moved to regularly updated software with new features. Moreover, its products and services are widely used in fundamental fields, such as education, which limits customers from switching to different suppliers due to networking opportunities.As I mentioned in the Lead-Lag Report, the US stock market is well-positioned to continue rising in 2020. If the company's forward guidelines materialize, Adobe will report $13.15 billion in revenue for the fiscal 2020, a rise of 18% from $11.17 billion in 2019.Technically, the price action stopped at the confluence of resistance of 127.2% Fibonacci extension and the ascending trend line (the black line in the chart) that connects higher highs, near the $330 handle. If it rotates lower, the previous all-time high of $313 is well-positioned to offer a decent supply.On the upside, the $330 handle will continue to act as a strong resistance given that the price action already reacted at this level. If broken, the next resistance, in the context of $161.8% Fibonacci extension sits just below the $350 mark.Adobe is one of the few major companies that managed to transform itself from the world of desktop and licensed software to cloud and subscriptions. As far as business transformation is concerned, only Microsoft can compare to a certain extent.The aforementioned transformation has put the company in a great position going forward in the fast-growing industry. Following the fresh all-time high set in the previous week, Adobe's stock is certainly not cheap. Buying at an all-time high is tough at times, however, its business model makes shares of Adobe a strong buy on dips.Like this article? Don't forget to hit the follow button above!"
4319228,102465,2020-01-27T10:18:17-05:00,Adobe continues to make new all time highs.Adobe is projecting to slow down in revenue growth YoY for 2020.The stock is currently overbought as it is up roughly 35% since beginning this current trend in late October 2019.Now is not a great time to look to start a position in Adobe.,"Adobe (ADBE) is on quite a run. Over the last 5 years, the stock is currently sitting pretty, up 391%. For comparison, the industry and the market are up 198.4% and 59.1% respectively. Congratulations goes out to anyone who has held onto this stock over the past 5 years. The stock has been nothing short of an absolute darling outside of a couple more recent pullbacks. Adobe continues to look very bright and will no doubt continue to have success both as a company, and for all stakeholders for years to come. However, the stock is currently overbought and due for another pullback of roughly 20%.(Source: TC2000.com)Adobe came out with very strong Q4 2019 numbers. One thing all shareholders love to see is stock buybacks. Adobe did just that, buying 2.8 million shares at an average price of $275.36. This has helped propel the current rally. They also have a very strong EPS history, and a strong forecast. As you can see below, coming off an EPS of 6.07, jumping to 7.46 next year is a ~23% increase YoY. This is massive growth. Even looking to 2021, you are still at ~21% growth at this point. Growth is projected to slow over time, but that could change as the company thrives and adapts. Looking to a similar company such as Salesforce (CRM), YoY growth for 2020 is only forecasted at 13%. Future Return on Equity for Adobe is forecasted at 34.1% over the next 3 years. Again, industry average is 10.8%. I have zero concerns when it comes to Adobe's ability to continue to grow EPS.(Source: Simplywall.st)Where we start to see some blips on the data, is when we look at revenue and net income growth. As you can see below, yes the numbers will continue to still get larger, but the rate at which they increase is a little concerning. Looking forward to 2020, we are expecting an 18% increase in revenue YoY. This will be down from the 23% we saw from 2018 to 2019. This rate drops to 15.7% for 2021. I think it is going to get tougher for Adobe to beat earnings down the road, which will lead to some stock price deceleration. Let me be clear, I do not think this is going to cause the stock to tank, but I am not expecting another 45% return on the stock this year. That said, I would love to be wrong on this one.(Source: Simplywall.st)Taking a look back over the past 5 years, we can see a steady growth rate in the price appreciation. As you can see below, the stock has increased greater than 20% in 4 of the last 5 years. Besides that, I see a fairly clear pattern of large(r) year of price growth, followed by a slower year. Yes, this is a small sample size, but based on that pattern, I would expect this calendar year to have a return of roughly 15-20%.(Source: TC2000.com)If we bring the 50 day moving average into the picture as seen below, we can see the stock has a pretty rich history of correcting back to it over an extended period of time. Is it true that there have also been runs where the stock has strayed from it doing nothing but climbing higher? Yes. There was a period in early 2017 where the stock ran up ~23% from the last point of contact, to the next point. This occurred over 88 trading days. However, it is far more common that there is a touch after an explosive growth period after 35-50 trading days.(Source: TC2000.com)This current run since last touch of the 50 day moving average, we are up ~26% over 55 days. This once again points to a coming price drop to bring not only the stock, but the valuation back to earth.Seeing as the stock is already up 7% on the year, I hope you can see why now might be a good time to take some profits off the table and wait for a better entry point. Yes, if you just want to hold Adobe in your portfolio forever, I am sure you will do fine, but taking a little risk off the table when the stock becomes overvalued isn't a bad thing either.(Source: Simplywall.st)Looking at the valuation above, we can see that the stock is trading well above its fair value. I will start by saying that this is normal, and ""fair value"" is not where I see this stock heading. BUT, it is definitely overvalued. Adobe fails in current comparison in P/E ratio (58x), PEG ratio (3.6x), and P/B ratio (16.1x) when it comes to fair value. Any analyst would say that Adobe is ""poor value"" based on these ratings. Especially when compared with its peers. A slight drop in price will not only move the stock to ""about right"", but lower the mentioned ratios closer to its market peers. I fully believe it will hit these levels and be fairly valued down the road, just not today.In summary, Adobe has done nothing but print money for shareholders, and I believe it will continue to do so over the next few years due to strong EPS. That said, there is a cause for concern when it comes to revenue as that rate is beginning to drop, which may scare off some shareholders and trigger some selling if they cannot beat analyst expectations. The reason I would sell some shares today, and definitely not look to enter the stock is mostly valuation based. The stock is clearly trading at a very high level right now, and is due for a pullback in the 20% range. That is where I will be looking to enter the stock. If I owned shares, I would not be liquidating all of them, but I would be taking some risk off the table as I patiently wait for a better spot to put that money to work. I would currently rate Adobe as a hold."
4309582,69905,2019-11-27T17:58:48-05:00,Adobe's growth rates are slowing down.Digging into Adobe's main segment: Digital Media.Why investors should take caution and sidestep this investment.,"Adobe (ADBE) has the making of a great investment.In fact, I have consistently asserted that it is an impressive company, which has successfully diversified away from a pure-play document editing into an overarching digital software experience, including analytics, cloud SaaS, data integration, and digital commerce solutions - to mention a few verticals.But my contention today is how can investors expect to profit from an already overpriced stock? Aside from relying on ''a buy high and sell higher'' investment strategy, there appears to be an insufficient margin of safety.On balance, I believe that staying invested at this valuation is more likely to priming oneself for disappointment than setting up for a reward.It has not escaped me that since my last article on Adobe, its stock has regained momentum.Source: author's coverageLast month, I wrote an article where I acquiesced:Similarly, today, I fully acknowledge that amongst many of its peers which are struggling to generate strong cash flows, Adobe stands head and shoulders above them.What's more, is that Adobe's management's focus on ensuring a high level of recurring revenues has led the business to have an incredible revenue growth rate. Once more, what do investors crave most? Predictability, why of course! And how will they reward it? With a high multiple.Thus, we are now starting to approach the crux of actually matters. What sort of multiple is reasonable for Adobe? Candidly, I'm unsure of what sort multiple is reasonable.Having said that, I am fairly confident that a stable enterprise will be rewarded with one sort of multiple, whereas an enterprise that appears to be facing decelerating revenue growth rates should be rewarded with a different, much smaller multiple.Source: author's calculations, press statementsGraphically depicted above we can see that even though over the past two years and even into its trailing nine months, Adobe has consistently generated revenue growth rates close to 25% year-over-year.But it appears that going ahead for Q4 2019, it is being guided to approximately 20%. How could this be?That's because Adobe's Digital Media segment accounts for close to 70% of its total revenue, and this is lapping strong historical growth.I do not believe this pace of deceleration is a one-off. Consider this:Source: Adobe 10-KAs we can see above, historically, Digital Media was growing at north of 25% year-over-year. But presented below is the trend since the start of 2019.Source: author's calculations, 10-Qs, including guidanceDo these figures translate themselves into our understanding of a stable and predictable enterprise? If one answers in the affirmative, I would question what sort of growth rate would shareholders reasonably expect in Q1 2020? And then, what about this time next year?If Digital Media has seen a deceleration of 25% over the course of 12 months, does this imply that over the next twelve months, Adobe's Digital Media segment will be consistently (and predictably) growing its revenues in the high teens?Source: author's calculationFirstly, it is not useful to argue that Adobe is cheap simply because the competition is more expensive. This sort of reasoning only works well towards the end of the bull market - but primes investors for considerable losses.Secondly, as we have discussed through, at the same time as Adobe's growth rates are evidently decelerating, the multiple investors are being forced to pay for its stock continues to expand: currently paying 14.3x revenues compared with a more subdued historical multiple of 10.6x.(source)Rather than waiting for others for confirmatory action, why not take a step back and weigh the likelihood of exiting this investment profitably?Presently, with the stock hitting all-time highs, every shareholder is holding a profit. But seeing that the stock is already full-priced, any bad quarter will give shareholders a reason to take profits and reprice the stock lower. At that point, investors will start to question their investment in Adobe. Don't be lulled into inaction."

4312901,105510,2019-12-17T10:24:27-05:00,"Upbeat Q4 sees broad-based strength across segments.
        Unchanged FY20 targets point toward conservatism, in my view.
        The path to $12 FY21 EPS looks very achievable.
        Ongoing buybacks andbest-in-class business model should sustain premium multiple.","Adobe’s (ADBE) latest quarter featured strength across both its key segments – digital media and digital experience. Over the medium-term, I think the business has strong growth potential, particularly in. Meanwhile, digital experience also looks well-positioned to build on a strong fiscal year (+31% YoY in FY19). From a company-level perspective, Adobe is a clear leader in digital, and its fundamentals stand out, with top-line growth consistently exceeding 20%, with an annual revenue run rate of ~$12 bn and outstanding operating margins (~40%) to boot. In addition, management also plans to execute $5.1 bn in authorized share buybacks, which should help deliver solid compounding returns to shareholders over the coming years. The strong Q4 print points toward a very achievable ~$12 EPS two-years forward (non-GAAP), and coupled with an ~30x multiple, gets me to $360.Adobe posted another strong quarter, with Q4 revenue reaching $2,991 million ($11.2 bn for FY19) and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.29 ($7.87 for FY19). Digital Media remains the main contributor, with net new annual recurring revenue (NYSE:ARR) of $539 million, significantly better than the $475 million guidance provided at November’s Analyst Day event. The renewed digital marketing strength helped alleviate many of the concerns which had previously surfaced following the analytics platform release in April and Marketo, as the Creative Cloud continued to drive consistent top-line strength.Source: Q4 and FY2019 Results PresentationThe big take from the Digital Media segment results was the notable acceleration across key metrics. Though headline revenue growth at 22% YoY for the quarter sustained the prior growth numbers seen in Q2 and Q3, the big plus was in total net new ARR additions, which came in at $539 million, an acceleration on a YoY basis (up 25% YoY versus the 14% YoY growth in 3Q). On an FY19 basis, net new ARR additions totaled $1,688 million, representing 17% YoY growth, again an acceleration from the 4% YoY growth rate in FY18. The net effect is that the overall Digital Media ARR balance moves up to $8,398 million, which at 23% YoY growth, points toward likely conservatism embedded in the FY20 guide of ~19% Digital Media revenue growth.The key driver within the Digital Experience segment was the Experience Cloud, which grew 24% YoY to $859 million, translating to a 31% YoY segmental growth rate in FY19.Source: Q4 and FY2019 Results PresentationThe strong segmental performance will have alleviated the concerns raised in Q3 - management previously noted in Q3 that subscription bookings growth for Marketo in the mid-market did not meet their expectations and, thus, planned to increase their focus and investment on-demand generation and inside sales. From the Q3 transcript:This quarter, on the other hand, management’s upbeat tone on the Q4 call pointed to a swift rebound – having made some investments that have improved go-to-market alignment, there has been a rebound in growth for Marketo as well as continued strength with Magento.There were likely some additional factors at play – note that Marketo CEO Steve Lucas departed in September, with further shuffling in the Digital Experience leadership ranks in Q4 (e.g., Marketo's Americas enterprise sales head and President of Asia Pacific). The executive turnover isn’t a major source of concern, in my view, as it is fairly typical of significant mergers, and Adobe still possesses a deep bench of talent.Having lapped the Marketo and Magento acquisitions, operating expense growth has slowed, which should enable operating margins to continue to expand further. As of 4Q19, opex as a % of revenue stands at 44.6% (~47.5% for FY19).Source: Company DataFurther opex declines, coupled with the revenue growth potential set up the Adobe model for significant margin expansion in the year ahead, which should filter through to FY20 EPS.Surprisingly, the Q4 strength and the Digital Media acceleration did not lead to increased guidance targets for FY20, with headline numbers remaining unchanged from the Analyst Day event. I think this implies there is a fair bit of conservatism embedded in the FY20 guidance, which I believe is now a relatively low bar.Nonetheless, the preliminary FY20 outlook pointed confirmed digital media strength - net new Digital Media ARR was guided to $1.55 bn, with overall digital media revenue projected to rise 19% YoY. Digital experience is also set to sustain a high-teens growth rate, primarily driven by a >20% YoY growth in subscription bookings. The guidance put the underwhelming 3Q bookings momentum in both the Marketo and Analytics Cloud subscriptions firmly in the rear view mirror as the positive traction shown in Q4 looks set to continue into next year.Source: Q4 and FY2019 Results PresentationThe strong Q419 results set things up well for FY20, with net new ARR, revenue, and EPS all outperforming, while the Experience Cloud approaches stability following the integration of recent acquisitions. Margins should also benefit as the company laps elevated opex post-acquisition and shift its focus toward the more profitable segments. Assuming management executes to plan, I see non-GAAP EPS approaching the $10 mark in FY20 while sustaining a 30+x earnings multiple on FY21 EPS of ~$12, which would lead to a ~$360 target.In addition to net income growth, Adobe also benefits from a shrinking float given the ongoing share repurchase program, which more than offsets dilution from share comp. Note that in FY19, Adobe bought back a total of 9.9 million shares, leading to a net decline in diluted shares by ~1% (assuming the continued deployment of ~$5.1bn in buyback authorization at the current ~$750m run rate).I like the long-term Adobe story; not only has it proven its ability to capture new users while maintaining pricing power, its sticky, recurring revenue base from both Digital Media and Digital Experience offers investors excellent visibility into the EPS run rate. The repurchase program adds further support to the stock price and helps sustain a premium multiple. Adobe’s best-in-class operating model, coupled with its long-term $100 bn addressable market opportunity, keeps me bullish on the stock."
4297822,69905,2019-10-22T10:09:08-04:00,A discussion of my Adobe calls over the past year and half.Adobe's free cash flow is not as strong as first meets the eye.Why one should call it a day on Adobe's stock.,"Adobe (ADBE) is one of the best software players. It has achieved a remarkable feat of diversifying away from a pure-play document editing company towards its digital experience segment.The problem, as I continue to argue, is that Adobe has been priced for growth for a long time ago, and that when investors have any reason to be fearful, investors will sell out of the most expensive stocks first.For now, readers should sidestep Adobe.Just over a year ago, I wrote a bullish article on Adobe where I noted,Then, in June of this year, I did an about-turn and stated:And I have been unwavering ever since then:Author's coverageIn investing, it is not good enough to be correct when everyone else is correct too. One needs to be correct when few investors think in the same way. And this needs to happen in a timely fashion (because in the long-run we are all dead).My stance on Adobe was not an easy call to make. How many investors are able to call the share price movement on the upside and downside too?To be honest, the timing of my call to reverse my position and to take a bearish stance was mostly down to luck (I humble myself, it was strictly a lucky call).But given my following of this space, Adobe always struck me as an odd company. Because other software/SaaS/analytic/cloud companies have been in bubble territory for so long, that those were relatively easy ones to avoid.But with Adobe, it was always more challenging. And even today, if asked, I could certainly highlight many positives, and make an extremely compelling bullish call.But I think, that investing is incredibly difficult. And our best chances of beating the benchmark strive not from being right on every Adobe stock. But correct in a few, very selective opportunities.Adobe's management team would like the investment community to focus on Adobe's free cash flow, but that is simply because as a software company, the bulk of Adobe's expense comes down to management's stock-based compensation.Specifically, out of the $2.25 non-GAAP for which Adobe is guiding for Q4 2019, close to 20% is 'neglected' and added back as it is only stock-based, and consequently not a 'real' cost -- this is nonsensical.Further, consider this: if Adobe's non-GAAP EPS numbers look attractive, that is simply because Adobe is repurchasing oodles of its shares:For Q3 2019 Adobe used up all its clean free cash flow to repurchase $750 million of shares. How do I figure this?To calculate its FCF some adjustments need to be made: Adobe's stock-based compensation ($196 million), as well as, property and equipment and intangibles should be subtracted from cash flows from operations. In total, Adobe's free cash flow equals $601 million compared with $750 million used in share repurchases.Succinctly, Adobe's repurchasing of its shares at these valuations only works to prop up the share price. And this works very well until it doesn't.When investors need to squeeze themselves into a pretzel to justify a valuation as being a function of its growth rates, one needs to be very aware that growth rates are very, very challenging to continuously hit above 25% year-over-year.Of course, bulls will counter that Adobe's revenues are subscription-based, meaning that there is a lot of visibility into Adobe's revenues. And of course, this is true. And that's why Adobe's share price has increased as much as it has. But at some point, customers do opt for cheaper/alternative competitors, such as DocuSign (DOCU), Salesforce (CRM), Shopify (SHOP) or others.The competition in the stock market right now is the most challenging and relentless it has ever been. This is possibly the most competitive endeavor in the world.How many eyeballs all around the world are right now looking at Adobe? It is very challenging to be the smartest woman (guy) in the room.Our best chance with investing is to take a few select opportunities where the odds are so substantially in our favor that the downside is largely protected and upside, well, let the upside take care of itself.However I appraise Adobe, I cannot see it doubling in value any time soon to $260 billion, but I can certainly see the stock getting a haircut to approximately $90 billion market cap."
4292583,69905,2019-09-19T19:01:12-04:00,"Investors expected more from Adobe's Q4 guidance.Adobe is the best in this space.Yet, at this valuation, Adobe's shares are best avoided.","Earlier this month, I wrote the following about Adobe (ADBE),Adobe's Q3 2019 results earlier this week played out largely as expected, even if its guidance came in a touch lighter than some expected.The thing with investing is that there is little point in being right on a stock, when everyone else is also right on the stock. To have any chance of beating the market, one needs to have more insight than others.And the thing with Adobe is that it's an amazing company. But everyone knows that already. Yes, it is extremely asset-light. Yes, 92% of Adobe's revenue in Q3 2019 was from recurring sources. All that, and a lot more is true. And nobody is disputing that, least of all me.Digging into the results, the graph below speaks for itself.Source: author's calculationsConsider just how stable that line is? That's one incredibly predictable growth rate. It is certainly highly impressive just how well managed Adobe is!And in a highly volatile market environment, nothing is more highly rewarded that sustainable and predictably strong revenues growth rates.Even when Adobe guides for Q4 2019 revenue to come in at 21%, some analysts felt that Adobe's guide was a nudge light and how could Adobe 'get back to more consistency in making numbers in this business?'And that's the problem summarized right there.Adobe deployed $750 million towards repurchases in Q3 2019. Looking back on its year-to-date reporting, Adobe has generated approximately $1.8 billion of free cash flow over its trailing 9 months.Consequently, we can see that, notwithstanding investing back into the business, Adobe is still able to be highly free cash flow generative and return to shareholders an impressive 70% of its free cash flow. But are shareholders any better off?Let's look at the facts: since May 2018 Adobe has used up $2.25 billion towards share repurchases, and this has brought down Adobe's total shares outstanding by less than 1.5%!Consequently, here is a business which is certainly doing all the right things: growing its top line, being attentive to its margins and returning huge amounts of excess free cash flow. But ultimately, a combination of significant management's stock-based compensation and a very expensive valuation means that shareholders are not really much better off.Source: author's calculationsI know Adobe's space mighty well. And I frequently exult praises over Adobe's consistent ability to be a high free cash flow generating machine.Source: author's coverage of ADBEBut there is a huge difference between recognizing a company's ability to execute at a high level and profiting as shareholders.I know that Adobe's peers are trading at nosebleed valuations. But simply because Adobe is not as irrationally priced as other companies does not immediately make Adobe a bargain investment opportunity.Once again, let's put things in context. Over the past 3 years, Adobe was growing with a CAGR of 24%, and investors expanded the multiples which they were willing to pay for Adobe.Looking ahead, if Adobe's top-line was to start to come down, even slightly, the multiple investors would be willing to pay will also compress.My insight on Adobe is not intended to be contentious. I have friends that are passionate Adobe shareholders. But the ugly facts which get in the way of a wonderful story is that everyone is already looking at Adobe with great expectations.And given Adobe's size, it will be increasingly challenging for a company the size of Adobe to continue to deliver against shareholders' highly enthusiastic sentiment."
4312841,104744,2019-12-17T00:27:08-05:00,"In FY19, Adobe's revenue increased 24%; the top line reached a $11.17 billion landmark.The outperformance of the Digital Experience segment was especially impressive.With a 36% FCF margin, Adobe is a clear free cash flow machine.Trading multiples are highly inflated which pose certain downside risks.","On December 12, Adobe Inc. (ADBE) reported stellar results that topped analysts' forecasts on EPS and revenue; it was the fourth EPS surprise in fiscal 2019. The company delivered double-digit revenue and EPS growth, together with a whopping yearly free cash flow to equity of $4.03 billion and achieved the FCFE margin of 36%. Resilient revenue jump was, to some extent, underpinned by continuous outperformance of the Digital Experience segment that encompasses Data & Insights, Content & Commerce, Advertising, and Customer Journey Management Solutions. The market appreciated its developments, and the share price edged higher. The fly in the ointment is that ADBE valuation remains highly inflated, which poses apparent risks.In the article, I will take a more in-depth look at Adobe's FY 2019 successes and touch upon its valuation.Adobe Inc. wrapped fiscal 2019 on an up note. The figures were especially inspiring, considering Q3 FY19 results had been mixed and even invigorated bears for quite some time.Data by YChartsIn FY19, Adobe delivered strong annual revenue growth of 24%. The top line reached an $11.17 billion landmark, indicating the company's market share is at its zenith. Also, the resilient momentum of sales growth (and especially of recurring revenue) shows it could expand going forward, pushing the company's market value higher. The expansion of the total addressable market to approximately $128 billion by 2022, which was highlighted during Investor Handout, looks fully supportive.The robust sales growth was underpinned by the Digital Media segment (e.g., Creative Cloud that includes Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, etc. and Document Cloud), the corporation's bulwark at the moment; the segment showed a 22% sales growth YoY. Still, the Digital Experience segment (Experience Cloud that includes Adobe Analytics, Magento Commerce, etc.), which is responsible for a lower slice of revenue, grew at a much faster pace; in FY19, the division's sales soared 31%. Most importantly, Experience Cloud subscription revenue jumped 37%. Vertiginous growth proved Adobe's acquisitions of Magento and Marketo in 2018 were extremely valuable. I personally remain bullish on the DE segment's future sales as modern marketing continues to transform and evolve. Companies that provide in-depth data analytics tools necessary to gain insights that drive advertising and marketing decisions, help to accurately manage budgets, deliver strong ROI and ROMI (Return on Marketing Investment), and improve customer experience will thrive in the long term. Adobe is one of them.The Publishing segment (e.g., Authorware, Captivate, ColdFusion, etc.), however, underperformed; annual segmental revenue contracted by 1%. I do not consider this lackluster result as a bearish signal, as the division brought only 2% of sales, and its weakness was more than offset by the outperformance of other divisions.The Americas still underpinned more than a half (58%, to be precise) of revenue, EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa) continued to secure more than a quarter of sales, while Asia brought 15%, precisely the same as in FY17 and FY18.While the top line edged higher, operating and net profit followed the trend. Adobe is not simply growing at all costs, but also manages to secure margins and drive shareholder profit higher. Though Research & Development expenses still require hefty funds (for instance, for development of Adobe Aero presented on Adobe MAX 2019 in November), the adjusted operating margin remained strong and equaled 39.9%. Operating income rose 23%, while diluted EPS increased by 16%.Perhaps the essential matter a potential investor should know about Adobe is that its free cash flow to equity far exceeds GAAP and non-GAAP net income. I estimate its FY 2019 FCFE (net cash flow from operations after purchases of property & equipment) to equal $4.03 billion; it was 4% higher than non-GAAP net income. Put another way, Adobe generated 36 cents in FCF per dollar of sales.Though Abode has a substantial debt on the balance sheet, the coverage of borrowings is not a concern for a few reasons. First, cash & short-term investments cover more than 100% of the total debt.Data by YChartsSecond, the total debt/Net CFFO ratio, which could be used to assess a firm's ability to manage its debt burden, is just 0.94x, meaning that the amount of cash the company generates in a year not only covers but even exceeds its borrowings.Data by YChartsThere is also one balance sheet issue I consider worth briefly addressing. A punctilious investor will definitely notice that in May, the bulk of Adobe's debt was reclassified as short term, indicating that the liability must be satisfied within one year. Given the reasons mentioned above, I do not think it is worthy of concern.As my esteemed readers who have been reading my stock coverages for quite some time do likely remember, I typically take a more in-depth look at a few metrics that reflect if a company invests proficiently, or it has hidden issues that hinder it from showing decent returns. In the case of Adobe, we can use Return on Equity, as the debt load (a 39% Debt/Equity) is relatively acceptable, but I suppose it is better to calculate FCF ROE and FCF ROTC to gain deeper insights. It appears that in FY19, ADBE managed to deliver a 40% FCF Return on Equity (Levered free cash flow/Average shareholder equity) and 28.6% FCF Return on Total Capital (Levered FCF/Average total capital). These impressive figures indicate the company highly efficiently used both creditor and stockholder funds and deserve to trade at a substantial premium to the market.It will not be an exaggeration to conclude that Adobe's valuation is somewhat bloated. While it trades at levels well above the market averages, it is also more expensive than Autodesk (ADSK) and Salesforce.com (CRM).Data by YChartsGiven its prodigious free cash flow generation and strong revenue growth, multiples look justified, but for a fervent value investor, Adobe is, of course, a stock to avoid. For investors who stick to other investing styles, and primarily, the GARP style, Adobe is almost a perfect pick worth further researching.I would not say Adobe's growth is decelerating, as its two key segments, and especially Digital Experience, are running on all cylinders. As investors appreciate the company's transition from old-fashioned packaged software to cloud solutions, its valuation reflects the market's confidence regarding its future. With the transformation of modern digital marketing and the increasing demand for more in-depth marketing data analytics, Adobe's products will definitely enjoy strong growth in the medium term.The company has a wide moat and three pillars of growth: Creative, Document, and Experience Clouds. It is barely imaginable for a professional designer or a person with a strong desire to create some digital art pieces to fulfill their tasks without using Adobe's solutions from Photoshop and Lightroom to Illustrator and InDesign, as there are literally no fully comparable alternatives with the same UX/UI on the market at the moment.Inter alia, I should briefly touch upon the buyback. Adobe has been aggressively repurchasing the stock; in Q4, it bought back 2.8 million shares. Share repurchases are a nice investor-friendly step, but at these valuation levels, a buyback might look like not the best option, as a reduction of the number of shares outstanding near an all-time high is a costly move. At the same time, the corporation does not pay a dividend. The valuation backed by growth prospects is too inflated, and even if Adobe decides to return all free cash flow to equity investors (which is barely possible), the yield will be only ~2.6% (put another way, will be equal to the FCFE yield). So, dividend introduction looks unlikely, and buyback is the best possible option to return cash to shareholders and spur the stock price at the same time.In sum, while I remain bullish on Adobe in the long term, I should concur any signs of deceleration of growth will be onerous."
4293610,104761,2019-09-26T03:41:58-04:00,"I recently added to my position in Adobe after the Q3 sell-off.With a valuation exceeding a hefty $130 billion, the company continues to impressively grow revenue 20%+ annually and strong double-digit growth will likely continue for foreseeable future.The valuation today is reasonable given Adobe's growth profile, its strong competitive position in the markets in which it participates, and its strong financial condition.The 2021 addressable market for Adobe will exceed $100 billion, at which time Adobe will still have massive runway for growth with well under 15% market share.Adobe is a buy.","Adobe (ADBE) reported another strong quarter, but slightly subdued growth guidance going into Q4-19 resulted in a minor sell-off of the stock. I added to my position and consider Adobe a solid long-term investment.The company has a strong competitive position in the markets in which it participates and estimates that its 2021 addressable market is valued at >$100 billion, of which today the company has less than 15% share. There is ample room for growth.The company has faced some challenges, notably subdued sales growth in its Digital Experience business segment, but the company is working to address this issue and the recent weakness is a buying opportunity.On the Q3 call, management noted that it is not satisfied with the sales performance of its Marketo solution to medium-sized businesses. The company will invest more money on demand creation and inside sales to boost Marketo's revenue growth in this area. Additionally, there were some bookings delays in Q3.SourceMarketo is a marketing automation platform that was acquired by Adobe in 2018. Marketo is part of the Adobe Digital Experience business segment, one of the company's two primary business segments. The other major business segment is Adobe Digital Media, which is focused on creativity software like Adobe Photoshop (photo editing), Adobe Premiere (movie editing), and related applications.As with other solutions in the Adobe Digital Experience business segment, Marketo is designed to help businesses improve engagement with prospective customers. While Adobe Digital Experience comprises just 29% of revenue (Q3) vs. 69% for Adobe Digital Media, it is the Digital Experience market that provides the most upside potential for Adobe.In a 2018 investor presentation, the company noted that Adobe Digital Experience market potential by 2021 would be $71 billion. By comparison, the total addressable market (TAM) for Digital Media is $37 billion.SourceThe company has a clear growth trajectory in front of it in both business segments. Adobe is the undisputed King of the Digital market, and with total revenue this year that will be well below $10 billion, the company's Digital segment still has a lot of room to grow into the $37 billion TAM.But the runway in Experience is even greater, though much more competitive. The company is barely scraping 5-6% market share in Experience and has prime competitors in the likes of Salesforce and Oracle. A recent Forrester market study on Digital Experience Platforms ranked Adobe in its top four Experience vendors after an analysis of ten leading Experience solutions.Source: The Forrester WaveTM: Digital Experience Platforms, Q3 2019 report, available for free download at adobe.com.The company issued tempered guidance going into Q4. That said, growth across the board is expected to remain strong. This isn't the first time the company has issued guidance that came in below Street expectations, but the differential in expectations is modest. The overall $2.97 billion in revenue guidance by the company came in less than 2% below the Street expectations of $3.02 billion.SourceOn the recurring revenue front, the company expects to add $450 million in subscription revenue in its Digital Media segment. One of the impressive things about Adobe is its subscription revenue stream. The company sells its software as a service, and more than 90% of revenue is subscription revenue. The company has continued to strengthen the stickiness of its revenue.In the recent quarter, 92% of revenue was recurring. In 2018, 87% of all revenue was recurring. Compare this to 2015, when just 67% of revenue was recurring.Adobe may not look like an obvious value given its P/E ratio or a discounted free cash flow analysis, but when you consider the dominant position it holds in Digital Media, the continued strength of its Digital Experience platform and the industry recognition that Adobe is a leader in this space, and the massive runway that lays before Adobe in both the Media and Experience markets, Adobe is trading at a reasonable valuation for a company that continues to grow revenue 20%+ yoy. The company has dramatically boosted the stickiness of its recurring revenue stream in recent years and may further embolden its position via acquisitions. The company has a rock solid balance sheet, has been a consistently strong generator of free cash flow, and continues to buy back stock. Given these elements, I think Adobe at ~$280 is a reasonable price.Adobe is a great company trading at a reasonable price. I have added to my position. If shares get punished again below current valuation before the end of the year, I would consider adding to my position again given the market opportunity ahead."
4290253,67113,2019-09-06T16:32:44-04:00,We nearly bought this stock 11 months ago.Shares are up 14% since then.A weekly sell signal has actually showed up on our screener.,"We wrote about Adobe Inc. (ADBE) last October and stated that we would wait for a weekly swing in the share price before getting long this stock most likely for a swing trade to the upside. Well, we never got that convincing weekly swing as Adobe, along with equity markets, in general, fell into a multi-year low last December.Eleven months on and Adobe is now trading 14%+ above ($289) the $252 price which we were attracted to last October. The question now is whether we are still attracted to the stock at its present share price and whether there may be a trade at hand.Although revenues are expected to rise by almost 24% this year, analysts who follow this stock expect 18% top-line growth next year, which is slightly lower than average. Earnings projections for the current year remain steady at about $7.81 a share, whereas fiscal 2020 is expected to bring in $9.75 a share.Gross margins come in at 85.6% over a trailing-twelve-month average, which is slightly down on last year. Furthermore, we are dealing with a higher valuation at present (compared to last October) as earnings per share over the past four quarters only come in $0.15 per share higher than the number in 2018 ($5.20).To help us decide on where Adobe is in its cycle, we like to go to the technical charts to see how shares have been trending.If we first go to the monthly chart, we can see that shares have been in a strong bull trend since 2012. The steepness of the curve has been relentless as shares continued to make higher highs at a rapid rate. The 50-month moving average as well as the long-term upward trend-line both offer strong support for shares at the $174 mark. The problem here, though, is that number is well over $100 below where the share price is trading at present. Therefore, all we can take from the long-term monthly chart at present is that the long-term trend is most definitely up.If we go to the weekly chart, we can see that Adobe like the market in general rallied aggressively out of its December lows last year. However, because the 4-week moving average is trading below the 9 and 18 weeks, we actually have a sell signal in play here. This signal has been confirmed by the breach of that intermediate trend-line plus the crossover on the MACD indicator.So, up to this point, we have a long-term bullish trend on the monthly chart. The intermediate chart looks like it is turning over. With trend lines, in order to confirm a successful breach, we usually go as far as having a 3% tolerance on each side. As the chart shows above, we have not had much downside movement since the trend-line breach. Furthermore, swing traders looking to possibly short Adobe here should be aware that the S&P (with its recent rally) has moved above its 10-week moving average once more. The S&P appears to be on the thirteenth week of its intermediate cycle. The index looks like it is not ready just yet to drop down into its intermediate cycle low. This obviously would have ramifications for a possible swing play to the downside in Adobe.Suffice it to say, the coil that is currently in play on the Adobe daily chart looks like it will break to the upside if the S&P continues to rally. Irrespective of the weekly sell signals discussed above, we do not envisage Adobe´s shares trading against the broader equity indexes if they indeed continue to rally.Therefore, to conclude, when swing trading either to downside or upside, we always try to make sure that our trade is aligned with the underlying long-term trend. Although we have an intermediate sell signal in Adobe at present, not enough of the other important info such as cycles and trends follow suit. We will take a pass on this trade at this stage."
4292496,103480,2019-09-19T11:58:31-04:00,"Shares of Adobe fell modestly after reporting Q3 results, putting the stock at about ~15% below recent highs.
        Adobe has shown plenty of resilience in the past and has consistently been able to reclaim new all-time highs following a dip.
        The primary driver behind this quarter's drop is a disappointing Q4 outlook, but Adobe has a history of guiding conservatively and later exceeding expectations.
        Adobe remains one of the highest-margin software businesses in the market, and is undervalued relative to future earnings growth.","Over the past several years, Adobe (ADBE) has been one of my favorite long-term hold stocks, having performed the S&P 500 consistently by well over 4-5x during the past several years. Over that time span, the once-staid document editing company has transformed itself into a cloud services giant, hooking creatives and professionals into its monthly-subscription plans and creating a broad ecosystem of products that include its flagship Acrobat, Photoshop, and other tools.As such, I view any dip in Adobe shares (that doesn't come with any news of heightened risk) as a chance to load back up on shares and wait for the rebound. Shares of Adobe have pulled back modestly after announcing third-quarter results, putting the stock in technical correction territory near 15% below recent highs:Despite the appearance of weakness since mid-July from the stock chart above, Adobe's fundamentals have never been stronger, and its long-term thesis remains very much intact:Let's touch on that last point a bit closer. I've always viewed Adobe's valuation from a PEG basis, because its quarterly earnings growth tends to clock in so much higher than a typical company. For FY20, analysts have a consensus EPS target of $9.75 for Adobe, per Yahoo Finance. That means its current forward P/E ratio is 28.2x, which doesn't necessarily scream cheap. That FY20 EPS estimate, however, represents 25% y/y growth over the current year's EPS estimate of $7.81 - meaning that Adobe trades at a PEG ratio of just about ~1x. When we add in the fact that Adobe typically outperforms investor expectations, we find a tremendous bargain in Adobe's current share prices.Stay long here and buy the dip. Adobe has been one of the most consistent performers in the software market, and the dominance of its flagship products plus the high growth potential in newer offerings makes Adobe a solid choice for the long term.Let's take a closer look at Adobe's third-quarter results:Figure 1. Adobe Q3 earnings resultsSource: Adobe 3Q19 earnings releaseTotal revenues grew 24% y/y to $2.83 billion, ahead of Wall Street's expectations of $2.82 billion (+23% y/y). Subscription revenues, meanwhile, grew two points faster at 26% y/y to $2.55 billion. We note also that Adobe's mix of subscription revenues also notched a record high at 89.8%, 160bps higher than 88.2% in the year-ago quarter.One of investors' primary concerns with Adobe coming out of Q3 was the fact that the company issued a relatively disappointing outlook for Q4. Wall Street had hoped for total revenues of $3.02 billion, about two points stronger than Adobe's actual guidance of $2.97 billion:Figure 2. Adobe 4Q19 guidance outlookSource: Adobe 3Q19 earnings releaseBut we saw the same phenomenon play out in Q3. Back in Q2, when Adobe initially guided to Q3 revenues, the estimate was ""~$2.80 billion"". Wall Street, on the other hand, had expected $2.83 billion - which is exactly where Adobe landed this quarter. The key observation here: Adobe has regularly been a conservative guidance giver, but its performance almost always tops initial expectations.Management reported that Adobe's strength in Q3 was broad-based. In particular, the company is counting on its smaller, newer products for growth. The company's newly-launched Adobe Experience Cloud, targeted at the CX (customer experience management) market, has been a strong performer that extends Adobe's total TAM by $70 billion. Per CEO Shantanu Narayen's prepared remarks on the Q3 earnings call:Similarly, Document Cloud continues to be another big winner for Adobe. The company landed some major wins this quarter from some of the world's largest global companies including Deutsche Bank, Saudi Aramco (yes, the world's largest company), Dell, as well as a huge public sector client: the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Management also commented that net new ARR for Document Cloud clocked in at $72 million this quarter, a record for the company. Adobe also noted that it just rolled out Adobe Sign for small and mid-market businesses with strong early customer traction. As demonstrated by this quarter's results, multi-product growth continues to be a pillar of Adobe's growth story. We note that among the largest cloud titans - which include Salesforce.com (CRM) and Workday (WDAY) - each has had to grow beyond its traditional niche in order to succeed. Salesforce grew outside of Sales Cloud to offer marketing and platform tools, while Workday moved beyond HCM to offer finance and ERP solutions. Similarly, Adobe is using the branding power of its flagship Photoshop and Acrobat tools to achieve wins in Document Cloud and CX. Adobe also made respectable gains in profitability this quarter, despite accelerating R&D spend to support new product rollouts (in addition to rolling out Adobe Sign for small businesses, Adobe also introduced the painting app Adobe Fresco in Q3). GAAP operating income grew 19% y/y to $853.8 million, representing a rich 30.1% GAAP operating margin. We note that despite being at a similar revenue scale, Salesforce.com (CRM) is still barely capable of producing positive GAAP operating margins - in its most recent quarter, Salesforce's operating margin clocked in at a mere 1%.Meanwhile, Adobe's pro forma EPS of $2.05 also grew 18% y/y and smashed Wall Street's expectations of $1.97. There's a lot to like about Adobe, especially at 10-15% off recent highs. Though the company gave a lowball guidance outlook for Q3, history has shown that Adobe tends to achieve well ahead of its own plans. With category-leading applications across a variety of software niches with relatively little competition (unlike Salesforce and Workday in CRM and HCM respectively, Adobe isn't facing dozens of competitors for Photoshop), Adobe is still poised for long-term growth. Buy the dip and wait for the rebound."
4291927,92586,2019-09-16T20:37:29-04:00,"Adobe will report fiscal 3Q19 results on September 16, looking to break the stock price inertia of the past three months.While the puts and takes of margin are a bit harder to forecast, revenues should increase about 23% on the back of an improved product suite, cross-selling, and M&A.ADBE trades at multiples that are far from depressed, but I believe the stock deserves to be valued a bit more richly.","Adobe (ADBE) stock has lost a bit of its momentum in the past three months. Shares have moved largely sideways around the $280 mark since the company's most recent, ""mixed-bag"" earnings report. The San Jose-based software company will now have another chance to inspire investors when it discloses the results of its fiscal 3Q19.Credit: Adobe Document CloudAnalysts expect revenues to reach $2.82 billion in the quarter, about $20 million more than the management team has guided for. If the target is achieved - and I believe it will, since the largely recurring revenue model usually allows for more accurate planning of financial results - the healthy top-line increase of 22.9% would stay roughly in line with the growth trend of the past 16 quarters. EPS estimate of $1.97 would represent yet another leg in consistent earnings growth that Adobe has been able to deliver over the past several years.Driving revenue momentum will likely be a combination of factors across Adobe's business segments - i.e. creative, document, and experience. The company's growth engine has historically been supported by (1) the introduction of new digital tools, taking advantage of strong momentum in mobile and social media, (2) cross-selling of the company's product suite across the different client verticals, and (3) inorganic growth. Regarding the latter, revenues should suffer a bit from more normalized comps, as the Magento acquisition turned one year old in May 2019.Source: DM Martins Research, using historical data from company's reportsA bit harder to anticipate will be margins, since a number of one-off items will continue to drag profitability in 2019. Among them are accounting changes, a heavier mix of Marketo revenues, and integration costs that are expected to follow Adobe's acquisitions of the past 15 months (Magento, Marketo, and Allegorithmic). But keeping an eye on the long-term opportunity, core margins should continue to expand as Adobe gains scale.In fact, paying closer attention to Adobe's long-term prospects makes more sense for the buy-and-hold investor than focusing too much on the company's quarter-to-quarter performance. I believe that Adobe will remain the undisputed leader in digital asset creation, while it continues to gain traction in e-commerce. In addition, I believe the company will keep expanding its subscription business (nearly 90% of total revenues in fiscal 2Q19) at a pace of more about 25% in the next few quarters, which should bode well for consistent revenue growth and margin support.Data by YChartsAs usual, ADBE trades at multiples that are far from depressed. Yet, I believe the stock deserves to be valued a bit more richly, considering (1) Adobe's strong leadership position in its industry, (2) the almost undisturbed top- and bottom-line growth pace that remains robust, (3) the shift towards more predictable, SaaS-based revenues, and (4) the company's pristine balance sheet (minimal levels of net debt) and strong cash flow (FCF of nearly $4 billion per year, representing an FCF margin of more than 35%).In the past few quarters, Adobe's earnings reports were often received with modest levels of bearishness - even when the results and outlook seemed far from concerning. Should the same happen this week, and absent any unexpected deterioration in fundamentals, ADBE would become an even more compelling buy at post-earnings levels."
4291327,69905,2019-09-13T04:35:59-04:00,Still a high growth company.Adobe's expectations versus delivery.Dangers looming in the stock.,"I remain unenthused over Adobe's (ADBE) shareholders' returns over the medium term. It has been difficult for some time to rationally argue that Adobe is undervalued.Moreover, given that investors finally appear to be rotating out of high-flying SaaS names and are once again being more value conscious, I declare that Adobe's shareholders are best to start to exit their positions to avoid untimely disappointment.As a brief reminder, Adobe has two main segments, Digital Media and Digital Experience, which are highlighted below.Source: Author's calculationsAdobe also has a smaller Publishing unit, which is small and not a game changer.In more detail, Adobe's Digital Media Segment includes Photoshop, Illustrator, and the Acrobat family. This segment assists users to create, publish and promote their content. While Adobe's Digital Experience segment has a completely different offering, which is focused on connectivity, analytics, and marketing endeavors.Moreover, to be clear, there is no question that Adobe is still very much in high growth mode, and the graph below illustrates this.We can plainly see just how steady and predictable Adobe's growth rates continue to be. And this fact, in and of itself, had allowed Adobe's valuation to balloon.However, when all is said and done, Adobe's shares have practically remained unchanged over the past 12 months. Yes, there is no question that historically Adobe has been a great stock to own - nobody is questioning that. But what matters now is what happens to the stock going forward?In fact, Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen asserts that Adobe's revenue growth, cash flow, and operating profit differentiate the company among SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) players, which I fundamentally agree with.Having said that, the problem is that investors had already been accounting for and rewarding Adobe with a premium valuation based on its very steady and consistent revenue growth.What matters now going forward is all about investors' expectations versus Adobe's delivery. Can a company the size of Adobe substantially outgrow its expected approximately 22-25% revenue growth rates? Because this is what investors are expecting from Adobe.Source: Author's calculationsIt is widely known that SaaS players aggressively use their stock as compensation in the place of a cash compensation. And even then, whilst being cognizant of this fact, we can see how the whole sector is being valued on a P/Cash flow (from operations) metric? The whole sector trades substantially above 30, while few of them are likely to keep growing over the coming two to three years above 30%.Here another way of looking appreciating the present sentiment in the investment community by paying attention to Adobe's peer Workday's (WDAY) valuation.Admittedly, Workday is smaller than Adobe and more prone to vicissitudes. Also, in my opinion, it will struggle to generate strong cash flows (if we assume its heavy stock-based compensation as a cash cost).And we can see that despite having strong recent performance in its quarterly results, investors are starting to question whether valuations ultimately matter? And thus that stock has also deflated of late.Salesforce (CRM) is another SaaS company with a similar story. It had been an absolute investor darling, and despite its continuous acquisition spree, investors had been highly exuberant of the stock. However, today investors are starting to question just how sustainable that growth strategy is likely, and its stock is also unchanged over the past year.High-growth, high-flying stocks work until they no longer work. Nobody is in any way dismissing the fact that Adobe is a very high-quality enterprise. What is being discussed here is how shareholders might profit from its stock, and I contend that they will struggle to do so.Ultimately, Adobe's shares do not offer investors a positive risk-reward balance.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive emails of my latest research, please click ""Follow"" at the top of this article."

""When the oxygen masks come down, be sure to put yours in place before attempting to help others"".That is the perpetual work environment of investing Market-Makers [MMs] whose role is to aid buyers and sellers in finding a point of price balance right now in multi-million-dollar block trades. A balance which usually requires them to put a part of their own firm's capital temporarily at the risk of changing market attitudes and prices.They won't do it without the oxygen of price-change protection.

Desirable conditions are down and to the right.The better-positioned Risk~Reward stocks are ADBE and MSCI at location [2], MSFT at [14] and OTEX at [21].The severe limits of the tradeoff proposition deny much of any reasoning to answer the question of WHY we see what we do. To probe that exploration further, we offer some history of what has been seen in the market movements of many of these securities when tradeoffs similar to today's have been seen in the past 5 years. Please consider Figure 2.Figure 2To answer the question of which of these has the best trade-off between forecast-able reward and risk, Figure 1 appears to answer with OTEX, but in close pursuit are MSFT, MSCI and ADBE. Answering the other five questions can put a finer point on a choice of only one of them.In Figure 2 the question of how big a near-term reward may be possible is addressed in column [E]. It measures the price distance of the top of the MM price range forecast [B] from the current market price [D].The question of how often may disappointment occur is dealt with in [H], the odds of having a profitable buy experience. Those odd are found by looking historically for prior MM daily forecasts of the last 5 years which had the same Range Index [G] proportions of upside to downside price change expectations as today's. The number of those is in [L], out of all available forecasts for the stock in [M].The [L] sample's outcomes are defined by the portfolio management discipline of TERMD, where buy positions are closed out at the first instance of the sell target's achievement, or the closing price 3 month after the date of the forecast, regardless of gain or loss. The percent of [L] profitable experiences is what is shown in [H]. Losses are the complement of that proportion.The size of loss is more realistically described by how badly the position's price may get drawn down during the holding period on the way to attempt reaching the sell target. That is shown in [F] as the point of maximum emotional stress, least likely to offer continued pursuit of the price goal in the face of disappointment to date.Resistance of that stress to the end of the maximum holding time allowed may produce either profitable recovery or the recognition of a loss. Either will consume a time investment of 63 market days or 91 calendar days. Gains taken at sell targets will likely be at shorter time investments, offering additional reinvestment of the expanded capital to achieve compounding of rewards within the original time investment commitment.The average number of market days held from all prior [L] experiences is shown in [J]. Its relation to a 252 market-day year indicates the possible number of re-investments, with a minimum of 4. Because of shorter holding period gains, more are possible where other opportunities are found. In the case of MSCI, its 36 market-day average could permit 7 re-investments in a year where other similar opportunities are found.Because such opportunities are irregularly available it is useful to measure the reward potentials in units which reflect the speed of attainment. Compound Annual Growth Rates [CAGR] do this but are cumbersome to use in dealing with periods of less than a year. Instead financial management often turns to basis-points per day as a unit of measurement. A basis point is 1/100th of a percent of change in cost or capital investment.In figure 2 the average simple percent net rewards of all [L] prior sample outcomes under TERMD are shown in column [ I ]. These differ from the target currently shown in [E] by a credibility ratio shown in [N], a dimension of varied concerns to the individual investor.To provide a common preference scale for selection of desirable investment candidates, we apply the [H] odds to the achieved rewards of [ I ] and its complement to [F] risks. These adjustments are in columns [O] and [P]. They are added together to form a net figure of merit [Q] for selection preferences. In addition, those net figures may be calculated in basis points per day to further refine them as selection measures. The bp/day figures are in [R], and rank the stock rows of Figure 2.The top score on this basis is held now by ADBE. Individual investor preferences over [F], [N], and [J] could easily produce different rankings.A look at recent ADBE expectations trendsFigure 3Price reductions for ADBE in the past month have had little effect on the MMs impression of what major institutional portfolio managers expect from ADBE stock prices in coming months. Its upside price potentials have expanded while its downside exposure prospects have shrunk, as indicated by the heavy dot current market quote in the vertical lines of the price range forecasts.ConclusionCurrently Adobe Inc. appears to be the more attractive buy for near-term capital gain among the better computer software stock investment candidates."
4291153,20715,2019-09-12T08:21:48-04:00,Adobe is set to release fiscal third-quarter earnings results on Tuesday.The company has experienced solid earnings and revenue growth in the past few years.The recent pullback in the stock has the stock approaching two potential support levels.Sentiment toward the stock is average with a slight skew to the pessimistic side.,"Software giant Adobe Systems (ADBE) is scheduled to report fiscal third-quarter results on Tuesday. The company is expected to report earnings of $1.97 per share on revenue of $2.82 billion. Those figures are significantly higher than the third quarter of 2018 when the company reported EPS of $1.73 on revenue of $2.29 billion. Extending those figures out we see that earnings are expected to increase by 13.9% and revenue is expected to increase by 23.1%.With many tech firms reporting declines in earnings and revenue, these figures look particularly strong, but they show growth that is a bit slower than what Adobe has averaged over the last few years. The company has seen earnings grow by an average of 45% per year over the last three years and revenue has increased at a rate of 24% per year over the same period. In the fiscal second quarter, earnings were up 10% and revenue was up 25%. Analysts expect earnings to increase by 16% for 2019 as a whole while revenue is expected to increase by 23.9%.In addition to the strong earnings and sales growth, Adobe has strong management efficiency measurements. The return on equity is 37.8% and the profit margin is at 39.6%.The combination of the earnings growth, the sales growth, the profit margin, and the return on equity gives Adobe some really high ratings from Investor's Business Daily. The company scores a 95 on IBD's EPS rating system and an A in the SMR rating system. This means that the stock ranks in the top 5% of all companies for earnings growth and it is in the top 20% in the SMR system.The weekly chart for Adobe shows how the stock rallied sharply from the fourth quarter of 2016 through the third quarter of last year. The overall selloff in the market took Adobe down with it and the stock suffered its first significant pullback in several years. The pullback also took the stock out of an upwardly sloped trend channel, but it looks as though a new one may have formed.We see that the highs from last December, this past April, and this summer all connect nicely to form the upper band. If we draw a parallel line and drop it down to the low from December we get what could be the lower rail. This lower rail is in the same area as the 52-week moving average and that could help confirm the validity of the lower rail.Looking at the overbought/oversold indicators we see that they have moved significantly lower in the last few months. The 10-week RSI has moved from overbought territory to below the 50 level. The RSI hasn't been in oversold territory at any point in the last three and a half years.The stochastic readings also moved from overbought territory to readings below 50. The only time these indicators have been close to oversold territory in the last three and a half years was in the fourth quarter. The indicators are still trending lower, but when they make a bullish crossover, we could be looking at a great buying opportunity based on previous instances where they crossed.I have been including sentiment analysis as part of my investment process for approximately 20 years now. I find that it complements fundamental and technical analysis rather well. One thing that I have learned over the years is that you have to look at the whole picture. The sentiment for a stock with strong fundamentals and a solid technical picture should be skewed to the bullish side. The sentiment toward a stock with poor fundamentals and is trending lower - the sentiment should be bearish.With Adobe, we have a stock with strong fundamentals and it has been moving higher, but the sentiment toward the stock is just average. There are 30 analysts following the stock and 19 have the stock rated as a ""buy"" while 11 have it rated as a ""hold"". This puts the buy percentage at 63.3% and that is slightly below average. Looking at another article I wrote back in March, Adobe had 31 analysts following it with 25 ""buy"" ratings. I am using a different source for the overall ratings now, so these numbers aren't necessarily comparing apples to apples.The short interest ratio is currently at 2.18 and that is slightly below average compared to other stocks. Looking at the readings from the past year, Adobe's short interest ratio hasn't been above 3.0 and has been as low as 1.0. Given the fundamental performance and the relatively strong technical performance, I am not surprised by the relatively low short interest ratio.The put/call ratio is at 1.18 with 111,818 puts open and 94,955 calls open at this time. This ratio is slightly higher than the average stock and it is higher than the ratio was at the June earnings report or the March earnings report. The ratio was at 1.01 on June 18, and according to my March article, the ratio was at 0.85 ahead of that earnings report. What this suggests is that the sentiment from option traders is slightly more pessimistic than the average stock and the sentiment has grown more bearish in the last six months.Overall I would describe the sentiment as average with a slight skew to the bearish side with the analysts' ratings being slightly below average and the put/call ratio being slightly above average.Being that this is the third time I have written about Adobe in the past year, I can tell you that I am still bullish on the stock. In both of the previous articles, I have pointed out a pattern to the stock's reaction to earnings.""What I noticed with Adobe's chart is that regardless of the fact that the company beat earnings estimates, five to seven days after the reports, the stock was lower each time. After the dips, the stock rallied over the next month.""The pattern was broken last September and then repeated in March after the earnings report, but the last report in June broke the pattern in a different way. The stock gapped higher after the earnings report and then continued higher over the next month.Given how the sentiment has gotten a little more bearish over the past year, I wouldn't be surprised to see the stock gap higher again after this earnings report. However, I don't think you have to take that risk ahead of the report. Out of the last eight earnings reports, the stock has been higher one month after the report six times. The only two exceptions were last September and December when the overall market was getting hit with major selling.With the weekly oscillators in the lower half of their range and with the daily overbought/oversold indicators close to oversold territory, I like the odds of Adobe making a move to the upside. If the stock does drop after earnings, you have the potential support of the lower rail of the channel along with the 52-week moving average. That might be the ideal entry point for a bullish position."
4286633,102912,2019-08-19T13:01:20-04:00,"In this article series, we use machine learning techniques to rank large-cap computer software stocks and focus on our top three ranked stocks.Adobe, Inc (ADBE) is our third-highest ranked computer software stock, and has excellent fundamentals based on our analysis.Based on its strong balance sheet, a great market position and high profit margins, we like ADBE at these levels.While there are signs of slowing growth, ADBE is well-positioned to outperform the market in the upcoming years.","This is the second article of our series on large-cap computer software stocks. In this article series, we use machine learning-based predictive analytics to focus our analysis of computer software stocks to three companies with the highest predicted probability of strong future annual returns relative to the market. Next, we identify the metrics most highly associated with future stock performance for technology stocks. Finally, we take a deep dive into the financials of our highest ranked computer software stocks.In the previous article of this series, we discussed our highest ranked computer software pick: Autodesk, Inc (ADSK). Our analysis revealed Autodesk was achieving explosive short-term growth fueled by high amounts of debt. Nevertheless, we had concerns over the company’s negative equity, high levels of debt and negative earnings. Ultimately, we kept ADSK on our watchlist but went against the recommendations of our machine learning algorithms arguing that our algorithms may not fully grasp the risks associated with massive amounts of debt in this volatile market environment.In this article, we focus our attention to our third highest ranked computer software stock: Adobe, Inc (ADBE).We used a massive financial database containing over a decade of financial statements and historical price data for thousands of stocks to train neural networks to identify the association between over a hundred financial metrics and a binary indicator of strong future annual stock performance relative to the market. Models were trained using a 75%/25% training/test split and internally validated against the test set.The performance of our neural networks relative to the overall market is described in great detail in one of our previous articles: 3 Semiconductor Stocks To Buy Today, And 1 To Avoid: Machine Learning-Driven Insights. Based on the results of internal validation, betting alongside our models led to a significant increase in expected returns as compared to the overall market.We summarize the rankings and key metrics of large-cap computer software stocks in table 1 shown below. In this series, we cover computer software stocks with a predicted probability greater than 60% including Autodesk, Inc. (ADSK), SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (SSNC), and Adobe, Inc. (ADBE). Honorable mentions go to computer software sector that almost met our cut-off include: Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS), Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS), ANSYS, Inc. (ANSS), Electronic Arts, Inc. (EA), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), and The Trade Desk, Inc. (TTD).Table 1. Rankings and key metrics of large-cap computer software stocksAdobe, Inc. (ADBE)Adobe (ADBE) is a computer software giant with a market cap of over $150 billion and represents our third-highest ranked stock in the sector. The company offers a line of software and services for content creation, digital advertising, and marketing including Photoshop, Lightroom, Adobe Analytics, Media Optimizer and Campaign Manager. The company was founded in 1982 and is headquartered in San Jose, California.Based on our analysis, ADBE has a quant score of 66.1% indicating it belongs to a basket of stocks with an excellent risk-reward profile. By comparison, the average predicted probability of strong annual returns of peers is 46.2%. ADBE's stock price has run up 22.6% year-over-year and has shown significant gains of 17.9% in the last quarter. The stock currently does not offer a dividend yield.Figure 1. Valuation and Financial Strength: Adobe Inc.Adobe Inc. trades at a premium relative to peers in terms of its trailing P/E ratio (56.8) having the 12th highest P/E ratio of any large cap computer software stock. It is important to note that the peer average P/E ratio is highly skewed by Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), which currently has a trailing P/E ratio of over 7,000. In any case, as described in part 1 of this series, our prior research indicates that the P/E ratio is a poor indicator of future stock performance for technology stocks.On the other hand, our research indicates that a high P/S ratio coupled with high profit margins is a strong indicator of future potential returns. In this case, ADBE has a higher P/S ratio relative to peers (15.9 vs. 10.8, respectively). Furthermore, as discussed below, the company has high profit margins.Financial StrengthLooking at measures of financial strength, ADBE's debt-to-equity ratio (1.0) is the 9th lowest among peers indicating it has been less aggressive in its use of debt financing. Meanwhile, its debt-to-asset ratio is similar to other computer software stocks (0.2). Overall, ADBE has a strong balance sheet and low levels of debt.Figure 2. Profitability and Management Effectiveness: Adobe Inc.ADBE has a higher gross profit margin relative to peers (84.7% vs. 76.9%, respectively) indicating it has more cash to spend on business operations as compared to peers. Similarly, the stock ranks 5th in terms of its operating margin (25.9%), which signals it controls its business costs and expenses better than peers.Adobe Inc. is able to generate a higher return on assets (13.7%) as compared to other computer software stocks; however, it has a lower return on equity (27.2%). This indicates the company has less debt than competitors, but also produces lower (but still impressive) returns for shareholders.Figure 3. EPS Compounded Annual Growth Rate: Adobe Inc.ADBE has one of the strongest medium and long-term growth profiles having experienced significantly more growth than most peers in the 3 to 10 year timespan. That being said, the ADBE’s growth has tapered off recently as reflected by lower free cash flow and operating cash flow growth relative to peers. Nevertheless, ADBE still managed to show an impressive 16.2% growth YoY, although this is a sharp decline from previous levels.ADBE is a company that has experienced explosive growth over the last decade. While there are signs that its growth is slowing, EPS growth is still high in the mid to high teens. Furthermore, ADBE has lower debt levels than peers while still maintaining a high return on equity. Overall, we like ADBE as a company. Its strong balance sheet and market position make it a less risky play, and, based on historic growth trends, the company should continue to offer strong growth in the future albeit at a slower pace than the last decade."
4287230,41961,2019-08-21T19:20:01-04:00,"Adobe is a high quality business that has provided investor returns of approximately 25% over the last decade.The business is riding secular trends in digital content which revolve around video and rich media creation and editing.Adobe’s moat is wide, with educational training on Adobe’s software suite in universities and colleges and a steep learning curve to master content creation software helping to preserve incumbency.Being a 'one stop shop' for content creation, analytics, tracking and campaign management may be influential with SMB's versus disparate point solutions.","Adobe (ADBE) is a business that I’ve long held admiration for. It occupies a significant position in the digital content creation and analytics ecosystem. There are 4 notable reasons why I like the business so much and why I hold today.The creation of rich, high definition media for content consumption is a trend that has been accelerating over the last few years. Fast mobile networks, devices with increasing processing and a shift to content monetization via digital advertising have all come together to create strong demand for digital content creation and accompanying analytics and marketing tools.The consumption of content via mobile device is rising as ultra fast mobile networks make it easier and more efficient to view rich media and large video streams. Rising CPM’s for video pre rolls, and a trend toward higher video conversion rates, coupled with increasing video inventory create demand for well edited video content. DIY content creators are increasingly monetizing their time and creativity on platforms such as YouTube, Facebook video, and Instagram stories and are turning toward content creation tools to assist. Bloggers of all types are looking for rich media and imagery to boost audience engagement and time spent on pages. The demands of maintaining various social media channels for internal communications departments create a requirement to be able to edit and retouch images to be disseminated across these channels in a consistent and standardized way.Adobe is the platform of choice for rich media content creation and editing. The company's Photoshop product has an iconic place in the creation and editing of images, to such an extent that image manipulation is now known more commonly known, as having just been 'photoshopped'. Beyond Photoshop, Adobe Premier Pro, Premier Effects and After Effects subsequently followed and took their place as best in class video software creation and editing tools.Adobe product family (Source: Pinterest.com)Adobe has such a lock on the market for content creation that it has built some very deep network effects which are very difficult for competitors to unseat. Given the market dominance of Adobe in content creation, there is an expectation that creative digital professionals entering the workplace have a working knowledge and ability to use Adobe products like Photoshop and Premier Pro to create their content. This expectation is reinforced in industry and academia, where the training courses for many creative design professionals heavily lean on the family of Adobe products to assist the learning experience of students. As these Adobe trained creative design professionals enter, they expect or demand Adobe software suites to execute design tasks. This works to create a strong, reinforcing network effect, which locks in Adobe as the established standard for content creation. Even if a better competitive product is developed, the learning curve to understand and master new content tools is typically very steep requiring months or even years of training and practice. Users who have mastered Adobe software tools would be unwilling to do so unless mandated to change, further preserving Adobe’s advantage.Just as important as the creation of high quality video content are analytics and measurement tools, the ability to integrate content into advertising platforms, campaign insights and ties into demand management platforms and lead management and marketing. Integrating all of these capabilities within content creation tools provides a seamless way for developers to be able to close the loop on their creatives and get a real time view on revenue generation.Adobe has inorganically built out these capabilities starting with its acquisition of Omniture in 2009. Omniture provided capabilities such as behavioral targeting and web analytics for Adobe. Since the acquisition of Omniture, other acquisitions that have extended on these capabilities have followed. Magneto and Marketo were both acquired in 2018. While Marketo, in particular, appeared to be a particularly pricey acquisition at almost $4.8B, it provided Adobe with an important set of capabilities that took the company beyond analytics and measurement to new capabilities such as lead management, email marketing and customer marketing, capabilities that are more competitive with those provided by Salesforce (CRM) and other CRM providers.The strategy being pursued by Adobe is a very interesting one in this regard. Integrating CRM tools into its suite of offerings not only dramatically expands its TAM (Total Addressable Market), but is also a bet that using content creation tools as a beachhead to offer analytics, tracking and lead management within the one platform will be viewed as convenient and ‘good enough’ by developers and content creators to avoid additional investments in specialist CRM and analytics tools. It is still too early to evaluate just how successful this strategy will be. However, this approach is likely to find favor with the SMB segment in particular, and those without significant in-house IT resources to manage multiple technology point solutions will value the convenience of a one-stop shop for content creation, analytics, and lead management.Adobe’s recent earnings release paints the picture of a business that has a dominant competitive position in a market that is being driven by strong secular trends. In its Q2 earnings release, Adobe reported that revenue growth increased some 24.5% to $2.8B. Adobe has averaged revenue growth of approximately 23% over the last 3 years. Adobe’s retention of revenue is also very good, with a gross margin consistently near 85% and net margin above 25%. Consistent with the company’s strong financial discipline and various growth opportunities, Adobe sports returns on invested capital near 20%, which is exceptionally good. Free cash flow generation is often 30% or higher of the company's revenue, resulting in a business that can largely control its own destiny as far as financing investment and growth.Valuation wise, Adobe very rarely trades particularly cheaply, given the quality of the franchise. However, this has not prevented exceptional returns to shareholders over a long period of time. Over a 10-year period, Adobe has delivered annualized returns of almost 25%. Adobe currently trades at a forward PE ratio of just under 30x earnings, comparatively high, but broadly consistent with its valuation over the last 5 years. Analysts expect Adobe to grow earnings at just under 17% p.a. over the next 5 years.Given the quality of the franchise, its dominant competitive positioning and the secular trends which it is riding, this is certainly a name to look to add on a more meaningful market pullback."
4277064,57621,2019-07-24T12:42:46-04:00,Adobe Inc. is a growth stock and strategic acquisitions and partnerships has propelled its stock to all-time highs.The current valuation suggests continued strong EPS growth over the next 5 years (estimated at 17% CAGR).Proposing to write put options at $250 strike to receive option premium upfront with enough buffer if the company under performs.,"Adobe Inc. (ADBE) reported record quarterly revenue of $2.74 billion for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 which represents 25% year-on-year growth. This revenue growth extends from fiscal year 2018 performance where the company generated revenue of $9.0 billion which represents growth of 23.7% over the previous year.Q2 2019 diluted earnings per share was $1.29 as compared to the same period last year of $1.33, due to higher provision for income taxes. However, for the six months ended May 31, 2019, Adobe Inc. reported diluted earnings per share of $2.65 as compared to $2.50 last year. In fiscal year ended November 30, 2018 diluted earnings per share were $5.20 as compared with fiscal year 2017 dilute earnings per share of $3.38 (53.8% growth).The phenomenal growth has ADBE shares trading at 54x PE and at an all-time high. At such prices, ADBE has to grow earnings per share at 17% CAGR over the next 5 years, assuming a fifth year PE multiple of 25x. The 2024 PE of 25x was taken from more mature software companies such as SAP and Microsoft.Historical P&LSource: company annual reportsAdobe's has demonstrated a solid record of sales growth and expanding operating margins. Management spent well on strategic acquisitions and partnerships, adding on ADBE's suite of services to be more comprehensive to marketeers and e-commerce customers. While I do like the transformation that ADBE has undertaken to be a major player in e-commerce, I see this stock as being a risky investment at such prices. ADBE however does have a strong balance sheet (debt-to-equity of 0.4x) and it generates healthy cash flow for further acquisitions and share repurchases. Free cash flow in 2018 was -$2.6 billion due to significant capital expenditure of $6.6 billion, but that is expected to be non-recurring in nature.I have therefore adjusted my growth assumptions and am proposing a trade idea based on selling a 1 year ADBE call option at $250.Source: broker accountSource: Yahoo! Finance Option ChainThe strike price at $250 represents my safety buffer derived by imputing a 10% EPS 5 year CAGR instead of 17% (my fair value estimated growth rate). The difficulty however is in getting the right price for the option as it is not liquid. I would also be writing a one year option with cost of funds charged through my brokerage. Hence depending on margin available and holding costs, my returns would be quite different from other investors. Assuming a 10% margin requirement ($2500), the $10.50 option premium received amounts to $1050, and the gross return is 42%. This is leveraged however. If you are ready to set aside the required funds of $25,000, this return drops to 4.2% over the holding period.While options are unconventional investing tools and risky to some, it may be a viable way to go long on a growth stock like Adobe Inc."

Adobe Inc. (ADBE) is it. Adobe is the flagship for digital transformation, riding the wave from its beginning. Several years ago, with products and revenues stagnating, Adobe reinvented itself in the cloud with a SaaS business model. The initiative paid off and the stock is now hitting record highs. Not only did Adobe transform its own business but has become a leader as a digital transformation enabler providing software and services so that other companies can successfully transform and thrive in the new environment.(Source: Adobe Investor Handout April 2019)Not only does Adobe have excellent financials but also has a reasonable stock valuation and is positioned to capitalize on the Digital Experience industry which has an estimated Total Addressable Market (TAM) of $71.2 billion in 2021. For these reasons, I give Adobe a Buy rating.(Source: Adobe Investor Handout April 2019)Adobe operates in three market segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience and Publishing.Digital Media generates 70% of total revenues generated from subscriptions to well-known products such as Photoshop, illustrator and Adobe XD.Digital Experience commands 27% of the total revenues generated from subscriptions from the company’s product Experience Cloud.The third market segment is Publishing with 3% of total revenues. This segment offers products and professional services such as document publishing, web application development, and high-end printing.Digital Media revenues grew at 22% YoY and it appears that future growth in this segment will be similar. According to company management, mobile is providing a tailwind with significant increases in mobile traffic and member sign-ups. Adobe Spark, a relatively new product, is rapidly gaining popularity with web and mobile traffic more than doubling YoY.While Digital Media is holding the fort, Digital Experience is where all the excitement is with 34% YoY revenue growth.For a long time, Customer Relationship Management (CRM) has been the tool for customer engagement but CRM has its issues:The social communication revolution has resulted in a shift in the balance of power from suppliers to customers. Business strategies implemented with ""control"" in mind are no longer needed. Businesses need to regroup around the shift in control from the seller to the buyer and the need to achieve sustainable competitive advantage.Enter Customer Experience Management (CXM), the new kid in town.Adobe is a leader in Digital Experience Platforms according to Gartner’s Magic Quadrant.(Source: Adobe Investor Handout April 2019)Adobe’s acquisitions of Magento and Marketo have filled out the Digital Experience portfolio and I look forward to seeing outsized future growth as these companies’ products become fully integrated within the Adobe Experience Cloud.(Source: Adobe Investor Handout April 2019)They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Below is a comparison of Adobe’s performance versus the software industry, courtesy of Simply Wall Street.(Source: SimplyWallStreet)Adobe trounces the rest of the software industry in ROE, ROA, and ROC.When it comes to high-growth companies, I generally focus on such things as revenue growth, free cash flow margin and the software company “Rule of 40”.Adobe had a great year with trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue growth of 24% along with a 5-year annual growth rate of 17%.(Source: Portfolio123.com)As with many SaaS companies, the historical financial trends are picture perfect. Note that Adobe got serious about its own digital transformation in 2013, which is where the dip in annual revenues occurred.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Adobe's free cash flow margin TTM has been positive for at least the last 10 years and currently stands at a phenomenal 38% of revenues on a trailing twelve-month basis.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Adobe has good control of SG&A expenses which have been falling steadily since the start of 2015 and now stand at about 56% of revenues, typical for a mature software company.(Source: Portfolio123.com)One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the ""Rule of 40."" It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA, and others use the free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as the figure is useful in a later part of my analysis.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the SaaS company has growth and cash flow in balance and is considered financially healthy. In Adobe’s case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 24% + 35% = 59%Since the calculation comes out at 59%, I conclude that Adobe is financially healthy.Revenue growth plus FCF margin is sometimes referred to as the ""Efficiency Score."" It has been determined that Efficiency Score has a greater than 70 percent correlation to a public SaaS company's revenue multiple, which is the valuation divided by revenue.In order to demonstrate this, I have plotted the EV/Sales multiple versus the Efficiency Score in MS Excel for 48 software stocks from my digital transformation stock list. A linear trendline is plotted through the scatter plot that represents the best-fit valuation multiple for a given Efficiency Score.(Source: Portfolio123.com/MS Excel)As can be seen from the above graph, Adobe sits below the best-fit line through the data points.The rest of this analysis is somewhat controversial. For me at least, it seems logical to assume higher valuation for higher-growth companies, and I use the best-fit line to gauge a company's valuation relative to the rest of the stocks in the custom universe. This is a relative valuation, not absolute as one would attempt to get using a DCF calculation.Based on the above chart, I conclude that Adobe's stock price is undervalued relative to the rest of the digital transformation stocks in my custom universe. Based on the valuation provided by Simply Wall Street, my own relative valuation calculation, growth, excellent FCF margin, and good SG&A expense, I assign a Buy rating for this stock.An investment in Adobe comes with several risks. For starters, the bull market is long in the tooth, and we could enter a bear market in the not-too-distant future based on a slowing economy or a resurgence in trade tensions between the USA and China.In addition, SaaS stocks are on a tear, and many of them are reaching all-time highs. Some analysts believe that we are in for a second ""dot-com"" crash due to lofty valuation.The market for CXM and digital experience platforms may not play out the way that Adobe expects, or competitors such as International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) may take market share from Adobe, leading to reduced growth and lower stock price.Adobe is a digital transformation enabler, providing transformation software for companies entering the new digital era. Adobe operates in three market segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience and Publishing. Digital Media is the current business and I expect that it will continue to grow at 20+% for several years. Digital Experience is the future of Adobe and is currently growing at approximately 34% per year. Publishing is an insignificant piece of Adobe's business and isn't discussed in this article.Adobe is a leader in CXM and Digital Experience, and given the company's extraordinary success in other market segments, I expect that the company will rapidly grow into the estimated $71.2 billion TAM.The company scores quite well on the Rule of 40. I believe that the company is fairly valued relative to other software stocks.This investment comes with significant risks, however. All digital transformation stocks have lofty values. At some point in time, these companies may come down to earth. There is also intense competition and the CXM market may not develop as expected.I believe that Adobe, with its more reasonable valuation and profitability, is a buying opportunity and investors should not miss out. Therefore, I assign a Buy rating to Adobe.Keep an eye out for my soon-to-be-launched Digital Transformation marketplace service!"
4286636,105304,2019-08-19T13:05:58-04:00,Adobe is a strong business.Adobe is trading near fair value and thus I present two trades to get long.The first trade involves buying trend-line support with a long call spread.The second trade involves buying support in the low 200s if we get a more significant pullback in the market and Adobe's stock.,"Adobe (ADBE) is a tremendous business. The company has been very successful at transforming their products into a subscription-based business model. The company has consistently delivered beats on earnings and is growing revenue at a solid 25% in the first two quarters of 2019. The company has a solid moat as customers will be reluctant to switch and learn unfamiliar competing products. Adobe is firing on all cylinders right now and showing no signs of slowing down.Adobe's stock price has been on fire for several years. The uptrend has been relentless with few opportunities for those who want to get in on pullbacks. Recently the stock has pulled back from highs of $313 into the $280s. I will present two ways to take advantage of this pullback in the options market given two different scenarios based on a combination of fundamental and technical analysis.Fair value of a stock is not some magical multiple, rather it is the present value of future cash flows. To come up with a number for fair value per share on Adobe, I plugged their numbers into my proprietary DCF excel spreadsheet. This fair value will help guide the trade in determining what a fair value might be to get long the stock. The analysis came up with a fair value of $284.33. Assumptions in my model include the following:1) A tax rate of 21%, a long-term growth rate and a risk-free rate of 2.00%, a beta of 1.56, and a market risk premium of 6%.2) Operating margin of 32% in year 1 (2019), increasing to 40% by year 10. As Adobe grows they should be able to maintain higher margins. I increased operating margins by 0.75% each year until year 10, where I increased it by 2.00% from year 9.3) Sales to capital ratio of 1.21 calculated by taking 2018 revenue and dividing by second quarter capital (book value of equity + book value of debt - cash and marketable securities). I maintained this ratio across all 10 years. I used this ratio to calculate the amount Adobe will have to reinvest in the business to sustain revenue growth. The amount left over is free cash flow.4) A weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC) of 8.20% calculated using an after-tax cost of debt of 3.24% and a cost of equity of 8.24%. Weighting was 99.29% equity and 0.71% debt.5) Revenue growth at 25% for the first four years. I then dropped it to 20% for the next two years, and 15% for two years after that. In year 9 I forecasted 10% growth, then used the long-term growth rate of 2% in year 10 and in perpetuity. These growth rates are more aggressive than most analysts, so bear in mind my final number may be higher than some analyst's price targets.The model calculated an intrinsic value per share of $284.33. Adobe closed at $287.45 on Friday, August 16. This leaves 1% downside from that closing price to intrinsic value according to my model, but is well within the range, let's say plus or minus 10%, of what one could reasonably call fair value. A 10% range gives the stock a fair value somewhere between $260 and $313. This helps provide a framework for the price we would expect Adobe's stock could trade inside over the life of the trade.Looking at a 3 year weekly candlestick chart of Adobe reveals three major technical takeaways:1) The stock has consistently been in an uptrend for years2) There is clear major support at $2073) The stock has held the short term trend line from the December lows.Source: ThinkorswimThis gives us two ways to play a trade on ADBE. The first possible trade is to buy the stock as close to the trendline as possible and wait for a move back to the highs at $310. The second is to wait for a break of the trendline and a move down to the low 200s where we get long. Let's look at how exactly we could put on these trades in more depth.I'm going to present an options trade here, as it is easy to limit downside risk in the case that it doesn't work out. As of the close on Friday, August 16, one could buy the 300/310 call spread expiring in October for a debit of $3.55 (assuming you could get filled at the mid-price). This leaves $6.45 of upside if ADBE is above 310 and $3.55 of downside if it is below $300 at expiration. The price closed well above the trendline Friday, thus I would prefer to get this spread closer to $3.00. This would result in a reward:risk ratio of more than 2:1. As for exiting this trade, I would use a stop loss on a weekly close below the trendline, and hold until the spread traded for at least $9.00 on the upside.Source: ThinkorswimScenario 2 is simple. Buy shares near support at $207. I would use $199 as a stop, or possibly hold some for the long term with no stop loss. This scenario is ideal, but much less likely than scenario 1. This is well below fair value and would take a pretty significant market sell-off to occur. It is essentially a dream scenario (assuming nothing changes about the fundamentals of the business). A target on this trade would be back near the highs in the $300s, with partial profit-taking along the way.If you're looking to get long Adobe, these two trades will do the trick. One more aggressive than the other. Adobe's business remains strong and the technical setup is there. This is a powerful combination that has the potential to result in some solid profits."
4272997,105257,2019-07-01T14:28:36-04:00,"Adobe is a great company that I no longer feel like buying.The company is occupied with its lower margin Digital Experience segment.Core Digital Media is decelerating, and this trend is likely to continue.Premium over peers may no longer be justified.","I was as bullish as any other investor who was lucky enough to have bought shares of Adobe Inc. (ADBE) a few years ago. However, I think now is the time to be rational as the company faces some significant risks in its Digital Media segment and is investing heavily in its lower margin Digital Experience segment. Also, I see shares as too expensive.Adobe Inc. is one of the largest software companies in the world. The company offers a line of products used by a wide variety of customers in various industries, in return, the company collects licensing and subscription fees, which form the bulk of its revenues. The company also offers technical support and education.The company operates through three segments:Adobe is a global company with a widely recognizable brand all over the world. As of Q2 2019, the company operates in America (58% of revenues), EMEA (27% of revenues), and APAC (15% of revenues).Over the last several years, Adobe was a top performer growing its revenues at a +20% per year and constantly improving its margins mainly due to the outstanding performance of its Digital Media segment (70% of revenues). However, I feel that now the focus is shifting away from Digital Media to Digital Experience which is a much smaller segment and operates on lower margins.There are several reasons that have led me to the conclusion that Adobe will focus more on its Digital Experience segment and less on Digital Media.1. The M&M Deal.On October 31, 2018, the company acquired Marketo just after it acquired Magento on June 18, 2018. Both acquisitions were integrated into Adobe's Experience Cloud. There are many articles on SA and other websites that highlight why was this a great M&A move from ADBE and all the synergies that those two will bring for the group and I agree with most of their reasoning. However, I want the company to be looking for deals to integrate into Digital Media, not the Digital Experience. Fully absorbing the two companies will take time and investments which will shift focus away from the main segment.2. Microsoft partnershipMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe have been ""flirting"" with each other for some time now and this year they finally decided to announce their deeper integration between their two platforms. Microsoft has been looking for ways to improve LinkedIn and to better understand its users and now they have finally found an opportunity to do so with Marketo. Integrating LinkedIn more closely with Marketo gives Adobe's Experience Cloud the opportunity to have a more complete picture of B2B customers.3. The resignation of the executive vice president of Digital ExperienceJust post the acquisitions on January 24, 2019, ADBE announced that the EVP of the group will be leaving the company which will without a doubt create some disruption risk in the segment and it will take time for the company to find a suitable replacement. This will again shift focus away from Digital Media.I believe now to be the worst possible time for the company to take its eyes off Digital Media.Throughout 2017-2018, Digital Media ARR (annual recurring revenues) growth has been for the most part flat at around 32-35%, but the last several quarters indicate a change in this trend. Digital Media ARR growth has been slowly declining up to 22.77% in 2018 and the trend will most likely take the growth to 20% or even lower in FY2019 and FY2020.Source: Quarterly reports, my own calculationsI believe that the growth will continue to go south as the benefits of the price increase on some of the Creative cloud products start to wear off throughout FY2019-FY2020 which will result in decreasing margins. This, in turn, will hit EPS. Just a reminder that Adobe raised prices in NA last year in Q2 and before that in February 2017 it increased its prices in EMEA in order to remain FX neutral. There was no negative impact on Digital Media ARR growth in 2017 and 2018 due to the price increases but now that two years have passed, it is normal to see positive effects wearing off.I am deeply concerned with the growth of Creative ARR which is part of the Digital Media ARR as growth has lost its momentum in FY 2019, and I feel like investors should keep a close eye on this metric.Source: Quarterly reports, my own calculationsAdobe's margins have already started to decline as of Q2 2018, and I believe there is much more ground to lose as the company is investing into the lower margin Digital Experience segment and the larger segment - Digital Media is cooling off.Source: gurufocus.comAt the same time, the company trades with premium when compared to peers like Oracle Corp. (ORCL), Salesforce.com Inc. (CRM), and Microsoft Inc.Source: Reuters.comThat premium is for now justified as Adobe has higher gross margin and lower debt than peers. However, future investments in Digital Experience and weaker performance of Digital Media should bring gross margin close to peers and the premium will no longer be justified.Source: Reuters.comIt's always hard to write a negative report about ADBE as the company has proven bears to be wrong time and time again. So, I need to do a good job highlighting the risks to my thesis.Risk number one: If Digital Experience proves to be an even better investment than Digital Media and is able to compensate for the growth, my thesis will be shattered. I don't feel like this is highly probable as this segment has been growing mainly by M&A and is much smaller than Digital Media.Risk number two: If Digital Media ARR growth starts accelerating again, my thesis will also be shattered. I don't feel like this is highly probable outcome as well, as in order for that to materialize at least one of two things has to happen - more price hikes or more investments in this segment.I don't expect to see more price hikes so soon as users were quite upset after the price hike in Creative Cloud. By doing more price increases so soon in America, the company risks increasing the volatility in its ARPU as people might cancel subscriptions. As far as investments go, I think that the focus will be on Digital Experience which will occupy the majority of future investments.Risk number three: Adobe may keep trading with a premium over peers. Since 2009, the stock has traded almost without any meaningful corrections, constantly beating expectations. Even now, its shares are trading at its 52 weeks high. Its revenues growth is high and the business is a strong cash flow generator. Also the company is a market leader with a strong brand. In other words, a hard to sell company.I recommend Adobe investors to reduce their exposure to Adobe in their portfolios (or at least not to add more) as I fear further Digital Media weakness and increased amount of investments into smaller sectors with lower margins like Digital Experience. Also, I fear that the high premium over peers may no longer be justified."

Their top line revenue growth came in 25% higher than the same comparable quarter last year, and their earnings growth was 10% higher.Expectations for quarterly revenue were at $2.70 billion and the company actual numbers were $2.74 billion.Bottom-line earnings came in $0.05 higher than expectations.

It has a strong vision and is successfully executing against it. Nevertheless, it is close to impossible to make a compelling argument for why Adobe is undervalued.At its present nosebleed valuation, investors are better off to call it a day here, rather than to try to time its top.Highlighted below are Adobe's two main segments. Adobe also has a third segment called Publishing, which is smaller and not a meaningful game-changer to the overall story, and, as such, is not discussed here.Adobe's Digital Media holds household names such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and its Acrobat family of products. This segment is the bigger of its two segments and is growing at more than 20% year over year.On the other hand, Adobe's Digital Experience, while, smaller in size, is growing at a much faster pace at close to mid-30% year over year. Having said that, we should note that Adobe's Digital Experience aggressive revenue growth rate is not entirely organic.In fact, this segment is able to boast of its strong top-line growth in part because of its two recently made acquisitions. Marketo, a marketing cloud platform company, was acquired for $4.7 billion. And Magento, a commerce platform, was acquired for $1.6 billion.Putting aside the fact that I have been bearish on Adobe's stock for some time, I must concede, that Adobe has done terrifically well with growing its top line at a very steady plus 20% CAGR.Source: author's calculations, SEC filingsWhen its Q3 2019 guidance was first announced, at first, some investors questioned its weak outlooks. But subsequently, on the back of an overly enthusiastic earnings call, investors appeared all too happy to throw caution to the wind.Even if we take into account Adobe's steady and predictable top-line performance, there is no question that all of the company's multiples are overextended.Source: author's calculations, morningstar.comThe table above makes one thing clear, that investors' positive sentiment towards any sort of company describing itself as a high growth software platform with a vision to improve enterprises' workloads are being valued at extremely high multiples.As such, given that Adobe is asset-light, it consequently should trade at a high multiple to revenues. But when we interpret Adobe's cash flows, readers should note that Adobe's cash flows from operations do not account for management's expensive stock-based compensation packages.Incidentally, it worth bearing in mind that even though Adobe continues to aggressively buy back its shares, having repurchased approximately $2.8 billion worth of shares during its trailing twelve months. This sum is close to 100% of its total free cash flow during the same period. Thus, when all was said and done, Adobe only managed to buy back approximately 1% of its total number of shares outstanding during its trailing twelve months.Ultimately, it is close to impossible to invest alongside the crowd and do better than average. For investors to beat the market, they need to seek out investment opportunities that are not trading at elevated multiples relative to historical valuations.These are stocks where there is some sort of discount to fair value. It is not good enough to argue for a buy and hold-for-ever strategy, because this sort of investment strategy typically works meaningfully better in theory than in practice.Unquestionably, Adobe has had a very strong runway over the past several years. Also, unlike many of its peers, Adobe's rapid growth has actually brought with it strong cash flows.But everyone is able to look back and state that. What matters now, is going forward, what possible aspect have investors not already priced in? What kind of edge do shareholders presently hold that others are not considering?In conclusion, I contend that shareholders are not likely to benefit from its present valuation and that this stock is best avoided.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive emails of my latest research, please click ""Follow"" at the top of this article."

Revenue expectations are set at $2.7 billion, matching management's guidance. Meanwhile, estimated non-GAAP EPS of $1.78, if reached, would top the outlook by a penny. Credit: AdobeI expect the quarter to be marked by a solid bump in revenues, particularly in Digital Experience (29% of sales last quarter), driven in large part by inorganic growth. The one-year anniversary of the Magento and Marketo acquisitions will not be until June and October 2019, respectively. Therefore, I estimate that the new e-commerce and B2B marketing businesses will likely drive about six to seven percentage points of top-line growth in the period.However, I also expect Digital Media to post solid results, with revenues rising in the 20% to 21% range. Within this segment, Adobe has been pushing for growth inorganically, including through the most recent purchase of French 3D gaming and entertainment graphics platform Allegorithmic in January. Most important, in my view, are the market-wide opportunities in the creative business that have yet to be fully captured - see company's estimate of addressable market below.Source: Adobe's Investor presentationThe trends in media content creation and sharing, social media marketing, migration to cloud and increased adoption of mobile platforms all play in favor of Adobe growing Creative Cloud at a double-digit pace for many quarters to come, in my opinion. Securing those revenues in place over the longer term and helping to smooth out quarter-to-quarter performance is the company's revenue model, primarily recurring and subscription-based in nature.Below is what Adobe's fiscal 2Q19 P&L might look like, based on the guidance provided. I will be particularly interested in checking the company's margins, which are expected to suffer in the first half of the year due to M&A-related purchase accounting effects. But as Adobe continues to gain scale and fully integrate the three acquisitions made in the past 12 months, I expect profitability to start shifting higher by next quarter.Source: DM Martins Research estimateADBE represents a fairly large chunk of my All-Equities SRG portfolio, nearly one-tenth of the total. I like the stock for a number of reasons, including (1) the favorable macro-level trends mentioned above, (2) the already-high margins that should improve over time with gains of scale, (3) the predictability of the revenue stream and (4) the robustness of a balance sheet that has minimal levels of net debt, despite all the recent M&A activity.Data by YChartsI do not expect the results of fiscal 2Q19 to have much of an impact on my investment thesis, and maybe not even on share price. Given the stability of Adobe's business model and the full-year guidance update provided as recently as March, I believe meaningful surprises (whether positive or negative) are unlikely to be delivered this week.So on Tuesday, I will be looking to ""check the boxes"" that I believe will reaffirm my bullishness towards this name. Any potential share price weakness might represent an opportunity to accumulate shares at a lower earnings multiple, which has risen seven turns since the late December trough of about 28x."

Having successfully executed a transition of its desktop products into a fully cloud-subscription enabled suite of creative tools, Adobe continues to grow its top line at a ~20% y/y pace each quarter despite topping a $10 billion annual revenue scale. Unsurprisingly, shares shot up 5% after Adobe's strong Q2 print, sending the stock to new year-to-date highs:As I wrote last quarter, I believe Adobe to be one of the best-positioned stocks for a long-term rally, and investors should continue holding on to the stock for long-term gains. Over the past three years, for example, Adobe has outperformed the S&P 500 by 160%, and the gap continues to grow wider and wider over time:Adobe's strong Q2 results give us no reasons to change the bullish thesis on this stock; and while Adobe's valuation at ~37x forward P/E appears expensive, we note that Adobe has consistently managed to maintain its above-market premium, justifying it through both strong top-line growth and bottom-line expansion. It's also worth noting that investors cheered Adobe's Q2 results in spite of a weaker-than-expected Q3 outlook:Figure 1. Adobe Q3 guidance updateSource: Adobe 2Q19 earnings releaseWall Street had hoped for $2.83 billion in revenues and $2.05 in EPS; instead, Adobe pointed to $2.80 billion and $1.95, respectively, as shown in the chart above.

Though both figures were below consensus at the time, Adobe actually came in well ahead of both its own guidance and the original consensus Q2 estimates. The bottom line on Adobe: this is a company that has consistently managed expectations over multiple quarters, and its stock has seen a smooth upward sailing as a result. Adobe is driving growth in multiple product categories, allowing the company to maintain its furious pace of revenue growth despite its substantial scale. Continue to stay long here, even as the company crosses into new all-time high territory.Let's dive deeper into Adobe's second-quarter results:Figure 2. Adobe 2Q19 resultsSource: Adobe 2Q19 earnings releaseRevenues grew 25% y/y to $2.74 billion, surpassing Wall Street's expectations (and Adobe's own guidance) of $2.70 billion, or +23% y/y. Note also that Adobe kept pace with Q1's growth rate of 25% y/y, which had accelerated two points over Q4's growth rate. It's worth noting as well that Adobe's growth rate is keeping pace with Salesforce's (NYSE:CRM) 24% y/y growth rate in its most recent quarter, a good compare as the two cloud titans have a similar >$10 billion annualized revenue run rate.Adobe has pointed to multiple products as growth drivers for the quarter. Of particular note is Adobe Spark, which is a tool that helps users quickly create graphics and short videos for social media. Here's some additional commentary from CEO Shantanu Narayen on Spark strength in the quarter from his prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call:Adobe's Creative Cloud is also getting a boost from Adobe Stock, which is Adobe's service for stock images and videos, growing at ""greater than 25% y/y"". Also of note is the fact that Document Cloud is well on its way to notching $1 billion in ARR; hitting $921 million ARR this quarter and $296.2 million in revenue, up 22% y/y. We note here that Adobe's Document Cloud ARR is on par with Docusign's FY20 revenue guidance. Though Docusign has recently announced sales execution issues and an elongation of deal cycles, causing its stock to pull back sharply over the past several weeks, Adobe has made no mention of any slowdown in momentum for either Document Cloud or Adobe Sign.On the marketing side, Adobe has made use of its recent Magento acquisition to ink a new partnership with Amazon. Under this new partnership, Adobe customers can now use Magento Commerce to manage their online storefronts. Similarly, Adobe has also struck a new partnership with LinkedIn (MSFT), with a focus on targeting B2B marketing teams. The key takeaway here: Adobe has its fingers in many different cookie jars, and many of its diversified bets are beginning to pay off. Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Acrobat have been around for a long time, but even as these mature products hit saturation points, Adobe has many faster-growing services that help the company to keep up its mid-20s growth rate. As a refresher, the chart below shows all the different product categories within Adobe's diverse suite:Figure 3. Adobe product lineupSource: Adobe Q2 investor datasheetIn this regard, Adobe is incredibly similar to Salesforce - though Sales Cloud has slowed down to 11% y/y growth, Salesforce's other cloud categories as well as recent acquisitions like MuleSoft and, more recently, Tableau (NYSE:DATA) are helping to keep growth rates afloat. But unlike Salesforce, Adobe is also generating tremendous EPS growth. Pro forma EPS this quarter grew 10% y/y to $1.83, beating Wall Street's estimates of $1.78 with 3% upside. Adobe also managed to grow operating cash flows by 14% y/y to $1.11 billion:Figure 4. Adobe cash flowsSource: Adobe 2Q19 earnings releaseAdobe has shown no signs of slowing momentum, and its multi-quarter trend of reliably beating estimates gives the stock ample justification for its premium valuation. I view Adobe as a more-profitable version of Salesforce: a multi-product growth story that never fails to impress during earnings and has retained a mid-20s growth rate despite being one of the largest cloud players in the software industry. Stay long here to continue benefiting from Adobe's consistent above-market performance."

Adobe’s current stock price of $278.29 is notably higher than ADBE’s January 29 trading price of $238.27. ADBE touts a 20.32% YTD return, but I think this highly-valued stock still has more upside potential. Going forward, the Sensei artificial intelligence (AI) platform can fortify Adobe’s pseudo-monopoly on design/content creation software. Sensei can enhance Adobe’s $5.343 billion annual recurring revenue from Creative Cloud. A stronger Creative Cloud revenue stream can help ADBE finish 2019 with a YTD return much higher than 20.32%. (Source: Seeking Alpha)A persistent pseudo-monopoly on multimedia design software can support ADBE’s high valuation ratios of 49.69x TTM P/E, 13.95x P/S, and 13.47x P/B. Adobe’s stock price can shoot up if it can keep improving its $1.495 billion/quarter revenue from Creative Cloud.(Source: Adobe)Based on the chart above, Creative Cloud is contributing 59% of Adobe’s annual revenue. Adobe infusing artificial intelligence features in Creative Cloud software products was judicious. The time-saving features of Adobe Sensei can help increase the estimated 15 million paid subscribers of Creative Cloud.(Source: Adobe)Time is money in the creative industry. Adobe’s future long-term prosperity is excellent. Adobe Sensei is accelerating the workflow of content creators and designers. The faster they finish their projects, the more money for creative professionals. Content creators and designers who make good income will remain long-term paying customers of Adobe.Retaining and growing the 15 million paying customers of Creative Cloud ensures Adobe remains the no. 3 leader in the $20 billion/quarter enterprise SaaS business.Artificial intelligence or generative designing made Creative Cloud more sellable. Even non-artistic individuals will find it comfortable to use complex software programs like Photoshop, After Effects, and Illustrator.We can guesstimate that attracting 3 million more (AI-assisted or AI-inspired) subscribers can add an extra $1.1 billion to Creative Cloud’s ARR (annual recurring revenue). Adobe’s FY 2018 revenue was $9.03 billion.Going forward, we can infer that Sensei + Creative Cloud has the potential to boost Adobe’s annual revenue by 12% ($1.1 billion divided by $9.03 billion). For the past 10 years, Adobe’s average sales growth rate is less than 11%. Adobe Sensei is very important because it can help ADBE maintain its 10-year sales growth performance.(Source: stockrow.com)The universal desire to earn more money through faster means justified the launch of the Sensei AI platform. My fearless assessment is that generative or AI-assisted design/content creation is becoming mainstream. Sensei AI-enabled Creative Cloud is just riding what is now fashionable. Autodesk’s (ADSK) very popular Fusion 360 also offers generative CAD/CAM design workflow. Another popular CAD/CAM software, Rhino, does generative designs. Open-source 3D software Blender offers generative content creation.We subscribe to the $9.99/month Photoshop CC/Lightroom Classic Photography package. I love the Sensei AI-enabled Photoshop features like the Content-Aware Fill and Select Subject. These AI-assisted capabilities help us avoid the tedious task of replacing unwanted background/elements. I dislike tiresome 3D modeling and visualization. However, the machine learning features of the $19.99/month Adobe Dimension CC product is tempting me.The point is that Sensei AI enhancements are compelling customers like me to subscribe to other Creative Cloud products even though we lack the skills or the ready market for them.Adobe Sensei’s generative usefulness is greatly illustrated by Adobe Spark. The AI-assisted way to generate layouts and color themes based on a chosen online template made Adobe Spark a must-have for graphic artists. No other online templates-driven, do-it-yourself or DIY graphic design websites can match the Sensei-powered usefulness of Adobe Spark. DIY commercial graphic design sites like Canva, Snappa, PicMonkey, and Easil do not have the AI graphic design IQ of Adobe Spark.Deadline-pressured content creators/artists need Adobe Spark to rapidly produce designs with different AI-generated layouts.(Source: Adobe)The quick way to generate/pick color themes on designs is a highly desirable feature of Adobe Spark.(Source: Adobe)There’s no point paying $12.95/month for Canva’s pro plan when I can get Adobe Spark for free with the $9.99/month Photoshop CC subscription. My fearless forecast is that the Sensei AI-infused Adobe Spark will eventually kill unicorn companies like Canva and Easil. Adobe Spark makes Canva's billion-dollar valuation a dangerous mirage.Raise your bets on Adobe. Do not be scared of ADBE’s elevated TTM P/E ratio of 59.69x. ADBE’s historical P/E valuations used to be as high as 150x. Adobe's past 10-year sales growth rate of almost 11% will persist because there's almost-zero competition for Creative Cloud.(Source: MacroTrends)The growing $980 billion/year printing industry and the massive $1.838 trillion/year global apparel business are boosting the need for more users of Adobe Creative Cloud software products. More designers are needed because there’s a rising demand for more printed packaging, advertising, clothing, content creation, and product prototyping/manufacturing.I do not see any serious downside to Creative Cloud. Adobe's current rivals Corel Corporation, Serif Software, and Magix are too small to match the AI-infused capabilities of Adobe Creative Cloud. I do not think Corel has the financial capability to build a cloud-based AI platform that can match Adobe Sensei’s scope. Nvidia (NVDA) AI chips powers Adobe Sensei. It takes thousands of pricey deep-learning/machine-learning Nvidia Tesla P100 or V100 processors to service the 15-million strong Creative Cloud ecosystem.(Source: Brett Newman/Microway, Inc.)Software giants like Microsoft (MSFT) and Autodesk have given up. Those two heavyweights could have disrupted Adobe's pseudo-monopoly on creative/design software years ago, but they never made any serious effort.

4253404,101459,2019-04-08T16:51:27-04:00,"Adobe boasts a strong fundamental business model, as well as an excellent management team.The Digital Experiences segment of the business continues to grow.Marketo and Magento acquisitions present strong growth opportunities.Partnerships with companies like Microsoft, SAP, and Drift have created long-term revenue possibilities.","Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a computer software company, focused primarily on digital media, digital experiences, and publishing. It derives revenue primarily through subscriptions, which are licensed to various OEMs.As of 4/5/2019, the company is trading at $267.45 with a market capitalization of $130.50 billion. It has a 52-week range of 204.95-277.61 and EPS of roughly $1.36. Adobe has performed quite well over the past 12 months, up over 40% and recently returning to highs last seen in October.Given this strong performance, many analysts have expressed concerns that it may have reached its short to medium-term peak. Though there are some points of concern to monitor, this stock is still an excellent play for the remainder of 2019. The company is about as susceptible to large price fluctuations as the S&P 500, exemplified with beta of 1.03. Its growth has come on the back of a strong, sustainable business model with a strong history of success over the past decade. Here, I will outline reasons for Adobe's growth during the past 12 months, my investment thesis for the remainder of 2019, and what investors can expect.Adobe's plan for success throughout 2018 relied on a continued dual strategy of growth in Digital Media and Digital Experiences. The Digital Media segment of the business encompasses the value associated with the Creative Cloud and Document Cloud services. Adobe's ability to expand the reach of these services has had a material impact on revenue growth. As noted in the most recent 10-K, recent promotions and a shift towards user agreements like Enterprise Term License Agreements ((ETLAs)) has shifted the way businesses and users interact with their services. Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR), an internal performance metric measuring its digital media segment, has shown tremendous growth from $4.77 billion in 2017 to $6.03 billion in 2018. This momentum has come from strength in both the Creative Cloud, which showed Y-Y revenue growth of 28%, and the Document Cloud, which showed similarly strong Y-Y revenue growth of 17%.This growth was not an anomaly, as investors saw it continue into 2019. Q1 Earnings released last month outlined creative revenue of $1.49 billion, an increase of 22% from the previous year. Its traditional product line (which includes software like Photoshop and After Effects) exhibited user growth, as did its photography business, with mobile user growth of its Lightroom CC exceeding 400%. The company's ability to successfully grow and maintain its user base should instill a sense of confidence in investors.In addition to its Digital Media business, the Digital Experiences segment also showed growth. This portion of the business is notable for its focus on analytics, optimization, and audience management. Y-Y growth from 2017 to 2018 was 20%, and continued into Q1 representing additional growth of 34%.(Source: Adobe Investor Relations)The recent history of Adobe tells the story of an innovative company; one focused on the development of new ideas, user acquisition, and a strong fundamental business. These core objectives are what has ensured its success in recent years, and why in Q1 it posted EPS of $1.71, compared to analyst expectations of $1.62. The financial status of the company is strong, as is the current business environment.As was just noted, the growth of Adobe's Digital Experiences revenue should generate optimism among investors. The segment's portion of total revenue grew from 27% to 29% and is expected to constitute an even larger portion in future quarters, in part, due to the acquisition of Magento and Marketo. Both of these acquisitions serve to bolster the Digital Experiences segment.Magento, a prominent commerce platform, was acquired in 2018 for $1.68 billion with the purpose of facilitating B2B and B2C experiences. This vision finally materialized with the launch of the Adobe Commerce Cloud a few weeks ago. Commerce Cloud will allow businesses to utilize the existing Adobe analytics cloud to optimize the commerce experience for businesses and consumers. To those familiar with Magento pre-acquisition, the platform will seem quite similar. Essentially, businesses will be able to operate online stores and utilize Adobe's complex system tools to attract and maintain new customers. Users will be able to maintain a full analytics dashboard that can keep track of key business metrics. The Power of Marketo, acquired for $4.75 billion in 2018 as well, will allow companies to utilize the predictive analytics system to make cost-effective business decisions. This will be an extremely powerful platform. In just 2018, Magento was responsible for $155 billion in gross merchandise volume. This platform appears to have been incorporated within the broader ecosystem quite well, and investors can expect it to be a notable driver of growth.The developments in the Digital Experiences segment represent both an opportunity for growth as well as a signal that Adobe is taking pressure from competitors seriously. Notable rivals like Salesforce have already integrated platforms that offers similar capabilities, and it's only a matter of time until more and more industry rivals begin adopting similar systems. Given the competition in this space, and the sizable M&A activity already undertaken by Adobe, they had extreme pressure to introduce a platform like the Commerce Cloud; and by all appearances, they delivered.(Source: Adobe Investor Relations)Adobe's ability to forge partnerships with prominent industry players also bodes well for it's short to mid-term future. Integrated efforts like the Open Data Initiative, a data heavy alliance between Microsoft, SAP, and Adobe signals the demand for investment in consolidated efforts to streamline data sharing between these companies and their respective customers. This has positive implications for both customers and the larger companies. The Data Initiative, which was launched last year, is in the process of expanding even more. At the Adobe Summit last month, the companies discussed the implementation of a Partner Advisory Council, made up of prominent leaders like Accenture, EY, and WPP, who will help join their effort to make the sharing of data easier and more efficient.Adobe, alongside marketing platform Drift, also announced the creation of a service called Conversational ABM within their Marketo Engage service. This will help B2B marketers have personalized one-on-one interactions with strategic accounts at any point in a consumer's buying process. The motivation for this service is also the underlying motivation for most of Adobe's current business initiatives: ease and usability. Barriers to communication between customers and marketers often impacts revenue, so removing those barriers through the use of services like Conversational ABM will allow businesses to leverage Adobe's superior technology to grow sales.Lastly, investors also learned that Adobe and Microsoft will be strengthening their existing partnership. LinkedIn, the business social platform owned by Microsoft, will share data with Marketo Engage and the Adobe Experience Cloud to better understand existing consumers. Microsoft and Adobe already have a strong relationship, and learning that this will be bolstered in the coming year is great news for investors.This is all great, but what does it mean for Adobe's stock price? A quantitative look provides an attractive outlook for the remainder of the year. FY Guidance provided by Adobe suggests that year end revenue will be $11.15 billion, up 23% from 2018, with EPS of $7.75. Maintaining this level of revenue growth, though perhaps slowing to 20% in 2020 and 2021, is a reasonable expectation given its already strong consistent growth pattern and guidance estimates.(Source: YCharts)It's true that much of this is predicated on the idea that Adobe's growth in this space isn't slowed or threatened by competitors like Salesforce or Google. But given recent developments by Adobe that we've already discussed, it's clear the company is increasingly taking efforts to combat this competition. In addition to this, shares were trading at 25x 2020 FCF as of last quarter. Though that is certainly high, given the current state of the business and current growth projections, it's possible we could see this climb to 26-27x by next year. If this does indeed happen, investors could likely see a price exceeding $300 in 2020.Adobe has been a consistently strong company for several decades. The fundamental business model is strong, and it has consistently shown itself willing to foster relationships with would-be rivals, as well as follow larger industry trends. With few exceptions, it has met or exceeded analyst expectations, and continues to grow the core parts of its business. There are certainly a few things to watch for over the next several months. To reiterate, these include:There has no doubt been significant growth over the past 12 months, but if the current business environment holds, and Adobe management continues to make smart strategic decisions, then the company has potential to reach $300/share by April 2020."

Magento’s new partnership with Amazon is another tailwind.Amazon’s leadership in global retail e-commerce can help Adobe improve Magento's competitiveness against Shopify.Magento’s e-commerce platform is mobile-ready. For this year, estimated global mobile commerce sales will reach more than $690 billion.Providing e-commerce solutions completes Adobe's ecosystem as a one-stop shop for product design, content creation, marketing, and web/mobile commerce.","I initially went long on Adobe (ADBE) because I like its invidious status as a pseudo-monopoly on design/content creation software products. I keep raising my bet on ADBE because this company is using Sensei Artificial Intelligence to accelerate its Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud services.Adobe’s future high-grade profitability is now even better. Last year’s $1.68 billion purchase of Magento gave Adobe a solid footprint in the growing $2.84 trillion retail e-commerce industry. Magento is the core of Adobe’s new Commerce Cloud business segment.(Source: Statista)Adobe's purchase of Magento completed its ability to offer almost all services required by a small or large company which requires software to design/engineer a product, the software/platform to market or advertise the product, and the web/mobile presence to directly sell the product.The integration of Magento/Commerce Cloud with the Adobe Sensei AI-assisted Adobe Experience Cloud platform can help Adobe replace Shopify as the no. 2 global e-commerce platform. Commerce Cloud is much more useful to online store owners because it can offer Sensei AI-assisted analytics/business intelligence, product search, product inventory/logistics, customer retention/engagement, omnichannel marketing/advertising, and document management.Adobe can also leverage its no. 3 position in Enterprise Software-as-a-Service [SaaS] to boost Magento's enterprise adoption. Bundling e-commerce solutions with content creation, document management, and omni-channel marketing services/solutions is good for customers.More often than not, getting all your required tools/platforms/software products from a single source can lead to savings. A company can save money from discounts from buying wholesale-rate or bundled-rate products. There’s also more reliable integration if an e-commerce site uses a seamless or unified API (Application Program Interface) and SDK (Software Development Kit).Common sense says it is not easy to maintain an e-commerce site that uses different solutions providers for customer tracking, data extraction, inventory, marketing and promotions, shopping cart, product search, customer re-targeting, etc…Going forward, more customers might adopt Magento under the unified Experience Cloud branding. As of today, less than 233k Magento websites remains active. This number is way below Shopify’s (SHOP) 910k live or active websites.(Source: builtwith.com)Magento’s new collaboration with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) can help Adobe grow faster as an e-commerce solutions provider. Prior to the May 2018 takeover of Adobe, Magento’s e-commerce platform/solutions was used to sell online goods worth $155 billion Gross Merchandise Volume [GMV].Thanks to Amazon’s global leadership in direct-to-consumer online retail, I predict that Magento software solutions can be used to process online sales worth $200 or $250 billion GMV this year.The partnership with Amazon can help Magento outpace the growth of Shopify. Magento was perceived as the third-biggest e-commerce platform in the world, with estimated 13% global market share in 2018.(Source: Cloudways.com)Like Shopify, Magento can benefit from the much bigger total addressable market on Amazon. Shopify has been integrated with Amazon MarketPlace since 2017. No doubt, Amazon is partly why Shopify became the no. 2 e-commerce platform last year, dethroning 2017’s no. 2 Magento.Microsoft’s (MSFT) Azure is Adobe’s preferred partner in cloud hosting/computing and data sharing. However, Adobe needed Amazon’s help to accelerate adoption of Magento e-commerce solutions. Amazon, not Microsoft, is the king of e-commerce.Amazon can provide a global logistics network for Magento customers. Adobe hopes that by solving the logistics requirement, more customers will adopt Magento products.In return, Amazon will earn money from hosting Magento-branded stores, order fulfillment, and payments processing. This symbiotic relationship between Adobe and Amazon is a good reason to buy more Adobe. There's more than 5 million sellers on Amazon MarketPlace. Some of those could become future customers of Magento/Adobe Commerce Cloud.Even without web hosting included, Magento offers more expensive plans than Shopify. Magento is geared toward customers with higher budgets for e-commerce sites. This is in-line with Adobe’s historical high-margins performance.ADBE trades at high valuation due to its excellent business margins. Adobe’s TTM net income margin is 28.08%, more than 10x higher than its sector peers’ median margin of 2.24%. Adobe’s efficiency is why it trades at 14.34x TTM Price/Sales, and 51.92x TTM GAAP P/E.(Source: Seeking Alpha)Relative to its peers in the Information Technology Sector, Adobe has a great overall A+ profitability grade from Seeking Alpha. Aside from its much higher margins, Adobe consistently grew its net income margins and operating income for the fast five years.Adobe's TTM net income margin was only 6.92%. As of March 1, 2019, Adobe touts a TTM net income margin of 28.02%. Since November 2013, ADBE has consistently achieved annual growth in its NOPAT (net operating profit after tax). From a NOPAT of $546 million in November 2013, Adobe's November 2018's NOPAT grew to $2.71 billion.(Source: Stock-analysis-on-net.com)By diversifying to e-commerce, Adobe can offset future low or zero-growth scenarios from the eventual slowdown of Creative Cloud. Creative Cloud’s annual recurring revenue is $5.34 billion. There are now over 15 million Creative Cloud subscribers. However, there will come a day when Creative Cloud subscriber count will plateau at around 20 to 22 million (my guesstimate) subscribers. Unless Adobe starts raising its Creative Cloud pricing, 2 to 3 years from now Creative Cloud revenue will peak/stagnate at around $8 billion/year.The world cannot afford to sustain an infinite number of Creative Cloud-centric designers & content creators. On the other hand, there’s no limit on how much people can spend during online shopping. By providing Magento software solutions to online vendors, Adobe avoids a stagnant future.My optimism over Magento’s importance is due to its mobile first approach to online shopping. Magento is already PWA-ready. PWA or Progressive Web Apps is the emerging standard to make websites run/perform like native applications on mobile devices.(Source: Magento.com)PWA means people do not need to download large-size Android/iOS apps to do mobile shopping. PWA also benefits online store owners/operators – they don’t need to keep creating/maintaining/updating separate web and mobile storefronts. Going forward, Magento customers can just operate a PWA website and it can serve desktop and mobile online shoppers.Being mobile devices-friendly is an important tailwind for Magento. Mobile shopping is the future of retail e-commerce. As per Statista’s estimate, mobile shopping will account for 72% of global online retail sales by 2021.(Source: Statista)Magento is appealing to online retailers who want to focus on the rise of mobile shopping (or m-commerce). Statista’s estimate for this year is that global consumer m-commerce revenue will reach $693.36 billion.(Source: Statista)Going forward, Amazon can help Magento contribute $150 million to $500 million to Adobe’s annual revenue. My guesstimate is reasonable. Adobe can bundle Magento along with Creative Cloud and Experience Cloud monthly/annual plans. Further, the new partnership with Amazon might be a signal that Magento can be affordable like Shopify.On the other hand, Adobe can also continue operating Magento as is – a pricey e-commerce solutions provider for those who can afford it. The cheap pricing approach is not a profitable business model for Shopify. Shopify remains a persistent money-loser in spite of its more than active 910k website customers.I rate ADBE as a buy. A well-diversified company like Adobe is a buy and hold forever investment. Adobe caters to video games developers, TV and movie producers, designers, content creators, ad agencies, offline and online marketers, and individual/enterprise online vendors.Its emergence as an e-commerce SaaS player gave Adobe a solid tailwind in case Creative Cloud’s wings starts getting tired. My long-term view is that future revenue from Magento can grow sufficient enough. Large enough that it can prevent Adobe from notably raising the current prices of Creative Cloud subscription prices.Based on its recent test of offering Photograph Plan at $19.99/month, I suspect Adobe is eager to rectify the mistake it made when it included the full Photoshop CC in the $9.99/month Photography package (along with Lightroom CC). Adobe could have immediately priced the said package six years ago at $14.99/month or $19.99/month.At $9.99/month, Photoshop CC is too cheap considering its many applications. I opine that Adobe also made the mistake of making Photoshop CC a great 2D/3D bitmap painting, vector drawing, and UI/UX design software tool. The many capabilities of Photoshop CC meant there’s very little need to rent the $19.99/month Illustrator CC product.On the other hand, the affordability of the $9.99 Photoshop/Lightroom package (and $49.99/month for all Creative Cloud software desktop/mobile programs) monthly plan helps fortify Adobe’s monopoly on design/content creation/document management software.I really appreciate the recent Magento and Amazon e-commerce partnership. It can help Adobe generate enough new revenue so it probably won’t have to raise Creative Cloud pricing.My fearless forecast is that Adobe notably raising prices of Creative Cloud (currently its biggest source of revenue) could compel customers to seek cheaper alternatives.Affordable subscription-only software from Adobe is why most people no longer needs pirated software or cheaper/free alternatives to Creative Cloud software programs."
4261734,104145,2019-05-08T21:22:58-04:00,"ADBE successfully transformed into a cloud and subscription-based SaaS company from a software company.The growth of ADBE is accompanied by grand vision, good execution, and smart acquisitions.The future growth is likely to be in the Digital Experience Cloud.","Corporations affect the way we think and behave slowly and unnoticeably, then become an indispensable part of our life. Adobe (ADBE) is a company of such nature. Founded in 1982 in San Jose, California, by John Warnock and Charles Geschke, ADBE affects people's life via its product offering, specifically Photoshop and PDF viewer (""Adobe Acrobat Reader""). In 2013, it transformed into a cloud-based SaaS company from a $43mn software company that solely offered point solution software back in 1987. Besides the hype around SaaS companies, ADBE is also attractive based on its own merits, specifically the continuous innovation, grand vision from the management, good execution, smart acquisitions, and the growth potential in its digital experience cloud. In this article, I want to introduce how ADBE successfully transformed from a license-based company to a subscription model by demonstrating its historical footprint, and show how a visionary management and good acquisition strategy could help with the business.ADBE has a leadership position in the industry as it is the de facto standard in content creation and portable document file. Photoshop made its first public appearance in 1988 as an add-on to a product called ""Illustrator"" that came out a year prior. This raster graphics editor allowed users to do graphics editing on an external resource rather building from the scratch. It also allowed users to display and save several file formats, and adjust color balance, hue and saturation.(Source: Evolution of Photoshop: 1988-2009)In 1993, ADBE created Acrobat, an application software that allowed users to view, create, print, and manage files in PDF format. By using a standard format, ADBE enabled users of different computers and systems to view documents at ease. In 1999, ADBE added some famous features to Acrobat 4.0, including password protection and digital signature.(Source: Macintosh Repository)Those two products are what ADBE is famous for until today, and represent a long history of continuous innovation, grand vision, and excellent execution. ADBE had nothing to do with graphics designing/editing in the very beginning - it actually started its journey into the unexplored landscape through a printing solution software called ""PostScript."" Released in 1984 as Adobe’s founding technology, PostScript played a key role in the Desktop Publishing Revolution. It allowed users to print from their personal computers to an external printer in high quality. Although this sounds like an absolute certainty today, it was almost impossible 30 years ago for users to print to an external source without purchasing a system with the device due to the lack of device-independent page description language (PDL). The appearance of PostScript solved the issue and impressed Steve Jobs very much: He urged Warnock and Geschke to adapt PostScript to be used as the language for driving laser printers. One year after, the Apple LaserWriter became the first printer to ship with PostScript, sparking the desktop publishing revolution in the mid-1980s.Later, the management expanded its product offerings to graphics-related software. As mentioned previously, it created a software called ""Illustrator"" in 1987 and sold it for $495 per copy, a significant discount compared to peers. Photoshop came out one year later as an add-on to Illustrator. It is noteworthy that back then, PostScript was still the revenue driver and subsidized those new applications. In 1989, 65% of the total revenue ($121mn) was from PostScript. However, the management thought one step ahead of the market. Warnock believed that ADBE would run out of gas if it was solely dependent on one product. Thus, he was willing to put different point solutions software into the market and test their profitability. In 1991, the vision became clearer: Warnock believed that ADBE shouldn't be a one-product company. Instead, it needs to expand into typeface, video editing, page layout, graphics design, etc. In the same year, a video editing tool called ""Premiere"" was born. In 1993, Acrobat was put on the market. By slowly complementing its product offering from 1982 to 1993, ADBE took an active part in desktop publishing revolution. From 1994 to 2006, ADBE further disrupted the landscape and became an important participant in the digital publishing revolution through bundle selling, a series of value-added acquisitions and a deeper penetration into the non-professional customer group. During this period, ADBE bundled all products in ""Adobe Creative Suite"" and became more mainstream, as customers have more exposure to its product offerings. Moreover, the acquisitions gave ADBE a bigger market share in consumer market as the products of the companies acquired had an already established consumer base. In 1994, it acquired Aldus (originally a partner of ADBE in 1985, with a key product called ""Pagemaker""). In 2005, ADBE acquired Macromedia and its flagship products that include Dreamweaver, an easier-to-use Photoshop competitor, and Flash, a video player. Besides incorporating the flagship products from the acquired companies, ADBE also expanded its customer base, namely the non-professional users, through offering simplified version of professional software. We can still see the strategy today: In 2009, ADBE acquired Omniture, a leading web analytics platform that aggregates marketing and advertising solutions, to open up a new category (Analytics) under its ""Digital Experience"" segment (refer to the picture below). In 2018, ADBE spent more than $6bn to acquire Marketo (under the Marketing Cloud) and Magento (under the Commerce Cloud) to build B2B marketing capabilities to match the existing B2C marketing functionality.(Source: Adobe Financial Analysts Meeting in October 2018)After the two publishing revolutions, ADBE embarked on a new journey of transformation. For the past two decades, ADBE was able to stay competitive as a license-based company. However, the industry landscape has been changing. Since early 2000s, companies started to sell software over the cloud on a subscription plan. The advantages of such model are obvious: more recurring and predictable revenue, more affordability to the customers, and more timely system updates vs. the previous 18-24 month update window. Furthermore, ADBE observed that although users had more creative demand, the business was flat so the company had to increase price to improve top-line growth. As a result of the changed landscape and the concern of sustainability, Shantanu Narayen, the new CEO back in 2007, demonstrated his vision on future expansion. In 2013, ADBE launched Creative Cloud, a set of applications and services from Adobe Systems that gives subscribers access to a collection of software used for graphic design, video editing, web development, photography, etc. It is a cloud-based, subscription-only model. Instead of paying $1,800 one-time licensing fee, users now pay $52.99 per month, or lower if they choose to subscribe to only 1 or 2 products. The transformation from a software company to a cloud-based SaaS company is time-consuming and costly but ADBE succeeded for several reasons:1) The management executes well: From John Warnock to Shantanu Narayen, the leadership always focuses on the big picture (e.g., thinking beyond PostScript back in 1988 and coming up with more products) and thinks one step or even two steps ahead of the market. The execution power can be seen from a series of acquisitions and innovation plans.2) ADBE expands naturally to broaden its TAM, thus creates more cross-selling opportunities: ADBE started as a 1-product software company yet expanded to an ecosystem with creative cloud, experience cloud, and publishing. The broadened TAM offers more demand from consumers, and the enlarged customer base guarantees cross-selling opportunities.3) Smart acquisitions bridge the gap on products and talents: ADBE is active with acquisitions. By acquiring Omniture in 2009, it added a new set of products and opened up a brand new business line. By acquiring Macromedia in 2005, it eliminated the threat on Photoshop from Dreamweaver, and added Flash into its product offering. Bruce Chizen, the CEO of ADBE from 2000 to 2007, who played a huge role in ADBE's transformation and the acquisition of Macromedia in 2005, came from the Aldus acquisition in 1994. ADBE didn't waste its ammunition on acquiring at all - it created bigger armory for future.From a business segment perspective, ADBE operates among 3 segments:The Digital Media (~70% of total revenue, includes Creative Cloud and Document Cloud), the Digital Experience Cloud (~27% of total revenue, includes marketing, analytics, advertising, and commerce), and Publishing (the printing-related business, ~3% of total revenue).(Source: ADBE's 2018 10K)Although the creative cloud counts for ~70% of total revenue, I do believe the future drivers will emerge from digital experience due to its huge TAM (refer to the chart below) and the recent acquisitions of Marketo and Magento. Again, the revenue from digital experience cloud only counts for 27% of the total revenue yet it has an addressable market of $71.2bn, counting for ~66% of the total addressable market of $108bn. Within the experience cloud, marketing and analytics present the biggest opportunities with the incremental TAM from Marketo and Magento. Magento could bring data on purchase behavior into the experience cloud and integrate with Adobe Experience Manager to unlock marketing functionality. This comes hand-in-hand with Marketo, a market-leading cloud platform for B2B marketing engagement. The recent partnership with ServiceNow's (NYSE:NOW) Now Platform would provide seamless digital workflows and personalized customer experiences across all touchpoints.(Source: Author's consolidation based on Adobe Financial Analysts Meeting in October 2018)ADBE never fails to deliver high growth. The 5-year CAGR from 2013 to 2018 on revenue is ~17%, and the CAGR on earnings is ~56%. Some people use P/E to value companies yet I personally prefer using P/S to value SaaS companies. The idea of using P/S ratio for company valuation was firstly introduced by Philip Fisher, and made famous by his son Kenneth Fisher in his book ""Super Stocks."" The P/S ratio can be applied to companies with seasonality or companies that haven't earned profit yet. It can also be used for spotting recovery situations. ADBE is a mature and revenue-generating company but 14% of its revenue goes to R&D and ~30% of revenue goes to marketing, given the nature of SaaS companies. As a result, P/S is still good to value ADBE given its fast growth, huge expense, uncertainty around the integration of acquisitions. Assuming the company keeps growing revenue at 24% and stabilizes in 2020, and buying back 1.5mn shares every year going forward, the P/S ratio suggests a valuation of $295 in 2019 and $328 in 2020 (refer the chart below for a simplified version of the valuation model).(Source: Author's estimates based on company data)To sum up, ADBE is a company of growth potential in its digital experience segment. The recent acquisitions of Marketo and Magento are pricey but given ADBE's history of good execution and the recent partnership with industry participants, it is fair to assume these two companies will drive the marketing cloud and the analytics cloud in the near future. ADBE shows a fairy-tale on how a license-based point-solution software company becomes a $9bn cloud and subscription-based SaaS company through thinking big, executing well, and acquiring the right targets. By penetrating deeper into the non-professional users via its innovative and expanding product offering, and its subscription model, ADBE has an established and sticky user base to build an ecosystem upon."
4248194,20715,2019-03-12T15:52:13-04:00,Adobe is set to announce fiscal first quarter earnings on Thursday after the closing bell.There has been a shift in sentiment over the last few months to a more bullish posture and that is a concern ahead of earnings.The company's fundamentals are really strong and it has seen earnings and sales grow at impressive rates in recent years.,"Software giant Adobe (ADBE) is set to announce earnings after the closing bell on Thursday and this report is for the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Analysts expect the company to earn $1.61 per share on revenue of $2.54 billion. The EPS estimate would represent earnings growth of 3.87% compared to the first quarter of 2018. The revenue estimate is 22.5% above last year's figure.The EPS estimate and expected growth rate is well below the rate the company has seen in recent years. The company has averaged earnings growth of 48% per year over the last three years. Adobe saw earnings grow by 45% in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.Adobe's sales have also grown at a solid rate in the recent past. The average annual growth rate has been 24% for the last three years and sales were up by 23% in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned above, sales are expected to increase by 22.5% in the first quarter.The management efficiency measurements for Adobe are really strong with a return on equity of 37.8% and a return on assets of 10.7%. The profit margin is at 39.6% and the operating margin is at 31.5%. All of these figures are well above average and this shows what a quality company Adobe is and how effective the management team has been.Adobe's stock has moved tremendously higher in the last few years and the fundamentals listed above show that the move is probably warranted. That being said, the stock has bounced back sharply from its December low and is now approximately 28% higher than it was then.From late 2016 through the high last September, the stock gained 177%. The stock was trading under $100 a share as late as November '16 and jumped all the way up to $277.61. The stock then fell down to $204.95 in December.The fall in the fourth quarter did move the overbought/oversold indicators from overbought territory to oversold territory, at least in the case of the weekly stochastics. The 10-week RSI moved from overbought territory down to a couple of readings down around 35 and the indicator hadn't been that low since February 2016.The stochastic readings moved from oversold territory to overbought territory in the last three months and they just made a bearish crossover which is a little bit of a concern. However, if we look at the stochastics from late '16 and throughout the rally, the indicators hardly moved out of overbought territory for almost two years. During that stretch, about the best timing of a better entry point an investor could get was a pullback to the 13-week moving average.Turning our attention to the sentiment indicators, analysts are pretty bullish on the stock and so are short sellers. There are 31 analysts following Adobe and 25 of them have the stock rated as a ""buy"" while the other six rate the stock as a ""hold"". I have expressed in the past that I expect to see between 65% and 75% of analysts ratings in the buy category for a stock with strong fundamentals. The percentage for Adobe is at 80% right now, so it is a little above average. What is concerning is there has been a pretty sizable shift in the last few months.Looking at the analysts' ratings on Yahoo Finance, we see that in December there were 29 analysts following Adobe with 19 ""buy"" ratings. That buy percentage was at 65%. Now we see six more ""buy"" ratings and four less ""hold"" ratings. It is unusual to see that big of a shift from analysts in such a short period.The short interest ratio is at 1.75 currently and it has also seen a shift to a more bullish stance. The ratio was at 2.31 in mid-February before the new reading came in for the end of February. The number of shares sold short dropped from 6.3 million shares to 4.6 million shares during the two-week period. I will say that there have only been a handful of occasions where the short interest ratio was above 2.0 in the past year.The put/call ratio is currently at 0.85 and that is a little high, but certainly not a sign of extreme pessimism. There are 86,012 puts open and 101,696 calls open at this time. Looking back at the December earnings report, the put/call ratio was at 0.98 and that reading was closer to a sign of pessimism. When I wrote about Adobe ahead of the earnings report in September, the put/call ratio was at 0.824.As a whole, the sentiment toward Adobe has shifted to a more bullish posture in recent months and that is a bit of a concern.With the fundamentals for Adobe being so strong, it is hard not to like the stock. The earnings growth, the sales growth, the management efficiency measurements… they are all well above average.The chart is a bit of a worry just because of the overbought reading from the stochastics, but as I expressed before, that didn't slow the stock down in 2017 and the first half of 2018.The sentiment is a concern ahead of the earnings report. Seeing such a big shift from analysts concerns me and seeing the drop in short interest is also a concern.All told, I am bullish on Adobe, but I wouldn't buy the stock ahead of the earnings report. There is a pattern to Adobe's stock price and its earnings reports. I talked about in the article back in September and the pattern played out again that time and again in December.This is what I said in September.It is hard to bet against a company like Adobe, so I wouldn't recommend a bearish play. However, I like the idea of waiting for 5-7 days after the earnings report and then look to go long the stock or buy some calls on it. That was the strategy I suggested back in September and that is what I would recommend again.When it comes to earnings, the sentiment indicators seem to matter more than the fundamentals. We see it time and time again where a company with strong fundamentals reports earnings that beat expectations and the company provides a solid outlook, but the stock falls because expectations were just too high. That is what I expect to happen with Adobe again this time around."
4248090,24823,2019-03-12T13:13:44-04:00,"Adobe has our weak Hold signal at 53 out of 100.Broadcom, our Hold signal is at 67.Ulta Beauty, our Hold signal is at 69.Oracle, our strong Hold signal is at 77.Dollar General, our weak Hold signal is at 58.","In my book, I encourage investors and traders to be proactive before earnings are announced, in order to be completely ready to act after earnings on Adobe (ADBE), for example. Here are our Buy/Hold/Sell signals for Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Ulta (NASDAQ:ULTA), Dollar General (NYSE:DG) and Adobe. Let’s drill down on the fundamentals to see if our computer signals are going to change after earnings. Which of these will pop or drop? Our signals are telling what the market expects, so we are looking for fundamentals that spell surprise. These stocks are reporting on Thursday.Our most important Buy/Hold/Sell signal is found in the SID column on this daily report we issue to subscribers before the market opens:I think this is the most interesting stock according to our proprietary signals. You can see that the grade is a very weak 53. Right next to the grade is a 20-day bar chart of the grade. See those red bars! They are Sell signals when our grade was 50 or lower. This signal is for the intermediate term and includes both fundamentals and technicals.You can see in the Fund column a +Buy signal and that is why ADBE is so interesting. Portfolio managers were buyers on balance and positive for the long term. Were they wrong and will they be selling after earnings? It has our short-term Buy signal in the Tech column. Despite these positive signals, our most important signal, the SID grade is flickering between a weak Hold signal and a Sell signal. (We only like stocks that are flickering between Hold and Buy Signals.)Over on the far right of the report is a red S for Sell under the SAR columns. This is the short-term Stop and Reverse (SAR) signal and is a technical signal. They started selling the stock on Monday and you can see the red S under M for Monday. Now go to our D:S column and you will see our Demand/Supply indicator is showing Supply. The 20-day bar chart for Demand/Supply shows the green bars of Demand dropping into red bars of Supply just when the SAR signal flashed a Sell signal. ADBE has selling before earnings.Now let's go to Finviz to check the chart and drill down on the fundamentals to see if our computer signals are right. We are also looking for any hints of a coming negative earnings report. The chart shows that it has recovered from a bad selloff. Price has moved positively above the 200-day moving average. (Portfolio managers do not like stocks with price below the 200-day, unless they are bottom fishing.) The 50-day moving average is attempting the golden cross by moving back above the 200-day. It will be bearish if price drops below the 200-day after earnings. I would be tempted to buy puts if that happens.Let's look at the fundamental metrics to see what the problems are. The trailing PE is near 46, ouch! But trailing PEs are not that important because price is based on the future, not the past. Look at the PEG, P/S, and P/FCF bearishly coded red because they indicate ADBE is overvalued. The forecasted PE does not look that overvalued, but earnings really have to be good. There is no room for the slightest hint of bad news. We can see why ADBE dropped with the market. Overvalued stocks go down worse than the market.An analyst downgraded it last month to market perform. No, we need upgrades, not downgrades on this stock. The consensus target of $290 needs to be going up, not down. Based on this target, it seems ADBE is fairly valued here and I don't expect a pop.The short ratio is not too high at around 1.8 days to cover. The shorts are not piling into this name. The analyst's recommendation level at 2.1 is not bad. It will be a surprise to portfolio managers, traders and analysts if the earnings are bad. If they are bad, I think price will drop to retest the recent bottom. If earnings are as expected, I don't think price will pop because price has already moved up strongly to get back to where it was. My guess is that the buyers are almost exhausted.Yahoo shows the analyst consensus is looking for $2.55 billion in revenues and $1.62 in earnings per share. However, the number to watch is the forecast for next quarter and those numbers are $2.72 billion and $1.88. In the last 90 days, earnings estimates have dropped from $1.88 to $1.62 for this quarter and that is bearish. However, it is already priced in and it makes it easier for ADBE to meet expectations. I think it eliminates any possibility of a positive surprise or a pop in ADBE price.Here is the weekly ADBE chart and price is starting to struggle as it reaches for the old high:ORCL looks OK on our signals, except our Implied Return signal is not a buy and implies that it is overvalued. The SAR signal turned from a S on Monday to a B for Buy on Thursday. Our Demand signal also shows buyers before earnings.At Finviz, the price chart shows a nice bounce back to where it was. The fundamental metrics look good. The forecasted PE is color coded green. The PEG is borderline acceptable. Debt ratio is color coded red. The short ratio is slightly high. The analysts' rating at 2.5 is acceptable. However, the consensus target is coded red because price is above the 12-month target and that explains why price dropped with the market. ORCL is no bargain at this price.Yahoo is showing consensus earnings at $0.84 this quarter and $1.05 next quarter and hardly any change in the last 90 days. Consensus revenue for this quarter is at $9.6 billion and $11.16 billion next quarter.I don't think there will be a pop in ORCL's price after earnings. With this weakness in the market, I am looking for selling on any move up due to the earnings news.AVGO is the kind of stock we like, with the SID grade flickering between green bars (buy signal) and black bars (hold signal) on the 20-day bar chart. The red bars in the Demand/Supply 20-day bar chart show selling before earnings. Our Timing, buy-on-weakness signal appears in the Tmg column. Also, our Implied Return calculation is coded green for a buy signal.The Finviz chart shows price pulling back from its bullish, recent, new high just before earnings. There are nice uptrends in the 20- and 50-day moving averages. Price is well above the 200-day. Most of the fundamental metrics look very good. However, the debt to equity ratio is coded red. In February, there was an analyst downgrade with a target of $280. The consensus target is $293.Yahoo reports the consensus earnings expected for this quarter are $5.23, down from $5.28 some 90 days ago. Next quarter's earnings are at $5.24, down from $5.34 reported 90 days ago. These are bearish signals, but it will make it easier for AVGO to report expected earnings numbers. Revenues are expected to be $5.82 billion this quarter and $5.85 billion next quarter.I think AVGO will hit the expected earnings, but the recent selling tells me there is not much chance of a pop after earnings.There was a SAR sell signal last Thursday and that was confirmed by the red bars of Supply now showing in our 20-day bar chart for Demand/Supply, D:S. Despite these short-term selling signals before earnings, ULTA still has our Hold signal in the SID column and this is our most important signal. The selling has triggered our Timing, buy-on-weakness signal in the Tmg column. However, we like to wait to see Supply improving before we buy. To play it safe, we might wait to see a confirmed buy signal in the Cfrm column.Finviz shows that price has bounced back nicely to where it was before the market selloff. No surprise, because all the fundamental metrics look good, except for price to cash which is really bad. However, price to free cash flow looks OK.There was an analyst downgrade last month. Price is close to the 12-month analyst consensus target. These two bearish signals may explain the selling before earnings.Yahoo is looking at consensus earnings of $3.56 this quarter and $3.10 next quarter. Revenues are expected to be $2.11 billion this quarter and $1.74 billion next quarter.I think ULTA is overvalued and it needs a good earnings report just to stay where it is currently priced. I don't expect a pop after earnings.A solid 20 days of green bars for Demand on our 20-day bar chart. Our most important signal shows 20 days of black bars, indicating an enduring Hold signal before earnings.The Finviz chart shows that price has recovered nicely from the dive and has made a bullish new high. The fundamental metrics all look OK except for price to cash which is problematic and coded red. All the other metrics are coded black. The short ratio is at 3.1 days to cover and looks slightly bearish. Short covering may explain the strong bounce up. The other bearish sign is the consensus 12-month analyst target of $121. Price is almost trading at that level. Something has to give. Either the analysts raise targets after earnings or the price falls.Let's go to Yahoo for a look at the consensus forecast for revenues and earnings. This quarter they are looking for $1.88 and next quarter $1.50. Revenues are expected to be $6.6 billion this quarter and $6.59 billion next quarter.I think the earnings will be as expected and analysts may move targets higher. However, even the higher targets will just barely justify where price is currently trading. I doubt if we get much of a pop after earnings. The best time to make money in stocks is when we are surprised and our signals are wrong. That means the market is probably wrong and the next move in price is usually obvious. We like to act on those surprises. We are prepared to act on them before earnings. Portfolio managers like to buy good stocks that have a pullback after earnings. They have to buy on weakness. Portfolio managers will not chase price higher after surprisingly good earnings. Only the traders will. We are ready to act on any earnings surprises this Thursday."
4254703,103480,2019-04-16T10:40:31-04:00,"Shares of Adobe are racing back to all-time highs, with plenty of fundamental support for further price appreciation.In its most recent quarter, Adobe saw two points of revenue growth acceleration, which is incredible for a company of its size.Notable drivers included an increase in ARPU as well as momentum in Document Cloud (Adobe's competitor to DocuSign).Recently, Adobe has also bolstered its efforts in marketing software, joining forces with Microsoft in order to compete against Salesforce.Though Adobe seems like a perennially expensive stock, its capacity for double-digit earnings growth balances out its high valuation multiples.","With stocks getting expensive again, many investors are asking the question: what's a safe growth stock to hold on to for the long term? Adobe (ADBE), in my view, is a perfect candidate. The software publisher best known for tools like Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader has consistently proven itself as one of the strongest earnings performers in the software sector, with the capacity to sustain mid-20s revenue growth while growing earnings at a much faster pace.With a market cap over $130 billion (during the December meltdown of the entire stock market, Adobe's market cap briefly sank under $100 billion - if only we had loaded up on more shares then!), Adobe is one of the largest software companies in the industry, on par with Salesforce.com (CRM) and right behind the ""legacy"" giants Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP), and Microsoft (MSFT). Yet, among these large-caps, Adobe and Salesforce have also proven themselves to be among the fastest growers.Part of the reason is inorganic growth. Like Salesforce, Adobe has chased growth in recent years by acquiring smaller software publishers. It certainly hasn't been shy about M&A - it spent nearly $5 billion last year to acquire Marketo. Yet, much of its growth is organic too - the company has seen tremendous success at converting its customer base into a subscription model and driving cross-selling opportunities across its product suite to increase average revenue per user (ARPU).As such, Adobe's rally - up 20% in the year to date, four percentage points better than the S&P 500 - is perfectly warranted:Data by YChartsIn my view, the Adobe rally still has plenty of steam. Investors would be wise to build a position in Adobe to benefit from its consistent trend of outperforming the broader markets.Though many observers tend to view Adobe as an expensive stock, we should look at Adobe's valuation multiples in the context of growth. Alongside its most recent quarter, Adobe raised its financial targets for the current fiscal year 2019, as summarized in the chart below:Figure 1. Adobe FY19 guidanceSource: Adobe Q1 earnings releaseAdobe's revenue guidance remained flat at $11.15 billion (representing 23% y/y growth over FY18 revenue of $9.03 billion), though Adobe's history of conservatism suggests that growth may actually clock in one or two points higher. Consensus estimates pin Adobe's FY19 revenues at $11.17 billion (+24% y/y), and even that higher figure is likely to be adjusted upward if Adobe keeps beating its quarterly earnings.The company did, however, increase its EPS target to $7.80, up five cents from a prior view of $7.75. While this still implies that Adobe trades at a rather meaty 35x forward P/E ratio, I'd argue that the combination of double-digit revenue and EPS growth still makes Adobe an attractive play. Note as well that consensus pins Adobe's FY20 EPS at $9.67 (+24% y/y versus the company's FY19 guidance of $7.80), per Yahoo Finance. The stock's rich P/E multiple is a fair reflection of the fact that Adobe consistently manages to produce above-market EPS growth.A few results from Adobe's most recent quarter also help to underline the company's unique strengths. Here's a look at the Q1 earnings summary below:Figure 2. Adobe 1Q19 resultsSource: Adobe Q1 earnings releaseThe most encouraging data point, in my view, is the acceleration in revenue growth. Q1 revenues clocked in at $2.60 billion (+25.1% y/y), whereas Adobe had exited Q4 at just 22.8% y/y growth. This represents 230 bps of sequential acceleration. For a smaller software company or a recent IPO, this might be a more normal incident. For a large software company at a >$10 billion run rate, however, this is an incredible feat. It was also a record revenue quarter for Adobe, with many of its individual clouds also achieving all-time quarterly revenue records. It's true that the consolidation of Marketo and Magento's revenues (both recently acquired and fully baked into the results this quarter) helped revenue comps, but note that Wall Street's consensus estimate for the quarter was still much weaker at $2.55 billion, representing just 22.6% y/y growth - analysts had modeled in slight deceleration, while Adobe gave them the opposite.Recognize also that 91% of the company's revenue is from recurring sources. Unlike many other software companies that can close big one-time deals to drive a quarterly beat, the lion's share of Adobe's revenues is completely sustainable.Several growth drivers are worth pointing out. The company called out particular strength in Document Cloud, which is Adobe's answer to the growing popularity of DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU). The company added $65 million in new Document Cloud ARR in the quarter (for sizing purposes, DocuSign only generates about $200 million in revenues per quarter). Adobe also called out strong cross-sell results for enterprise customers between Acrobat and Document Cloud, as well as higher-than-expected conversion of free trial users to fully paid users.Adobe also noted that it drove a strong increase in ARPU across the board. Cross-selling has become a major theme across the past few quarters - as Adobe's product portfolio has swelled beyond its core flagship products and into newer marketing/e-sign offerings, its customer base has also consumed more and more Adobe subscriptions.As we look ahead to further growth drivers for FY19 and beyond, one of the key points is the fact that Adobe is actively pushing to expand its TAM. As highlighted by its monster acquisition of Marketo in September last year, marketing software has been a major push for Adobe - and one outside its traditional realm of design/creative software intended for retail users and small teams. With the addition of Marketo, Adobe's push into enterprise-level software has become far more prominent.A few weeks ago, Adobe announced a new partnership with Microsoft and LinkedIn (now a subsidiary of Microsoft) to bolster its marketing capabilities. A key component of this partnership is the ability to populate customer data from Microsoft Dynamics 365 (Microsoft's flagship CRM product) into the Adobe Experience Cloud, helping sales and marketing teams to leverage data-based insights to engage more proactively with their accounts. The snapshot below, taken from the press release, highlights the key features stemming from the expanded partnership:Figure 3. Adobe Experience Cloud partnership featuresSource: Business WireThe partnership is a major jab at Salesforce, whose Marketing Cloud has become an important source of revenue growth as the flagship Sales Cloud hits a saturation point. Adobe is a relatively new entrant to marketing software, yet Gartner (the leading industry analyst for software publishers) has already named Adobe one of the foremost Leaders in the space in its 2018 Magic Quadrant for marketing software:Figure 4. Adobe marketing software rankingSource: GartnerThe Microsoft/LinkedIn partnership reflects a strong focus on marketing solutions as a focal point for growth in 2019, and will certainly bring a lot of greenfield revenue opportunities from the enterprise segment in the coming year.If you're looking for a growth stock to hold onto for several years, look no further than Adobe. Over the past year, the company has not only managed to convert nearly the entirety of its customer base into recurring subscriptions, but it has also expanded meaningfully into new software categories such as marketing and document management. Aside from completely dominating the Adobe Acrobat/Pro/Reader space that it's best known for, Adobe has also become a major competitor to the likes of DocuSign and Salesforce. Its ability to sustain ~20% y/y revenue growth alongside double-digit EPS and cash flow growth is a testament to the richness of its market opportunities. Stay long here and hold for the long term."

We will also validate the scenario analysis of earnings with a relative valuation technique, DCF analysis, and street analyst's recommendations. ______________________________________________________________Adobe (ADBE) beat the street in every quarter in the last 4 quarters. What do you expect when Adobe reports next earnings on Thursday, March 14?Source: Seeking AlphaAnalysts expect revenue of $2.547 billion and EPS of $1.61. The revenue estimate implies 3.3% growth sequentially.Source: Company FillingsDigital Media revenue increased to $6.33 billion in FY-2018 from $5.01 billion in FY-2017 (26% YoY growth). In FY-2018, Digital Media segment contributed 70% of total revenue. This segment was followed by Digital Experience segment, which contributed 27% and Publishing segment contributed 3% of total revenue. In FY-2018, Adobe moved enterprise offerings into the Publishing segment from Digital Experience segment.Digital Media Segment: Creative Cloud segment is a key growth driverDigital Media segment generates revenue from Creative Cloud and Document Cloud services. Creative Cloud is a subscription-based service which encompasses Adobe's creative products. This is Adobe's flagship offering with revenue contribution of $5.34 billion in FY-2018 (representing 28% YoY growth due to strong growth in Creative Cloud subscriptions). Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) are competitors in this segment.Management expects 20% year-over-year revenue growth for the Digital Media segment in FY-2019. This indicates that increasing adoption of Creative Cloud is expected to be a key growth driver for the Digital Media segment.Key Performance MetricAnnualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) is the performance metric that shows the money that comes in every year for the life of a subscription. ARR is a good measurement to assess the health and trajectory of the overall Digital Media segment. Adobe calculates ARR as follow:Source: Company FillingsIn FY-2018, Digital Media ARR grew to $6.83 billion (Creative ARR $6.03 billion and Document Cloud ARR $801 million), up from $5.39 billion in FY-2017 (27% YoY growth). Management expects $1.45 billion of net new ARR in FY-2019.ConclusionIncreasing adoption of Creative Cloud, as is evident by the increase in subscriptions, has pushed up overall revenues. Therefore, Creative Cloud is likely to be the next big catalyst for Adobe.Source: Company FillingsAdobe's operating income growth and net income growth continued to exceed its revenue growth. Although its revenue grew 24% to $9.03 billion in FY-2018, its operating income grew 31%, and net income grew 53%. Higher net income also contributed to cash flow from operations. In FY-2018, cash flow from operations was $4.02 billion increased by 38% compared to FY-2017.Adobe provided quarterly guidance for revenue, net operating expenses, tax rate, and EPS. To get a better understanding, I have done historical analysis of average vs. actual guidance and calculated delta/variation. I will forecast Adobe's full income statement simply by understanding how to interpret the company's guidance (a Top-Down approach to Adobe's guidance).Please note that Q1-2019 numbers shown in green on various tables are management guidance vs. my financial projection.1. Revenue Guidance vs. Actual Source: Company FillingsIncreasing adoption of Creative Cloud, as is evident by the increase in subscriptions, has pushed up overall revenues. In the table above, I calculated delta by comparing guidance vs. actual result. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that Adobe has a tendency to beat its revenue guidance. Management expects revenue of $2.54 billion for Q1-2019. I believe that Adobe will hit the higher ranges of its revenue guidance and report revenue of $2.59 billion for Q1-2019 due to the robust performance of Adobe's operating segments and inorganic growth fuel by recent acquisitions.2. Net non-operating expenses Guidance vs. Actual Source: Company FillingsThis includes interest expense and other income/expenses. This is a bit tricky to project because of the fluctuating pattern of other income/expenses. Net non-operating expenses are expected to be $39 million for Q1-2019. I believe that Adobe will report $49 million for Q1-2019 due to increase in debt for recent acquisitions.3. GAAP tax rate Guidance vs. Actual Source: Company FillingsThe tax rate is expected to be 3% for Q1-2019. I believe that Adobe will hit the tax-rate guidance and report 8% for Q1-2019.3. GAAP EPS Guidance vs. ActualSource: Company FillingsGAAP EPS are expected to be $1.14. Based on scenario analysis of earnings, Adobe will report GAAP EPS of $1.24 (variation 8.8%) in Q1-2019.4. Non-GAAP EPS Guidance vs. ActualSource: Company FillingsAdobe has a tendency to beat guidance. Non-GAAP EPS are expected to be $1.60 in Q1-2019. Based on scenario analysis of earnings, Adobe will report Non-GAAP EPS of $1.70 (variation 6.3%) in Q1-2019.5. Outstanding shares Guidance vs. ActualSource: Company FillingsOutstanding shares will be in line with guidance based on historical trend.Conclusion - Based on Historical Analysis of Guidance vs. Actual (Variation Analysis), we can conclude that Adobe will report the following financials in Q1-2019:Scenario Analysis of Earnings (Q1-2019) - A look at earnings from the view of management, analyst & investorsThrough scenario analysis of earnings, we will analyze whether the company can beat the street based on expectations of management, analysts, and investors. If yes, then we will certainly see upside in share price and, if not, then either hold or sell. We will also validate the scenario analysis of earnings with a relative valuation technique, DCF analysis, and street analyst's recommendations.Income Statement - a top-down approach to Adobe's guidanceSource: Company FillingsIn the above analysis, I have tweaked the revenue ($2.59 billion, 5.4% growth sequentially) and operating income ($718 million, margin 27.7%) in line with Street estimates, management guidance and variation analysis. Tax-rate and outstanding shares projected based on variation analysis 8% and 495 million, respectively.Conclusion (Hold/Buy Opportunity): Based on the scenario analysis of earnings for Q1-2019, we can conclude that Adobe will beat Non-GAAP EPS guidance by a margin of 6.6%. Hence, we can hold/buy till the next earnings.Now, we will validate the scenario analysis conclusion by applying the valuation methodologies.Investors should look at valuation methodologies when deciding whether to enter or exit a stock. Valuation is driven by perceived growth, risks and investors' willingness to pay. There are various methods available to assess the valuation of a stock.We used the DCF analysis over a five-year period, with the following assumptions:Here's the DCF analysis down to the unlevered FCF:The company's implied share price is $287, which is a 9% premium to the current price of $263. The most likely implied value is between $203 and $374 per share, based on this analysis.Based on our analysis, the recommendation for Adobe is Buy/hold. Now, we will validate the scenario analysis conclusion and DCF analysis by understanding the overall market view for Adobe. Analysts have a target price of $291.21, which is a 12% premium to the current price of $254. Of all the analysts covering Adobe, 17 recommended it as a strong buy, 3 recommended it as a buy, and 12 recommended it as a hold.1. Creative Cloud is likely to be the next big catalyst for Adobe2. Based on the scenario analysis of earnings for Q1-2019, we can conclude that Adobe will beat Non-GAAP EPS guidance by a margin of 6.6%. Hence, we can hold/buy until the next earnings report3. Based on DCF analysis, the implied share price is $287, which is a 9% premium to the current price of $263. The most likely implied value is between $203 and $374 per share4. Market view is positive and validates our analysisAdobe has outperformed both its own management guidance and street expectations in every quarter of the previous four quarters. Based on our analysis, Adobe keeps up its winning streak when releases its next earnings on Thursday, March 14."
4252167,102764,2019-04-01T15:42:21-04:00,"Adobe is a high quality business with a leadership position in its main markets.Financial performance is clearly attractive, both over the long term and in the most recent quarter.The stock is priced for growth, but not overvalued at all by industry standards.Competition and demanding market expectations are the two main risk factors to consider.Overall, the stock looks well positioned for attractive returns if management keeps executing strongly.","The software sector is on fire lately, and Adobe (ADBE) is no exception. The stock has gained over 25% in the past year on the back of vigorous revenue growth and outstanding profitability.After such a big rally, it makes sense to be patient when considering a position in Adobe over the short term. Nevertheless, both the business fundamentals and the quantitative indicators look good for investors in Adobe's stock over the years ahead.Adobe is a world leader in content creation software with Photoshop and Illustrator. Leveraging on such leadership, the company has added new products and features to build additional growth venues and consolidate its leadership position in content creation across multiple platforms. With the acquisition of Omniture, Adobe has also positioned itself as a big player in digital marketing services, an area offering plenty of opportunities for growth.Over the past several years, Adobe transformed its business model from licensing to a cloud-based subscription model. This business model works very well with clients, because the upfront cost for a subscription service is obviously much lower, and users get access to a solution that is permanently updated. From a financial perspective, subscriptions make revenue more recurrent and predictable over time.Adobe's strategic direction has produced outstanding returns for investors. Key financial metrics such as revenue, operating income, free cash flow, and earnings per share have increased substantially in the past five years.Data by YChartsFinancial reports for the first quarter of 2019 confirm that the business is firing on all cylinders and producing solid performance across the board.Adjusted revenue amounted to $2.6 billion during the quarter, growing by 25% and surpassing Wall Street expectations by $50 million. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.71, beating expectations by $0.09 per share.The digital media segment generated $1.78 billion in revenue, growing 22% on a year-over-year basis. Net new digital media Annualized Recurring Revenue - ARR - was $357 million, and total Digital Media ARR grew to $7.07 billion during the period. In the digital experience segment, Adobe reported Experience Cloud revenue of $743 million for the quarter, which represents a 34% increase year-over-year.Adobe is a widely profitable business, gross margin amounts to 86% of sales, and the company retains a huge 28% of revenue as net income margin.Adobe's stock is priced for aggressive growth expectations, meaning that valuation ratios are elevated in comparison to current earnings and cash flows. But that does not mean that the stock is overvalued when considering the company's potential for expansion in the long term.The market is assigning high valuations to companies in the software sector because the industry produces plenty of growth opportunities and attractive profitability. When comparing Adobe versus other industry players, the stock does not look overpriced at all.The table below compares Adobe versus Salesforce (CRM), Intuit (INTU), and Workday (WDAY) in terms of valuation ratios such as Enterprise Value to EBITDA, forward PE, projected PE versus long-term growth expectations, and price to free cash flow. Adobe is clearly priced at reasonable levels by industry standards.It's important to keep in mind that valuation is a dynamic concept. Current stock prices are reflecting a particular set of expectations about the business. If the company proves that it can outperform those expectations, then both fundamental expectations and the stock price tend to increase over time, and fundamental momentum can be a powerful upside fuel for the stock.The chart below shows how earnings expectations for Adobe in both the current year and next fiscal year have significantly increased over the past quarters. As long as this trend remains in place, it could be a powerful tailwind for Adobe's stock in terms of valuation.Data by YChartsTo put the numbers in perspective, we can take a look at Adobe through the PowerFactors algorithm. This is a quantitative algorithm available to members of The Data-Driven Investor, and it ranks companies according to a combination of factors that include: financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength.In simple terms, the PowerFactors system is looking to buy good businesses (quality) for a reasonable price (valuation) when the company is doing well (fundamental momentum) and the stock is outperforming (relative strength).Adobe is one of the top stocks in the US market based on the PowerFactors ranking. The company has an aggregate PowerFactors ranking of 98.49 and solid numbers across the four quantitative drivers: quality (99.37), value (88.5), fundamental momentum (85.4), and relative strength (80.28).Only because the numbers look strong, this does not guarantee that Adobe will outperform the market going forward. On average, companies with strong quantitative metrics tend to outperform the market more often than not. However, this does not tell us much about how a single stock will perform over a particular year.Adobe needs to continue delivering world-class software and services in order to sustain financial performance going forward, and the company operates in a very dynamic industry. Even if the business is strong from a competitive point of view, investors in Adobe need to keep a close eye on the competitive landscape going forward.In addition, the market is expecting strong growth in revenue and earnings from Adobe. If the company fails to meet those expectations, the stock would be vulnerable to the downside from current valuation levels. In other words, current valuation is not excessive, but it does not provide much of a buffer if the company fails to deliver.Those risks being acknowledged, Adobe is a high-quality business, and the stock looks well positioned for attractive returns if management keeps executing well in the years ahead."
4251167,20521,2019-03-26T17:46:21-04:00,"Its outlook failed to impress the market and the stock fell 5% post result announcement.Despite the strong quarter performance, Adobe's outlook for the current quarter fell short of market's expectations.Adobe has realized the importance of following a PaaS strategy to drive growth.","Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) recently reported another stellar quarter that surpassed the market's forecast. But the Street has come to expect a lot more from Adobe. Its outlook failed to impress the market and the stock fell 5% post result announcement. But Adobe continues to remain an impressive example of a turn-around done right as it continues to build its cloud, SaaS, and PaaS offerings.Adobe's first quarter revenues grew 25% over the year to a record $2.6 billion, ahead of the market's projections of $2.55 billion. Adjusted EPS of $1.71 were also significantly ahead of the Street's forecast of $1.62.For the quarter, Adobe's Subscription revenues grew 29% to $2.3 billion and Product revenues fell 0.6% to $170.6 million. Services and Support revenues grew 10% to $125.4 million.By segment, Digital Media grew 22% to $1.78 billion driven by growth in both the Creative Cloud and Document cloud segments. Creative Cloud revenues grew 22% to $1.49 billion and Document Cloud segment also grew 22% to $282 million. Revenues from the Digital Experience segment grew 34% to $743 million. Adobe includes revenues from Adobe Experience Cloud, Magento, and Marketo acquisitions.Despite the strong quarter performance, Adobe's outlook for the current quarter fell short of market's expectations. Adobe forecast revenues of $2.7 billion and an adjusted EPS of $1.77 for the current quarter. The market was looking for revenues of $2.72 billion with an EPS of $1.88. Adobe expects to end the current year with revenues of $11.15 billion with an adjusted EPS of $7.80 which was in line with the market's expectations.Adobe has been driving growth through product innovation and last quarter was no different. It is bolstering its Creative Cloud offering with the acquisition of Auvergne, France-based Allegorithmic. Allegorithmic is a leading provider of tools for 3D material and texture creation for gaming and entertainment. Its products allow content developers to produce texture assets twice as fast as usual with file sizes that are 500-1000 times smaller than regular textures. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Prior to the acquisition, Allegorithmic was privately held and had raised $1.9 million in funding from Sofimac Partners. Owler estimates its revenues at $2.6 million annually. The addition of Allegorithmic will help strengthen 3D content design for Adobe's Creative Cloud.Adobe has implemented a robust platform strategy to drive growth. It has built a strong ecosystem of plug-ins and integrations for its Creative, Experience, and Document Clouds. Within the Creative Cloud, Adobe offers more than a thousand extensions, plug-ins, and scripts that can enhance creativity and extend the functionality of Creative Cloud applications. For the Experience Cloud segment, Adobe offers a library of apps, extensions, and scripts that help customers manage their advertising, data analytics, campaign, and content management. Within the Document cloud, developers have built apps that help streamline document workflows and speed business with e-signatures.Adobe has realized the importance of following a PaaS strategy to drive growth. I would like to know from Adobe what apps are driving the most traction on its platform?Adobe may have made impressive moves so far, but the market is looking for a lot more. Its stock is currently trading at $262.27 with a market capitalization of $128.28 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $277.61 in September last year. Last year's stock market turbulence had sent the stock to a 52-week low of $204.95.Photo Credit: midiman/Flickr.comEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4246399,58641,2019-03-05T10:34:53-05:00,"I restate my January 29 buy rating for ADBE. The stock is now priced at $264.21 – notably higher than January 29’s $238.27.Aside from its invidious status as the king of creative software products, Adobe has another growing tailwind from Experience Cloud.Adobe was recently acknowledged by Gartner as among the leaders in Digital Experience Platforms.Digital Experience Platform or DXP software market is projected to have a market size of $9 billion by 2023. It is growing at 9% CAGR.Adobe Experience Cloud is A leader in Customer Experience Management or CEM. The CEM industry is growing at 22.9% CAGR. By 2025, CEM’s market size will be $32.49 billion.","Instead of profit-taking, I reiterate my January 29 buy rating for Adobe (ADBE). My bet on ADBE was primarily driven by the pseudo-monopoly of Adobe Creative Cloud. I appreciate Adobe more after Gartner identified it as among the leaders in the 2019 Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms, or DXP. This endorsement from Gartner should help Adobe attract more customers for its fast-growing Experience Cloud business segment.With the recent acquisitions of Magento and Marketo, Adobe is better-equipped to disrupt DXP leaders IBM (IBM) and Salesforce (CRM). Adobe's future prosperity is better because its DXP leadership makes it a more effective Software-as-a-Service provider.Gartner 2019 Magic Quadrant For Digital Experience Platforms(Source: Gartner)DXP is part of the overall $20 billion/quarter enterprise Software-as-a-Service or SaaS industry. Adobe is now the no.3 in global enterprise SaaS. This is thanks to its subscription software business from Creative Cloud and Experience Cloud.(Source: Synergy Research)Becoming a leader in DXP can help improve Adobe's 9% market share in global enterprise SaaS. Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud could generate $3 billion/quarter for Adobe.It doesn't list specific revenue distribution of its business segments, but Adobe's FY 2018 revenue was$9 billion. I estimated last year that Creative Cloud is contributing more than $1.3 billion/quarter. I guesstimate that Digital Experience (content/document creation & management) and Experience Cloud's (marketing and DXP) combined contribution could be as high as $4.5 billion year.Going forward, the customers of Magento and Marketo can add another $1 to $1.5 billion to Adobe Digital Experience's annual revenue. My estimate is reasonable. Experience Platform software market is estimated to be growing at 9% CAGR. It will have a market size of $9 billion by 2023.Adobe Experience Cloud also provides client companies a better way to manage customer experience. Grand View Research acknowledged Adobe as a leader in Costumer Experience Management or CEM. As per Grand View, CEM is expected to reach a market size of $32.49 billion by 2025, growing at 22.9% CAGR.There is no exact dollar amounts from its management but Adobe Experience Cloud's subscription revenue grew 26% Y/Y in Q4 2018, and Digital Experience segment revenue +20% Y/Y. The FY 2019 guidance also projects a 34% Y/Y growth in Digital Experience.(Source: Adobe)Adobe Experience Platform is an Artificial Intelligence-fueled, all-in-one shop where companies can market their products/services, engage their customers, do Big Data analytics, and collect customer data/preferences.It is easy to explain why Adobe has higher valuation ratios than Microsoft. More investors appreciate Adobe's pseudo-monopoly on creative software products. Investors also likes it that Adobe is a fast-growing leader in enterprise SaaS. Further, Microsoft (MSFT) does not have an equalizer to Creative Cloud. As far as I know, Microsoft does not have equalizers to Magento and Marketo.Refer to the chart below, ADBE touts much higher TTM P/E, P/S, and EV/EBITDA valuation ratios than MSFT.The stock market is fickle. The current market darling status of ADBE might not last forever. The biggest possible headwind I could think of is for Salesforce, Autodesk (ADSK), or Microsoft to make a serious challenge to the pseudo-monopoly of Adobe Creative Cloud. Creative Cloud's annual recurring revenue is Adobe's biggest growth catalyst. Those three firms are big enough to buy/develop alternatives to the $50/month subscription plan of Creative Cloud. If it does happen, ADBE could stagnate.Adobe is valued so high (50x TTM P/E) because Creative Cloud challengers are only midget companies like Corel Corporation and Serif Software. Adobe became a giant because the bigger giants, Microsoft and Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) did not bother to offer alternatives to Creative Cloud products.Further, I also see IBM Watson as a future rival to Marketo's automated marketing software for B2B customers. Watson is now being marketed by IBM as an AI-powered automated marketing platform. This is an important arena where Adobe and IBM are now competing. The Nvidia (NVDA) powered Adobe Sensei can eventually compete against the cognitive AI of IBM Watson.Adobe willingly paid $4.75 billion to acquire B2B automated marketing software leader Marketo. Adobe knew the digital marketing software industry is another fast-growing industry. Grand View Research estimated that the global digital marketing software industry was worth $35.24 billion in 2017. The cloud segment of digital marketing contributed $19.35 billion. Adobe wanted to ride the high 15.2% CAGR of the digital marketing software industry.Adobe Campaign remains its B2C marketing platform. Marketo is its B2B marketing solution provider.It wasn't due to some magic trick but Adobe is now big enough to challenge bigger SaaS giants. Creative Cloud made Adobe the biggest giant in content creation software. It is now also growing as a giant in digital marketing, digital experience, and customer experience management.Going forward, ADBE's valuation can likely go higher than 50x P/E after it becomes the no.2 enterprise SaaS vendor. Adobe posting an FY 2019 EPS of $7, coupled with a probable 54x P/E valuation, can push its stock beyond $330 by early next year. A future 54x P/E is feasible based on Adobe's historical P/E valuation.ADBE was previously valued as high as 150.37x P/E in November 30, 2014. Four years ago, investors were already making big bets on Adobe. They won big money from their early-bird boldness.(Source: MacroTrends.net)I don't see why history won't repeat itself. ADBE's 5-year price return is +284.69%. Due to the growing DXP and CEM industries, I bet that by FY 2024, ADBE will probably achieve a 5-year price return greater than 150%."
4238790,104122,2019-02-06T20:47:47-05:00,"Adobe offers a venerable brand with significant competitive advantages.The company displays a sound financial positioning.Although not presently a buy, Adobe is a stock to put on the watchlist.","Source: Google Images Warren Buffett advocates finding companies that possess ""a competitive moat"" or in other words, a business that exhibits substantial competitive deterrents. Adobe (ADBE) epitomizes Buffett's notion of an anti-competitive business. ADBE's creative cloud suite with market-leading programs ranging from Photoshop and Illustrator, After Effects, InDesign, Acrobat, Flash, Dreamweaver, Adobe XD, and Dimension dominate the computer graphics market with virtually non-existent competition. The company's extensive digital design programs are an indispensable tool for various creative development professionals. This article will substantiate my bullish thesis on ADBE discussing the company's business strengths, financials, valuation, and growth opportunities. From an overarching perspective, ADBE offers an unrivaled business characterized by anti-competitive products, a subscription-based revenue generation model, well-diversified product portfolio, and inseparable ties to the graphic design industry. Adobe's creative interface has endured as the gold standard amongst creative professionals for decades. Since the company's inception in 1987, ADBE has sustained its first-mover advantage as a result of a sustained track record of developing products that were unparalleled in their depth, versatility, and functionality of features. The company's initial product offerings of Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator have expanded to more than 30 different design programs catering to various creative development professionals ranging from graphic designers, photographers, web developers, game developers, app developers, and graphic artists. ADBE's programs benefit from a number of positive externalities ranging from a self-integrated platform, sustained continuity of service, and a resistance to product substitution. To elaborate further, ADBE's programs offer seamless integration with one another. From a practical standpoint, the file outputs are compatible and the programs all offer a familiar interface, but from a sentiment standpoint, designers and creative professionals are more likely to remain within the Adobe ecosystem due to strong brand loyalties, reasonable pricing for the company's services, and a yearning for innovative and easy to use features. In addition to seamless integration, creative professionals spend a significant amount of time learning how to use the Adobe product platform making them very reluctant to switch design interfaces and learn how to use a competing program. This results in significant competitive deterrents to switch to a competing interface. Also, creative professionals are presented with a lack of viable competitive alternatives as ADBE's creative cloud suite is so expansive, including preeminent programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Acrobat, Flash Professional, Flash Builder, Dreamweaver, Fireworks, After Effects, Premiere Pro, Media Encoder, Bridge, and Encore. Adobe derives an overwhelming majority of revenue from the company's subscription sales, as again, ADBE largely operates on a subscription-based revenue generation model. For a reasonable amount, starting at $9.99 a month, creative professionals are given access to a whole host of programs. ADBE employs a very well executed pricing strategy; the company generates continued revenues from its subscription services as opposed to traditional per unit sales. Additionally, the graduated pricing system assures a price and product solution tailored to a consumer's individual needs. Source: Adobe The company's competitive pricing, especially within the educational atmosphere, causes colleges and universities to impress the products upon students assuring continued continuity of use in future occupational endeavors. From an operational oversight perspective, ADBE has lived up to its innovative past. The company is constantly reinventing itself and its industry with new pioneering offerings that seamlessly interconnect creativity and digital technologies. ADBE maintains an estimated 50% of the total market share in the digital content-creation software segment. The company's deviation to a subscription-based revenue generation model enabled ADBE to improve liquidity and operating capital as users pay in advance every month to use ADBE's programs. Furthermore, ADBE's acquisition of Allegorithmic better positions Adobe to drive revenue growth in the 3D/CAD materials, video game production, and cinematic/special effects segments. An examination of ADBE's balance sheet reveals a sound financial positioning. The company has sustained positive shareholder equity, expanding revenues, and ample liquidity reserves of $3.3 billion. ADBE's revenues have increased on an almost linear trajectory. You'll notice the revenue growth rate increased significantly over the past couple of years, a beneficial byproduct of the company's transition to a subscription revenue generation model. Another business advantage is ADBE's astronomical margins; the company has an astounding gross margin of 85% and net profit margin of 29%. ADBE is able to furnish significant profit retention and substantial gross margins as a result of the company's limited capital expenditures. ADBE's expenditures are primarily centralized around the human capital required to advance the company's products thus eliminating the supply side expenses of a more traditional business. However, ADBE's exceptional business comes at a significant cost. Based on a discounted cash flow valuation, ADBE is extremely overvalued; the company's current share price of $255 exceeds the future cash flow value of $159. Data by YChartsAdobe demonstrates an exceptional business with entrenched competitive characteristics. The stock makes for a versatile investment holding that will ensure capital appreciation over the long run. However, investors should be mindful of its current overvaluation. Because the stock is so overvalued, initiating a position now comes with significant downside risks. ADBE is definitely a stock to add the watchlist, as in the event of a good pullback, the company furnishes a strong buy rating. Author's note: Thanks for taking the time to read the article.

Adobe is well positioned for growth via a more attractive value proposition to the existing customer base and reach to new customer segments. During the period, the net new users’ subscriptions increased across new segments and geographies. Recent acquisitions in the Experience segment and the company’s successful history of integrating new businesses will continue to support the strong results momentum for Adobe.We think the results highlight Adobe’s positioning as the market leader in creative and marketing software solutions. We like Adobe’s high visibility revenue model, ample growth runway and exposure to secular tech growth themes. As Adobe increasingly shifts its installed base to a subscription software model, we don’t think the transition will be as smooth as the market expects. We also question the potential for incremental upside given the secular shift in print media and a historical inability to monetize its developer base given the availability of cheaper alternatives. At ~46x trailing PE, the stock commands a hefty premium. We think it better to wait until valuations normalize before considering a position.Adobe performed better than its targets on an annual and quarterly basis in FY2018 and 4Q, excluding the results of the recently acquired Marketo. Annual sales increased 24% yoy to USD 9.03B due to good performance in both strategic segments - Digital Media and Digital Experience. On a quarterly basis, sales grew by 23% yoy to USD 2.46M and were 20M above targets (excl. Marketo).(Source: Adobe)The company’s business consists of three segments:In 2018, the ARR in the Digital Media segment grew to USD 6.83B and added USD 1.45M net new ARR during the year. For the quarter, the company posted a net new ARR of USD 430M, USD 45M higher than the target. Adobe’s creative revenue increased 28% yoy to USD 5.34B and Document revenue reached USD 982M (17% yoy). In the Digital Experience segment, revenue increased 20% yoy to USD 2.44B. On a quarterly basis, Creative revenue grew by 26% yoy to USD 1.54B supported by good performance in all customer groups and Document revenue was up to USD 259M (10% yoy). The Digital Experience segment increased by 25% yoy to USD 690M.The company had approximately USD 8B of contracted revenue by the year-end comprising a USD 5B backlog of unbilled revenue and USD 3B of deferred revenue.In FY 2018, Adobe generated USD 4B in operating cash flows and returned USD 2B to shareholders through its share repurchase program.On a yearly basis, Adobe GAAP EBITDA increased 27% yoy and margins improved by 84 bps to 35%. Company net income grew 53% yoy to USD 2.59B and net profit margins improved from 23% in 2017 to 29%.In 4Q, Adobe’s EBITDA increased by 13% yoy to USD 827M. However, margins declined to 34% vs. 36% in 4Q 2017 partly due to the effect of Marketo acquisition.The group posted annual diluted GAAP EPS of USD 5.20 (53% yoy growth) and non-GAAP EPS of USD 6.83. The quarterly GAAP EPS were USD 1.37, and non-GAAP EPS reached USD 1.83.Built on the strong momentum, Adobe provided guidance on 2019 expected results to reflect: 1) the acquisition of Magento and Marketo (USD 75M write-down of deferred revenue) and 2) adverse changes in global currency rates of approximately USD 35M.Adobe’s targets were based on its current reporting standard ASC 605, but from 1Q 2019 reporting will move to ASC 606. The company expected this would have a limited positive effect on earnings in 2019.Adobe expects USD 11.15B in revenues (23% yoy growth) with Digital Media posting 20% yoy growth and Digital Experience posting 34% yoy growth. The net new ARR is expected to reach USD 1.45B. The GAAP EPS is expected to reach USD 5.54 and USD 7.75 on a non-GAAP basisIn the quarterly guidance, Adobe forecasts revenues of USD 2.54M (22% growth vs. 1Q 2018 and 3% growth vs. 4Q 2018). The company expects stronger growth in the Experience segment 31% yoy vs. 20% in the Media and net new ARR for the period of USD 330M. Expected GAAP and non-GAAP EPS are USD 1.14 and USD 1.60, respectively.In June 2018, Adobe added the commerce platform Magento to the Digital Experience segment, and in October 2018, Marketo - the leader in B2B marketing engagement - was acquired. Without the effect of the recent acquisition, annual sales increased 22% yoy, still ahead of the set targets (Marketo brought USD 21M to sales in 4Q for one month). Adobe’s management is focused on the integration of the two recently acquired companies. Given the small share of Marketo in the group’s revenues, no substantial effect on margins from the acquisition is expected in 2019.Adobe has a stable business model with leading market positions in its strategic segments – Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. The company is clearly, well positioned to expand its value proposition and customer base and provide sustainable long-term results. However, the stock is pricey at EV/EBITDA of 35.8x and Trailing P/E of 45.8x.We see risks on the horizon as well – 1) Potential resistance to the shift toward a subscription software model, and 2) Headwinds in print media, its core vertical, and 3) Challenges in monetizing its developer base given the availability of cheaper alternatives. We think it better to wait until valuations normalize before considering a position."

(ADBE) shares have been on a roll, I believe the company is still at the very beginning of its growth stage. After the company successfully completes its moat creation, it will be positioned to fully capitalize on its integrated software and web services ecosystem.Adobe is a diversified prepacked software company offering specialized design tools, online e-sign services and photo stock to marketers, creative professionals, knowledge workers, developers, enterprises and other consumers creating, delivering, optimizing and transacting exclusive content. Most of its services are subscription-based, with product and support services accounting only for about 12 percent of total revenue. The company operates three revenue segments - digital media, digital experience and publishing - with the first and second totaling 31 and 26 percent respectively.Source: Adobe 2018 10-K filingInspecting Adobe’s history, I have found the company to be a heavy inorganic grower. Over the last decade, it successfully acquired over twenty companies - with the majority incorporated in the United States. Adobe’s most recent portfolio additions include Magento, an e-commerce software, Marketo, a marketing automation software, and Allegorithmic, a 3D texture and material creation software.Source: Author's own creation, Data Sources: Crunchbase.com, WikiDuring the latest quarterly earnings call, one finding that was particularly interesting is the actuality that software sells more or less the same way as clothes or consumer electronics do. During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the company’s sales reached record highs, making them two of the largest-single selling days in company history. Apart from a strong holiday season, the company continued investing in building the Adobe experience platform, which is intended to provide a unified view of the customer for both Chief Marketing Officers and Chief Information Officers.As stated in the company’s earnings call, Adobe is also currently in the process of building deep technology moats with a focus on strengthening relationships with customers and differentiation against competitors. Taking a closer look at Adobe’s probable future sources of sustainable advantages, I believe a newly formed partnership with Microsoft (MSFT) is on a good way to become the company’s single-biggest moat.According to the ZDNet, Shantanu Narayen and Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, know each other well from earlier times when they both studied at the same high school in Hyderabad. Joining the informal tech group known as the Big 4 (Microsoft, SAP, Salesforce (CRM) and Oracle (ORCL)) is likely to result in some kind of long-run growth rates convergence, which, in Adobe’s and Microsoft’s case, can produce considerable synergies.And positive developments are apparent also on the financial statements front. In the last two years, Adobe’s free cash flow growth has significantly accelerated, constantly pushing the all-time highs to new levels. This is a rare development, testifying to a strong cash flow generating momentum.The dark side of Adobe’s fast growth, however, is represented by remarkably stretched multiples. The company’s trailing twelve-month P/S, P/E, Price-to-FCF and EV-to-EBITDA ratios stand at 14, 50, 35 and 40 percent respectively. Even though Adobe’s historical development of valuation ratios resembles a wild ride, the multiples tend to hover in a high territory most of the time.Plugging in Adobe's financial statements' figures into my DCF template, the company’s shares seem to be more or less fairly valued. Under the perpetuity growth method with a terminal growth rate of 2 percent, constant 25 percent annual revenue growth over the next five years and 31 percent EBIT margin, the fair value of the stock comes at US$256.7. Under the EBITDA multiple approach of a discounted cash flow model, the intrinsic value per share value of the company stands roughly at US$332.6, if we assume that the appropriate exit EV/EBITDA multiple in five years' time is around 20x.Source: Author's own Excel modelFrom a different perspective working with operating earnings multiples, Adobe shares currently appear undervalued. Using the F.A.S.T. Graphs forecasting calculator with a 25 percent adjusted operating earnings growth rate assumption, the company's intrinsic value by the end of November FY2024 are forecasted to reach up to US$664.7. This implies a total annualized rate of return upside potential up to 17 percent.Source: F.A.S.T. GraphsLastly, in light of revenue variation of Peter Lynch's popular earnings line for the projection of probable per share values of the company, Adobe shares' long-run potential seems to be skewed to the positive territory. According to my model, assuming 25 percent annual revenue growth, zero percent annual equity dilution factor and a price-to-sales PS ratio of around 14x, the company's share price by the end of 2022 could hover above US$600. This scenario suggests an annualized rate of return potential as much as 20 percent in the following years.Source: Author's own Excel modelTo sum up, Adobe seems to be a creative software provider with virtually no direct competitors. Assuming Oracle, DocuSign (DOCU) and GIMP do not present a serious threat to the company’s profit margins, Adobe has practically a monopoly in the digital design software industry. Despite significantly inflated valuation multiples, its prospects with respect to a lately formed alliance with Microsoft and other technology firms look bright, suggesting the larger part of the company’s growth phase lies ahead.Disclaimer: Please note that this article has an informative purpose, expresses its author's opinion, and does not constitute investment recommendation or advice.

I also raised my bet on Adobe (ADBE). Content is king. Adobe's expanding Creative Cloud software suite makes it the king of content creation software products. Adobe already dominates in print and digital/web document and content creation. The recent acquisition of Allegorithmic increased Adobe's presence in the software market for 3D/CAD material texturing, video games production, and TV/movies cinematic special effects.Allegorithmic's proprietary technology and software products will boost the long-term growth of Creative Cloud. Adobe plans to integrate Allegorithmic software/IP in Creative Cloud software programs. Like it or not, the recurring revenue from Creative Cloud software subscription fees is still the biggest sales/income producer (more than 50% of revenue) of Adobe. Creative Cloud subscription fees contribute more than $4.5 billion to Adobe's annual revenue.(Source: Seeking Alpha)There are dozens of free and/or cheaper alternatives to Creative Cloud software products, but Adobe's $8.98 billion annual revenue convinced me that it has solid share in the $17 billion/year computer graphics applications/software market. Going forward, Allegorithmic can help Adobe hit $10 billion in annual revenue.(Source: Jon Peddie Research)Anything that can boost the potential long-term growth of Creative Cloud deserves to be discussed here at Seeking Alpha. Content creation software subscription fees, not digital marketing (Adobe Experience Cloud), will remain Adobe's main growth catalyst for the next decade.As you can see from the screenshot below, Allegorithmic's Substance suite of products integrates with all the gaming/entertainment production platforms available today. Going forward, Adobe will monetize from a number of paying customers of game engines like Unreal and Unity. Allegorithmic also integrates with 3D/CGI content creation software programs like Maya, 3DS Max, Cinema 4D, and MODO. Maya and 3DS Max are Autodesk's (ADSK) premium subscription software solutions for game development and TV/movie CGI special effects. Allegorithmic Substance competes with Autodesk's $10/month Mudbox 3D digital painting and sculpting software product.(Source: Allegorithmic)Allegorithmic, Adobe Dimension CC, and Mixamo complement Adobe's growing encroachment on the 3D content creation moat of Autodesk. My fearless forecast is that Adobe will eventually have to acquire a third-party CAD (Computer Aided Design) software product which it can integrate with Creative Cloud. This will help Adobe disrupt Autodesk's lingering dominance in CAD software products.Allegorithmic's upcoming software product for augmented reality materials, Substance Alchemist, will not only benefit the video games and TV/movies industries but will also be perfect for augment reality CAD designs for architecture and civil engineering purposes.Creative Cloud's annual revenue could reach $7 billion if Adobe starts involving itself in the growing CAD software market. It was estimated that the CAD software market's size was $8.325 billion in 2017. It has a projected annual growth rate of 6.6% until 2023.Integrating Allegorithmic's 3D texture and material creation features in Adobe Photoshop, Dimension, After Effects, and Project Aero should boost Creative Cloud's quarterly subscription fees. My guesstimate is that Allegorithmic can add 10% to 20% to the estimated 12 million paying subscribers of Creative Cloud. A 10% increase in subscribers should translate to 10% boost in quarterly revenue (around $1.3 billion) from Creative Cloud business segment.Previously, Allegorithmic's software products are not cheap. The monthly subscription fee of Allegorithmic's Substance is $99.90 (for pro license users earning $100k to $100 million/year). This is 10x the $9.99 monthly fee we pay to use Adobe Photoshop CC. Adobe's entire Creative Cloud suite for teams (business users) costs only $79.99.Buying the physically-based materials library of Allegorithmic Substance cost $7,490. You also need to pay another $3,745 to get one-year updates for materials. I am not sure how Adobe will monetize Allegorithmic from hereon. I don't think Adobe will give away Allegorithmic materials library and software products for free.My theory is Adobe will charge additional monthly fees for Creative Cloud software products with integrated Allegorithmic's Substance technology and Materials libraries. My bet is that the pricey materials library (used for content creation, advertising, games and video entertainment) from Allegorithmic will be packaged inside Adobe Stock's most expensive package, $249.99/month.Crowd-sourced Adobe Stock is an under-appreciated reason to stay long on ADBE. It is a growth catalyst that can outpace the growth of Shutterstock (SSTK). Adobe takes 33% to 35% on every image/video/2D/3D image asset downloaded or bought at Adobe Stock platform. Adobe Stock integrates on all Creative Cloud software programs. If you are a clever graphic artist, using Adobe Stock assets can let you prosper on volume-based projects that depend more on a fast workflow.I am a photo/video editor. On a good month, I can make much more money contributing to Adobe Stock than writing investing ideas for Seeking Alpha or I Know First.(Source: Adobe)Design and content creation job orders are seasonal. It makes sense for game developers, CG artists, movie outfits, and TV producers to use Adobe Stock on a month-to-month for their 3D material requirements. It will be more cost-efficient than paying $7,490 upfront for Allegorithmic materials library.At the moment, we only use Photoshop to create 2D game assets, mobile/web user interface designs, edit photos, and layout birthday/wedding albums for printout. Going forward, many Adobe Stock crowd-sourced contributors can use Allegorithmic software/technologies with Adobe Photoshop to create 3D texture/materials.In the future, instead of only using Photoshop to make photostory albums like this one, I could also use it to create 3D texture materials for sale/rent at Adobe Stock.(Source: Motek Moyen)(Source: Motek Moyen)The invidious status of Adobe as the king of software for content creation is compelling reason to keep adding more ADBE shares. The persistent expansion of Creative Cloud to cover more aspects of design/content creation is a good sign that management is hungry for more growth. A dominant company that still touts insatiable appetite for growth is a buy-and-hold-forever investment.Adobe is growing its 3D content creation software portfolio with the acquisitions of Mixamo and Allegorithmic. I expect Adobe to eventually buy a competing rival to AutoCAD. Offering a subscription-based CAD software product can help Adobe improve its global ranking (no.3) in the $20 billion/quarter Enterprise Software-as-a-Service ((SaaS)) global industry.Further, software products are also thankfully immune to any China-U.S. tariff war. Unlike American hardware product-centric firms like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), China's communist rulers cannot easily threaten Creative Cloud's surging revenue stream."
4229308,102547,2018-12-19T21:57:26-05:00,"“Almost all creativity requires purposeful play” (Abraham Maslow).And certainly, on the creative software field, Adobe is the most purposeful player.Such purposefulness endowed this software maker with many premium features.But are you willing to pay a premium price to play along with it?","Image Source: Freerangestock Free Commercial ImagesPlease skip the following introduction if you have read my previous articles.What is a wonderful company, and what is 'quality merchandise' from an investing standpoint? The most constructive definition to address this question is Warren Buffett's concept of ""economic moat"", a long-lasting competitive advantage that allows a given company to harvest above-average returns on its capital, even when faced with economic downturns or powerful competitors.A quality investing strategy should, therefore, capture the fundamental nature of Buffett's philosophy. Here, the aim is to identify high-quality stocks - or ""compounders"" - trading at reasonable prices by calculating a simple Quality Score based on 13 fundamental factors related to the actual business and its intrinsic economic characteristics. These are (possibly) the qualitative and quantitative factors that best capture the elusive 'quality dimension' of a specific company, at least according to Buffett and to other investors in these best-of-breed companies like Charlie Munger, Chuck Akre, and Joel Greenblatt. The intention is not to discuss fleeting quarterly results (far from it) but rather to find and analyze superior companies and business models capable of compounding value for many years into the future. To calculate the Quality Score, we'll try to answer questions addressing the following aspects:1) Presence of strong and enduring competitive advantages; 2) Favorable market dynamics and relative positioning; 3) Presence of multiple and complementary cash flow generators; 4) Resilience to technological disruption and to obsolescence; 5) Presence of abundant and recurrent sales with low cyclicality; 6) Presence of market leadership; 7) Presence of pricing power; 8) Presence of high and persistent Cash Returns on Invested Capital; 9) Strong cash-generation ability; 10) Presence of superior gross profitability;11) Presence of superior revenue growth, with improving sales momentum; 12) Presence of solid risk management policies; 13) Strong financial position, with little debt.To calculate the Quality Score, one (1) point is awarded when the answer is fundamentally positive (""Yes""); minus one (-1) point is subtracted when the answer is essentially negative (""No""); no points are added or subtracted (0) when there is too much uncertainty, or when negative and positive factors are essentially in equilibrium. ""High-quality companies"" are the ones with a Quality Score of ""6"" or above. Let us then calculate the Quality Score for Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE).Adobe’s competitive advantages can be traced back to the firm’s evolutionary pathway. The history of Adobe Inc. starts at Xerox PARC, the research institute in Palo Alto where many revolutionary technologies were first developed – laser printing, the graphical user interface, and the modern PC, for instance, all hailed from this famous Californian venue. It was in such a thriving environment that John Warnock and Chuck Geschke started to develop a programming language designed to describe the exact size, position, and shape of the objects on a computer-generated page.Their language would function without reference to any particular printer or computer; as a consequence, any machine capable of interpreting it would also be able to generate a representation of any page and at any resolution supported by a specific device. This solved a serious problem of compatibility and standardization at a time when computers were starting to really take over the corporate realm. For two years Warnock and Geschke tried to persuade Xerox (XRX) to turn their promising language into a viable commercial product. However, Xerox - as was often the case with the company - once again failed to harness the creativity of its own people, and so they both decided to leave PARC to try to make it on their own.Named after a local creek, Adobe was thus born in December 1982. Three months later, they had a lucky break as Steve Jobs visited Adobe’s little office in Mountain View to assess the potential of ‘PostScript’, as the programming language came to be known. Impressed, Jobs invested USD 2.5 million into Adobe and gave them an advance on royalties. The injection of capital made Adobe the first company in the history of Silicon Valley to become lucrative in its first year of operations – and this financial cushion, in itself, would be instrumental to fuel Adobe’s expansion.Apple’s (AAPL) LaserWriter was the first printer to ship with Adobe’s PostScript language, in an event that would unleash the desktop publishing revolution of the ’80s. Licensing PostScript to manufacturers like HP (HPQ) and Apple brought Adobe a boatload of money that enabled the company to grow profitably and to support the successful release of its most iconic products.Adobe’s first-mover advantage was reinforced by its superior offeringsIndeed, the best was yet to come for the well-capitalized Adobe, as the potential offered by PostScript was not restricted to its original scope: as a page description language that defined objects in mathematical terms, PostScript also allowed for the development of an application capable of producing graphic outputs through a flexible vector format. Launched in 1987, this application became known as Adobe Illustrator, a truly groundbreaking product that transfigured the graphic design industry on a massive scale and, in doing so, it also transformed Adobe into a global behemoth focused on software.Adobe Photoshop, which was developed by Thomas and John Knoll, was released a mere 3 years later and quickly became the gold standard in digital photo editing thanks to its functionality, versatility, and depth of features. Furthermore, Photoshop was one of the first applications that enabled outside developers to add new features to the program via plug-ins; many developers took advantage of this architecture, a fact that solidified Photoshop’s dominance within its category.Adobe’s competitive advantages | Customer switching barriersSpearheaded by applications like Photoshop and Illustrator, the company’s sprawling offerings - which would later include references like InDesign and Premiere Pro, among many others - became deeply embedded in the daily workflow of countless personal and corporate customers. Despite this popularity, the problem with an application like Photoshop (and its kin) is that it requires a steep, long learning curve to be fully mastered. Once mastered, all these scores of customers become very reluctant to switch providers because of the financial costs and downtime risk to their businesses and, above all, because of the time it takes to learn how to use competing applications.Adobe has been doing an excellent job at cultivating this powerful switching barrier from an early stage: at attractive price points, the company provides colleges and universities unlimited access to the latest versions of its apps and services, making these institutions heavily dependent on Adobe’s offerings. Naturally, students introduced to Adobe’s software are much more likely to stick with the company once they have used its products and integrated them into their workflows. Indeed, the education system is an essential part of converting students into lifetime users.Such a strategy also helps to spread a set of key applications that are now indispensable to the proper functioning of the creative industry’s ecosystem. Indeed, students have a strong incentive to learn how to use Adobe’s products (because the industry uses them extensively), and companies also have a strong incentive to continually embrace the firm’s software (because new hires arrive with a deep, proficient understanding of Adobe’s latest offerings). This phenomenon creates a virtuous cycle that perpetuates Adobe’s dominance. Today, these barriers are not limited to any particular application because Adobe’s full range of SaaS offerings creates intrinsically sticky relationships between the company and its customers.Adobe’s competitive advantages | Network externalitiesBy creating a shared language and a widely understood platform, Adobe’s monolithic grip on the creative fields has also created positive network externalities to the benefit of the company. Following Metcalfe’s and Reed’s Laws, these positive network effects are generated when the value of a product or service increases as the number of users also increases.In 1993, the company introduced the Adobe Acrobat product family. This initiative provided a standard format for electronic document distribution (the famous .PDF file format), in an event that once again had a transformative effect on the way documents are produced and shared. By chance or by design, it was perhaps with Acrobat that Adobe first realized the power of networks: when the company made its Reader available for free in order to support the more price-sensitive side of this ‘two-sided’ network (the people reading the documents), this in itself created strong demand for Adobe’s document writer (arising from the people producing the documents), which was the network’s profitable side. Therefore, Adobe was subsidizing one side of the network to make money on the network’s opposing side.Such positive externalities arise in the so-called Platform-mediated Networks (PMNs), which include a network of users who need to interact with each other (in this case, Adobe’s customers), along with an intermediary (Adobe itself) that provides a given platform (like Creative Cloud) which encompasses the means that facilitate users’ interactions.So, for instance, if a freelance graphic designer wants to edit and change a certain vector file for resale, he can buy it on Adobe Stock and then work on it with Adobe Illustrator; then, he can share the result of his work with a prospective client (say, a small marketing & advertising agency); however, to open the file for review and proofreading, the client must have a vector graphics editor (and chances are that this editor will be Illustrator); if satisfied with the finished artwork, the client can then send the file for mass printing; however, to maintain consistency, the printing company - such as Cimpress NV’s (CMPR) Vistaprint - will also need to open it using Illustrator (in fact, Vistaprint recommends the upload of files created with Adobe’s software).What is circulating between all these players? The .EPS and .AI file formats, which are preferentially created and edited with Adobe’s applications. The .EPS format (Encapsulated PostScript) is one of the most common vector image formats along with the .AI format (which is proprietary). Both are the standard interchange formats in the graphics and print industries. The same kind of interplay occurs throughout the industry with other Adobe applications and their resulting formats (like the pervasive .PSD format produced by Photoshop). Of course, all these formats can be created and edited using other programs –like Inkscape and GIMP, which are free, open-source applications - but the potential loss of functionality and compatibility is always a risk.Such network externalities are a powerful competitive advantage because they create barriers to exit (for existing users) and barriers to entry (for competitors). They are often self-reinforcing, too. But Adobe also benefits from ‘complementary networks’. Such networks arise when two or more products are more useful and valuable to customers when they are used together. Example: Premiere Pro users (hailing from a major film studio like Warner Bros., for instance) can dynamically link compositions from After Effects, edit audio clips in Audition, import complex raster files from Photoshop, and then queue and export sequences in Media Encoder. All of these programs from Adobe work better in tandem, therefore removing the hassle of using disjointed, piecemeal solutions from different providers. This complementary network magnifies Adobe’s hold on the market by keeping customers locked inside the company’s platforms.Experience Cloud also forms a potent complementary network. With it, Adobe has developed a comprehensive digital marketing hub that supports the full lifecycle of marketing strategies - spanning advertising, marketing, and analytics - that sets it apart from competitors like Oracle (ORCL) and Salesforce (CRM). Experience Cloud’s all-inclusive functionality (which was developed both organically and via acquisitions such as Omniture, Marketo, and Magento) has made it the clear market leader at a time when Adobe’s corporate customers are increasingly interested in crafting targeted omnichannel advertising campaigns. Having such a wide-ranging, complementary solution has also endowed Adobe with a sustainable competitive advantage.Adobe’s Competitive Advantages | High Benefit/Low-Cost Proposition Adobe’s newfound ability to offer superior products at much cheaper entry prices has created yet another competitive advantage. The High Benefit/Low-Cost advantage arises when acquisition costs for a product or service are comparatively low, but the extracted benefits (actual or perceived) are substantial or even mission-critical, creating a value disconnect that makes price considerations largely secondary for the end customer. In the past, Adobe used to make expensive applications that were outside the pricing range of vast swathes of potential users. Indeed, a few years back, prices on its Creative Suite bundle started at USD 1300 and went as high as USD 2600, depending on the chosen version.Adobe’s transition from selling boxed products to selling cloud-based subscriptions has therefore benefited its customers by providing more flexibility and significantly lower entry prices (many users think that this fact is debatable, but the growth in subscriptions tells otherwise): now, customers can select the sort of subscription that better fulfills their requirements, and Adobe’s revamped model has also abolished the hefty up-front costs that characterized the firm’s past propositions.The transition also aided the company by locking in clients for extended periods and by restricting piracy to negligible levels (in fact, in a twisted way, Adobe benefited from piracy because ‘pirates’ helped to spread the usage of very expensive applications that wouldn’t otherwise become so widely known, learned and accepted).Now, prices on Adobe’s Creative Cloud different packages start at USD 9.99 per month (for individuals wanting just Photoshop and Lightroom) or at USD 33.99 per month (for businesses using a single app). With such entry prices, competition will have a hard time convincing potential customers to switch providers in favor of untested, unknown, or inferior applications. Moreover, most competitors won’t be able to undercut Adobe on these prices because doing so for longer periods would (quite possibly) compromise their profitability and even their viability as a business.Adobe’s Competitive Advantages | Strong brandKnown for reinventing itself and, in doing so, reinventing its industry, the company’s brand is associated with a string of pioneering offerings that connected the creative and technological worlds in an indelible manner. Not surprisingly, Adobe is still considered by Forbes as one of the world’s most innovative companies in a context dominated by the so-called ‘Cloud Kings’ such as Salesforce and ServiceNow (NOW). Today, the brand continues to grow and to gain notoriety as it diversifies into the marketing services and advertising tech industries. That much is attested by the fact that Adobe has logged a 14% annual brand value increase from 2011 to 2018, according to Interbrand’s 100 Best Global Brands ranking.This exceptional performance still places it behind rivals Oracle and IBM (IBM) - which are seated at number 12 and 19 in the ranking, respectively - but well ahead Salesforce (which sits at number 71). However, both Adobe and Salesforce are among the fastest growers within tech, whereas IBM and Oracle actually saw their brand value erode over the last few years. Adobe is also one of the fastest growers on Brand Finance’s U.S. 500 Most Valuable Brands. On the basis of total shareholder returns (TSR), Adobe is equally one of the top ten performers among BCG’s Top 50 Large-Cap Value Creators: the firm’s 5-year TSR of 36% is much higher than the median TSR (15.6%) for all of the more than 2400 companies in BCG’s database.Tellingly, the wider digital economy is so attractive that, rather than seeing only cut-throat competition between the largest players, we are also seeing prospective rivals collaborating with each other in order to dominate such a vast and profitable market. Adobe is now cooperating with IBM, SAP, and Microsoft at various levels - after all, war can be bad for business. Armed with cutting-edge technologies and aided by a prominent position in its markets, Adobe is poised to benefit from the increasing adoption of digital media, digital marketing and digital sales within the ever-growing digital economy sphere.Creative Cloud Main Growth DriversExpected to reach a value of USD 29.2 billion by 2021, the addressable market for Adobe’s creative software is an arena where the firm faces highly fragmented competition. This expanding market is being driven by powerful trends such as the proliferation of digital devices and the strong growth in web content consumption. As attested by the popularity of image-based social networks like Instagram and Pinterest, rich imagery is becoming an increasingly important means of communication in today’s world; moreover, the robust shift to visual-centric marketing and the mounting deployment of visual plays to engage consumers across devices and channels will certainly boost the demand for Adobe’s flagship applications. It is reasonable to assume that no other company will profit as much as Adobe from the growth in this market. On a global basis, the number of active individual and team subscriptions to Creative Cloud is projected to reach 19.7 million by 2024, a figure that translates a staggering increase of 64% since 2017.Document Cloud Main Growth DriversAnticipated to reach a value of USD 7.5 billion by 2021, the addressable market for Document Cloud is the smallest among Adobe’s core markets. By leveraging its status as the lingua franca for electronic documents, the .PDF / Acrobat family of solutions is also well-positioned to capture further growth as businesses across the globe ditch physical paper files in favor of digital documents, and as digital signing gains widespread acceptance (in the U.S. alone, the digital signature market is anticipated to witness a 20% CAGR between 2018 and 2023). These trends are being propelled by rapid digitization and by the increased penetration of smartphones and other devices both in developed and developing geographies.Experience Cloud Growth DriversCompanies of all areas of activity are embracing digital marketing software in order to implement, analyze, and improve their marketing campaigns. In today’s market context, in which impeccable customer experience is paramount to continued success, they have to. Furthermore, according to research from IDC and Gartner, many of the leading companies in the world are now expecting to shift their marketing focus from traditional, offline channels (like TV and print) to mobile, digital channels (like smartphones and tablets, which provide access to mobile apps, social networks, and messaging systems). After all, that’s where customers are spending most of their time.According to Juniper Research, digital advertising spend across wearable, mobile and online devices will surpass USD 285 billion by 2020, up from 160 billion in 2016. In turn, such ‘digital transformation’ is creating an ocean of prized data that needs to be addressed in a timelier, more personalized, and more effective manner. This circularity, through which marketing practices are developed, measured, and then redeveloped again to obtain better results, is a large part of what Adobe intends to explore with Experience Cloud.Driven by the need to implement such complex cross-platform and multi-channel marketing strategies, the broader Digital Marketing Software (DMS) market is expected to grow at a CAGR of about 17% through to 2022; however, given its leadership and comprehensive, all-inclusive offerings, it is not unreasonable to accept that Adobe will capture more of this growth than most competitors (with the probable exception of Salesforce).This completeness of offerings serves Adobe well because if, for instance, a particular company like Coca-Cola (KO) badly needs to improve its marketing campaigns (which it needs), this company can use Experience Cloud in a truly integrated manner to target underpenetrated subsets of the population (in Coca-Cola’s case, the 18- to 24-year-old demographic) across social media, e-mail, Coca-Cola’s own websites, and YouTube (90% of U.S. adults ages 18 to 24 watch online video weekly); such approach requires the creation of countless pieces of artwork (to keep content well-adapted to every screen and platform), and also automated media buying and personalization capabilities, three functions that are equally provided by Adobe; once content is created and launched, Experience Cloud then gives Coca-Cola a centralized tool to re-orchestrate and analyze all cross-channel marketing campaigns in order to drive better engagement across touchpoints. And, finally, many of these steps can be enhanced by Sensei, Adobe’s artificial intelligence engine.As seen by the example above, DMS incorporates distinct and sought-after tools that include, among others, web analytics, market automation software and lead management products. With the recent acquisition of Marketo, Adobe has assimilated a highly competitive B2B marketing and lead management product to compete against Oracle and Salesforce in a market that is expected to witness a CAGR of 17% through to 2022.Via yet another landmark acquisition (Magento), Adobe has also established a solid foothold in the e-commerce software market, an arena that is anticipated to expand at a CAGR of about 20% over the next 4 to 5 years; on the other hand, the marketing automation software market is estimated to record a CAGR of approximately 9% over the same period, a much slower but still interesting growth rate. All this growth is creating substantial prospects for vendors like Adobe, which is set to continue growing at a fast clip as companies and advertisers shift their marketing spending toward higher ROI digital platforms.Adobe is now one of the largest and most well-diversified software companies in the world. The company is currently organized into 3 distinct segments: Digital Media, Digital Experience and Publishing.Adobe’s Segments | PublishingPublishing, the smallest segment, includes legacy offerings such as eLearning and web conferencing solutions, technical document publishing and high-end printing. A sizable part of the revenue generated by this segment comes from licensing Postscript/PDF-based technologies to OEMs that manufacture printers and other output devices. Printing is losing its importance as paper and physical systems are replaced by fully digital workflows.Adobe’s Segments | Digital MediaStill the company’s largest segment, Digital Media provides services, products, and solutions that enable individuals, teams and companies to create, publish and promote their media content through Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. This segment encompasses Adobe’s flagship applications for web designers, graphic designers, developers, architects, photographers, animators, and videographers, among many other workers and professionals. Endowed with a profusion of applications developed over several decades (like Photoshop, Adobe XD or After Effects), Creative Cloud’s depth and breadth are unmatched in the industry.Targeted at knowledge professionals who create and distribute documents - like lawyers, architects, and engineers, among countless others - Document Cloud is built around the Acrobat family of products and services. With this platform, customers are able to produce secure documents that can be edited, printed, scanned, signed, shared or filled out using services and electronic document capabilities that are often crucial to accomplish a certain purpose (like replicating and interpreting architectural plans drawn at precise scales).Adobe’s Segments | Digital ExperienceIn turn, Digital Experience offers services, solutions and the development of personalized experiences at scale for creating, managing, executing, measuring and optimizing digital marketing and advertising campaigns across multiple channels. Adobe’s Experience Cloud entails 4 distinct offerings targeted at marketers, data scientists, developers and CMOs (again, among others): Marketing Cloud, Analytics Cloud, Advertising Cloud, and Commerce Cloud. The M&A initiatives that led to the establishment of this comprehensive set of solutions - like the acquisition of Omniture in 2009 - seemed risky and devoid of synergistic potential. But that was not the case.In reality, for any company, digital content is currently at the core of most marketing initiatives. However, up until recent times, the effect of this digital content on prospective and existing customers/shoppers was not being truly measured in a systematic, discerning manner. By marrying Creative Cloud with Experience Cloud, what Adobe aims to deliver to its clients is a unified, all-encompassing view of their marketing and advertising efforts. Thus, as a matter of fact, Adobe’s two main growth engines are very synergistic.Adobe’s expertise in creative media has enabled the firm to expand seamlessly into the digital marketing arena by cross-selling its Digital Experience solutions to C-suite execs who already managed people utilizing Adobe’s Digital Media applications. That wasn’t a hard sell because, over the last decade, the development of tailored customer engagement initiatives through digital means has rapidly become a crucial aspect of doing business. Since digital marketing is essential to foster sales, nowadays virtually all companies need sophisticated tools to get insights into the real efficacy of their concerted campaigns across channels.Experience Cloud, which targets this blossoming market, has large opportunities for continued expansion. Moreover, Adobe is now positioned to harness the power of Artificial Intelligence and Big Data to provide long-lasting, mission-critical services to its customers. All in all, regarding its varied and comprehensive range of solutions, Adobe truly delivers more than the sum of its parts.Innovation cycles in the ‘MarTech’ (Marketing Technologies) industry are typically short or very short - the industry is currently in an accelerated state of flux, as every player strives to offer the most advanced solutions for the cost incurred by customers. Within this fast-paced arena, there is now a veritable zoo of products in the offing that include solutions for ‘Public Relations Tech’, ‘Conversational Interfaces’, ‘Offline Tracking’, ‘Creative Optimization’, ‘Voice Agents’ and so on. A casual look at Scott Brinker’s famous ‘Marketing Technology Landscape Supergraphic’ (see below) is enough to realize how intricate, competitive and inventive the MarTech ecosystem has become. With one disruptive idea after another hitting the battleground, the burden to rise above competitors has now reached feverish levels.Image source: chiefmartech.comTo stay ahead of this mad game, Adobe needs to offer highly differentiated products and services on a regular basis but it also needs to stay focused, cost-effective and relevant – a difficult balancing act that has made a long procession of victims throughout the past (both Oracle and IBM, for instance, have somewhat fallen by the wayside as cloud-based companies like Salesforce gained relevance over the last few years).Of course, together with its largest peers, Adobe still enjoys a leading and seemingly impregnable position within the MarTech space; however, just about any tiny competitor showed on the graph above can be a candidate to unleash creative destruction in the years ahead. Indeed, it is known that disruptive innovations tend to be created by entrepreneurs in start-ups rather than created in market-leading firms like Adobe.Why? Because disruptive innovations are not profitable enough when they start their erratic ascent, and also because developing them to fruition often diverts resources needed to wage battle against other large incumbents. Being so, Adobe is not worried at the moment with BIGVU, for instance, but it is certainly monitoring what SAP, Salesforce and Oracle intend to do going forward. And Adobe must do just that, because even though it occupies a top position in MarTech (a narrower front), the company cannot combine its marketing applications with Customer Relationship Management applications (a wider front) and that’s something SAP, Oracle and Salesforce can do with ease for any given customer.On the other hand, the running costs imposed by Creative Cloud’s SaaS model left large swathes of potential subscribers unhappy with Adobe (to say the least). While no other competitor can match the depth and breadth of Creative Cloud, lower-priced applications - like Corel and QuarkXPress - might take share in niche markets if Adobe starts to raise prices more aggressively. Indeed, companies within tech frequently find themselves in a position in which they must sprint as fast as they can just to stay in the same place. And Adobe is no exception.Adobe already possessed a strong business model before 2012-2013. With the shift to a cloud-based subscription model, its business became even stronger. In fact, as soon as a certain critical mass is reached in the number of captive customers, the SaaS model becomes one of the strongest businesses models in existence.There is remarkable leverage and scalability in an arrangement that has repeatable revenues and largely fixed CapEx requirements. One of the more attractive characteristics of such a model is that the marginal cost of each incremental sale is minuscule or practically inexistent; for Adobe, the SaaS model also brought other remarkable benefits that included better access to growth, higher levels of customer retention, and lower economic sensitivity.Furthermore, through different strategies, the new model facilitated the upsell of services into the existing subscriber base: for instance, by leveraging its SaaS platform, Adobe can instantly capitalize on its freemium offerings (products with stripped back functionality which incentivize the upgrade to paid versions) like Adobe’s XD or Spark, to constrain churn and to lock in new customers. In fact, Adobe can realize a sizable profit by persuading even a small percentage of users to pay for a fully-featured version of a given product with such a strategy.Another compelling attribute of this business model is that providers are often paid in advance for products and services; being so, customers are a de facto source of funding for the company. While it needs to recognize the revenue as offerings are being delivered, the company has the benefit of upfront cash, a fact that provides plentiful liquidity and optionality. No wonder then that companies like Veeva (VEEV), Workday (WDAY) and ServiceNow have, quite rapidly, become dominant forces within their respective industries - and no wonder then that ‘old tech’ companies like Microsoft and Adobe became suddenly rejuvenated when they successfully moved their biggest businesses to a model based on recurrent sales.Regarding creative software, there’s Adobe reigning supreme and then there’s all the rest. It is estimated that the company owns more than 50% of the digital content creation software market, a share that grants Adobe a quasi-monopolistic position in this growing arena. Anywhere in the world, whenever a person views an image, graphic, webpage, video, magazine, flyer, billboard or digital advertisement, there is a high likelihood that such media content was created or touched using Adobe’s software. Also, a proficient utilization of Adobe’s software is one of the top skills companies demand in jobs emphasizing creativity.Adobe’s share in this market is expected to expand to nearly 80% by 2023. As a consequence, it is not completely inappropriate to say that Adobe dictates the course of the creative industry and - in so doing so - it brings standardization and interoperability to a whole ecosystem. Photoshop, in particular, has conquered such a virtual monopoly in raster graphics editing that ‘photoshop’ has been converted into a verb. Today, many people ‘photoshop’ images as much as they ‘google’ for information. This is the ultimate compliment to a product and a phenomenon that clearly demonstrates how pervasive and dominant that product is.Through Experience Cloud, Adobe is also a market leader in digital experience platforms, a broad offering that covers digital marketing, commerce, analytics, and advertising. Adobe is currently one of the largest providers of software for retailers, for CPG manufacturers, for higher education organizations, and for leisure and hospitality companies. According to the company, Adobe Experience Cloud helps its customers manage more than 150 trillion data transactions per year (that include 41 trillion rich media requests), over 150 billion e-mails, and over USD 3 billion in advertising spend. Currently, two-thirds of Fortune 100 companies utilize the firm’s solutions to obtain customer intelligence.Adobe is indeed one of the most dominant companies in the technology sector. But is this dominance translated into actual wealth creation (regardless of the stock price, sales growth, or EPS)? To answer this question, we need to calculate the company’s returns on invested capital and then compare the results with its cost of capital.Here, the calculation of returns on invested capital will follow the methodology proposed by Michael Mauboussin; however, Free Cash Flow was used instead of NOPAT in the numerator. The objective is to assess how much actual cash the company was able to generate based on each dollar it invested into its operations. Thus, CROIC might be preferable to ROIC in this circumstance.To compare cash returns and WACC, let’s then use Aswath Damodaran’s data and assume that Adobe’s cost of capital hovered between 6.5% and 7.5% over the last 10 years of operations. As shown by the graph, Adobe’s cash returns have always exceeded comfortably its cost of capital.The returns are also exceptionally high except for the period when the company was investing more heavily in order to execute its transition. The firm’s CROIC has been trending up in a consistent manner from 2013 onwards, and this uplift subsequently accelerated due (most probably) to a blend of structural advantages, effective capital allocation, and market share gains.That much is equally reflected by the firm’s Book Value per Share, which increased by 31.8% between 2012 and 2018; it seems that Adobe is really creating tangible (and not merely speculative) wealth for its shareholders.The graph below also seems to corroborate this thesis, as it shows a wide and largely favorable spread (illustrated by the red polygons) between the year-over-year growth rate of FCF and the year-over-year growth rate of Invested Capital over the last few years. Most of the time, FCF generation increased faster or much faster than the company’s reinvestment rate (please note: caution is needed when interpreting this graph, because investments can take several years to bear fruit; this graph is only useful as a possible indication of the trend and magnitude of the spread between IC and FCF).All in all, it seems that capital allocation at Adobe has been highly accretive to shareholders’ returns. In part, this graph also explains why Adobe’s fourth-quarter and fiscal 2018 results came ahead of consensus expectations on revenue but missed on the bottom line. There’s a cost to growth, and again IC and EPS/FCF growth are about to cross their paths. However, when the company’s competitive advantages and expanding markets are taken into account, there’s no reason to think that Adobe’s latest investments won’t reward shareholders over the next few years.Cash flow is the basis for a sound business. Naturally, firms that generate plentiful cash - and that exhibit the capacity to compound it for many years into the future - are more valuable than the average company. To evaluate Adobe’s cash-generative capabilities (which are outstanding), the following parameters will be used:Positive Free Cash Flow Generation: Adobe has always been Free Cash Flow-positive over the last decade, a period through which cash flow generation actually increased by 250% (from USD 998 million in 2009 to 3493 million in 2017-2018, using TTM figures).Free Cash Flow to Sales: Producing plentiful FCF is always desirable but the amount should be placed in context. In this instance, FCF/Sales ratios above 10% indicate a very high ability to turn sales into hard cash, which is what matters in the end. Adobe's current FCF/Sales (TTM) ratio is 40.8%, a truly exceptional percentage that translates a very healthy conversion of sales into free cash flow; on average, this number has been around the 34.6% mark during the last 5 years of activity.Cash Conversion Rate: As measured by Free Cash Flow/Net Income, Adobe's CCR averaged 251% between 2013 and 2017. Again, this reflects an impressive conversion rate, since ratios above 100% usually mean excellent liquidity. Here, Adobe also tops its peer group by a wide margin (Microsoft’s and Oracle’s CCR averaged 161% and 177%, respectively, over the same period). There is a relationship between the accrual ratio and the CCR. Calculated as (Net Income-FCF)/Total Assets, the accrual ratio provides a means to identify companies with low non-cash earnings relative to their cash flow. When FCF is greater than net income (translated in a CCR > 1), cash earnings are higher than accrual earnings, which usually means that earnings quality is high.CapEx/Operating Cash Flow (5-year average): As demonstrated by this ratio, Adobe does not need to reinvest a large chunk of the cash generated internally just to keep on operating: making Adobe an exceedingly capital-light business, on average CapEx consumed only 13.6% of Adobe's OCF over the last 5 years. This ratio has been trending down consistently since Adobe’s transition, and now stands at only 7%. Together with the company’s high returns, this ratio shows that Adobe is capable of generating surplus capital with relative ease.Defined as the ability to raise prices in excess of inflation without losing customers, ‘pricing power’ is a subtle concept that Warren Buffett deems as one of the most important parameters an investor should evaluate when assessing the quality of a business. Buffett also mentioned that gross margins are a good quantitative indicator of a firm’s pricing power. If that is indeed the case, then the power is with Adobe.As shown on the graph, Adobe’s intra-industry gross margins are very high both in a relative and in an absolute sense. However, by themselves, gross margins are not enough to define pricing power. The first reason is that margins can be impacted by non-price factors; the second reason is that both returns on capital and market share fluctuations must also be taken into account in this regard: achieving high gross margins can be pointless if competitors are eating away returns and market share. But Adobe’s returns on operating capital are improving and revenues are rising, two trends that indicate that Adobe is probably healthier than ever despite the company’s risky transition to a SaaS model.Before 2012-2013 Adobe was driving revenue growth by raising average selling prices and by moving customers up the value ladder; such approach wasn’t sustainable over the long run, though, because the firm was probably approaching the limits of its pricing strategy. The products were becoming too expensive for all the small businesses that relied on Adobe’s offerings to produce creative content. The shift to subscriptions from perpetual licenses has allowed the company to expand profit margins and to reduce customer price sensitivity.However, the company has never focused on being the low-cost provider within the industry - quite the contrary, from the get-go Adobe has always strived to differentiate itself on non-price factors such as well-calculated acquisitions, diverse go-to-market strategies and (above all) meaningful innovation. Willingly or not, customers pay higher prices because the brand is synonymous of quality, completeness, and interoperability. The impressive rate of adoption of Adobe’s cloud-based services since 2012 (and the growth in the average revenue per subscriber) is the definite testament to the high degree of pricing power yielded by the company. All in all, Adobe is the archetypal premium brand that beats rivals while charging much more for its services and solutions.A consistent body of research shows that companies with low asset growth tend to outperform companies with high asset growth. For U.S. firms, much of this asset growth is fueled by large acquisitions. Unfortunately, despite all the hype surrounding acquisitive moves, M&A is usually a source of value destruction. This is the reason why, when evaluating the quality of a business, an important aspect to consider is the company's profitability in relation to its total assets (as calculated by dividing gross profits by total assets). In this calculation, gross profits are used instead of bottom-line results because they are not usually affected by accounting tricks; also, gross profits are not distorted by Advertising and R&D expenses, or by other capital expenditures incurred to maintain or improve the competitive positioning of a particular business.There's no hard-and-fast rule to analyze a given company along this dimension, but the calculation should be made both with and without goodwill just to make sure the firm is not overpaying for unproductive acquisitions over time. In Adobe's case, on average, goodwill was responsible for about 44% of the company's total assets throughout the last half-decade. This shows that Adobe has been an acquisitive company.To fulfill a minimum level of profitability generated by acquisitions - and by the respective asset growth - Adobe must have been capable to exceed a year-over-year ratio of 1:3 between gross profits and total assets over the last few years of activity. As shown by the graph, Adobe has always exceeded the minimum amount of asset profitability except for the period between 2013 and 2014 (the graphic shows gross profitability including goodwill). Adobe gradually became the most profitable company among its peer group but that situation will probably change to reflect the company’s latest (and sizable) acquisitions.Moody's assigns a relatively positive 'A3' long-term rating to the company, with a stable outlook. The firm's current Altman Z-Score of ‘9.0’ places Adobe well inside the 'safe zone'; long-term debt and other long-term liabilities only account for 18% of the company’s total current liabilities, whereas cash and short-term investments comprise 32% of Adobe’s total current assets. At the present, Adobe has an adequate Piotroski F-Score of '7' (out of 9) that is being penalized by a lower year-over-year current ratio and by augmented year-over-year financial leverage. This is still a consequence of Adobe’s latest acquisitions (especially of Marketo Inc.), which Moody’s views as “strategically sound as it expands Adobe's digital marketing capabilities by adding an established cloud-based marketing platform”. Moody’s also reasserts that “strong EBITDA growth and cash flow generation will lead to a rapid decline in financial leverage post-acquisition and replenishment of its cash balances.” Standing at only 0.30, Adobe's debt-to-capital ratio seems perfectly manageable by this cash machine; moreover, operating income covers 32 times the firm's interest expense. Standing at 1.66 and 1.68, respectively, Adobe's current and quick ratios are also quite manageable. All in all, the firm exhibits very strong liquidity, but it does not possess a perfectly immaculate balance sheet. One thing seems certain, though: Adobe won’t be caught swimming naked when the liquidity tide starts to go out.A business like Adobe faces many systemic risks, including unfavorable currency fluctuations, breaches of intellectual property rights, heightened trade barriers for certain technologies and, of course, technological disruption. However, investors should also stay attentive to company-specific risks, particularly regarding acquisitions, ‘key man risk’, and failure to attract and retain brainpower.AcquisitionsLarge tech companies like Adobe are extremely complex organizations: they offer an enormous assortment of solutions; they serve B2C and B2B markets; they are present both in developed and in developing nations; they sell their products and services through a convoluted network of channels; and they inhabit a vast, thick jungle populated by a wide variety of partners, rivals, systems, and technologies. As a consequence, it is easy to fall prey to all kinds of distractions and forget true strategic imperatives.On the flip side, these companies cannot afford to be complacent when it comes to grabbing nascent markets: to stay relevant over the long haul in a fiercely competitive market, a company like Adobe also needs to gain critical mass (fast) through well-thought acquisitions. Without large, methodical, and well-integrated acquisitions, Adobe wouldn’t be the force that it is today. But while Adobe has excelled at extracting synergies from acquisitions, prospective investors should realize that overpaying for targets remains a considerable risk in this overheated marketplace.Adobe’s latest and largest purchase is a case in point. There’s no reliable way to determine the number of sales generated by Marketo prior to the acquisition, but a very rough estimate places it at around USD 450-500 million. Such figures would mean that Adobe has paid a hefty price equivalent to around 10 times Marketo’s sales. The acquisition made strategic sense, as it filled a large gap and strengthened Adobe’s offerings in the business-to-business market; Marketo was also recognized as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for CRM Lead Management, and so this is not some untested, speculative provider. Still, the acquisition seems expensive.Unexpected Changes in ManagementThe firm’s management pulled off an impressive feat when they navigated Adobe through the transition from perpetual to subscription licensing. Having pivoted faster than any other major software company in history, Adobe is rightly judged as a great success story. Indeed, it was not easy to steer such a large and complex ship across the rogue waves of disruption: amid a rapidly evolving technology-driven landscape, many customers were intensely displeased with the change, many competitors were ready to steal market share, and many analysts were skeptical of the transformation. Not only has management proved naysayers wrong, but they have also expanded the company into the digital marketing space with aplomb while maintaining high levels of profitability. With such a pristine record, financial markets would certainly punish any unexpected changes in Adobe’s management team.Talent Attraction and Retention:“Go after the cream of the cream. A small team of A+ players can run circles around a giant team of B and C players.” - Steve Jobs certainly understood the extreme importance of hiring and retaining top talent for today’s skills- and knowledge-based companies. As stated by Conference Board in 2016, failure to attract and retain top talent was the most pressing problem faced by CEOs on a global basis, well ahead of other persistent issues such as competitive intensity and economic growth.But real talent is very scarce, and the scarcer it becomes, the harder it will be to retain it for the long haul. In fact, according to a controversial explanation, one of the most important factors behind Silicon Valley’s continued success is the fact that courts in California refuse to enforce contracts suppressing employee mobility. Free to hop from one employer to another (or to start their own businesses), talented employees help to spread ideas, skills, and technologies between competing firms.Such unintended ‘cross-pollination” is a double-edged sword, of course. So, how good is Adobe at keeping its talent happy? Well, the good news is that, according to Glassdoor and Great Place To Work (GPTW for short), Adobe is still one of the best companies to work for (in an absolute sense); the bad news, however, is that Adobe is trailing several direct competitors such as Salesforce and HubSpot (HUBS) on these wide-followed review sites.On Glassdoor’s ranking, Adobe occupies the 31st place, well behind Google, HubSpot, SAP, and Salesforce. But on GPTW’s ranking, Salesforce (at 1st place) is the only direct competitor doing better than Adobe (at 23rd). IBM and Oracle are absent from both rankings, whereas Microsoft appears at the 39th place on Glassdoor’s classification. There’s enough room for improvement, but it seems that Adobe is doing a relatively good job on this front (as shown above, the differences between the companies are minimal). Salesforce is on the hunt, though.It is known that the company has had no problems on the sales front. Quite the contrary: fiscal fourth-quarter results marked Adobe’s 15th successive quarter of sales growth, with record revenue of USD 2.46 billion translating a year-over-year increase of 23%. Broad-based sales growth across all segments and geographies echoed the strong demand surrounding the company’s offerings and Adobe’s outstanding pricing power.Revenue generated from the Digital Media segment expanded to USD 1.71 billion, with a contribution of 1.45 billion from Creative Cloud (up 23% y-o-y) and a contribution of 259 million from Document Cloud (up 10% y-o-y). Digital Experience generated sales of USD 690 million, up 25% when compared with the prior-year quarter. Adobe beat consensus expectations on sales but it missed to some extent on the bottom line due both to foreign exchange headwinds and to greater than expected costs arising from the Marketo acquisition.This acquisition is weighing on projected earnings, but the negative effects should be transient. Confounded by its typical myopic view, the market overreacted to the news without properly considering that Marketo and Magento are large and recent acquisitions that still need to be fully integrated into Adobe’s ecosystem. Even for Adobe, it won’t be easy to effectively assimilate the technologies, operations, services, products and all the employees that arrived with the two companies: despite its strategic fit and synergistic properties, these acquisitions won’t certainly bear fruit overnight (and both were too expensive, admittedly). The acquisition of Marketo, the leader in lead management, only closed in October but it added USD 21 million in sales for the quarter. On its part, Magento will surely gain importance as e-commerce lifts-off around the globe.More relevant for the current context is the firm’s strong organic expansion. Remarkable growth added net new Digital Media annualized recurring revenue (ARR) of 430 million dollars, with Adobe finishing the year with USD 6.71 billion of Digital Media ARR. About 88% of Adobe’s revenues are now generated from recurring sources, a growing percentage that will smooth the firm’s cyclicality and bolster customer switching costs. In addition, Adobe’s current churn rate (the proportion of subscribers who leave during a given period) is believed to be very low. Adobe is projecting revenue of USD 11.15 billion for 2019, an amount that translates a healthy year-on-year expansion of 23%. Adobe also predicts a marked acceleration of 34% for its Digital Experience segment. Overall, the firm's financial results, growing percentage of ARR, positive guidance and expanding offerings suggest business is still going strong for the software titan, and that Adobe’s long-term growth drivers remain solidly in place.Relative Valuation | Price Multiples: Adobe is highly rated by the financial markets, and perhaps too much so. The company’s current PEG ratio does not seem excessive, though. In general, Adobe is now trading above its 5-year average price multiples, and well beyond the valuations of its peer group. This is not surprising, but there’s nothing here pointing to an eventual mispricing.Absolute Valuation | Discounted Cash Flow Analysis: Adobe's year-over-year cash flows were rather volatile over the last decade. In large part, this is still a consequence of the company’s successful transformation: on the one hand, the transition depressed free cash flows between 2012 and 2015; on the other hand, it has then swelled cash generation by so much (by 265%, no less, between 2013 and 2017-2018) that the latest values have completely distorted the sample’s standard deviation.Indeed, Adobe’s free cash flow stability* only reaches a low value of 0.47; in contrast, bastions of stability like Coca-Cola (KO) or Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) are capable of reaching values around 0.85. At first blush, such volatility doesn’t seem to provide much confidence to model the company’s future cash flows using a DCF analysis. However, the transition is nearing completion and subscriptions will smooth the path going forward. The DCF analysis will project cash flows over the next 5 years of business. *As calculated by 1-(Standard Deviation/Mean Standard Deviation).Estimation of Operating Cash Profits: Main AssumptionsRevenues: In aggregate, the model projects revenue growth of 15%-17% through to 2022-2023, with distinct contributions from Creative Cloud (CAGR of 17%-19%), Document Cloud (CAGR of 7%-9%) and Experience Cloud (CAGR of 18%-20%). The reasons behind this growth were discussed above, on Question 2; the model assumes that Adobe will maintain a leading position in its core markets and that it will grow revenues slightly faster than most competitors with the exclusion of Salesforce.Cost of Goods Sold | Gross Margins: On average, COGS were equivalent to 14.6% of revenues over the last 5 years. In order to keep assumptions conservative, the model assumes a range between 13.5% and 15%. As a consequence, the numbers also imply gross margins within the 85%-86.5% interval. The cloud-based subscription model allowed the company to improve margins, but labor costs will probably increase due to the shortage of talent tech companies are facing. In the future, it will be even harder to attract and retain talented individuals and teams.SG&A expenses / R&D investments | Operating Margins: On average, SG&A expenses were equal to 46.6% of revenues over the past half-decade. The model assumes an improvement of 5%-8% in SG&A to account for the fact that subscriptions will generate 96%-98% of revenues by the end of the forecast period (a captive pool of customers is cheaper to maintain, and it also lends itself to faster upgrades and cross-selling initiatives). The model assumes that R&D investments will stay in line with Adobe’s long-term average of 18% of revenues. Being so, the numbers imply operating margins within the 24%-25% range (which is an exceptionally conservative assumption).Estimation of Operating Cash InvestmentsThe model assumes that the sum of capital expenditures investments with the changes in working capital will reach a level equivalent to 10%-15% of operating income, on average, per year. Adobe’s capital-light structure doesn’t require much in the way of CapEx (and the amount of invested capital, even including goodwill and intangibles, has actually diminished by about 5% between 2013 and 2017).Terminal Growth Rate, Estimation of Cost of Capital and Fair ValueAgain, to keep assumptions unadventurous, the DCF model assumes a WACC within the 8.0% + [± 1.5%] range. The model also assumes a terminal growth rate between 2% and 3%. After performing a sensitivity analysis, the valuation model imparts a present-day fair value estimate range between USD 230 and USD 250 per share, implying that Adobe is fairly valued or even slightly undervalued.The final Quality Score for Adobe is 10 out of 13. Globally, among large caps based on OECD countries, there are only a handful of companies reaching such a stellar result. A potent mix of profitability, pricing power, growth, market leadership, attractive business model and enduring competitive advantages make Adobe one of the highest-quality companies within the tech sector. For now, Adobe’s position in creative software seems virtually unassailable; however, the digital marketing and commerce spaces are still wide open to competition from a host of formidable rivals like Salesforce and Oracle. Nevertheless, and considering the analysis above, there are good reasons to assume that Adobe will remain as one of the most dominant players within these fast-growing arenas from both a technological and a market leadership standpoint. With its emphasis on innovation and excellence, the firm will probably continue to reinvent how people create, understand and engage with content for many years into the future. Steve Jobs saw Adobe’s potential 35 years ago and invested accordingly. Can you see the same potential now?"
4229143,20521,2018-12-19T05:30:29-05:00,,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has been transforming its operations to stay in step with the industry's trends. For the past few years, it has been shifting toward a subscription-based model from the traditional license-based model for its software. More recently, it has been making relevant acquisitions in the cloud. The recent results were stellar, but the earnings outlook failed to impress the market.Adobe's fourth quarter revenues grew 23% over the year to a record $2.46 billion, ahead of the market's projections of $2.43 billion. This was the fifteenth consecutive quarter that Adobe delivered revenue growth. Adjusted EPS of $1.87 were marginally lower than the Street's forecast of $1.88. Including the impact of the acquisitions of Magento and Marketo, earnings came in at $1.90 for the quarter.By segment, revenues from the Digital Media segment grew 23% to $1.71 billion with Creative revenue growing 26% to $1.45 billion and Document Cloud growing 10% to $259 million. The digital experience segment reported a growth of 25% over the year to $690 million driven by a 30% growth in subscriptions-based revenues. The market was looking for revenues of $1.70 billion from the Digital Media segment and $660.2 million from the Digital Experience segment.The acquisition of Marketo helped add $21 million in revenues for the quarter for Adobe. Magento's acquisition brought in another $30 million. But while the acquisitions may be delivering higher than expected revenues, but the lower than expected earnings suggest that Adobe's acquisitions may be impacting its earnings.Adobe's transition to the subscription model is helping it grow. During the quarter, Adobe added digital media annualized recurring revenue (ARR) of $430 million in the quarter, exiting the year with $6.83 billion. The growth reflects how Adobe has a growing customer-base for its subscription offerings. Adobe reported 88% of its revenue came from recurring sources, compared with 84% a year ago.Adobe ended the year with $8.725 billion in revenues and an EPS of $5.50. Including the Magento and Marketo acquisitions that it made recently, the revenues for the year came in at $9.03 billion with an EPS of $6.76.Adobe expects to end the current quarter with revenues of $2.54 billion with an adjusted EPS of $1.60. The market was looking for revenues of $2.52 billion with an EPS of $1.88. Adobe expects to end the current year with revenues of $11.15 billion and an adjusted EPS of $7.75. The Street had forecast revenues of $10.8 billion for the year with an adjusted EPS of $7.98.Adobe has been able to deliver strong revenue growth due to its continuous product upgrades. Recently, it began shipping an all-new Acrobat DC which comes with connected mobile apps like Adobe Scan and Acrobat Reader Mobile to help users create, share and collaborate with PDFs across smartphones and tablets. It has also integrated its offerings with other platforms. For instance, Adobe Sign, its e-signature solution, has new integrations and partnerships with Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Dynamics, and ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW).It also continues to invest in building the Adobe Experience Platform, the first open platform for customer experience management. The Adobe Experience Platform will aim to deliver a unified view of the customer for both CMOs and CIOs. As part of this initiative, it has entered into a partnership with Microsoft and SAP (NYSE:SAP) - the Open Data Initiative. This initiative is targeted at eliminating the data silos that are present across all organizations. Adobe plans to leverage this data to deliver customized, real-time customer experiences.Adobe's recent results reveal the impressive revenues being brought in by Marketo and Magento. I would like to know from the users why are they choosing Marketo over services offered by Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) Eloqua or Salesforce's (NYSE:CRM) Pardot that offer similar products? For instance, marketers are known to favor Eloqua's decision map which is similar to a visual interpretation of a mind map. Also, Pardot offers better integration with Salesforce. Similarly, Magento has some big competition to deal with as well. For instance, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) comes with an easier visual interface, and BigCommerce (BIGCO) hosts the user's store for them. Why do you choose Magento instead?The market was disappointed by Adobe's earnings outlook and the stock fell 7% post result announcement. It is currently trading at $230.00 with a market capitalization of $112.27 billion. It touched a year high of $277.61 in September this year. It was trading at year low levels of $172.92 in December last year."

        A bunch of new extensions and offerings is rocking the creative world.
        Ideal stock for long term investors with the intention to have growth exposure.","An Empire of rock-solid applicationsOver the years Adobe ( ADBE) has built a digital empire of world-class applications- an empire that is difficult to recreate by its rivals. Its creative cloud offerings for content and Document management and software suite delivers an unparalleled experience to professionals across the globe. It’s not that the rivals haven’t put in the effort, it’s just that Adobe is too good at what it does. So when Adobe says it is targeting total revenue of approximately 23%+ growth for the year, it means it. In fact, I am betting that the company is downplaying its guidance just to keep the surprise…well, a surprise. Just look at its recent performance, last year’s creative revenue increased 28% yoy to $5.34B, document revenue reached $982M (17% yoy), digital experience revenue increased 20% yoy to $2.44B and profitability remained superb, totaling to $9.03 billion in total revenue. This reflects an increase of 24$ annual growth. No doubt that Adobe continues to be the superstar in its galaxy. If your portfolio doesn’t have exposure to this Company, you should definitely take a position.Products and events that communicate true value to usersAdobe’s performance was driven by high-quality results across all its segments, particularly among consumers. Black Friday and Cyber Monday were two of the largest single selling days in company history. The company focused on expanding the value of Creative Cloud for existing customers while extending its capabilities to meet the needs of broad new segments of users. Back in October Adobe held its annual MAX creativity conference, a conference that has become a movement with reach and impact well beyond the physical event.Image SourceThis was indicated by thousands of Creative customers who tuned online to watch MAX, now millions more continue to view MAX content. The product announcements at MAX included major updates to its flagship Creative tools which included Photoshop, Lightroom, Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere Pro and the introduction of Premiere Rush. Premiere rush is the first all-in-one, easy-to-use video editing app for social media creators which simplifies the complicated work of video creation and sharing on leading platforms such as YouTube and Instagram. Research indicates that online video is one of the fastest growing Creative segments, which makes Rush is a strong foundation of its strategy to unlock this opportunity for millions of new customers.Innovation at the coreAdobe’s new technology includes prototyping experiences and applications for voice-enabled devices such as Amazon Echo, this is powered by Adobe Sensei inside of Adobe XD. New apps including Photoshop on the iPad which brings the power and precision of Photoshop to a touch device.Image SourceProject Gemini, which is a new drawing and painting application now brings unprecedented watercolor and oil painting capabilities to the digital canvas. Creative professionals that dazzle us with their artistry (while bringing their firm huge profits) will be now equipped more than ever. Adobe’s document cloud is investing to modernize the PDF experience on every device and surface and building on the document intelligence available from the billions of PDFs in the market to power AI-driven experiences. The firm recently shipped an all-new Acrobat DC with connected mobile apps like Adobe Scan and Acrobat Reader Mobile to create, share and collaborate with PDFs across smartphones and tablets. Adobe’s experience cloud is enabling redefined customer experience management and delivering the industry's only end-to-end solution for marketing, advertising, analytics, and commerce purpose-built for the modern enterprise.It’s all reflected…in numbersThis is all reflected in Adobe’s growth data. Although an apples-to-apples comparison is not possible, the following table gives you some insight into the firm’s excellent performance. The comparison table includes Autodesk ( ADSK), Align Technology ( ALGN), Square ( SQ), Oracle ( ORCL) and ServiceNow ( NOW). The table shows that although 3-year median revenue growth was higher, median earnings growth was 1.21% only whereas Adobe posted 10.52%. Revenue growth was slightly below average, but if you combine both revenue and earnings growth, no doubt that Adobe stands out.Data from SeekingAlphaPrice to earnings and price to cash flow, two important valuation multiples clearly indicate that is so much more room for Adobe to trade at higher multiples. Its current price to earnings is 49.9, which could potentially trade as close as 60. Same goes for its current price to cash flow multiple. Moreover, there’s a slight uptrend in both the multiples which might indicate that investors are more willing to pay a higher price for its earnings and cash flows. This could result from the fact that recently Adobe has launched a number of extensions to its product portfolio which are crushing the creative tools market.Data from Seeking AlphaAdobe’s Quarterly data in the 2011-2018 period shows an upper range estimate of 73.52 in PE, yearly data shows an upper range estimate of 84.29 in PE. A closer look reveals that Adobe often traded at much higher levels. The qualitative factor behind Adobe trading at higher levels is its high user acceptance. Adobe is taking up market share from its competitors, and I doubt whether its competitors can take it back. If you take a look at Adobe’s products, you will see that Adobe targets almost all of the “creative tools” market (graphics, audio, animation) and also document and advertising. Adobe users revere Adobe, the switching cost to other applications is not only heavy in terms of money but also in terms of skill. As an engineer, I admire the design and the engine Adobe implements in its products.Since 2015 Adobe’s share price soared by more than 250%, this is a reflection of the firm’s aggressive market capture during the period. In last one year, share price grew by more than 28%, and the saga continues. As I described earlier, investors may have become more willing to pay higher prices for its earnings and cash flows due to its new offerings. Because Adobe continues to expand its market share in the creative tools sector, there’s additional interest from the investors who want to hold Adobe for the long term. I am expecting that Adobe will cross the sweet $300 mark within this year driven by new products and extensions, and I know, my friends already invested in Adobe are telling me that I am being very conservative in my expectations, and I agree with them. The tools that Adobe delivers to the creative world, it is really unparalleled, and being a software engineer myself, I have always felt it.Image from SeekingAlphaThe fundamentals remain rock solid. Revenue, profit margin, an d FCF margin continues to trend upwards, could it be forever on an uptrend? That’s unlikely. But a profit margin between 20%-35% is very healthy, with slight differences in case of FCF margin. Adobe’s assets are roughly 22% financed with debt, making it a strong capital structure.Data from 10kConclusionAdobe’s product suite offers an unparalleled experience to creative enterprises. The firm’s competitors are far from its genius touch, which is reflected in its excellent performance year by year. Moreover, effective communication has made its marketing efforts more impactful, reaching end users efficiently. Adobe is a long term stock, no doubt about that. With its highly innovative culture, Adobe releases new extensions to its product suit regularly, delivering updated interfaces and high functionalities in a timely fashion. If you are a long term investor and have some space left in your portfolio for growth purpose, Adobe might be the one for you."
4228470,92586,2018-12-14T18:26:02-05:00,"Adobe's fiscal 4Q18 results and 2019 outlook were mixed, further clouded by the impact of new acquisitions and accounting guideline changes.But if I take a step back, the company seems to be performing as well as it has been, in my view.I remain optimistic about the consistency of Adobe's performance and the favorable trends in revenue growth and margin expansion.","Adobe Systems (ADBE) reported the results of its fiscal 4Q18 this Thursday after the closing bell, along with a revision of the fiscal 2019 outlook. The news did not seem to have pleased investors much, as shares ended the day down a sizable 7%.Credit: Officelovin'Analyzing the numbers this time around proved to be quite a bit more messy than usual. On the surface, the company's financial performance in the quarter, adjusted for the Oct. 31 acquisition of Marketo, beat consensus expectations - although it's unclear how much the 30 days worth of Marketo operations had already been baked into the Street's estimates. Revenues of $2.47 billion topped expectations by $30 million, although they also included $21 million worth of Marketo sales. Adjusted EPS ex-acquisition reached $1.90, a couple of cents ahead of consensus.The summarized P&L below have been adjusted for items like SBC and intangible amortization, but not for Marketo results (not all the details on this business have been made available). What strikes me at first is the very unusual pullback in profitability metrics - since I started covering ADBE, op margin has expanded by at least 230 bps YOY every quarter. It has been calculated, however, that Marketo was responsible for producing seven cents in headwind to EPS. I approximate that, without the acquisition impact and at a tax rate that's more consistent with last quarter's level, op margin would have come in 80 bps better YOY - still not quite impressive by Adobe standards.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsPerhaps taking a step back is in order here. Measured relative to management's expectations, Adobe delivered the usual pristine quarter. Revenues ex-Marketo topped guidance by $20 million, while non-GAAP EPS exceeded the outlook by three cents. The large digital media segment continued to grow at a 20%-plus rate, surpassing guidance by about one percentage point. Very importantly, in my view, was the evolution of recurring revenues. Total digital media ARR leaped forward at a rate of nearly 30%, and so did experience cloud subscription revenues. Adobe seems to be innovating at the usual pace, including new product announcements (updates to flagship tools, video editing for social media) and other innovations on the intelligent cloud front.Source: company's earnings releaseThe outlook for fiscal 2019 may have worried a few investors (myself included), as adjusted EPS of $7.75 failed to reach current consensus of $7.97. My first usual suspect for driving below-expectations guidance were the new acquisitions, particularly Marketo. However, quite a bit of other factors, including some that speak little to the robustness of Adobe's operations, seem to have played a role in projected EPS growth of less than 18% that looked a bit modest.The management team pointed the finger specifically at (1) accounting guideline changes and their negative 15-cent effect on per-share earnings, (2) unfavorable exchange rates and (3) a higher effective tax rate as key items impacting the earnings profile. With regard to the fundamentals of the business, CEO Shantanu Narayen clarified that, ""from an operational basis, Marketo is actually not dilutive"" - putting to rest a few concerns that I had regarding the drag, caused by the acquisitions, to what has been an impressive earnings growth trend.At the end of the day, after sorting through all the noise caused by accounting standards and the impact of the newly-acquired businesses, I believe Adobe remains on track to produce consistent growth in the foreseeable future. The many moving pieces and a below-consensus EPS guidance delivered on a tough day for the equities market in general, coupled with a stock that does not look very cheap at first glance (see below), might have been enough to justify ADBE's $8.3 billion loss in market cap this Friday.On my end, I remain a confident ADBE shareholder. At the core of my investment thesis is the consistency of the company's performance and the favorable trends in revenue growth and margin expansion that I believe will remain intact for the next couple of years at least. Should the stock drop further from current levels, I may even add to my existing position in order to lower my blended cost basis."
4229214,98236,2018-12-19T12:23:57-05:00,"Adobe reported a quarter with very typical results - better EPS, better revenue growth, and a strong outlook.The shares have been pummeled, down a bit more than 7% since the earnings release.Guidance was perhaps misunderstood and misappreciated.The company is projecting reported non-GAAP EPS lower than the prior consensus.The company has a relatively high EV/S ratio, which is constraining the shorter-term outlook for the shares.","Does anyone know who's on first? It is one of those hoary phrases that sometimes has great utility. It comes from the burlesque theater and was immortalized by Abbott and Costello. A golden record was placed in the Baseball Hall of Fame. The saying might usefully be used to sum up the reaction to Adobe's (ADBE) just reported quarter. I suppose I ought to have some sympathy for headline writers who can't have the expertise to deal with the impacts of acquisitions and deferred revenue write-downs. In case there are readers wondering, Adobe reported another beat and raise quarter with no suggestion of a slowdown in demand or anything resembling margin pressure, other than the deferred revenue write-down. Really! The headlines are more than a bit far afield from what is happening.Having said that, there is an issue here that is likely to weigh on the shares and not just the post-earnings downdraft seen on Friday. In essence, and for lots of reasons that are not connected to the company's outlook or its operational performance, the net of its forecast for EPS will cause most analysts lowering numbers. Specifically, the new EPS forecast for this current year has gone to $7.75 and that compares to the prior consensus of $7.97. As it happens, there have been something more than 20 downward earnings revisions and concomitant with those will come downward revisions in price targets. That presents an environment in which highly valued stocks such as Adobe are hard-pressed to go up these days. It is a function of this very unforgiving market environment.I think that the quarter reported can be best described as another typical Adobe beat and raise quarter, obscured by the acquisition of Marketo at the end of October. But, really, the company reported its results so that investors might make apples to apples comparisons, and those comparisons were about what one might expect. In other words, Adobe continued to surpass its prior forecasts for both reported revenues, for the additions to its ARR and for earnings. The guidance, too, was an upside, after making the adjustment for the deferred revenue write-down. Adobe is about as close to a machine as it gets in the enterprise software world, and this was another quarter along the way. Adobe is not now struggling, and I doubt it will struggle in the foreseeable future. Since the subject, for whatever reason appears controversial, I think the following quote from the CEO is worth considering, ""Excluding Marketo, we met or exceeded all of our Q4 and annual targets."" I would add that the company raised its target for ARR additions to its Digital Media component for 2019, a sign that growth is continuing unabated in the most important component of this company.As mentioned, the company's guidance in terms of EPS for the new fiscal year has been reduced from what had been the prior consensus. The new EPS guide is for $7.75 compared to a prior consensus of $7.97. This is not a function of operational dilution from Marketo, particularly. Most of the guide down does related to the deferred revenue write-down, coupled with some FX headwinds, coupled with an expected higher tax rate, although the non-GAAP expected tax rate is still just 11%. At this point, many investors/traders tend to shoot first and ask questions later. Any detailed exposition of Adobe's prospects would certainly conclude that this past quarter's results, and the company's forward guidance was neither a cause for concern nor a suggestion of slowing growth. Those concerns just aren't real. I have a real concern about the prospects/investment in Marketo/Magneto that will be discussed later in this note, but that concern is not going to prevent this company from achieving its targets for growth, profitability, and free cash flow.There really isn't much more I can say than that, other than the misunderstanding has apparently created somewhat of an opportunity. As opposed to the last time I wrote about Adobe, this past quarter was not a problem, and its outlook, conservative as is traditional, suggests that visibility is substantial, and the company continues to grow its business consistently as it changes the creation process over and over again.I confess to being surprised that some analysts were confused by Adobe's earnings press release. It was a pretty tame affair. I have read that some observers were concerned about the dilution from the Marketo acquisition. Why that might really be so is more than a bit puzzling. Again, the current outlook for Marketo, adjusted for the deferred revenue write-down, is better than the initial expectations when the deal was announced. Marketo is a building block that will create significant revenue synergies. My issue is that Adobe seems likely to under-invest in maximizing the potential outcome, although not all readers are going to reach a similar conclusion.The shares were down about 7% on Friday in the wake of the earnings, and they have backed off by 17% from the high set about 2 months ago. The kind of share price retrenchment has been pretty typical for companies within Adobe's growth rate in terms of EV/S. This formally unexciting name is now trading at levels that might interest some readers. Although, primarily from the point of view of earnings and free cash flow, the shares are still expensive from an EV/S evaluation.Adobe has not been the most controversial of stocks in the last several months, and I find I have not published on it for more than a year. Back when I last wrote about the name for SA in September of 2017, the shares reached as low as $148/share in the midst of another earnings-related share-price pull-back. Back then, I urged readers to buy the dip.Fast forward to the end of 2018. In some ways, this is a more difficult call to make in that many high-growth IT shares are selling at constrained (well, somewhat constrained) multiples after the last 2-3 months of a painful correction. But while Adobe shares are certainly down from their highs, on a year-to-date basis, the shares have risen a bit less than one-third which compares to a 14% gain for the IGV. So, even a set of inaccurate headlines can impact shares, and such is the case this after-Thursday earnings.Should readers buy Adobe shares at the current valuation? The facile answer is probably yes. But the fact is that at the current level of relative valuation, the shares will not appeal to everyone for many reasons. I think the case to own Adobe for long-term growth investors looking for earnings and cash flow along with revenue growth is easy to make. It owns one of the best long-term franchises in the software space and that asset will reward holders into the foreseeable future.I do not own the shares personally, but I think for many readers, owning Adobe represents an excellent compromise in terms of investing in a stable, high growth business. The issue for me, as I explore to some degree in the following sections of this article, is that much of the positive case for Adobe is so well known that there are few positive surprises. The major issue, and the one that I do not have an answer to, is the relative performance of the company's digital market efforts. Digital Marketing, or the Experience Cloud as the company calls it, is almost 30% of total revenues. It has done well, but not quite well enough. The issue that is likely to prove to be the difference between a decent investment and a great one is simply how well Adobe will do in wringing synergistic revenue benefits from its recent acquisition of Magneto and Marketo.The basic reason investors/readers might choose to do so, besides the level of profitability and free cash flow, is the visibility and stability of growth. When investors look at Adobe, inevitably, they look at Creative Cloud first. These days, Creative Cloud is lumped in as part of what is called Digital Media, but that segment is predominately weighted to Creative Cloud. Indeed, Creative Cloud can readily be conflated with Adobe and that will probably remain the case for the foreseeable future.For those unfamiliar with Adobe, Creative Cloud is all about creating content, going from a blank screen to some kind of design. Lots of people use it to create graphics, illustrations, to lay out pages and of course to edit and rearrange photos. There are millions of users who range from creative professionals, consultants, amateur photographers and to all individuals in between. It may seem hard to believe, but there are about 14-15 million subscribers to Creative Cloud these days, and that total just continues to grow at a rate in the high teens.Adobe spends about 17% of its revenue (GAAP) on research and development. That is quite a bit less than the ratios seen at much smaller, higher growth businesses. But that said, the aggregate spend has now reached almost $1.7 billion/year. For that sum, Adobe has been able to add lots of features and new offerings to Creative Cloud, more than I can even possibly summarize. Just as AWS (AMZN) maintains its market position in its space by adding functionality at a torrid pace, Adobe does the same. While there are niche competitors, they simply lack the resources to provide users with all of the new functionality that is apparently of importance to creative professionals. One of the most important attributes for the Adobe investment story is that it has a substantial barrier to competitors in its most important business-and one that continues to be augmented through additional product functionality.I think one of the unique components of the Adobe story relates to just how little competition the company has for the functionality of Creative Cloud. I have linked here to an article in which the writer stretched to find alternatives. There actually are some as can be seen, but none of Creative Cloud alternatives comes from vendors with the financial or marketing muscle to be a threat to Adobe's dominance for a long, long time. Yes, there are users who don't like subscription plans and far more who find it a normal way of doing business. And piracy is still a threat to revenue growth that has to be continuously addressed.And yes, for some users, the $600/year price is a hurdle. I am sure that some users feel that for $600/year, they should be able to use Adobe on multiple PCs without further payment.Individuals can get a full suite of Creative Cloud applications for just over $50/month and can get the Photoshop application alone, for less than $10/month. Businesses pay somewhat more - $80/month for the entire suite. Last quarter, Creative Cloud revenues rose by 26% to $1.45 billion Creative is still about 60% of total revenues, and while that percentage will decline in the wake of Adobe's new acquisition, Creative is basically the dog when looking at Adobe.Probably, the best way to evaluate the performance of Adobe, and the one that has been used by most analysts for some years, is the increase in ARR. The goal for last quarter in terms of ARR growth was $385 million. The actual attainment was $430 million, and that excludes Marketo. It seems odd to have to rationalize a beat in ARR of 11.7%, but to use the term ""struggling"" and the results of Adobe in the same sentence is pretty far-fetched.As mentioned, the growth of Creative Cloud is inexorably linked to its continuous enhancements. In that regard, the recent introduction of Premiere Rush, which is the first video editing app for social media creators who create content for platforms such as YouTube and Instagram, is probably of most significance in terms of expanding the TAM of Creative and maintaining its growth rate, even at its current scale.Given the number of subscribers that the company has and the cadence of the growth in the paid subscriber count, it is fair to try to understand what the saturation point for this business might be. I wish I had some facile answer to that question, but it is basically indeterminable. As mentioned, Adobe, actually increased its forecast in this business segment for its new fiscal year, primarily because of the strong momentum it had last quarter. I am inclined to correlate the subscription growth in the Creative Cloud to very broad trends in terms of how people spend their leisure time, how businesses advertise, the continued growth of social media and the need to provide social media with content and so forth.I suppose I would have to think that Adobe and its Creative Cloud might be a bit more susceptible to overall economic growth factors than other IT solutions that are offered more or less exclusively to large enterprises. We have no historical data about how subscription growth for Creative Cloud might react to economic growth. The subscription offering, particularly at its current scale, has never had to deal with an economic slowdown. But, unlike some commentators on this site, my tea leaves do not suggest a coming economic slowdown, and the company certainly is seeing a speed-up in its percentage growth rate.Adobe, with its Adobe Sign set of solutions, is actually the principal competitor of DocuSign (DOCU), but that is almost an after-thought in terms of this company's revenue growth. The company calls this overall business segment Document Cloud. Document Cloud is growing quite a bit less rapidly than Creative Cloud, and the sequential revenue growth this quarter was quite small, about 3%, although that reflects certain internal factors. While many users know and use Acrobat, probably, the major revenue generator in the Document Cloud offering, and the company continues to invest in its enhancement, its competition against DOCU is probably not a noteworthy success for the company at this point. Still, the overall size of that market, which is far beyond just the automation of signing, is large enough that it still represents a significant opportunity for Adobe. The company does offer what is called a System of Record capability, which ultimately is the future of revenue generation, both for Adobe Sign, and for DocuSign, but it is not anything that is likely to move the needle in the near future. On the other hand, the use of Acrobat, however, continues to increase, in particular, because of additional penetration into international markets and because of additional functionality that seems to resonate with some users.It is called Digital Experience these days and includes a variety of offerings including those from newly acquired Magneto and Marketo. Digital Experience is basically a set of solutions that range from analytics, to e-mail marketing, content management and something called a Commerce Hub, the offering acquired with the Magneto transaction.Enterprise marketing is an enormous market for software vendors. Depending on the definition, the market size is supposedly more than $30 billion/year, and growth is supposed to be in mid-teens percent. The two top competitors are Adobe and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), although the space also includes offerings by SAP (SAP), SAS Institute, IBM (IBM), and Oracle(ORCL). I would rate Salesforce as the strongest competitor in the last couple of years, partially since it acquired a string of companies in the space including Krux, Datorama, Demandware and ExactTarget. Last quarter, Salesforce grew its Marketing and Commerce Cloud by 37%, which compares to 25% growth for Adobe's Digital Experience. On the other hand, Digital Experience, with $690 million of revenues this past quarter, remains ahead of Salesforce whose revenues in the same space were $489 million for the quarter. Both growth rates were as reported and included some component of inorganic revenue.While Salesforce seems to be growing faster than Adobe, both Forrester and Gartner seem to rate Adobe's product offerings as superior. Adobe has been growing its Digital Experience revenues in the low 20% range for most of the past year, better than the overall growth of the market but not quite as good as the growth being achieved by Salesforce. My guess is that Salesforce simply has a better and more effective go to market strategy when it comes to selling to enterprise customers, and it is willing to spend relatively more on Sales and Marketing spend compared to Adobe. Last quarter, in aggregate, Salesforce spent 47% of its revenues on sales and marketing. That was an increase of some 400 basis points from the level the company spent in the prior year. It is that level of spend that has constrained the GAAP margins of Salesforce.By comparison, Adobe spends 29% of its revenues on a GAAP basis on sales and marketing, a number that is holding steady year over year. The numbers are obviously not comparable. Lots of Adobe's revenue comes from consumer subscriptions rather than enterprise deals. Salesforce these days regularly closes 9 figure deals; Adobe doesn't do that. But, for what it is worth, I think the gains in market share that Salesforce has made and continues to make in the digital marketing space are directly correlated to its willingness to spend liberally on sales and marketing in a competitive space with many formidable competitors who offer well-regarded solutions.As many readers know, Adobe has made some relatively substantial acquisitions in the digital marketing space in the last few months. The acquisitions are of the scale as to somewhat change the company's center of gravity toward digital marketing. I do not propose to recapitulate in any great detail what both companies do and how they compete in the market. Magneto's best-known competitor is Shopify (SHOP). There are many differences between SHOP offerings and those of Magneto. Simply put, Magneto is not really designed as the platform of choice for start-up businesses which lack expertise in e-commerce. Again, just my view, there are many potential revenue synergies available for Adobe. Many of the users who subscribe to Creative Cloud wind up with their own e-commerce sites. But to maximize those synergies would be costly. At this point, there is no real evidence that Adobe will choose to make the investment required to actually take on SHOP in this space.Marketo is a significantly larger acquisition. Adobe paid almost $5 billion to acquire the business which has a revenue run-rate of about $400 million. Marketo is basically a digital marketing business that competes very directly against the Salesforce Marketing Cloud. It obviously fits well into Adobe's experience management suite of offerings. Presumably, that is why it was acquired. I have linked earlier to one Magic Quadrant report from Gartner that outlines the space and the competitors. There are so many reports and so many vendors vying for recognition that it would not be feasible to even try to include a representative sample in this article.My take is that Marketo has some strong solutions, so say all the folks in marketing research who track these things. But in a field as crowded as it is, and with the shark called Salesforce trolling the waters, I am not sure that Adobe will spend what it takes to maximize the returns of its new asset. Personally, I would have preferred to see Adobe accept some dilution in order to solidify Marketo's market positioning. It is not going to do that, at least according to what the company has said. HubSpot (HUBS), another competitor in this space, and one that addresses many of the same kind of customers in terms of size that Marketo looks to acquire, is around the same size as Marketo. But it is willing to spend almost $300 million a year on sales and marketing to acquire customers. Whether or not HUBS is a good investment or should spend $300 million/year on sales and marketing it is not relevant. And to some extent, whether or not Marketo/Adobe have better solutions or more features or functions in their platform is not terribly important either. The issue is that Adobe may not be willing to spend adequately to match its competitors in this space, because to do so would require it to take a step or two back on EPS.I do not think anything bad will happen to Marketo, or to Adobe in this space. I do think that spending an inadequate sum on sales and marketing is going to lead to share losses in such a crowded space with so many sharks trolling in those waters.I do not think the results of this last quarter suggest anything evil or untoward is happening at Adobe. The share price reaction is what it is in the context of a very highly valued company in a market that continues to compress valuations. Regardless of the causes, the company has a new and lower EPS outlook than it had before the call, and that is something that can't seem to be accepted in this investment environment.The company has an extraordinary franchise in its Creative Cloud that will probably keep on giving for the foreseeable future. It has a strong offering in its Digital Experience segment. My own view is that, based on the company's own disciplines, it is likely to under-invest in this segment and will lose share to smaller, aggressive competitors and most particularly to Salesforce. But the result is not likely to be sufficiently negative to upset the business model. I don't think there is much risk to the EPS estimate for this year, I would be amazed if it weren't bettered. And I think the company can sustain organic growth above 20% for another couple of years, at the very least.The company generates plenty of cash, and it will continue to repurchase shares. Might it pay a dividend? It certainly has the resources to initiate a new leg in its capital allocation program, but suggesting a dividend at this point for Adobe is just so much speculation. The company is likely to generate around $4 billion in free cash flow this coming year. That is a free cash flow yield of just below 4%. One way I look at valuation is to take a free cash flow yield and compare it to a company's growth rate. That is a ratio that shows Adobe substantially better than (above) the average for its growth rate. The problem is that the free cash flow/growth ratio, while worthwhile looking at, is not well correlated with share price performance.In short, I believe that Adobe shares reflect lots of positive sentiment and lots of visibility. The shares are likely to reward longer-term investors, simply because the level of growth is seemingly so visible and stable. But in the short term, I think the high valuation, based solely on the EV/S ratio, precludes positive alpha.Adobe is a great asset. The problem is that its light is not contained in a bushel basket. It appeals to and should appeal to more conservative investors who want to invest in names that combine reasonable growth with reasonable profitability. The glass is more than half full for that cohort, and half full for many other readers."

Flash Player can run from a web browser as a browser plug-in or on supported mobile devices.Flash player was its second hit success software program after its Adobe Acrobat and Reader software introduced PDF, the Portable Document Format, which is still ubiquitously used today even after all these years.Most software companies are relatively new to the scene and like companies I have recently written about such as Zendesk (ZEN) and Twilio (TWLO), they can brag about growing sales of 30% or 40% plus per year.Adobe isn't too shabby itself growing sales at over 24% annually - remarkably high for such an ancient tech company.The company's strengths are similar to that of Apple (AAPL) - high-quality products and high profitability.There will be no back-to-back doubling of the stock like some hyper-growth tech stocks because Adobe doesn't subscribe to the type of growth trail that Square (SQ) has blazed.What you can expect from Adobe is a slow grind up in share price stoked by its outperforming EPS expansion and acceptable sales growth of mid-20%.Its annual operating margins have essentially tripled since the beginning of 2015 from around 10% and now boast an Apple-like 30%.There are no bones about it - Adobe has high-quality software across its diversified portfolio.Other Adobe software products universally soaked up are its stable array of graphic design software such as Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Dreamweaver.Adobe has also ventured into video editing, animation, and visual effects with Adobe Premiere Pro.Not only that, Adobe has forayed into more conventional types of software such as digital marketing management software and server software.Simply put, Adobe's assortment of digital media software products has a religious-like following especially for iOS users.As you might have guessed correctly, the lion's share of Adobe's revenue stream stems from its software as a service (SaaS) segment contributing 80% to the top line.More narrowly, the digital media segment makes up almost 70% of the subscription-based revenue. This division will expand at least 20% each year boding well for Adobe to maintain its 20% plus sales growth that any legacy software company would sacrifice a right leg to achieve.Its digital marketing software products rub up against stifling competition in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) amongst others and contribute a less robust 30% to overall sales.I am less bullish on this part of the business because they have it rough competing against one of the FANGs, the path of less resistance clearly sides with its bread and butter of the digital media offerings.Its subscription-based pricing model was the catalyst for boosting profitability causing the stock to experience massive price gains. The stock has doubled in the past two years which is unheard of for most legacy software companies.No longer does Adobe need to manufacture the ancient CD of yore physically delivering it to customers, users can briskly download these products directly from the official website, receive constant upgrades over broadband internet, and pay Adobe monthly for their humble services.In fact, any investors looking for some hot software stocks only need to find companies that recently shifted to a subscription-based pricing model. It's pretty much a license to print money if the software quality can backup the monthly costs for the user.I can tell you that Adobe's software has remained world class, embedded at the heart of most digital devices at home and in the office, and who would have thought that just a little shift to the pricing model would have doubled the stock price?Well, instead of one-off sales, Adobe can book revenue month after month, and year after year demonstrating the supercharged effect of shifting to a recurring revenue stream model.Highlighting the pivot to profitability is Adobe's three-year EPS growth rate of 48% turning this company into a mammoth software company with a $117 billion market cap.Another positive for Adobe's future sales are its fertile addressable markets in Europe and Asia.There is ample room to expand in these geographical regions with Europe already chipping in with almost $2 billion of revenue per year and Asia with another $1 billion.Future harvests look even more bountiful.These two regions make up almost 40% of sales and as the Asian middle class is poised to elevate a giant swath of its people to middle class, Adobe will be a handsome beneficiary of this trend as middle-class families tend to pump out more university graduates who migrate to software-based occupations.Even though Adobe isn't the sexiest name out there, it certainly is in the category of ""safe.""In no way do I see an eradication of its embedded software spread widely throughout the tech universe.Its digital media software tools are best-in-show and loyally followed with a long-lasting revenue stream that has room to grow abroad.Do not expect Adobe to debut any earth-shattering products, but I fully anticipate Adobe to become even more profitable to the point that they might offer a dividend or reallocate capital to shareholders through stock buybacks.Apple has similar strengths in its business model, albeit on a much grander scale.I feel that Adobe doesn't get the credit it deserves because of its steady as it goes drivers that keep motoring higher in an industry that adores groundbreaking products that revolutionize the world.I would wait for a major sell-off because a double in two years has bid up the stock to expensive levels represented in its premium forward PE multiple of 35.However, as the conclusion of the mid-term elections offers some certainty to the market, tech stocks could get swept up in a positive rush to round out the year.Luckily for Mad Hedge Tech readers, this is the golden age for software companies and we are just scratching the surface of the capability software efficiencies can deliver to small and large companies across every bit of the economy.Another Apple-like similarity is that Adobe is annually voted one of the best places to work according to Fortune, stacked up against companies represented across the full economic spectrum and not just tech.If you have a kid, tell him to find a job in San Jose, he or she could find worse places to cut a paycheck."
4228532,103480,2018-12-15T15:37:21-05:00,"Shares of Adobe slipped a further 6% after reporting Q4 results, despite beating Wall Street's expectations on both the top and bottom line.Adobe remains one of the highest-margin, most profitable companies in the software sector.At the same time, the company has committed to growing revenues in excess of 20% y/y.Adbeo's current <30x P/E ratio represents a rare low for a stock that has produced 57% earnings growth over the past year.","It's been a rough couple of months for creative software publisher Adobe (ADBE), the vendor behind popular applications like PhotoShop and Acrobat. After a rally earlier in the year fueled by investor optimism over the pace of its transition into subscription-oriented revenues, Adobe has fallen back alongside other high-growth technology stocks both on widespread rotation out of the tech sector as well as a concern that Adobe will need to rely on acquisitions like Marketo to produce growth. Adobe remains well off its 2018 high of $280, and the company's quarterly beat in Q4 did little to raise optimism - in fact, shares slid more than 6% on the news.I've been steadily building a long position in Adobe since last quarter, when shares were beginning their descent from peak values. What I noted then still holds true: Adobe is one of the most promising stocks to hold amid a wider downturn in the tech sector. Though Adobe is a growth stock, with double-digit advances in both revenues and EPS, it's also a remarkably steady performer and a strong cash flow generator.We have Adobe's new cloud focus to thank for that. In the past, Adobe collected one-time fees on software sales like most software publishers of its time. Now, however, the lion's share of Adobe's revenues are collected on a subscription basis. Many creative professionals who lean on Adobe for their work are more or less forced into its monthly fees. Adobe's tools have little serious competition in the market, so its ability to retain these revenues is solid. And, as evidenced by the company's purchase of marketing automation company Marketo, the company is making a deeper push into enterprise.Recurring-revenue companies like these are the types of stable, cash-flowing businesses that investors should stay invested in through volatile markets. It's worth noting that Adobe is trading at a fairly low P/E ratio relative to its historical multiples. Figure 1. Adobe FY19 guidanceSource: Adobe earnings releaseFor next year, Adobe has guided to pro forma EPS of $7.75 - given its historical tendency to come in above its guidance, however, we should plan for over achievement. Indeed, Wall Street's consensus target on Adobe's EPS is $7.97, per Yahoo Finance. Against this earnings estimate, Adobe trades at a 28.9x forward P/E ratio. While that doesn't sound cheap in the context of ""normal"" stocks, note that Adobe achieved 57% earnings growth in FY18. This puts Adobe's PEG ratio at just 0.5x - a classic indicator of undervaluation for a growth stock. In my view, Adobe's recent pullback and its robust outlook for FY19 (with 23% y/y revenue growth in the guidance plan, not accounting for any outperformance) make it worth adding to your portfolio for 2019. Adobe has perennially outperformed the S&P 500 by a vast margin over the past 10 years (chart shown below), and with its bullish thesis still very much intact, that's unlikely to change.Let's dive deeper into Adobe's fourth quarter results. The company's earnings summary, taken from the earnings press release, is shown below:Figure 2. Adobe 4Q18 resultsSource: Adobe earnings releaseRevenues grew 23% y/y to $2.46 billion, beating Wall Street's consensus of $2.43 billion (+21% y/y) by a two-point spread. Subscription revenues saw even stronger growth at 29% y/y to $2.18 billion. Note also that subscription revenues account for 89% of Adobe's revenue mix, up four points from 4Q17. It'a also useful to keep a pulse on Adobe's ARR growth. As most investors know, ARR represents the annualized value of all of Adobe's subscription contracts. This quarter, Adobe ended at a total $6.71 billion ARR in its Digital Media business - which is greater than its Digital Media revenues of $6.33 billion for the year. This essentially means that even if Adobe didn't add any new customers next year but held onto its existing ones, it would continue to see revenue growth thanks to its existing, enlarged contract values. Note also that Creative Cloud ARR is up 26% y/y to $1.45 billion, which includes some of Adobe's most popular and long-standing apps like Acrobat Pro, InDesign and PhotoShop. Despite these programs having existed in the market for years, Adobe is still managing to churn out double-digit subscription growth in them.Figure 3. Adobe ARR and other key metricsSource: Adobe supplementary data sheetHere's some additional useful commentary from CFO John Murphy on the quarter's earnings call:Adobe's strength cascaded into the bottom line as well, as it does every quarter. Gross margins hit a sky high 85.4% in the quarter, and though that's down slightly from the year-ago quarter, it's worth recalling that Adobe's gross margin outshines virtually every other large-cap SaaS company in the market:When combining Adobe's strong unit economics alongside its highly recurring revenue base, it makes for an incredibly strong and long-lasting financial profile. The company's pro forma EPS grew 45% y/y to $1.83, excluding Marketo's losses, Adobe's EPS is actually $1.90, a two-penny beat relative to Wall Street consensus of $1.88. It'a also worth noting that Adobe still has about $7.85 billion of its $8 billion stock buyback left, per Adobe's CFO. This covers about 6%-7% of Adobe's market cap and can fuel additional EPS growth in FY19. The current depression in share prices actually affords Adobe an opportunity to time its repurchases well. Adobe is a one-of-a-kind software asset that has virtually no clones in the market. It has swiftly turned its legacy software businesses into cash cows that generate recurring revenues at an 85% gross margin. On top of that, the company is making a deeper push into enterprise with a new foothold on ad-tech and marketing automation via its purchase of Marketo. In my view, the bullish thesis on Adobe is as strong as ever. Risks to Adobe are few in 2019, but one that stands out is the company's ability to continue producing strong EPS growth. Margins have slid fractionally this quarter, but Adobe has still been able to produce strong EPS growth all year thanks to tax reform. Once the tax code changes are in the rear-view mirror and Adobe is comparing its earnings like-for-like in FY19 vs. FY18, the perception of slower earnings growth may cause investors to dial back Adobe's P/E multiple. In my view, however, this stock has much more room to the upside thanks to its continued extension of its product categories. Look for a buying opportunity in Adobe should the shares keep dropping."

Upcoming launch of an iPad-native version of Photoshop CC is another imminent tailwind for Creative Cloud.Another recurring revenue growth catalyst is Adobe Stock. My fearless forecast is that Adobe Stock can eventually eclipse Shutterstock.","The persistent growth in Creative Cloud revenue is why I remain long Adobe (ADBE). The robust quarterly recurring revenue from Creative Cloud helped enable the bold $4.75 billion purchase of Marketo and $1.6 billion acquisition of Magento. The reliable/recurring 10-figure annual profit from renting out its design software products makes it feasible for Adobe to stockpile cash for future acquisitions and/or share buyback.Expanding its reach through mergers/acquisitions is preferable. Magento’s 2017 revenue was just $150 million. Magento’s 2015 annual revenue was less than $220 million. I guesstimate that Magento’s 2017 revenue was less than $400 million. If it wants a greater market share in SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) Adobe will need to buy more firms. Adobe is only ranked third in global Enterprise SaaS, with less than 10% market share. Outpacing the 45% Enterprise Saas annual growth of its partner Microsoft (MSFT) is possible through new acquisitions.Growing Creative Cloud Revenue Can Boost Adobe’s ExpansionOut of the record-setting $2.29 billion that Adobe made in Q3 2018, $1.36 billion came from Creative Cloud subscriptions (or almost 60% of quarterly revenue). This is 28% higher than Q3 2017’s $1.06 billion. In 2016, Creative Cloud’s Q3 revenue was only $803 million. The June 2013 switch to a subscription-only business model produced a boost in Adobe’s annual net operating cash flow. From only $1.15 billion in 2013, it shot up to $2.91 billion in 2017. Renting out its design software products boosted Adobe’s cash and short-term investments from $3.17 billion in 2013 to $5.82 billion by end of 2017.More importantly, this revenue growth is in spite of the numerous free and/or cheaper alternatives to Adobe software products.Adobe finished FY 2015 with 6.17 million individual and team Creative Cloud subscribers. It was estimated that Adobe ended 2017 with more than 12 million Creative Cloud subscribers. Creative Cloud contributed $4.17 billion to Adobe’s FY 2017 performance. I guesstimate that Creative Cloud can contribute around $5.1 billion this FY 2018 and $6.3 billion in FY 2019.Last month’s release of Creative Cloud CC 2019 suite of products likely inspired more people to subscribe. There’s probably more than 13.5 million subscribers right now. The implementation of Sensei artificial intelligence features in industry-standard products like Photoshop, InDesign, Premiere, After Effects, and Illustrator are very compelling reasons to subscribe.Artificial Intelligence can accelerate the workflow of creative professionals and content creators. A faster workflow means more income for freelancers, design studios, marketers, advertising agencies, and content publishers. The more money that Creative Cloud subscribers make, the better it is for Adobe’s long-term growth and expansion strategy.Adobe is so generous that it even implemented Sensei AI features in its non-professional Photoshop Elements and Premiere Elements products. Adobe Sensei is the game-changing advantage of Creative Cloud software over competing packages from Corel or from Serif.Retaining customer loyalty is easy for Adobe. Adobe is responsive to requests from its customers. Long-desired by many creative professionals, the upcoming iOS/iPad-native version of Photoshop is coming next year. It was also often requested that Photoshop should have multiple artboard previews, Distribute/Align objects command, Frame text/image holder tool, and adaptive workspace/UI size features. Adobe implemented all of them in Photoshop CC 2019.Further, Adobe made Photoshop CC 2019 less of a memory hog. Based on my two weeks of tests, Adobe Photoshop CC 2019 on Windows 10 64-bit launches faster than Photoshop CC 2018 version. It also eats a lower amount of RAM (Random Access Memory). The screenshot below is Photoshop CC 2019 with seven JPEG images (16 x 10 inches @ 200 DPI) and one 5-layer PSD tarpaulin 2x3 feet @ 100 DPI resolution. It uses less than 900 megabytes of RAM. Loading them up on the 2018 version ate more than 1 gigabyte of RAM.(Source: Motek Moyen)Adobe giving away fully-working free Windows/Mac versions of its Experience Design CC (or Adobe XD CC) User Interface/User Experience [UI/UX] design software will tenaciously diminish competition. The popular $99/year Sketch Mac UI/UX tool from Bohemian Coding will most likely suffer the sad demise/fate of QuarkXpress. Yes, Adobe was late in the UI/UX software genre, but its ruthless dissemination of XD CC as a free tool will gradually reduce the appeal of rival commercial UI/UX programs like Bohemian’s Sketch, InVision, Webflow, Axure, and Atomic.Adobe Stock is another underappreciated tailwind for Creative Cloud. Adobe Stock’s pricey monthly/annual subscription fees are still palatable to many deadline-sensitive individuals and teams. Using stock images/videos/templates accelerates workflow. It’s a no-brainer for a design studio to pay $199.99/month to quickly get 750 standard assets they can instantly use for any commercial project. Adobe Stock’s library touts 100 million design assets. It is highly likely that individual/company subscribers can quickly find what they need from Adobe Stock.(Source: Adobe) My fearless forecast is that Adobe Stock can eventually generate more than the $557 million annual revenue of Shutterstock (SSTK). The deep integration of Adobe Stock with Creative Cloud CC software programs makes it the go-to choice for using royalty-free commercial assets.  Astute freelancers and design studios can pursue a lower-margin, volume-based business model using Adobe Stock assets/templates to quickly churn out finished designs.ADBE is $30 from its 52-week high of $277. 61. However, we should remain long (or add more) on Adobe because of its massive Creative Cloud moat. It has fierce rivals in digital marketing/advertising, but Adobe has nil competition in professional design/content creation software.The invidious pseudo-monopoly standing of Creative Cloud software products is why Adobe can maintain its 24% annual revenue growth rate performance. It is responsible for the steady increase in annual profit and cash flow. I expect Creative Cloud to keep contributing around 60% of Adobe’s quarterly/annual revenue. This will likely only change after 3 or 5 years from now, and only after Adobe acquired and grew subsidiaries that generate enough new revenue streams.(Image Source: Statista)Marketo and Magento can contribute less than 10% of Adobe forward annual revenue.

The acquisition could happen at a much higher price than ADBE’s current price of $240. In addition to ADBE’s intrinsic strength, the strong possibility of an acquisition makes for an even more compelling case to have ADBE in one’s portfolio.The way forward is opensourceWhile coding was considered to be a rare skill in the heyday of DOS, coding has become commoditized in today’s context. Cloud, crowd-sourced code development and patent expiries are making it infeasible to earn through licensed content for mass use products. In fact, commodity software has started following the razor and blade model – the core software (razor) has been moving towards becoming free with service (blade) bringing in the real dollars.The shift in trend has been materializing across sectors with companies ranging from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) opening up their doors to establish an ecosystem that supports their growth. Charging rent for the product is passé; charging for an actual service is the fad.The cloud brigade (led by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)) offering ‘database services’ for a subscription fee has given a fillip to the movement towards free. A developer now only needs to use a service, rather than focus on managing a database.

One of the starting points was the open sourcing of the .NET framework in November 2014.Source: Reaction to .NET becoming open sourceOne of the reasons for this move was to allow .NET to compete with Java, but the bigger reason was to allow users of Azure to benefit. MSFT's intent became even more evident in November 2015 when MSFT reached a ‘patent standstill agreement’ with Red Hat (RHT). This agreement simply ensured that neither of MSFT or RHT would troll each other’s patents. Patent suits are held off in anticipation of earnings, but in the MSFT-RHT deal, there was no money involved. Not only was this deal a source of relief for people running RHT Linux on MSFT Azure but also was a marked shift in the attitude of a company called as a patent troll by some.In another few months, MSFT would reassure customers about indemnifying them against any patent claims that they may face for using open source software on the Azure cloud. To further cement MSFT’s commitment to Linux, MSFT soon thereafter joined and became a Platinum Member of the Linux Foundation.In June this year, MSFT further strengthened its position in the open source ecosystem by gobbling up a large part of that ecosystem known as GitHub. As MSFT transitions from a software to a cloud company, ability to influence contributors to the cloud ecosystem is nothing short of gold. Not to forget MSFT also owns LinkedIn, one of the world’s largest professional networking sites. The cumulative impact of these acquisitions is that MSFT now owns a large part of the demand and supply dynamic in the new age computing. Talk about an AWS killer!MSFT doesn’t seem to be stopping here. In October this year, the company has joined the Open Invention Network (OIN). OIN is an open-source patent community that enables its members to use the available licenses on a royalty-free basis. MSFT’s move to join OIN is nothing short of epic, given that the company used to charge between $5 and 15 per Android device shipped as a royalty fee.Part of the reason could be the declining billions from royalty fee due to the difficulty in implementing contracts with the perpetrators of Android commoditization.Source: A huge shift in the Android market is hurting MicrosoftEven taking the declining royalty fees into account, the move towards open sourcing 60,000 of MSFT’s patents to OIN’s portfolio of over 1,300 patents is further testament to MSFT’s changing strategy to embrace the open source world. For MSFT, the decision to move towards open source (and Linux) has been about growth in business through the company’s ability to service customers in the customers’ environment – which is increasingly becoming open source.MSFT appears to be approaching towards growing Azure from multiple dimensions. While the company’s approach towards open source has been an eye-opener for many, MSFT has also started allowing data from its platforms to move on others.The open data initiativeIn Sept. 2018, MSFT, ADBE, and SAP (SAP) launched the Open Data Initiative, a unified data model aimed at providing a consolidated view of end-user data to customers.Source: MSFT Press ReleaseWhile some see this as a front against the growing influence of Salesforce.com (CRM), this alliance adds another dimension to the utility of Azure – additional analytics firepower based on the number of transactions the cloud platform will have access to. ADBE’s CEO puts it in as many words:The underlying reason for this alliance is to participate in the fast-growing customer experience management market, which is expected to grow at a CAGR of 22% between 2018 and 2024 to reach $21.3 billion.SAP’s acquisition of Qualtrics International at 20x revenue further points to the need to continually increase presence. It is notable despite SAP touching 77% of the world’s transactions without Qualtrics, SAP had agreed to pay $8 billion for a company that was about to IPO and had been valued at $2.5 billion in its last round of funding.SAP’s acquisition also puts it in more direct competition with ADBE, which essentially now focuses on the experience business. On one hand, SAP enters in a data sharing agreement with MSFT and ADBE, and on the other hand, it has upped the competition with the real horizontal partner of this triad, ADBE. While Office 365 has been gaining market share with a 56% global share in 2018 vs. 34% in 2016, MSFT’s core proposition in this alliance is that of Azure hosting the combined and growing data lake.It is also important to note that while ADBE (with Marketo and Magento) still lacks salesforce automation capabilities, MSFT is almost missing in the marketing space despite a very potent offering in Office 365.Source: CRM Investor DayIn addition to the complementary nature of MSFT and ADBE’s portfolio, ADBE also presents MSFT with an additional opportunity to further strengthen and broad base Azure’s utility. Could then MSFT be looking at ADBE to be more than just a partner?The rumor of MSFT buying ADBE is not new. However, what seems to have changed this time around is MSFT’s approach towards Azure. The MSFT of the day is willing to tear down the biggest and oldest of obstacles that even hint towards a possibility of hindering Azure’s growth. MSFT has laid to waste its arsenal of 60,000 patents that were delivering billions of dollars annually and spent a bomb to acquire developer relationships (in GitHub) just to let the world know how serious the company is. If a company can spend billions to dollars to let the world know of its changing philosophy, there should be limited doubt about what that company could do to get a piece of the experience business that can make Azure’s stack near perfect.Notwithstanding that Adobe Experience Cloud runs on Azure and the fact that Adobe's CEO Mr Shantanu Narayen and Microsoft's CEO Mr Satya Nadella went to the same high school in Hyderabad, there are other aspects of business also that can benefit from an increased level of personalized customer experience.To begin with, MSFT’s search algorithms (Bing, Cortana) could significantly leverage the added flavors from greater access to user behavior data. Not only could this help improve advertiser ROI but also provide the basis for sustained improvement in the gaming business. The enhanced user analytics arising from the use of its products could also prompt MSFT to drop pricing for the Office 365 (including ADBE’s Document Cloud), exacerbating share losses for G Suite.Facebook is the leading example of how to leverage user-generated content and the ensuing insights. With MSFT’s focus on quantum computing, execution may just be semantics.Despite the screaming logic, there still could be a hiccup, the price of ADBE.(Note: Most of the financial commentary about ADBE’s standalone business has been taken from the article, Adobe: The Business Of Experience.)ADBE is growing and the intrinsic value of ADBE could be at least $150 billion (or $300 per share), which presents a massive funding challenge. While the combined entity could deliver significant upside over the medium-term, the costs of funding could become a challenge.On a standalone basis, MSFT could do ~$40 billion in FCF for F2019, and ADBE could also add $0.5 billion. At the end of Sept. 2018, MSFT also had ~60 billion of net cash (cash and equivalent less debt). Thus, theoretically, MSFT could finance for a zero-synergy scenario by taking on another $50 billion. Considering the potential synergies (as a % of incremental revenue and costs), the additional funding needed by MSFT is likely to be higher.Source: Author's financial model to estimate synergies between ADBE and MSFTThe following table lays out the value of synergy for different combinations of revenue and cost synergy contributions.Source: Author's financial model to estimate synergies between ADBE and MSFTDue to the second order and beyond benefits arising from ADBE’s acquisition, the estimates of synergy presented here may be conservative. If MSFT’s search business is the first division that starts integrating ADBE's Experience Cloud, the extension to gaming is likely to start post the search business’s complete absorption of ADBE’s capabilities. Unless done in a linear manner, there is a chance of a leak in leanings and thus synergies.While each project (business line alignment) will continue to generate significant learnings to be carried over to the ecosystem (third order and beyond benefits), we look at the highlighted scenarios to estimate the value of synergies shareable with the investors of both the companies.In the scenarios considered, the average value of synergy is ~$300 billion or ~2x the intrinsic value of ADBE. The obvious next question is how much of this will MSFT be willing to share with ADBE shareholders?Taking a cue from an earlier assessment (which matured to fruition within four months of the assessment), MSFT could also be willing to share 20-40% of the potential synergies.Source: Author's financial model to estimate synergies between ADBE and MSFTWhile a 20% share of synergies by MSFT represents a ~90% upside for ADBE’s stock (currently trading at ~$240), it also represents a ~$220 billion price tag for a company that is expected to $11 billion in revenue for F2019. ADBE’s valuation of 20x revenue makes SAP’s acquisition of Qualtrics at 20x look like a very reasonably priced buy.Arguably, this would be one of the most expensive deals in the tech world and also the biggest for MSFT, whose largest bet until now has been that of LinkedIn at $26 billion (or 7x of revenue). However, by paying at least 25x of revenue for GitHub MSFT has demonstrated that the company is no more shy to pay top dollar to get what it wants.The early bird catches the worm, but what happens when there are too many birds? As already highlighted, ADBE operates in a high growth market which is increasingly becoming central to the growth of the marketing business. In order to grow their business, many other suitors could follow MSFT’s lead in attempting to woo ADBE.The limiting factor for any potential acquirer will be that of affordability, given ADBE’s price (as highlighted above), and thus, the discussion only limits to FAAGs.Potential Buyer 1: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)Time and again, speculation has surfaced regarding the benefits of AAPL buying out ADBE. Not only is the rationale of ADBE helping AAPL improve its customer experience well-grounded but also are AAPL’s cash reserves of $250 billion quite sufficient.While APPL’s unsuccessful attempt to buy ADBE is a thing of Mr Steve Jobs' days, unless AAPL plans to increase its focus enough on the app experience side to launch one of the largest bids in the tech history, the deal could be still some time away.Possibility: MediumPotential Buyer 2: Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)The second name that comes to mind is GOOG, and for good reason:What dampens the case for ADBE's acquisition by GOOG is GOOG’s tie-up with CRM. CRM had announced that it will use GOOG’s cloud for international expansion. The idea is to collaborate to leverage the collective analytical capabilities to give a more ‘complete’ picture of online and offline user behavior to the customer.While GOOG has the capability to absorb and leverage ADBE, GOOG’s erstwhile relationship with CRM could make buying out CRM a far more lucrative option than to first disentangle with CRM and then buy ADBE.Possibility: Medium Potential Buyer 3: Amazon (AMZN)MSFT and AMZN have a large degree of overlap, with AMZN leading in both the cloud and retail businesses. While ADBE could give a fillip to AMZN’s retail business, Alexa and media and fashion business, the growing competition in India and AMZN’s broader ambitions to conquer retail may limit the company’s desire to buy a $200 billion experience company. (AMZN has a net cash position of $5 billion at the end of Sept. 18)Possibility: LowPotential Buyer 4: FBWhile the thought of a social network acquiring ADBE may not be very intuitive, FB’s core business could make the ADBE acquisition a very sound business proposition. In fact, FB already has experience of effectively subsuming the analytics firepower from WhatsApp. ADBE’s unified customer profile (UCP) also ties in well with FB’s user profiling efforts, sans the privacy-related issues.Source: Adobe: The Business Of ExperienceFB’s revenues, while down to ‘just 33% growth’ in the last quarter, still generated enough cash with the company ending with ~$40 billion in cash and no debt. Barring FB management’s distractions due to privacy, there isn’t much reason why FB wouldn’t want ADBE to migrate from Azure to FB’s private cloud.Possibility: HighAlthough competitive bids can only increase the winner’s dilemma for ADBE’s acquirer, the funding requirement and ADBE’s tight integration with MSFT are likely to discourage most suitors.MSFT seems intensely focused on growing Azure and ADBE could be the stepping stone to grow Azure’s dominance. While IBM’s acquisition of RHT came at a time when RHT had seen a slowdown in growth, MSFT will be buying a growing experience business in ADBE. This is likely to warrant a significant premium for ADBE. In addition to ADBE's own improving fundamentals, potential interest from MSFT makes ADBE a strong investment bet.Notes:"

(NASDAQ:ADBE) has produced some amazing financial results during the last 3 years (2015 to 2017). 2018 is looking to be a record year for the company. Even if the stock is currently selling at a Price-Earnings ratio above 50, I think the company is still a good investment for growth investors.The company’s strategy to focus on selling its products via its Cloud/Subscription plans has improved the net margins dramatically. This trend should continue as sales from its product subscription plans now make up more than 80% of its total revenues.Source: Adobe Annual Report 2017As we can see in the Income Statements table, revenues have increased at a growth rate of 15.8% per year between 2013 and 2017. Even better, revenues grew by 23% between 2015 and 2017. If we look at ADBE’s quarterly results for 2018, we can estimate revenues to reach $8.7-8.8 B by the end of 2018, which would represent a 1-year growth of 20%.What I like the most about ADBE’s financial performance is the improvement in net margins. Profit margins improved from 7.2% in 2013 to 23.2% in 2017. If we look at the company’s quarterly results for 2018, we can expect the net margin to be around 27-30%. This is quite an improvement from 2013.The main driver behind the improvement in the company’s net margins is certainly the shift of its revenues from selling Products to selling Subscriptions. Let’s have a look at the 3 tables below:Source: Adobe Annual Report 2017As we can see, and as we will discuss in the ‘Discussion and Outlook’ section, the company is now generating a very large percentage of its revenues from its Cloud subscription plans. We will also discuss how the company has categorized its products into 3 reportable segments: Digital Media, Digital Marketing, and Print & Publishing.A quick look at the balance sheet shows that the company is in a good position to cover its short-term liabilities, with a current ratio above 2. Liabilities are growing at a faster pace than assets, as ADBE made a few acquisitions during the last 5 years. The company also bought Magento and Marketo in 2018. Investors should keep an eye on this aspect of the business as we move forward.Stockholders’ equity grew at a modest rate of 5.9%. I like to see equity grow at a faster rate. However, the company completed some acquisitions and repurchased some of its shares. At this time, I am not too concerned about the growth in liabilities and the modest growth in shareholders equity.DCF ModelThe output of my DCF model provides a price per share of 251$ / share. At its current price of 248,15$ / share, the shares seem to be selling at a fair value. The price target for the next year (12 months) is 280$ / share. This is 12% above its current market price.P/E & PEG RatiosLet’s now look at ADBE’s P/E and PEG ratios against some of its peers:Given the numbers in the table above, I conclude that ADBE is selling at a decent Price-Earnings given its expected growth potential.With revenues growing at +20% and net margins now approaching 30%, the company has done quite well during the last 3 years to generate positive cash flows for its shareholders. Here are 2 quotes from the company's Q4 FY2018 targets:The question here is whether the trend is sustainable or not. I will discuss the company’s growth potential during the next 5 years.Increasing Revenues from Subscription plansThe main driver behind the improvement in net margins is that the company now makes most of its sales from monthly or annual subscriptions. Users now download the products and pay a monthly/annual fee to use them. The company does not have to print CDs, package them and sell them through stores anymore. Purchasing is now made on the net directly to ADBE. Most software companies are now using this strategy to sell their products. Costs to produce the CDs are now a thing of the past, and the profits do not have to be split between developers and store operators.As we have seen in the Financial Results section, ADBE’s percentage of sales produced from its Subscription plans has increased year after year and now makes up 84% of its revenues (2017). I expect this trend to continue and reach +90% within the next 5 years.Revenues from all 3 of the company’s segments are shifting to subscription plans.Digital Media SegmentIn ADBE’s financial statements, the company recognizes its revenues from 3 distinct segments: Digital Media, Digital Marketing, and Print & Publishing.The Digital Media Segment is the most lucrative of the segment, and the one growing at a faster rate. The products listed under this segment include Adobe Photoshop & Lightroom, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, to name a few.These products are used by professionals working in graphic design, photographs, web developers, animators, designers, etc. Even if the competition is stiff, most notably from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), Corel, and Microsoft, the branding of ADBE’s products is solid and we should expect these products to be in high demand by graphic design professionals in years to come.ADBE also offers various plans to its users. Its clients can choose the plan that suits them so they can use the products they need to support their work. The Digital Media Segment Subscription Plans are supported by Adobe Creative Cloud.The Digital Media Segment makes up 68.5% (2017) of ADBE’s revenues. With an average growth rate of 27% between 2015 and 2017, I expect this segment alone to provide 10-12% growth during the next 5 years.Digital Marketing SegmentThe Digital Marketing Segment is the second-largest segment of the company. The products from this segment are offered through Adobe Experience Cloud. The products offered through the Experience Cloud includes Adobe Analytics, Adobe Audience Manager, Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Media Optimizer Search, etc.These products enable customers to develop their web marketing strategies and help them deliver their products to their targeted audience.This segment represents 30% of ADBE’s Revenues (2017) and it is growing at a rate of 18.5% since 2015. The competition is, however, quite stiff, most notably from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The company should be able to grow its revenues from this segment because of the growth potential from the Web Marketing/Advertising market. However, because of the presence of Google, I would expect the growth rate to slow down in the following years. A growth rate of 10-12% from this segment would provide 3-4% growth in ADBE’s top line during the next 5 years.ADBE's latest acquisitions (Magento, Marketo) should boost the offering from this segment. It remains to be seen what will be the impact of both acquisitions on the profitability and growth of the Digital Marketing Segment.Print & Publishing SegmentThe Print & Publishing Segment of ADBE generates the smallest percentage of the company’s revenues. The star product offered under this segment is Adobe Acrobat. This is one of the better-known products offered by ADBE.This segment only accounts for 2% of ADBE revenues (2017). Revenues from this segment have been declining since 2015 at a rate of -5.4%.At this point, I do not think that the Print & Publishing Segment will have a large impact on the company’s growth during the next 5 years.Recurring RevenuesWe have noted above that the Subscription plans have a positive impact on the company’s net margins. We must also acknowledge that subscriptions have another non-negligible advantage: Recurring revenues.Monthly and annual fees cost less to customers upfront, but after 2-3 years, the company will generate more cash flow than collecting cash by simply selling its products once. Monthly and annual fees are also easier to predict, which will reduce some of the risk when analyzing the company’s financial results and predicting future income.Information on its Q3 FY2018 Earnings Call seems to back up my expectations:International SalesADBE generates its revenue across the globe. However, as we can see in the table below, sales from the United States represent above 50% of the company’s business.Values in Million USDSource: Adobe Annual Report 2017Even if the American market will still provide most of the growth during the next 5 years, I see a real opportunity for the company to gain market shares in Europe and in the Asia-Pacific area during the next 10 years. This could be a major growth driver for long-term investors.To increase its sales in Europe, Management provided this information on its Q3 FY2018 Earnings Call Script:The company has its share of risk that could undermine the profitability of its operations in years to come.Here is a list of risks investors should carefully monitor:Adobe has the tools to provide growth rate of 12-15% in years to come, because of the following aspects of its business:Even if the stock is currently trading at a price-earnings ratio above 50, its current momentum, expanding net margins and growth potential make ADBE a solid investment at its current market price."

All supported (sometimes created) by software systems and “apps”. It is a continually developing and improving activity which can become (under the right circumstances) a rich and long-lived business.One of the software producers most-recognized by computer users, both professional and individuals is Adobe, Inc. (ADBE). Its digital imaging aids permeate the digital marketing community and the non-professional individual photographing community. Adobe Photoshop is a raster graphics editor developed and published by Adobe Systems for macOS and Windows. Photoshop was created in 1988 by Thomas and John Knoll. WikipediaHere is how dozens of software vendors' prospects are currently perceived by investment-market professionals.Figure 1(note: all materials from blockdesk.com have been approved for use in this article)Upside price rewards come from the behavioral analysis (of what to do right, not of errors) by Market-Makers [MMs] as they protect capital they must put at risk from possible damage from future price moves. Their forecasts of potential reward (best upside likely price change) are measured by the green horizontal scale.The risk dimension is of actual-experience price drawdowns at their most extreme point while being held in previous pursuit of upside rewards similar to the ones currently being seen. They are measured on the red vertical scale.Both scales are of percent change from zero to 25%. Any stock or ETF whose present risk exposure exceeds its reward prospect will be above the dotted diagonal line. Best reward-to-risk tradeoffs are to be found on this map at the frontier of alternatives, down and to the right.Currently the most-advantaged on just a risk~reward basis are MSCI, Inc. (MSCI) at location [5], MicroStrategy Incorporated (MSTR) at [9] and Ellie Mae, Inc. (ELLI) and LogMeIn, Inc. (LOGM) at [2].This map is a good starting point, but it can only cover some of the investment characteristics that often should influence an investor’s choice of where to put his/her capital to work. The table in Figure 2 covers the above considerations and several others.Figure 2The Figure 2 table has two distinctive parts. The first 4 numeric data columns [B]-[E] are products of the analysis of current behavior of market professionals. Those columns and the one headed Range Index report what that behavior implies about the current expectations of investment professionals for the likely range of stock or ETF prices in the coming 3-4 months.The remaining columns report what actual market price activity produced when prior forecasts for each stock similar to those of today were used to manage investments under a common portfolio discipline. The Range Index column tells what percentage of each stock’s current forecast lies below the current market price. Under the Sample Size column heading a count of the number of prior forecasts with Range Indexes like today’s is indicated, along with the total number of all forecasts available from the past 5 years of market days.Thinking about the credibility of the current forecasts, the proportion of those similar prior forecasts that could produce a capital gain profit becomes a significant measure. It demonstrates the capability of the forecasters to be helpful to the wealth-building investor. Its proportion as a percent of the prior forecasts sample is in the column headed Win Odds.The Win Odds has an important impact on the Realized Payoff column next to it, where the NET gains of all the prior forecasts in the sample are reported. These results include the actual losses taken under our standard portfolio management discipline TERMD, applied to all forecast situations. TERMD sets the top of each implied price range forecast as a sell target for that single forecast. When first reached within the next 3 months’ closing market price that forecast position is closed so that the expanded capital can be immediately reinvested the following market day. If not reached in 3 months the position is closed and reinvested, regardless of gain or loss.The Risk~Reward Tradeoff map of Figure 1 presents upside forecast prospects to be pitted against actual prior worst-case downside price exposures during TERMD holding periods. The flavor of the prospective reward carrot, the column headed in the Figure 2 table as %Upside Sell Target, was muted there by the worst-tasting next-column experience headed Maximum Drawdown.That point is viewed as the most likely high-stress point to cause an untimely termination of the adventure. A termination then would be at the least productive, most damaging point. Instead, committing the discipline’s full 3-month time investment (but not beyond) might achieve potential recovery to profitability, perhaps even to reach the forecast sell targetBetween the target “cup” and the %Payoff “lip” serious adjustments to commitment enthusiasms can (and usually may) occur. They are indicated by the column headed Cred.Ratio where the Realized Payoff accomplishment is contrasted with the %Upside Sell Target offering.This more critical Reward~Risk comparison draws on the Win Odds (and its complement) to condition the Realized Payoff and the Maximum Drawdown as indicated in the Odds-Weighted columns.Figure 2’s rows provide all these important dimensions issue by issue for the more promising securities in Figure 1. They are accompanied by similar boldfaced measures of SPY to give a taste of “the market” as most frequently observed by the investing public.At the bottom of the table simple averages of the listed stocks offer comparisons of the group with SPY and with a much broader population of over 2,700 stocks and ETFs as measured on this day. The full population data often reveals overly optimistic sell targets and abysmal payoff results. In contrast, the population’s “top10” issues, ranked by their odds-weighted prior forecast histories, typically present annual rates of capital accumulation in the +75% to +90% range and even above, as they do now.Often the more attractive issues fairly quickly resolve their (for whatever reason) underpriced condition, producing a “speed” of capital gain which enriches the CAGR of a portfolio. A more useful condition to those investors whose situations face potential time-defined financial needs to be met by the portfolio sooner than it would likely be able to satisfy. An Active Investment Management strategy able to selectively shift capital into and out of such opportunities often is a solution to such needs.One tool to identify the presence of such opportunities, and to choose between them, is show in Figure 3.Figure 3The orientation of this map is like that of the Reward~Risk Tradeoffs in Figure 1; good is down and to the right, not-so is up and to the left. Items in the white Payoffs area at left have achieved average Win Odds by amounts less than 80 out of 100, and those in the extreme upper left corner may also have had negative % payoffs from prior forecasts at current RI-levels.Present market prospects, as represented by SPDR S&P500 Index ETF (SPY) at location [1] offer coming price change payoffs better than some Software stocks and less than others. But it does so at very high historical odds of performance in the next 3 months, based on its past 5 years’ price performance following forecasts like today’s.The more interesting alternatives here are those with high odds for a profitable investment experience, but with a better-than-market-index prospect. Best of the group in payoff prospect is MSTR at [4], but its profitability odds fall to only 2 out of 3. The odds for ELLI at [9] rise to 8 of 10, and MSCI at [2] has an almost 19 out of 20 history.Best odds in the group is Blackbaud, Inc. (BLKB), provider of software support to organizations seeking donations from supporting charitable donors. Its only caution is that the stock’s current forecast is so attractive (a low Range Index of 1) that in 5 years that has only happened 24 times – less than once in ten weeks, on average. But it has been followed by reaching its sell target each time, in about two months – 45 market days. A small, but powerful, credible sample.Perhaps best-known to investment professionals is MSCI, Inc.(NYSE:MSCI), a spin-out of Morgan Stanley which originated from the creation of price indexes for groups of market securities, used by analysts and money managers internal to the parent. The independent (?) company now offers investment decision support tools to the entire investment industry.More familiar to individuals may be LogMein (LOGM), a provider of internet cloud-based communication services assisting group meetings free of attendee re-location inconveniences, along with other communication services.Opportunities for near price-change capital gains appear to be better among less-well-known vendors of software and related services than for some giants, like Adobe (ADBE) or Microsoft (MSFT). The prospect for double-digit gains at a double-digit basis-points per day rate exist in BLKB, MSCI, and LOGM, making them attractive as buys in an Active Investment Management strategy such as TERMD."

The management's focus on going beyond transformation to become the one-stop shop for digital consumption is likely to create a deep competitive moat, to the company's advantage. Despite spending liberally on acquisitions, ADBE's vision and operating leverage are likely to sponsor business growth, which can lead to meaningful stock price appreciation.ADBE is best known as a company providing solutions for the creation, distribution and measurement of digital content. ADBE breaks its business into three reportable segments - digital media, digital experience and publishing (legacy solutions).Source: ADBE Financial Model. Note: The ADBE Financial Model has been developed by the author using SEC filings, the company's investor disclosures and competitor analysis. The ADBE Financial Model is a multi-scenario, three-statement model that estimates financials for the next seven years and summarizes the expectations through a DCF valuation.Digital media accounts for the bulk of the business and offers solutions (including Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.) as a subscription service, across platforms.Source: ADBE Investor Handout - July 2018During the company's 2018 MAX conference, ADBE disclosed that the company's total addressable market (TAM) is expected to grow to $36.7 billion by 2021.Source: Adobe MAX 2018However, the bigger growth opportunity lies in the digital experience market.Source: Adobe MAX 2018 ADBE’s portfolio of digital experience assets includes analytics-based marketing, advertising and commerce solutions.Source: Adobe MAX 2018The company’s solutions cater to marketers’ desire for continual improvement in targeting efficiency, while growing reach.Although ADBE has a long-standing history in digital media products, the company’s entry in digital experience is relatively new. The digital experience space in itself has been growing due to marketers’ preference for digital as the go-to medium for better ROIs. The increasing dependence on technology has led to rapid growth and evolution of the digital space, giving rise to competition. Despite the competition, ADBE claims to be a leader in most of the markets for digital experience.Source: Adobe MAX 2018In a market crowded by some of the biggest names, ADBE's claims seem to be supported by independent research firms.Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience PlatformsSource: GartnerADBE has been ranked as a leader in the digital experience segment by Gartner in its Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Digital Experience Platforms and by Forrester in its Forrester Wave for Enterprise Marketing Software Suites.The company's leadership position has been predicated on the management's vision for ADBE's product stack, which seems to be revolving around data.The product stackIf cloud-based digital media is the new cake, the enterprise marketing capability is the icing on the cake because of the end use case of the ability to communicate value.Source: Adobe MAX 2018Data seems to be at the heart of ADBE's focus on experience, which helps create a measurable return on investment (ROI) for the end user. Data-driven advertising and marketing capabilities also present a natural affinity for commerce resources – a client would rather have a single platform to market a campaign, sell the product and measure the ROI of spending.Since Magento's commerce cloud widens the scope of ADBE’s offering set, ADBE continues to capture natural demand arising from its core businesses. Not to mention the developer community of over 300K that ADBE got access to through the Magento acquisition.Part of the reason for the Magento acquisition getting disproportionate attention was the fact that Magento Commerce Cloud was filling up a gap in ADBE’s offering stack, making the overall offering a more complete suite.Source: Adobe MAX 2018Marketo's acquisition is likely to be another arrow in ADBE's quiver.Source: Adobe MAX 2018Marketo is a leader in cloud based B2B marketing engagement offerings. The completeness of ADBE’s stack also helps the company steadily pivot its business model towards experiences, rather than just products. The company’s CEO, Mr. Shantanu Narayen explains:Source: CMO ADBE’s focus on experience also stems from the siloed nature of many of the current solutions, which limit the ability to benefit from multiple interactions with the same customer across different channels. The company’s multichannel presence and ADBE’s strategic partnerships are aimed at providing a wider coverage across platforms.Strategic partnership with MicrosoftThe relationship between ADBE and Microsoft (MSFT) looks similar to that between Tom and Jerry. On the one hand, the two companies compete with each other and on the other hand, MSFT is possibly ADBE’s most important reseller.Source: 3Q18 Earnings Call ADBE seemingly has the upper hand in terms of the product, while MSFT has a better distribution reach. The evolution of this relationship is very interesting with ADBE’s customer profiling efforts potentially aimed at disintermediating ADBE’s dependence on MSFT for distribution.Unified Experience The focus on integrating fragmented user behaviors across channels has led ADBE to transition towards a platform, capable of providing a complete view of the user behavior. The company calls this view ‘unified customer profile’ (UCP).Source: Adobe MAX 2018UCP is essentially a set of parameters that capture users’ behavioral and demographic information across ADBE’s solution and channel presence. The mere prospect of having access to a psychologically segmented user database is mouth-watering for marketers. The demand for data is likely to cause a self-sustaining chain reaction: as the number of marketers flocking to ADBE grows, ADBE’s datasets will also grow in utility which will drive further demand.Before people complain of user privacy intrusion, one must understand the background of UCP. Facebook (FB) had faced flak for its treatment of user privacy because FB was using technology to build behavioral profiles of users, without explicit consent. ADBE has a much more sophisticated approach towards user data mining for marketing. While FB was used primarily for recreational purposes to begin with, majority of ADBE’s products have had established commercial objectives with customers willingly sharing usage patterns to improve experience. Thus, ADBE mining data to enhance user experience (from a CXO perspective) has a very different context than FB selling ‘free’ user information to marketers. In both cases, the end product for the platform is the user data sold to the advertiser/marketer. The consensual nature of the ADBE’s offering is likely to give a fillip to demand, which is likely to get amplified on the back of the company’s existing reach. (ADBE's approach compares favorably with that of FB. The social media giant has been known to manipulate user behavior by way of its data mining capabilities, without users’ consent, to test out the best way to serve ads).The benefits of UCP are obvious – as ADBE becomes one stop shop for marketer demand for user experience, the number of transactions and pricing per transaction improves. Interestingly, ADBE has also been reporting the total transactions processed by the company over the last many years.Transaction growthWhile the transaction volumes reported only captures the cloud/web part of the business, these volumes should represent the lion’s share (and key focus) of ADBE’s business.Source: ADBE Financial Model. Note: Revenue/transaction or pricing has been calculated using the total reported revenue for the year and dividing it by the number of transactions. Since a small part of ADBE revenue is also derived from on-premise product, the pricing calculated here is marginally overstated. However, the trend in the actual pricing and calculations shown here are unlikely to be very different since cloud revenues as a portion of the total business should account for majority of the revenues. While the transaction (volume) growth can put Moore’s law to shame, the price per transaction has been dropping like a dead fly! The net result has been a CAGR of ~16% in revenue growth over F2013-2017.The tacit acceptance and facilitation to help analyze the company’s business as that of a software technology company as well as a data processing company say a lot about ADBE management. The company seems to have a calibrated approach towards investor communication – measure twice, cut once. Instead of boisterous claims or abrupt tweets, ADBE has been consistently offering a gentle whiff of the company’s intentions through legitimate disclosure methods. In this context, the management commentary is all the more fascinating:Source: 3Q18 Earnings CallSince ADBE does not break down between the free and paid customer growth and usage, the information available and the commentary could be interpreted as follows:Source: ADBE Financial ModelThe margin improvement is a likely result of an increasing conversion of free to paid customers and cost control, which in turn has resulted in a healthy balance sheet.ModelIn the past, growth in the number of transactions has had an almost perfect negative correlation with the pricing. While a variety of factors could have contributed to the steep decline in pricing, the biggest reason is the rapid proliferation of digital. Assuming that the growth of internet usage and thus the transaction growth is unlikely to slow down, pricing should continue falling with transaction growth.Source: ADBE Financial Model. Note: The expected annual decline in pricing, in the bull case, is much higher than in the bear case.The three scenarios differ in expected growth in transactions, the associated pricing changes and the consequent difference in operating leverage. While the bull case is not difficult to visualize, ADBE's stance on TAM warrants the enthusiasm to be toned down. Thus, the base case could be the most appropriate way forward.Base caseSource: 3Q18 Earnings Call While the absolute number of transactions is likely to follow an exponential growth curve, the base effect could lead to the increase in the number of transactions to plateau.Source: ADBE Financial ModelHowever, the inherent operating leverage in the business is likely to sustain margins levels:Source: ADBE Financial ModelAt the scale of transactions that ADBE processes, every penny gets magnified into billions of dollars of cash flows.Source: ADBE Financial ModelAt an expected FCF (2018E) of $3.2 billion, ADBE trades at an FCF yield of 2.5% or P/FCF of 40x.By the traditional measure of valuation for cloud software companies, ADBE trades at an expensive P/S of 14.5x.ADBE data by YChartsThis mid-teen multiple also presents a fundamental problem, when compared to ADBE’s total addressable market.Source: ADBE Investor Handout - July 2018Source: Adobe MAX 2018ADBE is likely to report ~$9 billion of revenue in F2018E. Using the TAM (2020 estimate), the company has a 9-11% revenue share. How can a company that owns 11% of the market be worth 1.25-1.5x the TAM? Companies such as Salesforce (CRM) and Spotify (SPOT) have had similar issues. For the current company:Therefore, using a rich P/S multiple of 9x (implying a revenue visibility of 9 years), ADBE’s equity value should be valued at $81 billion. Is this another opportunity to gain 40%+ by shorting the stock?ADBE's thesis doesn’t fit in the TAM/Market Cap paradigm, and for good reason. Firstly, ADBE's margin profile is much less dependent on non-cash items vs. some of the other big names in the cloud space. And secondly, the company is increasingly becoming an experience-oriented (transactions focused) player and not just a pure-play SAAS vendor for digital media. The leaders in payment processing (Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA)) trade at P/S of over 15.5x and still have considerable upside. Thus, looking at ADBE from a data processing centric business, the company’s stated TAM does not help the cause of valuation. Instead, ADBE is best valued by capturing the long-term value of the business, which can be best done through a DCF. Across the three scenarios, the estimated DCF value/share is as follows:Source: ADBE Financial ModelThe average price of $334 represents a 30%+ upside to the current price levels. The key risk to ADBE’s growth thesis is from its advertising business getting impacted due to increasing privacy concerns. Also, worth mentioning are potential issues from increase in competition from the likes of CRM.However, ADBE's focus on data across to deliver on customer experience is likely to continue becoming a competitive differentiator for the company.Source: Adobe MAX 2018The company's enviable market position, growth in the underlying business (as evidenced by the expanding TAM), steady pivot towards a data processing-oriented model and operating leverage make ADBE a high-quality play on digital consumption.Notes:"
4212971,103480,2018-10-21T07:54:49-04:00,"Software giant Adobe has proven to be one of the most resistant names in technology, dipping only slightly while high-growth software peers are down 20-30% from peak prices.Adobe, on the other hand, is only 10% off highs, but even this mild dip is a great opportunity to pick up shares of a perennially expensive stock.Helping Adobe's stability is a prelim guidance release for FY19 that features 20% y/y revenue growth in FY19.Adobe's recent buyout of Marketo also deepens its push into enterprise-oriented products. It was also named a Gartner Leader in the ad tech space last week.With a self-estimated TAM above $100 billion, Adobe can credibly sustain ~20% y/y growth for many years, like fellow large-cap SaaS stock Salesforce.com.","With the surprise downturn in many technology and growth stocks, many investors are scrambling to rotate their portfolios toward cyclically-resistant names. Among these, in my view, is Adobe (ADBE), the popular software publisher behind household names like Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Reader, and Adobe Photoshop.What I find especially attractive about Adobe now is that, after its highly successful transition to a SaaS-oriented, subscription-focused business model, the company has also accelerated its push into enterprise software, increasing its market opportunity far beyond the consumer software staples that it's probably best known for. Last month, Adobe announced that it was purchasing marketing software firm Marketo (which was a fast-growing public software company prior to its buyout by private equity) for just shy of $5 billion, highlighting its increased focus on growing its marketing software (""mar-tech"", as it's sometimes called in the industry) business.Companies like Adobe, with consistent growth and perpetually high margins that allow for massive EPS expansion quarter after quarter, rarely trade cheaply. Adobe is one of the best-performing large-cap software stocks of the year, and even the recent downturn didn't take away too much of its gains. Year to date, Adobe is still up 40%, despite being down 10% from highs near $280.ADBE data by YChartsShares of Adobe are rarely on sale, and I view a 10% discount to be as opportune of a buying window as any. While many other tech stocks are down 20-30% from highs, with some stocks like Dropbox (DBX) down even 40% from highs, Adobe has proven that it is among the more resilient of tech stocks. Goldman Sachs (GS) has echoed this view, noting that Adobe and VMware (VMW) are two solid software picks to ride out a downturn, as reported by SA News.Let's review the bullish case for this fantastic growth stock - and use any near-term pullback to buy.Part of the reason investors have still stuck with Adobe despite the deeper pain felt across the software sector is because the company recently released upbeat guidance for FY19. At a meeting of Wall Street analysts, Adobe released the following targets for FY19:Figure 1. Adobe FY19 guidanceSource: Adobe investor relationsNote that Adobe is close to a $10 billion annual revenue run rate, so 20% y/y growth implies $2 billion in incremental revenues - and this is a rare feat for a company so large. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the subscription-oriented revenue model that Adobe has pivoted toward - assuming high retention rates hold, Adobe can cling to last year's revenues without any effort at all, and new business is purely incremental to top-line growth.Very few software companies of this scale are able to maintain this kind of growth rate - the only other one that comes to mind is Salesforce.com (CRM), which has also seen consistent above-market stock performance. Salesforce has famously pledged to ~20% growth in perpetuity, as it has outlined a plan of hitting $20 billion in revenues by FY22 (double its current size).The important difference between Adobe and Salesforce, however, is that Adobe is tremendously profitable - from a GAAP perspective as well as non-GAAP and cash flow standpoint. While Salesforce has managed to turn positive pro forma EPS and free cash flow, large GAAP profits have always eluded it, to the ire of many investors.Adobe, on the other hand, has generated 29% net margins in the first nine months of FY18 while growing its GAAP EPS by 61% y/y over the same time period. Against this kind of performance and against an expected growth trajectory of ~20% y/y for many years, it's more than reasonable to pay for Adobe's current valuation. Analysts, as reported by Yahoo Finance, are expecting EPS of $7.98 in FY19, so Adobe is currently trading at a P/E ratio of 31x against FY19 EPS and a PEG ratio of 0.50x, based on its trailing nine-month EPS growth rate. I'd say that's a steal.The expectation of a stable ~20% y/y growth trajectory for Adobe isn't just a casual estimate: it's supported by Adobe's massive TAM. In the same press release that announced Adobe's prelim FY19 targets, Adobe also updated its 2021 TAM to $108 billion (previously, it had noted an $83 billion TAM in 2020).With a revenue run rate of ~$10 billion, and if we believe Adobe's estimation of its own TAM, Adobe is very under-penetrated despite being one of the largest software companies in the market. With so much greenfield market opportunity in front of it, ~20% y/y growth in perpetuity isn't unreasonable.One of the key growth opportunities for Adobe is in its marketing software products. In late September, Adobe announced that it would be buying Marketo for $4.75 billion (Vista Equity Partners bought the company for $1.8 billion off the public markets in 2016, so this isn't a bad return for Marketo's owners either).At the time of its sale to Vista Equity Partners in 2016, Marketo generated approximately $250 million of revenues. Now, according to Adobe's conference call on the Marketo acquisition, the company generated $320 million of revenue and is expected to grow at ""greater than 20%"" in 2018 with improved operating margins as well. The Marketo acquisition will bump up Adobe's revenue scale by 3-4% immediately, while providing a solid growth engine for the future.The Marketo acquisition also highlights Adobe's increasing push toward enterprise software, as its traditional consumer software businesses become more saturated. Of Adobe's >$100 billion TAM, the lion's share of untapped opportunity lies in enterprise. Adobe's core competency within enterprise SaaS lies in marketing and ad-tech software.At present, Adobe's ""Digital Experience"" segment generates just about a quarter of its year-to-date revenues, as shown in Adobe's financial summary below. Over time, however, this enterprise-oriented segment can grow to overtake Adobe's business.Figure 2. Adobe revenue mix Source: Adobe investor relationsAdobe isn't just a casual entrant into the space, either. Last week, the reputed software research firm Gartner bestowed a top-ranking Leader distinction to Adobe in the ad-tech space. Recognition by Gartner curries plenty of weight with IT buyers, and validates Adobe's strength in marketing software and ad tech. Going forward, investors should watch Adobe's Digital Experience growth closely, as it is the key to capturing a greater slice of a $100 billion TAM.Adobe has a lot of bullish factors going for it at the moment, so I view the opportunity to buy more shares at a 10% discount as a treat. Recent news coming from the company show nothing but a business that is firing on all cylinders, on track to meet FY18 goals while setting robust, yet achievable targets for FY19. Adobe is entering new markets (that is, enterprise software) from a position of strength - its consumer products have virtually no equal in the market, so all of its growth in ad-tech is purely additive.This is one of the few software stocks, in my opinion, that is safe to leave in a portfolio for 5-7 years that is nearly guaranteed to outperform the broader market. Stay long."
4226852,103231,2018-12-06T16:32:53-05:00,"The stock price of Adobe seems particularly attractive after a short contraction due to overall market uncertainty, even after the recovery seen in recent days.Adobe has positioned itself as a leader in the Digital Media space thanks to several secular trends and the qualities its cloud applications offer.Adobe’s revenue growth, paired with its increasing EPS and its expanding FCF, makes the company one of the best investments in the industry.","The Fed's decision to maintain gradual increases in the interest rate has caused the market to enter a prolonged downtrend. The falls in the market prices recorded during October continued throughout November, with the technology and energy sectors being the most affected. However, one of the most resistant industries despite this uncertain environment has been the Software industry, which still maintains an increase of 17% YTD.^SPX data by YChartsAlthough the software companies have also suffered a contraction in their prices during this bear market, we see that this has been mitigated thanks to the expectations that have been generated around trends such as the cloud, Software-as-a-Service models (SaaS), and the digital transformation. The fears transferred from the technology sector to the software industry have begun to dissipate recently; after Salesforce Inc. (NYSE: CRM) increased its revenue expectations for its fiscal year, and Nutanix (NASDAQ: NTNX) improved its gross margins all over the year, the cloud software companies have seen favorable moves in the price of their shares, recovering part of the recent falls.As a result of continued growth in the software industry, most analysts have maintained their buy recommendation for many of these companies. In the case of Adobe Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: ADBE), analysts have even increased their price target after reviewing the company's online shopping predictions for the rest of the year. We see that after the contraction in the price of Adobe the stock seems particularly attractive. This is especially true considering that revenues have maintained a growth rate above 20% and the EPS have sustained a significant increase over the past three years.Adobe's strengths are not limited to its financial results. The transformation of its software offer towards applications in the cloud, added to a SaaS business model, has turned the company into the undisputed leader in the content creation space, and one of the favorite selections in the industry. (To learn more you can read our software industry review.)Although the recent recovery in the price of Adobe may dissuade some investors looking for a better entry point, we believe that the company occupies a privileged position towards next year.Applications for content creation are used in a wide range of purposes ranging from the most well-known ones - text creation, images, graphics, video and audio - to industrial applications such as simulations and prototypes. Content creation software companies have penetrated a wide range of end markets, with digital media marketing being the fastest growing.After the proliferation of social media, the budgets of digital marketing by companies have grown exponentially. Companies not only allocate more resources to their digital campaigns, but also invest more and more in content creation. This trend has provided an important growth opportunity for Adobe over recent years, where its applications have not only helped large companies to create visual content, but also small design agencies and freelancers.With the launch of its Creative Cloud offer, Adobe migrated its entire range of creative products such as Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Premiere towards the cloud. This new package not only allowed users to easily access this applications across multiple platforms but also offered them a more affordable price that increased the penetration of Adobe’s end markets. The adoption of these applications has been such that the term ""Photoshop"" has become a reference for the editing of images in the social collective.Adobe has been able to identify this transition to digital media on time and has expanded its product portfolio through M&A. The trend of companies to find better ways to attract and retain their clients with marketing experiences that are coherent and personalized is generating new opportunities for growth. The Experience Cloud segment, which includes the Marketing Cloud, Analytics Cloud, and Advertising Cloud products, helps Adobe’s customers create specific digital marketing campaigns.It is expected that this segment will continue to expand rapidly as a larger budget is allocated to digital media, as opposed to traditional media. However, we also see that Adobe faces more competition in this area as the prospects of this market attract more participants. We believe that Salesforce offers are the most significant and notorious, as their Einstein Analytics and Marketing Cloud applications are also showing rapid growth.Despite this, we estimate that the digital marketing market still has room to expand given the early phase it is in. This stage is marked by strategies focused on cross selling and upselling, so we still do not see friction between the offers of Adobe and Salesforce that makes us think that growth in this segment will reduce its pace in the medium term.Source: Data extracted from filings from the SEC.Although larger companies such as SAP AG (NYSE: SAP) and Oracle Corp. (NYSE: ORCL) have also ventured into the digital marketing space, we see that Adobe's Experience Cloud offering and Salesforce applications have quickly positioned themselves as the preferred choice among small and medium-sized companies, while adding more large clients. We see that both companies are pure players within this space, which has quickly positioned them as market leaders.Looking at the sub-industry of application software, it is found that most of these companies have easily maintained a double-digit growth thanks to the secular trends of SaaS models and cloud offerings. For its part, Adobe has managed to maintain a CAGR above 20% in the last three years thanks to organic growth from its Digital Media segment, and more recently Digital Marketing, while continuing to increase its portfolio of applications through M&A.Although at first glance the company seems to be priced at a considerable premium from a PS point of view, we believe that the company offers a much higher value than the rest of the industry thanks to the tremendous growth that its EPS have seen. Adobe's PEG ratio seems relatively attractive compared to the rest of the industry, especially considering that the company is one of the most competitive industries in the market.Source: Data provided by Fidelity and various third parties.Additionally, we estimate that the early migration of its creative products to the cloud has allowed Adobe to expand its margins while reducing the sensitivity and cyclical nature of its revenues. Its Creative Cloud offer has almost monopolistic qualities thanks to a significant network effect and its high switching cost, which has allowed the management to maintain a cost structure well below the industry average.This operational efficiency has not only resulted in a steady growth in the net income, but also in a significant increase in the free cash flow, allowing the executives to maintain a share repurchase program that by 2018 amounted to $8 billion. We see that the company offers a value well above the rest of the industry thanks to its robust FCF, which gives it the ability to continue with its growth strategies while actively returning capital to investors.Source: Data provided by Fidelity and various third parties.In general, the capacity of the business model to generate a positive FCF, added to the competitive advantages of Adobe applications, positions the company as one of the best in the software industry. The company has several growth drivers that make it attractive for the long term, while executives continue to consolidate their new offers in the medium term.Added to this, the fundamental data show a robust company that offers a value much higher than its current price. We see that the current environment of uncertainty that prevails in the market has created a valuable opportunity for long-term investors to increase their position. In the same way, despite the recent recovery in the price, we estimate that the shares still have enough room to continue appreciating both in the medium and long term."

Other investors in the company include Cervin Ventures and Bloomberg Beta.Adobe participated in CloudApp’s investment syndicate due to its interest in CloudApp’s plugin for Adobe XD, which will enable designers to share their work more quickly and streamline their collaboration efforts.As Vijay Vachani, director, partner platform and ecosystem, Creative Cloud at Adobe, stated in the deal announcement,Adobe has been a moderately active corporate investor in technology startups, investing in at least eight company financings since 2013.The graphic below shows a sample of its recent investment history by various metrics (click to enlarge):(Source: VentureDeal Database)The data indicate that Adobe has focused its investments most often in the industries of Software and Digital Media.Most of its recent investments have been in the later stages of startup company development.By geographic location, Adobe has invested frequently in California-based firms, which isn’t surprising since the firm is headquartered in San Jose, California.Adobe would do well to continue investing in startups building software for its Creative Cloud platform and I expect it will do so. The $10 million design fund is certainly a start but is a rather small fund.By comparison, Salesforce Ventures (CRM) originally started by investing smaller amounts in dozens and then hundreds of companies building for its CRM and database platform. It has invested several hundred million dollars over the years in companies of all sizes.While Adobe may not have the same scale as Salesforce, if it wants to continue to expand the value of its Creative Cloud platform, supporting innovative startups is a faster way of adding functionality than by building in-house."
4206463,103480,2018-09-15T09:06:33-04:00,"Adobe shares are up again after posting strong Q3 results.The company managed to accelerate revenue growth by 50 bps in the quarter, an impressive feat given its nearly $10 billion annual revenue scale.Adobe also continued to drive massive earnings and cash flow expansion.With reports that Adobe is pursuing accelerated growth in its marketing products through an acquisition of Marketo, the company could see even stronger growth soon.Adobe's ~$5 billion of cash gives it a considerable war chest to work with.","It seems more and more evident over the past several quarters that Adobe (ADBE), the application software company best known for products like Photoshop and Acrobat, has become very much like Salesforce.com (CRM) - but a more profitable version. Like Salesforce, Adobe has managed to maintain growth in the mid-20% range for quite some time. And when organic growth begins to slow, Adobe pursues growth via acquisitions. Marketing applications have long been one of Adobe's new core focuses and most important sources of growth, and this past week, a Reuters report broke that Adobe is pushing to acquire Marketo (MKTO). Prior to its take-private by Vista Equity Partners two years ago, Marketo was one of the best-recognized and fastest-growing SaaS companies in the so-called ""mar-tech"" space.Adobe's high degree of quality comes at a price. I've cautioned previously about buying Adobe at the top of the market - but more and more, it seems like there is no such thing as a ""top"" for Adobe. Small pullbacks are quickly reversed into gains, and the stock continues its upward trajectory almost uninterrupted. While Adobe goes against my typical grain of buying value-oriented, somewhat overlooked technology stocks, I find it unlikely that Adobe won't continue to materially outperform the market as it has been.ADBE data by YChartsAdobe is already up 57% this year. The key to getting behind Adobe's massive rise and its steep valuation, however, is to place a higher importance on its earnings growth. Looking at Adobe from a revenue multiple standpoint makes me shy away - 14x forward revenues is one of the steepest valuation multiples in the sector, hands down.But Adobe also has a powerful earnings base to consider. We often look at SaaS companies from a revenue standpoint because they have no profits to their name, but with Adobe, a 40x forward P/E ratio doesn't look too bad when we consider the fact that pro forma EPS grew 57% y/y this quarter, up to $1.73 from $1.10 in the year-ago quarter:Figure 1. Adobe earnings growthSource: Adobe investor relationsA 40x P/E ratio divided by 57% growth yields a PEG ratio of 0.70x - actually suggesting that Adobe is undervalued after giving credit for its rapid earnings growth.I've been in and out of Adobe's stock over the past year, but it seems like I should stick to my guns and ride Adobe higher. The company's growth trajectory seems unstoppable and its rapid rise in share price is a reflection of that growth, not overhype.Here's a look at Adobe's latest results:Figure 2. Adobe 3Q19 resultsSource: Adobe investor relationsRevenues grew 24.4% y/y to $2.29 billion, actually accelerating 50 bps over last quarter's revenue growth of 23.9% y/y. When a company at Adobe's scale manages to maintain its growth rate - let alone accelerate at any pace - it's a true accomplishment. Adobe has been growing in the mid-20s for quite some time, and with both organic and inorganic growth to support it, this pace of growth looks highly sustainable. Wall Street was looking for revenues of $2.25 billion, or +21.7% y/y - marketing an impressive 270 bps beat this quarter.As usual, Adobe's growth in ARR is equally impressive. For any company that is comprised primarily of subscription revenues, growth in ARR should be the chief objective - and for Adobe, it grew total digital media ARR by 6% from the prior quarter to $6.40 billion. This was helped also by record revenues from Adobe's Document Cloud, despite fears of competition from the other heavyweight in the space, DocuSign (DOCU).John Murphy, Adobe's CFO, pointed out the following drives behind the top-line strength this quarter on the Q3 earnings call:This strength translated well into bottom-line expansion. Adobe managed to increase its already sky-high gross margin to 87.1%, a 140 bps increase over 85.7% in the year-ago quarter. This makes for a powerful combination with the fact that nearly all of Adobe's revenues are on a recurring basis. This company is a profit machine - with its steady flow of subscription revenues droppings straight into the bottom line.Continued expense discipline on the operating cost side also allowed Adobe to expand its operating income by 31% y/y to $718.6 million, representing a GAAP operating margin of 31.3% - 170 bps better than 29.6% in the year-ago quarter.Operating cash flows, similarly, grew 36% y/y in the quarter, and as previously mentioned, EPS of $1.73 grew 57% y/y and beat Wall Street's expectations of $1.69.Figure 3. Adobe cash flowsSource: Adobe investor relationsIf you glance at the last section of the chart below, you'll also note that Adobe's share count has been gradually dwindling. Unlike most SaaS companies that award stock comp liberally and see their outstanding shares balloon on a quarterly basis, Adobe has been able to manage down its share count. This is an important source of EPS growth as well, alongside top-line expansion and margin improvements.Figure 4. Adobe share count history and supplementing dataSource: Adobe investor relationsThere seems to be no reason why Adobe's success should slow down anytime soon. Its ~$5 billion cash balance also gives it a plentiful war chest with which to acquire companies like Marketo and pursue even more growth. With gross margins near 90%, all of Adobe's top-line growth feeds tremendous EPS expansion - which is unlike most large SaaS companies such as Salesforce and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), which, despite reaching tremendous scale, are still struggling to produce meaningful GAAP EPS.Stay long on this name."
4211843,67113,2018-10-16T09:16:51-04:00,"Revenue is expected to grow by 23%+ this year.Analysts keep on raising earnings projections for both this year and next.Adobe, as it transitions customers to the cloud, is taking aggressive steps to increase its addressable market.Due to elevated volatility lately, we will wait for a weekly swing.","Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) competitive advantages can be clearly seen in its margins. With the company's fiscal year ending in November, we can see that its gross margins over the past four quarters equate to 87.1%. Now over the past ten years, we may have seen a slight drop in this metric but operating margins of 32.3% over the same time frame have been growing strongly and continue to trend upwards in an aggressive fashion.The digital media & digital experience segments should ensure margins remain elevated. Adobe has a potent brand in the creative software niche, so as long as the company continues to serve its customers well, we do not see meaningful competition encroaching in this area.On the digital experience or digital marketing side, CEO Shantanu Narayen recently stated that he believes this market could easily be worth $60 billion. This is a very difficult figure to try and estimate, but the potential is there for everyone to see especially when you take into account the sheer number of potential customers that this segment could be tailored to.Shareholders you feel will need to see early success in the digital experience segment especially after the recent Marketo acquisition of $4.75 billion. Add this to the Margento purchase and we are at well over $6.3 billion. Obviously, the migration of many companies of all shapes and sizes to the cloud is a strong tailwind for Adobe. The issue concerning the security of intellectual property as well as government regulation is potential roadblocks, but (being trend followers) we continue to believe digital engagement with customers will grow exponentially going forward.We also believe investors underestimate the potency of Adobe's subscription business model. Management knows that if it can really add value in areas such as marketing and analytics, its ecosystem will be enhanced and switching costs will become more elevated. In fact, when you think of the Creative Cloud software, you feel that Adobe's offering here is already embedded in enterprises as a core necessity. This belief system among employers and enterprises alike can be very difficult to disrupt for competitors no matter how good their product is. Similar to Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) routing and switching products of yesteryear, products can get entrenched in an industry where they are seen as the ""standard"". Projects, as a result, can hit the ground running when there is viable common software used among all which is why Creative Cloud still continues to be the kingpin in many markets.In terms of growing company's income from its subscription-based model, Adobe was a huge instigator of proceedings in this space with the transition of Creative Suite to the cloud. It has been a resounding success especially from the perspectives of growing margins and producing more stable earnings. Therefore, concerning the recent Marketo deal in the digital marketing space, Adobe knows that first-mover advantage in this space could end up being a huge trump card for the company. The more quality services and training the company is capable of providing, the more probable its recurring customers will ""stick"" to the company even more over time.With respect to valuation, Adobe currently trades with an earnings multiple of 49.4. Now to many, this may seem high, but the company's 5-year average, for example, is 79.8. Furthermore, forward-looking earnings projections from analysts continue to increase aggressively with $6.82 per share in earnings projected this year and $7.84 in 2019. Furthermore, with how margins have been trending, we are confident the bottom line will take care of itself as long as robust top-line growth continues. Adobe has grown its revenues by over 20% annually over the past 3 years on average and is expected to do $9 billion in sales this year which will be a 23.2%+ gain on 2017's number.To sum up, we believe Adobe's subscription revenue will drive sales and margins faster than what many believe. The likes of the Magento and Marketo deals will result in more customers and significantly increase Adobe's addressable market. Management wants to add as much value as possible through new cloud packages in order to win those subscriptions over time. We will wait for a weekly swing here before going long."

Better yet, guidance for a traditionally strong fiscal 4Q came an inch ahead of consensus, in what now seems to me like a reoccurring game of anchoring expectations at current levels and beating them three months later.Credit: Extreme TechRevenues of $2.29 billion landed precisely at my more aggressive estimate. As I noted in my earnings preview, the guided 22% top-line growth that would have represented the smallest revenue increase since early 2017 looked too conservative for my taste, considering the minor uplift from Adobe's recent acquisition. In fact, the same seems to hold true for the upcoming quarter. The guided 20% growth coupled with an estimated minimum $30 million in Magento sales (about 150 bps in YOY total company revenue increase) appear to suggest a noticeable deceleration in organic growth in fiscal 4Q18 that I find unlikely to materialize.The three-cent upside to my more aggressive fiscal 3Q18 EPS estimate began to take shape in the form of significantly better gross margin: 87.1% vs. 85.7% last year. The results confirmed my expectation for improved ARPU on the digital media side, which has been driven by a higher mix of standard-to-promotional pricing and price hikes in the U.S. for products like Lightroom, Spark and others.Opex ex-SBC came in below my expectations on an absolute and relative-to-revenue bases, which I estimate to have caused a three-cent positive impact to my EPS forecast. It looks like the slightly richer integration expenses that I expected to see this time did not materialize. Adobe took advantage of its increasing scale to create operating leverage and deliver record levels of net income that I believe could reach $1 billion per quarter, non-GAAP, by mid-fiscal 2019.See simplified P&L below.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsCertainly past performance does not guarantee future results. But I believe history can sometimes give us hints about what to expect going forward. In the case of Adobe, I am pleased to see fiscal 3Q18 financial results that were even more robust than I had forecasted last week. However, my excitement for the stock can be best illustrated by the following table:Source: DM Martins Research, using data from Yahoo FinanceSince ADBE went public in August 1986, the stock has beaten the annual return of the S&P 500 (SPY) by a factor of three. Even on a risk-adjusted basis, ADBE's 0.55 Sharpe ratio is significantly better than the benchmark's 0.30 (a rare occurrence), suggesting more reward captured for the risk taken over the period.Even though the same level of outperformance was not achieved during the massive bear markets of 2000-2002 and 2007-2009, I believe Adobe is a very different company operating in a different environment today. First, it has a compelling digital media and marketing product portfolio whose revenues I believe to be protected by a well-established subscription model.Second, whereas Adobe's target market might have been narrower ten years ago or more, I believe digital content creation and distribution have become much more spread out across a number of individual, pro, semi-pro, and large enterprise clients. The business seems to be more appealing today, and Adobe is the name to beat in its market.ADBE PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsFor all these reasons, plus the solidity of the company's balance sheet, I remain a confident ADBE shareholder. Despite valuations that could scare some (see chart above), I believe this GARP (growth at a reasonable price) stock will continue to climb at a relatively steady pace for at least a few quarters to come."

The company beat earnings estimates when they reported earnings for their quarter ended in August after the close on Thursday. Solid results occurred in digital media, digital experience and publishing.The stock closed Thursday, Sept. 13 at $268.52 up 54.1% year to date and set its all-time intraday high of $270.94 on Sept. 12. The stock traded as high as $273.39 and as low as $261.20 in after hours trading and the stock should open Friday closing in or above a fresh all-time intraday high.Courtesy of MetaStock XenithAdobe Systems remains well above a ‘golden cross’ that was confirmed back on April 6, 2016 when the stock closed at $95.40. A “golden cross” occurs when the 50-day simple moving average rises above the 200-day simple moving and indicates that higher prices lie ahead, and this was obviously a successful investment strategy for Adobe. Note how the stock has tracked the 50-day simple moving average all year with that average now at $256.25. There are four chart horizontal lines. The lowest is my annual value level at $135.82. The second line is my semiannual value level of $205.57. The third horizontal is my quarterly value level of $240.03 which held as a buying opportunity on July 2.

The 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading is projected to end this week at 76.10 up from 72.89 on Sept. 7 and will soon be overbought above the overbought threshold of 80.00.Given these charts and analysis investors should buy Adobe on weakness to the 50-day simple moving average which is rising at $256.25 and reduce holdings on strength to my monthly risky level of $293.93.

4206083,20715,2018-09-13T12:48:42-04:00,The software giant is set to report earnings after the close on Thursday.The company's fundamental performance has been among the best around.The stock has gained almost 170% in the last two years.But a pattern in the reactions to earnings suggest you should wait to go long.,"Adobe Earnings Preview: Adobe Has Been Impressive in Recent Years, but the Pattern Suggests Waiting a Week After Earnings Before Going LongThere are very few companies or stocks that can match the performance that software giant Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) has experienced in recent years. The company has seen tremendous growth in both earnings and sales and the stock is up almost 140% in the last two years. The company is set to release earnings after the close on Thursday and investors have to wonder, can the company keep it up?I think it can and here’s why.The company has tremendous momentum on its side. Over the last three years, earnings per share have grown at an average of 48% annually. The most recent quarterly report showed earnings growing by 63% and the company is expected to see earnings growth of 56% for 2018 as a whole.Sales have also been growing rapidly, but not as fast as earnings. The average growth rate in the past three years has been 23% and the most recent quarter was in line with that rate at 24%. Analysts are predicting sales growth of 22.4% for 2018.Adobe is also very efficient with a return on equity of 27.2%, a profit margin of 37.5%, and an operating margin of 32%. The company has seen cash flow from operating activities double in the last two years.The valuation on Adobe is a little high with a current P/E ratio of 48 and a forward P/E of 35. While those ratios are high compared to the overall market, there are higher ones within the tech sector and on companies whose fundamentals aren’t nearly as impressive as Adobe. You also have to consider the company’s status within its industry as a strength and something that warrants such a high valuation.Adobe’s strong product portfolio has given it a huge advantage over its competitors and has given the company a status that is almost monopolistic. Products like Acrobat and Photoshop have become standard in the graphics industry and now those products are included with the company’s Creative Cloud package. The company has also seen tremendous growth in its Document Cloud, Experience Design (XD), and Spark products.The company has continued to transform itself. As more technology has shifted to online and cloud needs from desktop-based design, the company has kept pace with the changing environment and maintained its status as the top producer of graphics solutions software. The company may lose small amounts of market share as cheaper products are released from competitors, but Adobe’s status is secure for the foreseeable future.Investor and analyst sentiment toward Adobe is neutral to optimistic overall, but it has been shifting toward a more pessimistic tone in recent months.There are 31 analysts following the stock and 25 rate the company as a “buy” while the other six rate it as a “hold.” These numbers have remained steady over the last four months. While the percentage of buy ratings (80.6%) is higher than average, it seems to be warranted based on the fundamental performance of the company and the price performance of the stock.The short interest ratio is at 1.74 and that ratio has increased in the last two months. The ratio was all the way down to 1.18 on June 15 before climbing to its current reading on August 15. The ratio has risen because of the average daily trading volume falling more so than the number of shares sold short increasing. In fact, the number of shares sold short has dropped from 4.74 million to 3.63 million in the last two months. The average daily trading volume has fallen from just over 4 million shares per day to just over 2 million shares per day from mid-June to mid-August.The options market is where we see the most pessimism. The current put/call ratio is at 0.824. That is leaning toward the overly pessimistic end of the spectrum. I used the options series that expire on Friday, along with the traditional monthly options of September and October to calculate this ratio.As I said before, the overall sentiment is a little skewed toward the optimistic side, but it has been moving toward a more pessimistic tone in the last few months.As I mentioned before, Adobe’s stock has gained almost 170% over the last two years, but that doesn’t tell the whole story. The stock has been incredibly consistent in its ascent.The weekly chart below shows how the stock has experienced very few dips since the beginning of 2017. I use the 52-week moving average as a key trendline and have seen a number of stocks use that moving average as support as they climb. In the case of Adobe, the stock hasn’t been near its 52-week in the last year and a half and has only closed below its 13-week moving average on a few occasions during that period.Of course, seeing such price strength comes with its issues. The 10-week RSI is near overbought territory and it has been that way since early in 2017. The weekly stochastic readings paint a similar picture - near overbought territory and that has been the case for most of the last 18 months.The indicator that I drew on the chart is a Raff Regression channel. The middle line is the regression line and the outer bands are equal distances from it. The distance is based on the one furthest from the regression line - in this case, the lows from last fall and in February.I drew the regression channel to show the angle of Adobe’s climb more than anything. I drew a standard deviation channel on another chart, but the stock hasn’t been anywhere near the outer rail of that channel and I used one standard deviation to draw it. I had to drop the requirements to 0.5 standard deviations for the rails to actually be touched by the trading action over the last three years. What that shows is how consistent the stock has been.The consensus estimate for the earnings report on Thursday is for Adobe to earn $1.69 per share on revenue of $2.25 billion. The EPS estimate has remained constant over the last 60 days, so they apparently feel confident in their estimate.The company has beaten analysts’ estimates in each of the last four quarters and the amount it has beaten by has been very consistent - 9.34%, 8.86%, 7.8%, and 7.64%.Even though the company has consistently turned in earnings above the consensus estimate, that hasn’t always translated into an upside move by the stock. In fact, three of the last four times the company reported earnings (the ones mentioned above), the stock moved lower the next day. Now, none of the declines have been all that great, but the stock moved down nevertheless.What I noticed with Adobe’s chart is that regardless of the fact that the company beat earnings estimates, five to seven days after the reports, the stock was lower each time. After the dips, the stock rallied over the next month.Given this information, I would suggest a delayed options play on Adobe. Watch the earnings report to see if it is in line with the past reports - beating estimates by 7 to 10%. Watch to see if it dips in the next five to seven trading days and then go long with some options. Given the pattern, the November monthly expiration series will likely make the most sense.The option premiums are pumped up currently due to the impending earnings report. By waiting until after the report and if the pattern plays out once again, you should be able to get call options at a significantly lower price.Overall, I am bullish on Adobe given its fundamentals and its technical picture. The company’s strong earnings growth and sales growth look like they will continue into the future. The sentiment toward the stock has been growing more pessimistic in recent months and as a contrarian, I find that encouraging.If you own the stock already, I suggest holding on to it. If you are looking to buy the stock, I suggest waiting about a week after the earnings report and then buying in. But the options trade idea listed above is my favorite way to play it."
4202714,69905,2018-08-28T22:45:54-04:00,"Adobe is undervalued, backed by strong and recurring revenue.Unlike its peers, Adobe's free cash flow is not skewed by non-cash adjustments.Adobe has a solid share repurchase program to boost its EPS number.","The digital communications space has come into favor with the investment community, with many companies in this space now trading at lofty premiums. Furthermore, in spite of an aggressive rally on its share price in the last two years, you may be surprised to hear me say it, but I actually think that in spite of the illusion of trading with a heavy price tag, Adobe (ADBE) is one of the few companies in this sector which is undervalued.Adobe's Q2 2018 was noteworthy, with revenue up 24% to $2.2 billion compared with $1.5 billion in the same period a year ago, while its bottom line jumped 63% YoY.As a brief reminder, Adobe has two main segments, which account for 97% of total revenue, with Adobe's smallest segment, Publishing, accounting for just 3%.In more detail, Digital Media is Adobe's largest segment, generating approximately 70% of total revenue and provides tools for creating and promoting content. Adobe's newer segment, Digital Experience, accounts for roughly 27% of total revenue and measures digital marketing. Through these two offerings, Adobe seeks to be a one-stop shop solution for making, managing and measuring content for marketers, advertisers, and other groups.Creative Cloud is the driving force behind Adobe's Digital Media segment. Creative Cloud accounted for the majority of Adobe's Digital Media's 28% YoY growth.Its Creative Cloud is a subscription-based platform which continues to perform astonishingly well and saw its revenue jump from roughly $1.01 billion to $1.30 billion - with this quarter's revenue increases coming from individual, team and enterprise subscription.Adobe's Document Cloud is smaller than its Creative Cloud Revenue. Nevertheless, its growth of 22% YoY to $243 million certainly helps Adobe's top line start to have a small element of diversification.Furthermore, significantly, Adobe's Document Cloud business achieved record revenue in Q2 2018. Particularly insightful from this quarter's call was CEO Narayen's comments in the Q&A where he openly stated that he believes that Acrobat's family products are growing into 'emerging markets' and that Adobe is presently solely focused on pushing volume for its products. Later, it will still be able to leverage pricing or ARPU - supplying Adobe with a further lever to pull on downstream.Adobe runs its operations mighty efficiently. Like most software companies, a large portion of its actual expenses come in the form of stock-based compensation. As such, when calculating Adobe's free cash flow, we need to adjust for its taxes paid on its equity awards. Given that Adobe allocated $240 million to taxes on awards in FY 2017, we would expect this figure to minimally be hitting $250 million in FY 2018. However, seeing how Adobe has already deployed $323 million in H1 2018, we can safely assume that it will exceed its normalized $250 million for FY 2018.Having said that, while Adobe's SEC filings don't disclose just how much its acquisition of Magento played a role in Adobe's elevated employee equity awards, we can most likely assume that this is a one-off event. Which brings me to free cash flow.Adobe's capex requirements, including its capitalization of intangibles, reach approximately $230-250 million. Thus, all netted out and we come to FY 2018 estimate of roughly $3.6 billion or approximately $7.35 per share of free cash flow - assuming Adobe continues to conservatively repurchase shares. This leaves Adobe trading at roughly 35X to free cash flow - note, not earnings but free cash flow.Source: author's calculations, morningstar.comThe above table highlights how each peer is trading on a P/Cash Flow multiple. However, unlike some of its peers, particularly Salesforce (CRM), Adobe is not too liberal with its non-cash stock-based compensation. With Adobe, what you see in terms of cash flow is fairly close to what you actually get - there is no significant need for adjustments to its cash flow. However, the same cannot be said about Salesforce.In other words, given that Adobe carries a rock solid balance sheet with a net cash position of approximately $4.4 billion, it is perhaps unsurprising that Adobe continues to repurchase its share at a strong clip. In fact, CFO Murphy noted on the call that Adobe was looking to deploy $900 million into repurchases over H2 2018, with a further $8 billion to be allocated starting FY 2019 to the end of fiscal 2021 - returning to investors 6.8% over the next 3 and half years.Adobe is a high free cash flow generative company, with a strong track record of generating stable and predictable free cash flows. Also, with the support from its rock-solid balance sheet, it has an ongoing aggressive share repurchase plan. I argue that in time, Adobe should be rewarded with a higher multiple to free cash flow and that long-term, patient shareholders should benefit.Author's note: The only favor I ask is that you click the ""Follow"" button so I can grow my Seeking Alpha friendships and our Deep Value network.Disclaimer: Please do your own due diligence to reach your own conclusions."

(ADBE) are down 4.29% since peaking on July 25, 2018, and in my opinion, the shares of this provider of digital documents and content creation tools are an attractive buy at current price levels. The company has a solid history of generating strong earnings growth, and the future growth ratios point to accelerated growth over the next twelve months. I lay out my bullish argument for the company below by reviewing some pertinent fundamental and technical aspects of the stock.My MGQ plays a critical part when it comes to determining if I am going to go long or short a stock. Generally, I only want to go long a stock with an MGQ higher than that of the S&P 100, and I want to go short a stock with an MGQ lower than that of the index (for a more detailed explanation of how I calculate the MGQ please see my blog post).As of the end of July 2018, the MGQ for the S&P 100 stood at 10.04.The current MGQ for ADBE stands at 17.47, which implies a 74.11% higher growth rate compared to the S&P 100. This tells us that ADBE has strong future growth potential and is a good candidate for a long position.Let's dig a little deeper into the financial data to get a better feel of how the company has performed on certain fundamental metrics and what these numbers imply for future growth.The PastDuring the past 12 months, the average EBITDA per Share Growth Rate of Adobe Systems Inc. was 37.70% per year. During the past 3 years, the average EBITDA per Share Growth Rate was 51.90% per year. During the past 5 years, the average EBITDA per Share Growth Rate was 18.70% per year. During the past 10 years, the average EBITDA per Share Growth Rate was 5.10% per year (GuruFocus). What we see with ADBE is an acceleration of earnings growth over the last three years.The operating margin % for ADBE came in at a 31.82% as of June 2018. Each dollar of revenue the company generated brought in 31.82 cents of earnings. The company's operating margin came in well above the average of 17.20% for the S&P 500, and the company's operating margin was also higher than the average of 19.35% for its industry (specific group of firms engaged in similar business activities), and 20.74% for its sector (broad segment of the economy).The FutureKnowing how a company has performed in the past is important in order to evaluate management's past record in running the business. But more important to us is how profitable the company will be in the future because we are investing going forward, not backwards. And it's the forward-looking metrics that should really get you excited about ADBE.I like to use two measuring sticks to gauge the future growth potential for companies: Forward P/E and forward rate of return.There are several ways to interpret a company's Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E). One approach is to look for companies that have a lower P/E compared to other companies in similar sectors - the rationale being that the lower the P/E, the more a company is being undervalued by the market, hence, the more value you are buying for every dollar invested. This makes a low P/E stock a good value, but there is also the other side of the coin - it can also indicate that investors aren't very confident about the company's growth prospects.I prefer to use Forward P/E (current stock's price over its ""expected"" earnings per share) to gauge a company's expected future earning power. A high Forward P/E ratio means that investors are anticipating higher growth in the future and are willing to pay more for future earnings - momentum investing is all about following the trend (perceived or real).ADBE has a Forward P/E of 32.68 compared to a 17.29 Forward P/E for the S&P 100. The Forward P/E for ADBE is higher than that of the index, indicating that investor growth prospects for the stock are higher than that of the broader market, and thus they will be willing to pay more for the shares for the higher growth rate.The forward rate of return for a stock (created by Donald Yacktman) is one of my favorite quotients for gauging the market's expectation for future growth for a company. Yacktman defines forward rate of return as the normalized free cash flow yield plus real growth plus inflation. In simple terms, the forward rate of return can be thought of as the return that investors buying the stock today can expect from it in the future.The forward rate of return for ADBE stands at 21.46%. This implies that an investor buying the stock today should expect a 21.46% return over the next 12 months. The average forward rate of return for the S&P 100 as of the end of July was at 8.85%, so ADBE has an implied potential rate of return that is 2.42x greater than that of the index.The risk inherent in the forward rate of return is that the calculation is reliable only if the company can grow at the same rate in the future as it did in the past. If the growth rate falters, the projected returns will not materialize. But we are willing to accept this risk as part of the difficult process of forecasting earnings and growth momentum.As per my ChartMasterPro Daily Trade Model, the momentum trend for ADBE turned bullish with a break above $250.00 on August 21. This signaled a bullish breakout from a bearish downtrend line which began on August 15 on the daily charts. The shares recently bounced off a longer uptrend line at $245.00, which should encourage investors to buy on the bullish breakout. From here, I see the shares climbing to the $275.00 level over the next three months.Today, I will buy the ADBE 19OCT18 245 Call Options, which will provide approximately 10x leverage on my long trade. My stop-loss exit signal for the trade will be a daily close below $245.00. When trading options with leverage, a stop-loss is absolutely imperative in order to avoid oversized losses and wipe-outs. My target return for the trade is 100% (10% share appreciation x 10x leverage on the call options).For investors in the shares, I recommend that you hold for 3 months or $275.00, whichever comes first. For longer-term investors, I believe ADBE is a solid addition to any growth portfolio over the next 12 months.It's difficult to find anything not to like in Adobe's most recent earnings report. For Q2 2018, the company reported the following Y/Y growth: revenue was up 24% and earnings increased 63%. Its Digital Media segment reported revenue growth of 28% Y/Y; its Creative Cloud segment reported revenue growth of 29%; Document Cloud revenue was up 22%; Digital Experience revenue increased 18%; and Adobe Stock (digital library of images) grew revenue 25%. Wow. And the company raised its guidance for Q3. Wow, again.But the one number that really wowed me from the Q2 earnings call was the following:Subscription revenues account for almost 90% of the company's revenues! And subscription revenues posted Y/Y revenue growth of 29.6%. The nice thing about subscription revenues is that they are predictable and sticky (more on this below). Further, the profitability ratios for the company are outstanding, especially when compared to the competition:Profitability RatiosSource: ReutersI like companies that have high profit margins compared to their competitors - this shows me that management is best of class in generating revenue and controlling costs in their industry.As the chart above shows, Adobe has posted significantly higher profit margins than its competitors both on a TTM and 5-year average basis. I would take advantage of the recent dip in the stock price to take a position in this high growth company.The company offers its creative suite of products via their Creative Cloud. They have plans for individuals, businesses, students, and schools and universities. Customers can sign up for Single App plans or for their All Apps plan. Whatever plan you choose, the one common thread is that you have to pay a recurring monthly or annual subscription fee. From a business perspective, I love this product structure, because once you're in, it's very difficult to leave - and the more you use the product, the more ""sticky"" it becomes - especially when your data and work are stored in the company's cloud.In addition to Creative Cloud, the company also offers products via their Adobe Document Cloud and Adobe Experience Cloud - all on a subscription basis. The fact that the company's subscription revenues increased by almost 30% Y/Y is proof that clients are satisfied with the product suites (if they weren't revenues would be falling as clients left) and that new clients are being acquired.In its Investor Presentation from October 2017, Adobe estimated that by 2020 its total addressable market for its full suite of products would be around $82 billion:Source: Adobe.comTotal revenue for Adobe in 2017 came in $7.29 billion - if the company is correct in its estimates about the future size of its addressable market, there is still plenty of market share that Adobe could gobble up in the coming years - and from what I see, they have the right product strategy in place to grab that market share.When I go long a stock, I want to invest in a company that provides superior future growth potential, but I also want to time the entry into any position to try to maximize my return.So, I use fundamental analysis to identify shares with a strong future growth rate, and then I apply technical analysis to identify ideal entry points.In my opinion, ADBE is an attractive buy at these levels from both a fundamental and technical perspective."

Net income was $666.3 million, or $1.34 a share, compared with $419.6 million, or $0.84 a share a year ago.

Its partner ecosystem provides thousands of pre-built extensions, including payment, shipping, tax, and logistics.The acquisition of the Magento Commerce Cloud will enable Adobe to deliver a seamlessly integrated commerce solution into the Adobe Experience Cloud. It will be able to cater to both B2B and B2C customers globally.Magento was founded in 2008 and prior to the acquisition had raised $272.5 million in funding from investors including Hillhouse Capital and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Magento's financial details are not known, but Adobe expects its revenues to be nearly $150 million for the year. The acquisition is expected to help Adobe compete with players like BigCommerce and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP).But the biggest news for Adobe has been the $4.75 billion acquisition of Marketo. Marketo was founded in 2006. It provides a complete range of marketing automation software solution that can be utilized by both SMBs and global enterprises. Its platform helps brands track their customers' activities online to help deliver more personalized advertising. Marketo listed on the Nasdaq in 2013, but two years ago, it went private when it was taken over by Vista Equity Partners for $1.8 billion.Marketo's acquisition is expected to add to Adobe's marketing-technology capabilities and will help expand its B2B platform while improving its customer experience across B2C and B2B. Over the past few years, it has been building up its martech arsenal with significant acquisitions. It started in 2009 when it picked up Omniture for $1.8 billion to include Web analytics, measurement and optimization technologies that would help it drive experiences and e-commerce across all digital media. In 2013, it added Paris-based Neolane Inc. for an estimated $600 million. Neolane was known for its marketing automation and cross-channel campaign management software and services that help B2B and B2C marketers. Its solutions enable customers to offer personalized campaigns through direct mail and digital contact, including e-mail, SMS and MMS.I would like to hear from users how this acquisition changes their world? Adobe is clearly making big moves in the marketing sector. According to recent research, the spending on digital marketing grew by 44% last year in the United States and Britain to $52 billion. Adobe's acquisitions are turning it into a single-stop shop for all of the marketer needs. What other capabilities do you think Adobe needs to add to its platform?The market is very pleased with Adobe's bold moves. Its stock is currently trading at $260.88 with a market capitalization of $127.7 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $277.61 earlier this month. It has been climbing throughout the year from the 52-week low of $143.95 that it was trading at a year ago."

        I think that guided revenue growth of 22% may be too conservative, and expect to see another top- and bottom-line beat this week.
        My convictions on ADBE speak less about my short-term predictions on fiscal 3Q18 results, and more about the long-term growth opportunities.","Software maker Adobe Systems (ADBE) is a few days away from releasing the results of its fiscal 3Q18. Last quarter, investors seemed unimpressed with the company's performance at first glance. The stock sold off immediately following the ""beat and raise"", which I called at the time ""yet another opportunity for long-term investors to partake in this growth story"".With valuation back on the rise since then, I wonder how the Street will welcome what I expect to be yet another strong quarter for the San Jose-based digital media and marketing company.Source: PremiumBeatMy bullish stance on ADBE is not based on a catalyst-centric thesis. Instead, what attracts me the most to the stock are the company's long-term prospects. The recurring nature of Adobe's revenues (nearly 88% of last quarter's top line) has been smoothing out the progression of its fast-growing sales and profits since 2014 (see graph below), which I consider one of the great benefits of owning shares.I expect the favorable trends to remain unchanged in fiscal 3Q18, with Adobe's market-leading, comprehensive suite of digital media and experience products continuing to grow at a very healthy pace. Guidance for the quarter calls for revenues of $2.24 billion which, if achieved, would result in an unusually low top-line YOY growth rate of 22% not seen in the past five quarters. In addition to thinking that the outlook may be a bit too conservative, I see small upside to third quarter results and fourth quarter guidance from the acquisition of e-commerce solutions company Magento, closed in June of this year.I expect margins to be resilient at least, as a result of recently-observed improvement in ARPU on the digital media side that has been driven by a higher mix of standard-to-promotional pricing. As the company continues to gain scale, I project that opex as a percentage of revenues will decline once again. I believe my projected improvement of only 30 bps is highly conservative to account for possibly high integration costs. But I would also not be surprised to see further earnings upside coming from this line of the income statement.Below are my estimates for fiscal 3Q18.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsIt is hard to be an ADBE contrarian.Adobe seems to be, by a long stretch, the best-positioned company in the creation, utilization, cloud storage and sharing of digital assets, and is now getting more closely involved in the e-commerce space. Some might argue that valuation has run a bit too far, as a current-year P/E of 38.7x and long-term PEG of 2.0x seem to suggest. However, considering Adobe's superior market position, strong balance sheet (net cash position of $4.46 billion representing nearly one third of total assets) and robust subscription-based business model, I find the multiples at least justifiable.I head into earnings holding shares of ADBE. But my convictions on the company and the stock speak less about my short-term predictions on fiscal 3Q18 results, and more about the long-term growth opportunities that I believe to be plentiful."
4201995,58641,2018-08-24T18:36:07-04:00,"Adobe can increase the number of its current Creative Cloud subscribers after its release of a full version of Photoshop for the iPad.Going forward, Adobe is likely going to make future versions of its best-selling products become more hardware-agnostic.Adobe's growth prospects are better when it also can rent out its Creative Cloud software products to iOS/Android tablet/smartphone users.The ever-more powerful ARM processors from Apple are only going to make the iPad a better laptop replacement for designers and content creators.Adobe has an excellent history of selling software made for a non-Intel x86 CPU architecture.","The recurring revenue stream from Adobe’s (ADBE) Creative Cloud software-as-a-service has a future tailwind. Adobe is planning to release a full version of its $9.99/month Photoshop product for the iPad next year. It can boost Adobe’s $1.3 billion/quarter Creative Cloud subscription business. Apple (AAPL) sold 11.55 million iPads last Q1. The tens of millions of high-end iPad/iPad Pro users is a massive pool of potential new subscribers. (Source: Adobe/Apple) Creative Cloud is Adobe’s biggest segment (more than 50% of revenue). Any business move that can boost its revenue growth potential is a good reason to stay long ADBE. It’s been more than five years since Adobe completely switched to the software-as-a-service model. New subscriptions growth from PC/Mac users is likely slowing down. Adobe has stopped disclosing its actual number of Creative Cloud subscriber numbers. However, Trefis estimated that Adobe likely ended 2017 with 12 million Creative Cloud subscribers. Prior to the shift, Adobe had an installed base of 12.8 million users. Adobe shifted to subscription-only software distribution in May 2013. Its stock price went from less than $60 in September 2013 to $257 this month. This growth in valuation and revenue was largely due to the rapid growth in Creative Cloud's number of paid subscribers. Based on Trefis' estimate of a 12 million subscriber count, Adobe was able to recruit an average of 667K paying Creative Cloud software subscribers per quarter from June 2013 to December 2017. The growth from 476K subscribers in Q1 2013 to 12 million in Q4 2017 is largely responsible for ADBE's massive five-year growth in price. The transformation to a software-as-a-service company helped Adobe grow its revenue from $4.06 billion (2013) to $7.27 billion (2017). The elimination of the need to pay $600 outright for Photoshop also diminished piracy and made it more affordable to more people. Renting Photoshop for $9.99/month obviously helped boost Adobe's 2013 net income of $0.29 billion to $1.69 billion from 2013 to 2017. (Source: Morningstar)Catering to non-PC/Mac users increases the total addressable market for Adobe’s software products. There's notable potential long-term economic benefit from 500K or 1 million iPad Pro/iPad users paying $9.99/month for a real iOS version of Photoshop. There are 25 million artists and designers who can improve their productivity using an iPad with Photoshop CC.With Apple (AAPL) coming up with newer and more powerful iPads, creative professionals and content creators will find these tablets more useful. Next-gen iPads with Apple’s latest processors can make them real laptop replacements. Further, my fearless forecast is that Photoshop won’t be the only legacy x86 Adobe software product that’s going to be expanded to the iOS platform. It's quite possible that two to three years from now, most of Adobe’s legacy x86 products could be truly cross platform/device agnostic. Instead of an iPad-using graphic artist paying only $9.99 for Photoshop, he/she could be paying $52.99/month for the entire Creative Cloud suite of software. Just imagine the impact of 500K new subscribers paying $53/month to Adobe's coffers. It could add more than $300 million to the annual recurring revenue of Creative Cloud. The upcoming A12 Bionic ARM-based processor from Apple should be better than Qualcomm’s (QCOM) new Windows laptop-grade Snapdragon 850. Based on GeekBench tests, the current generation Apple 6-core A11 Bionic ARM-based processor is now already as good as a quad-core x86 Kaby Lake Intel (INTC) Core i5-7300HQ laptop processor. Design apps like Photoshop are multi-core compatible. Apple making better multi-core processors is a compelling reason for Adobe to grow out of its current x86-only approach for paid Creative Cloud programs.(Source: Geekbench) I had lingering doubts that legacy Windows/Mac OS software programs created based on Intel’s (INTC) x86 architecture can be ported perfectly to ARM-based computers. Further, reassembling the current version of Photoshop CC 2018 to work on iOS devices is likely costly and time consuming. Photoshop has a code base extending back to the late 1980s. I do not expect Adobe to be able to create a 1:1 port of an x86 macOS Photoshop to ARM-based iOS Photoshop.The poor x86 emulation performance of the Photoshop image editing program on a Snapdragon 835-equipped Windows 10 laptop was a reminder that Adobe needs to make a native iOS-compliant version of Photoshop. I also do not think Apple has any intention of releasing or allowing x86 emulation on iOS. I have no proof but Adobe is likely building a new Photoshop from scratch. The iOS version only needs the most used core features of a x86 Photoshop CC 2018. Adobe should replicate what Serif did. Serif made desktop-level (not watered-down) iPad versions of its Windows/Mac Affinity Photo and Designer software products. Adobe is capable of making productivity/design software programs that do not run on a x86 or CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing) processor. Before Apple switched to Intel processors in 2006, Adobe made and sold boxed versions of Photoshop, Premiere, Illustrator, and PageMaker for PowerPC Mac. Like ARM processors, PowerPC processors also are RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing). My bet is that the upcoming iOS-native version of Photoshop will lose the many unnecessary bloat features (like video editing and animation) that Intel’s x86 CISC allowed it to have. A Photoshop for iPad that's a pure photo-editing/composition program like the old PowerPC Photoshop CS2 is already good enough for creative professionals like me. Expanding its total addressable market to include iPad users only adds to Adobe’s attractiveness as a long-term investment. Adobe's valuation is influenced by how good it can grow Creative Cloud's recurring revenue. This growth rate depends on how many new subscribers sign up for Adobe's software products.I remain long ADBE. I like it very much that Adobe still continues to enjoy its invidious status as a near monopoly of design software (90% of creative professionals use Adobe Photoshop) on design/creative software products."

The materials are not a substitute for obtaining professional advice from a qualified person, firm or corporation. There is a bullish momentum pattern in Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE) stock 7 calendar days before earnings, and we can capture that phenomenon explicitly by looking at returns in the option market. The hardware portion of technology has been hit hard -- Applied Materials and Nvidia guided down, and those two, with Micron, make up the guts of technology. But another part of the industry is doing very well -- it's software and cloud. Adobe has earnings due out in less than a month -- Wall Street Horizon has an estimate (not a final date) for 9-13-2018. A week before then would put us in early September. We just looked at a couple of non bullish strategies in the S&P 500 (The Clever, Effective, Winning Pattern in the S&P 500 Using Options) and For Amazon (AMZN), A Market Shift Doesn't Stop Profitable Option Trading, today we look at a directional back-test which also reveals an anomaly in the broader market that has persisted during this bull run and the Great Recession. The logic behind the test is easy to understand -- in a bull market there can be a stock rise ahead of earnings on optimism, or upward momentum, that sets in the one-week before an earnings date. We will examine the outcome of getting long a weekly out of the money (40-delta) call option in Adobe Systems Incorporated 7-days before earnings (using calendar days) and selling the call before the earnings announcement. Here's the set-up in great clarity; again, note that the trade closes before earnings, so this trade does not make a bet on the earnings result.Since Adobe reports earnings after the market closes, this back-test does not take on earnings risk. This back-test closes before earnings. We can add another layer of risk management to the back-test by instituting and 40% stop loss and a 40% limit gain. Here is that setting: In English, at the close of each trading day we check to see if the long option is either up or down 40% relative to the open price. If it was, the trade was closed. We also back-tested the 14-day options, so there isn't total time decay in the options. Here are the results over the last three-years in Adobe Systems Incorporated: Tap Here to See the Back-testThe mechanics of the TradeMachine® are that it uses end of day prices for every back-test entry and exit (every trigger). The trade will lose sometimes, but over the most recent trading history, this momentum and optimism options trade has won ahead of earnings.While this strategy had an overall return of 605%, the trade details keep us in bounds with expectations: ➡ The average percent return per trade was 36.8% for each 7-day period. ➡ The average percent return per winning trade was 46.3% for each 7-day period. ➡ The average percent return per losing trade was -10.9% for each 7-day period.It's a fair question to ask if these returns are simply a reflection of a bull market rather than a successful strategy. It turns out that this phenomenon of pre-earnings optimism also worked very well during 2007-2008, when the S&P 500 collapsed into the ""Great Recession.""The average return for this strategy, by stock, using the Nasdaq 100 and Dow 30 as the study group, saw a 45.3% return over those 2-years. And, of course, these are just 8 trades per stock, each lasting 7 days. Yes. We are empirical.Now we can look at just the last six-months, as well:Tap Here to See the Back-test➡ The average percent return over the last six-months per trade was 53.8% over each 7-day period. And here's a six-month daily ADBE chart, with the pre-earning momentum highlighted.Note that the use of a 40% limit in the back-test, turned that first pre-earnings move into a winner with an early exit.You should read the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options.

4188410,102007,2018-07-19T13:47:26-04:00,F2018 Q2 was another solid quarter with revenue growth and strong margins. Magento adds another growth lever for Digital Experience.We continue to believe that Adobe constitutes a core holding for any technology investors looking for a sector leader and innovator.We expect another strong Q3 in September and await more details around post-acquisition plans for Magento.,"Adobe (ADBE)'s F2018 second quarter results was another solid quarter with consistent revenue growth and strong margins. We will discuss the highlights from the latest quarter and discuss the outlook for the upcoming third quarter results. We continue to view Adobe as a core holding for investors looking for exposures in the technology and growth equity space.Adobe continued its impressive revenue growth as Q2 revenue increased by 24% year over year to $2.2 billion. The second quarter revenue came in $40 million ahead of consensus and operating margin improved to 40%, a 300bps improvement from last year. Despite the decline in operating profit from Q1, we think the current level is highly applaudable and think it would be a success if Adobe could maintain 40% margin going forward.Digital Media again grew 28% to $1.55 billion (Creative at $1.3 billion and Document Cloud at $243 million). Digital Media is Adobe's largest segment and houses its flagship products including Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, InDesign etc. The impressive growth at this segment has supported the underlying strength of this stock in the last few years. It is just so much easier to do everything else right when your largest segment is consistently growing at just shy of 30% every year.Digital Experience grew 18% to $586 million, sustaining the momentum from the last few quarters. This segment houses Adobe's tools for marketers that aim to help companies better market to consumers. The segment has seen its growth slowed down since 2017 Q3 but it also accounts for a smaller part of the revenue. The segment is seeing higher competition as a large number of competitors fight for the same wallet from companies' marketing department.We think Adobe's competitive advantage lies in its experience in running a seamless cloud-based service that can be integrated with its Digital Media assets. Adobe has deep relationships with the marketing and creative departments at most companies and it has been able to leverage that relationship to establish itself as a relevant player in digital marketing.Another closely watched metric is Annual recurring revenue (""ARR"") in Digital Media, which includes Creative and Document Cloud.During Q2 2018, Creative ARR grew an impressive 33% to reach $5.37 billion, continuing its strong momentum from the previous quarters. Adobe has done a commendable job in onboarding its users from legacy applications to its Creative Cloud platform, which results in high recurring revenue.Document Cloud ARR also saw another quarter of accelerated growth that came in at 33% and ARR reached $694 million. Despite its smaller size compared to Creative, the impressive growth out of this segment is crucial to the continued success of Digital Media.Adobe provided guidance in which it expects revenue of $2.24 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.68 for the third quarter. Adobe expects Digital Media to grow 25% over last year and Digital Experiences to grow 15% over last year. The company also expects to add $310 million of net new Digital Media ARR.We think there are a few tailwinds for Adobe including the pricing increases implemented by Adobe in the second quarter and the rumor that its popular Photoshop app is coming to iPad. The above guidance also does not include the acquisition of Magento, which is expected to contribute $40 million of revenue in the second half of 2018. We will discuss Magento below.Magento was previously sold to private equity firm Permira by eBay(NASDAQ:EBAY) before being acquired by Adobe. Adobe's foray into e-commerce will likely bring together its existing digital marketing offerings and the mid-market transactional platform from Magento. We think there are obvious challenges in the face of an integration that will span across two separate systems and two sets of customers. How Adobe will integrate the Magento platform in a seamless way is critical to the success of this acquisition.As we have seen in the share price of Shopify (SHOP), the market for serving SMID merchants has exploded and is continuing to grow. Adobe wants to accelerate its slower-growing Digital Experience segment by getting into the higher-growth e-commerce segment. We think its flawless track record of execution certainly could help Magento upgrade its products and perhaps enter the enterprise market in some ways. We believe it is still early days for the acquisition and we would expect more details about the strategy for Magento and integration on the Q3 conference call as the deal closed on June 19.Adobe is the dominant player in the creative software space with its unparalleled suite of products that are deeply ingrained in designers around the world. Adobe also continues to compete with its rivals including Salesforce (CRM) and Oracle (ORCL) in the digital marketing space (now e-commerce too with the Magento acquisition). Adobe has proven its ability to grow its Digital Media segment consistently and it has sought to expand its Digital Experience segment by tapping into the e-commerce space through the acquisition of Magento. We think the e-commerce market is a high-growth area that will provide another exciting market for Adobe in the years ahead. We continue to believe that Adobe constitutes a core holding for technology investors due to its dominant market position and proven track record of accretive growth and execution. We expect another strong Q3 in September and await more details around post-acquisition plans for Magento.Author's NoteWe hope you found our article helpful.

4182687,21798,2018-06-19T18:38:18-04:00,Adobe has a stronghold on the graphics software market.Adobe is likely to grow at a above-average pace as a result of being the go-to company for its solutions.The reasonable valuation and above-average growth will drive the stock to achieve above-average gains.,"Adobe (ADBE) became a household name not long after the company's co-founder, John Warnock, transformed paper into digital files known as PDF files. Adobe's well-known applications, Photoshop and Acrobat, added to the company's popular status. The company advanced along with new technology over the years and now offers cloud-based subscription services with advanced creative applications.Adobe's effective products have become the industry standard, making the company a go-to source for creative solutions. This gives the company a sort of monopoly status for creative software solutions. My investment thesis is that the company's strong position for creative solutions and subscription model will help drive long-term above-average growth. The stock's reasonable valuation for a high growth company will allow the stock to achieve above-average gains.I have a few main points to highlight from Adobe's recent performance. Adobe demonstrated strong growth in their Q2 earnings report. Record revenue of $243 million was achieved for Document Cloud, representing a 24% year-over-year gain. Document Cloud subscriptions along with Acrobat perpetual licensing drove 22% overall revenue growth for Adobe in Q2. Adobe Sign, the digital signature solution, is seeing strong momentum within the Document Cloud business. Half of Fortune 100 companies are now using Adobe Sign.Creative revenue was even higher with a 29% gain for Q2. This is being driven by Experience Design [XD], which is a cloud-based solution for designing and prototyping websites/apps and for collaborating with colleagues across multiple platforms. XD is Adobe's fastest growing segment.I think XD has the potential for strong future growth. Those who use UX tools find that XD is a complete solution that has features that other programs lack. For example, XD brings everything together as a complete design solution, which includes prototyping. PowerPoint is a good program, but it lacks the prototyping and design capabilities that XD offers. XD is considered fast and easy to use. Overall, the program gets high reviews. The positive user experience is likely to lead to strong future sales growth as potential customers do research to find the best match for their projects.I think that education is another strong potential source of growth for Adobe. Adobe's Spark Premium is available to students on a global basis. Spark enables communicators to turn ideas into visual stories. Visual stories as part of the Spark program will help students learn and retain information in an enhanced way as opposed to just reading a textbook. Academic studies have shown that digital storytelling can be a valuable tool to help improve students' proficiency, critical thinking, and learning motivation.Spark could easily catch on as a popular way for educators and students to create and experience content for the purpose of effectively learning new information. This represents a large growth opportunity for Adobe since there are so many schools in the United States and abroad.Adobe also has future potential growth with their augmented reality [AR] authoring tool known as Project Aero. This was featured at Apple's (AAPL) WWDC earlier this month. Project Aero allows designers and developers to create immersive content that links the physical world with the digital world. Some examples of this include seeing new furniture or other interior designs in your home before you make a purchase or watching a movie with the actors appearing in your living room.I like the subscription model that Adobe has in place. The company offers monthly subscription plans at various price points. For example, those interested in photography could sign up for the $9.99 monthly plan for access to the Lightroom and Photoshop apps. Those who need access to all of Adobe's apps could get the $52.99 plan for all of the company's creative apps.The subscription model makes recurring revenue automatic. This is a better business model than relying on one-time purchases. The subscription model is more likely to bring in more revenue for Adobe. Users can purchase only the apps that they will use, making the business model friendly for customers as well.Overall, I think Adobe has an extensive portfolio of leading creative programs. The extensive portfolio will help the company grow by attracting new customers on a regular basis. The subscription model will help lock-in many of those customers for recurring revenue.Adobe is a company growing revenue at strong above-average double-digit rates. I typically like to use the PEG ratio for high growth companies like that. Some investors may see Adobe's stock as overvalued if they just look at the trailing and forward PE ratios, which are 59 and 35 respectively.The 5-year PEG ratio takes the PE a step further and factors in the next five years of earnings growth. With that in mind, Adobe is currently trading with a PEG of 1.47. This factors in average annual earnings growth of about 26% over the next five years. The high growth stocks that I've researched typically perform well when they trade with PEG ratios below 2.It is reasonable for Adobe's stock to grow approximately in-line with earnings growth with a PEG ratio between one and two. Therefore, if the company achieves their expected earnings growth of about 26% per year, you have a stock that can outperform the market with over 25% annual gains.Although Adobe is performing well for creative software solutions, new or existing apps with lower price points could take market share away. Increased competition could cause Adobe's rate of growth to slow down, which would have a negative effect on the stock.Another risk is that Adobe has its share of disappointed customers when the company announced their shift to the subscription model. Some customers and potential customers might be more comfortable with one-time purchases for creative apps. Therefore, Adobe could lose business to companies that offer creative apps with one-time purchases.I think Adobe has a strong portfolio of creative apps, which is likely to draw new customers and retain existing ones. The company has done a great job of staying relevant by innovating with new apps such as XD and Aero. This will help the company to continue growing at an above-average pace. So, I think the company will meet/exceed the high earnings growth estimates, given their strong track record.With the valuation at a fair level for a high growth company on a 5-year PEG basis, I expect the stock to increase approximately in-line with earnings growth over the long term. With average expected annual earnings growth of 26% for the next five years, Adobe has a good chance of outperforming the S&P 500 over multiple years.Let me know your thoughts on Adobe in the comment section below.

4181889,103480,2018-06-15T08:21:54-04:00,"Despite beating Wall Street's expectations yet again in Q2, Adobe stock fell 3% after-hours in response.The company continued its robust 24% y/y growth rate on the top line, while favorable tax tailwinds helped to double the bottom line.The company further updated its tax estimate for FY19 to 14%, below its initial expectation of 18% and below its FY17 tax rate of 21%.Despite these tailwinds, Adobe's shares are looking extremely expensive at 13.8x forward revenues.Historically, however, dips in Adobe's stock have been short-lived. If shares continue to see weakness, it could be a rare buying opportunity.","Over the course of the past year, shares of Adobe (ADBE) have been among the most reliable performers among large-cap software. Virtually immune to the ups and downs of other high-flying stocks in the technology sector, Adobe has enjoyed a steady rally upward as investors embraced its near-complete transition to a cloud-based subscription business model and its widening margins and bottom line.After posting Q2 results, however, Adobe stock suffered a rare tumble on the order of 3%, even as the NASDAQ jolted to new all-time highs. At face value, nothing seems wrong with Adobe's Q2 results - as usual, the company beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom line with a sizable beat margin to each. The company also provided upside guidance for the coming quarter with approximately a 1% buffer above Wall Street's expectations.So what gives? The only thing weighing Adobe down is its huge valuation. Even after accounting for this quarter's earnings slip, Adobe has risen more than 45% in the year to date alone. Investors have seemingly all piled onto the trade without any regard for valuation:ADBE data by YChartsAt its current post-Q2 share price of $251, Adobe trades at a forward revenue multiple of 13.8x, as shown in the chart above. There's no doubt that this is among the upper echelon of large-cap software stock valuations. Make no mistake: Adobe is a growth juggernaut and has one of the best narratives within the software sector, especially upon its successful transition to a nearly pure SaaS model (thus increasing the value of its revenues, as they are recurring and carry a higher gross margin), and it certainly deserves a healthy premium to industry averages. But when the company's growth is only middling in the low 20% range, and when the majority of the SaaS sector trades at 6-8x forward revenues (though with the broad tech sector up to all-time highs, valuations in the industry have all inched upward in tandem), a double-digit multiple seems excessive.For some context, here's where Adobe's valuation stands relative to other large-cap SaaS stocks with ~$2 billion or more in revenues (At a ~$9 billion revenue run rate, Adobe is the second-largest pure-play SaaS company behind Salesforce.com (CRM))ADBE EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsWith all this being said, there's one important thing to note about Adobe: historically, its pullbacks have never lasted long. Adobe got crushed in the February time frame along with most other stocks, but it was one of the fastest companies to snap back and rally to new all-time highs. When a company like this has remained an investor favorite for so long, it's difficult for the company to stage any sort of a pullback without tempting opportunist investors to buy in. The bottom line on Adobe stock: if shares continue to see pressure in the next few weeks, it could be a rare buying opportunity in the stock, which is rarely far away from its all-time highs.The high revenue-based valuation aside, Adobe's greatest opportunity lies in its hugely expanding bottom line. Adobe trades at a 38.9x P/E ratio based on consensus FY18 EPS of $6.46, as reported by Yahoo Finance. This quarter, Adobe was able to grow its bottom line by about 2x - so if you incorporate the growth potential of the EPS, it actually looks quite reasonably valued on a PEG basis.The key lies in Adobe's tax rate, which is one of the biggest drivers of EPS growth thus far in the year. Along with its Q3 guidance, the company made the following statement about its tax rate:Should this trend hold, and given the fact that the company's EPS is highly sensitive to its tax rate, the estimated four-point drop in tax rate could have an outsized impact on EPS. Based on Adobe's most recent share count of 492.5 million per the most recent 10-Q, consensus EPS of $6.46 implies net income of $3.18 billion and pre-tax income of $3.88 billion, based on an 18% tax rate. Dropping this tax rate to 14% on the same pre-tax income of $3.88 billion yields net income of $3.34 billion, or 5% higher on tax tailwinds alone - not to mention all of Adobe's organic improvements in EPS, which we'll dive into next.Here's a look at Adobe's Q2 results:Source: Adobe investor relationsRevenues grew at 24% y/y to $2.19 billion, beating analyst expectations of $2.15 billion (+21% y/y) by a respectable three points. Adobe's growth continued at the same 24% y/y growth pace that it set last quarter, showing that the company's momentum still hasn't peaked yet. Subscription revenues saw even stronger growth at 30% y/y, now representing 88% of Adobe's Q2 revenue base and up 4 points from 84% in the year-ago quarter.It's important to note how massive Adobe's recurring business has become. Essentially, nearly all of Adobe's revenues are sourced from recurring subscriptions - a huge turnaround for a company that used to, like every other software company before it, make its living selling packaged software in retail outlets like Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP). Now, instead of making a large upfront sale every time it sells a license to Acrobat or Photoshop, it can continue to generate a recurring stream of revenues from its client base. As of the end of Q1, Adobe's Digital Media ARR (the segment that comprises its most popular design and graphics tools) reached $6.1 billion - or about three-quarters of its full-year revenue guidance that is already locked into a subscription plan.Of course, this has a terrific impact on margins. Gross margin inched up to 87.2% in the quarter, up 70bps from 86.5% in the year-ago quarter. Operating expenses also declined as a percentage of revenues to 55.4%, 360bps better than 58.0% in 2Q17 and driven primarily by increased efficiency on the sales and marketing side.As a result, GAAP operating income grew 39% y/y to $698.5 million and showed a GAAP operating margin of 31.8%, up 340bps from 28.4% in 2Q17 and without a doubt one of the strongest margin profiles in the software sector. And due to the tax rate wind-downs previously mentioned (tax rate was just 4% this quarter, though one-time effects are influencing this quarter's results), Adobe managed to grow its EPS by nearly 2x to $1.35. On a pro forma basis, Adobe's EPS of $1.66 showed a healthy beat to analyst consensus of $1.54.Investors' opinion of Adobe should rest heavily on where its valuation lies. At its current valuation of 13.8x forward revenues and 38.9x forward P/E, the company seems excessively overvalued, even against other high-priced stocks in the SaaS sector.However, we put also balance that viewpoint against the fact that Adobe has historically suffered only short-lived declines before rallying to new highs, as well as the fact that its huge earnings growth rate (powered by reductions in the tax rate) can lead to a very attractive potential P/E multiple for the stock. All in all, should shares of Adobe see further pressure to the $230-235 range (around where it traded after posting results last quarter), it would present a rare opportunity to buy shares that are perennially expensive and continually chasing new highs."

My move happens ahead of the company's fiscal 2Q18 earnings report to be released Thursday, June 14th. Although the timing might suggest a short-term bet driven by a specific catalyst, my investment decision is more driven by the quality of the company's subscription-heavy business model and strong fundamentals.Credit: EngadgetAdobe has made a habit of beating conservative consensus estimates quarter after quarter. It has been over three years since it disappointed investors by delivering a minimal $20 million revenue miss in fiscal 3Q14. This time, I expect the San Jose-based company to impress once again.I see some of the same trends of the recent past playing out in fiscal 2Q18. A heavier mix of subscription services (86% of total revenues last quarter vs. 82% the year before, likely 87% this time) means that topping management's usually conservative sales guidance will become increasingly more likely. I have no reason to believe that Adobe's popular digital media and cloud services will sputter, and I bet on a slight revenue beat over the guided $2.15 billion.On profitability, I expect Adobe to benefit further from scale to produce increasing gross margins, as the company managed to do in the past couple of quarters. Should I be right about it and even assuming a slight sequential increase in opex as a percentage of revenues for the sake of being conservative, I believe Adobe can easily beat its EPS guidance of $1.53 -- by two cents, per my estimates.See my projected fiscal 2Q18 P&L below.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsBut my interest in the stock transcends what financial results the company might be able to deliver next week. In my view, Adobe offers a rare combination of (1) market-leading digital services at (2) high margins that have become (3) predictable as nearly 90% of revenues are now subscription-based. This may explain the stock's very smooth climb over the past five years (impressive 41% annualized return with relatively small 22% annualized standard deviation) that has put to shame the performance of the broad equities market.ADBE PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsAdd to the mix a strong balance sheet: Adobe currently holds a $4.3 billion net cash position that keeps being fed by a healthy stream of free cash flow (nearly $1 billion last quarter alone). These resources have allowed Adobe to make strategic acquisitions that expand the company's operations horizontally, present new cross-sell opportunities and will boost top-line growth inorganically. Magenta is the most recent example in the e-commerce space, one that I have welcomed for a price tag of $1.7 billion that I find reasonable and ""digestible"".Sure, a stock that trades at a 39.2x forward P/E multiple may seem richly priced. But as I have stated in the past, ""if there is one company whose stock deserves the rich valuation, Adobe is a top contender, given its cash-rich balance sheet and growth profile"".Because late is better than never, I am buying ADBE today despite the impressive share price run of the past several years, believing that there is more upside to be captured with this high-quality stock."
4181248,24823,2018-06-13T03:14:23-04:00,Adobe needs a positive surprise.It needs analysts to upgrade targets.Will it sell off after good earnings?,"Adobe (ADBE) is ready to report earnings Thursday after the close and good earnings are expected. However, does it pop after good earnings or do we see some profit taking. Let’s look at the positive chart and positive fundamentals which expect positive earnings. Our Implied Return calculation has lost its Buy signal and we want to find out why.Here is the positive, weekly chart that shows the positive uptrends that every investor loves to see in a stock they own.Positive Technical SignalsAs you can see all the signals are positive. There are nice uptrends and ADBE is outperforming the market. However, as you can see, money flow at the top of the chart is dropping, but still in the green. Also the candlesticks on the price chart, for the last week and this week, look bearish. Price could easily drop down to test the 10 week moving average. Let’s see what the analysts are saying based on their fundamental analysis.Analysts Fail To Raise TargetsFinviz shows that the consensus analysts’ 12-month target is $240, color coded red, because it is lower than the current price of $253. Obviously we need earnings that are surprisingly good, so that analysts will raise their targets. Otherwise price is too high and we can expect a drop after the expected good earnings. However a recent analyst just posted a target of $250, above consensus.Let’s double check the Nasdaq data for ADBE. Their analysts’ consensus target for ADBE is $245 with the highest analyst target at $280. Also 15 of 22 analysts have buys for ADBE. Perhaps 7 analysts think it is overvalued or need a positive surprise to go to buy. Let’s look at the fundamentals that the analysts are using to come up with their targets.Overvalued FundamentallyFinviz shows the fundamental metrics, and they look good, but overvalued and coded red. Short term earnings growth is spectacular at 46% this year but only 13% next year. The five year annual growth rate is a very attractive 26%. Yahoo analyst consensus is looking for earnings of $1.54 on Thursday and revenues of $2.16 billion. The whisper number for earnings is a few cents higher, so if $1.54 is reported it may be a disappointment. This year’s consensus earnings is $6.46 and next year, per finviz, is $7.31 with a forecasted P/E of 34.57. In view of the lower growth next year, ADBE is overvalued and that will eventually stop price from moving higher. Is this the quarter that recognizes the valuation problem? Is this why the highest analyst target is only $280. Even that $280 target cannot justify the current high price and implies a lower price.Conclusionit looks like price is ahead of the fundamentals. Even if the earnings are good as expected, and you use the highest analyst price target of $280, that only gives you an implied return of about 10%. The target needs to be closer to $310 and that requires a very big, positive surprise in earnings. I think there will be good earnings, but profit taking after earnings. Perhaps we see a pop and then a drop. We deleted ADBE from our paper model portfolio because of the low implied return. The return needs to be higher than 20% to return to our portfolio.Disclaimer: We are not investment advisers and we never recommend stocks or securities.

4206067,104778,2018-09-13T11:38:36-04:00,"Adobe’s amazing transformation from legacy software to a SaaS company is paying dividends.Adobe shines at earnings announcements, and are poised to beat estimates.Adobe is a great GARP stock with lower P/E ratios and comfortable profit margins compared to Salesforce.","Editor's note: Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome James Malcolm as a new contributor. It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to the SA PRO archive. Click here to find out more »Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has been a silent achiever in recent years, managing to successfully shift their business model from a legacy software company to a successful Software as a Service (SaaS) company.All this success has led Adobe to be a real star performer within the Computer Software industry, achieving an impressive stock growth of 72% in the past year (industry average returns sit at 36%).With an earnings announcement for Q3 FY19 taking place today after the close (9/13), Adobe looks poised to close out another successful quarter and provide a positive outlook going forward.Adobe’s product offering is very diverse and well-established. Their main business areas are: Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing.Within their Digital Media branch, sits their Adobe Creative Cloud offering which includes Photoshop CC, Lightroom CC, and many more. These products are strong market leaders, with no credible competition aside from lower-end companies. This is reflected with strong growth in Annualized Recurring Revenue growth to $6.06 bn in Q2 FY19.Under their Digital Experience branch sits Digital Marketing. Adobe boasts an impressive array of products that differ from Google's (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Analytics platform, in the way that it is an end-to-end experience from creation of content to analysis. This was strengthened with the purchase of Magento in May. Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) grew to $6.06 billion exiting the quarter, a quarter-over-quarter increase of $343 million.More broadly, Magento was a purchase that gained them entry into a highly competitive eCommerce industry at the more premium end of the scale. Given the premium nature, Magento targets mid-large companies, i.e. they have existing contracts with Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). They do however have a direct sales channel to small businesses looking for a more premium offering. This B2C channel is something that Adobe's current strategy hasn't allowed for while they focus on B2B sales.From a user perspective, Adobe now creates a truly seamless experience other competitors such as Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) can't recreate. They effectively have 'the Apple (AAPL) effect' where you need no other provider to achieve your creative and business goals. Given this, I would really expect ARPU to steadily increase in the Digital Experience space.With a Q3 FY19 earnings announcement upcoming on Thursday, and an already fantastic year - what do we expect? More growth.Consensus analyst estimates are hinting Adobe’s revenue per share of $1.69, up from $1.10 a year ago. Given Adobe’s consistent history of beating analyst estimates by as much as 8% - expect this to be higher.Despite beating analyst estimates, Adobe's share price has previously dipped in past quarters. Options traders are betting on a +4.5% move for this earnings round. If the market does negatively react to earnings in the short term, Adobe appears to have a support level of $255, which will be a trigger point for a reversion in my bullish view.Aside from earnings, I'm laying my interest in comments around continued increases in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) and subscription revenue. Previous quarterly results show signs that this will be positive. Link to latest Quarterly report.Because of Adobe’s large product offering, it’s complex to place it exactly in one industry. However, we believe that their closest peer is Salesforce (CRM). Their offerings do differ, in the Creative Cloud space and Publishing arena - where Adobe Acrobat is a defacto solution.Salesforce has had a similar history to Adobe, in the sense that they've had to diversify their offerings to help maintain and find new growth areas. This is evident in Salesforce's transition from a per sales CRM to offering Marketing cloud and Service cloud in the past few years.Both companies are increasing spending in research and development in machine learning and AI - Adobe with Adobe Sensei, Salesforce with Einstein, at similar rates. Adobe manages to achieve a very good Return of Assets ratio of 11%. This, along with more restrained cost-control leads Adobe to have a strong 26% profit margin compared to Salesforce’s 6% profit margin.The good Return on Assets ratio that Adobe achieves surprises me, as I do perceive Salesforce as a more mature company in terms of transformation - with Adobe yet to reap all benefits of diversification. That being said, the purchase of Magento has not yet been fully represented in Adobe's financials.Annual returns between Salesforce and Adobe are highly correlated, due to being in similar industries, but Adobe is achieving higher returns over the past year.Salesforce had an impeccable last quarter achieving 550% Quarterly Earnings Growth (yoy) compared to Adobe’s respectable growth of 77%.At current prices, it appears as though Adobe may be a sitting at a better price for a growth stock compared to Salesforce. This becomes clear when Adobe has a P/E ratio (forward) of 29 compared to Salesforce’s P/E ratio (forward) of 60.Salesforce does have a lower Price to Sales ratio (P/S) of 9.97 compared to Adobe's 16.14. I believe this is indicative that Salesforce is more mature in their respective markets, and that this will steadily improve for Adobe as they increase ARPU through their more complete product offerings and potential price increases.Key Statistics provided by Yahoo Finance as of 9/12/2018:The main risk factors that I recognize is the slowdown of Magento expectations. As mentioned, in May, Adobe acquired Magento. At this time, they said that they expected a $x dollars over the next two quarters.If Adobe struggles to convert existing users over to Magento or their Digital Experience space - I would revise my decision down as this is an area that Salesforce and SAP (NYSE:SAP) do so well.Conversion won't happen overnight, or over a quarter so I'm not expecting too much at tomorrow's earnings announcement regarding that, but it's something that could hint at slowing growth in 6 months' time.Adobe is a company that has put in the hard-yards of transforming themselves into a SaaS company that consistently beat analyst estimates. Expansion into the e-commerce market is something that was needed to maintain growth and close their product offering.I believe that they've created a solid platform for consumers and enterprises alike that will drive ARPU up for Adobe.Adobe, when compared to Salesforce is tracking along a similar growth curve, but is slightly behind and has growth to come.For these reasons, I think Adobe represents a fantastic GARP stock and I'm giving it a moderate price estimate of $285, with strong potential to grow $300+."
4181629,101584,2018-06-14T09:56:21-04:00,The company has seen unicorn level growth in the past year.They have incredibly inflated trading multiples in comparison to their peers.This earnings release with such high valuations could see them fail to meet earnings in which case the stock will plummet or beat earnings which could make it pop.This allows for an interesting options play that could prove profitable in either scenario.,"Software has been one of the hottest sectors in the market in the last 12 months. With the Dynamic Software index rising nearly 43% in the past year, most companies in the sector are hitting peak valuations. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is no exception. The company has soared nearly 83% in the past 12 months. With second quarter earnings being released this upcoming Thursday, we will dive in a little to see what to expect. Will the company continue its current trajectory and beat expectations, or will it fail to live up to the hype?The first item in their 10Q from the first quarter that I would like to look at is their revenue and how it is broken down. From the first quarter last year to the first quarter this year, the company had its revenues grow 24%. This is no small feat and it is coming as the company is really going all in on their subscription-based business model. In fact, the company saw revenues coming from products and services and support actually shrinking while the subscription revenue grew almost 30%.The subscription model has become incredibly popular in the last few years. It now covers many needs from music, entertainment, shaving, and the works. Some incredibly successful companies, such as Netflix, rely completely on subscription services to succeed. This model makes sense as it allows for reduction of costs due to scaling, protects their patented material better, and creates a strong and loyal customer base.We can see this in action for Adobe as the nearly 30% increase in subscription revenue only increased costs by 16.6%. The ability to scale at reduced cost, especially for a company based on fixed costs with low variable costs, is a great way to grow their revenues. This also should allow the company to keep their revenue more consistent as the subscription model makes customers pay the same amount per period, thus reducing cyclicality.This increase in revenue at minimal cost increase has allowed the company to grow its operating margins from 28% in the first quarter of last year to 34% in the first quarter of this year. It has also helped their margins grow from 24% to 28% in their net income. Between the revenue growth and the margins growth, the company saw net income increase a staggering 46%. This can help shed light on why the software industry is doing so well.The company has seen extreme growth and it is expected to continue; maybe not quite as fast, but it should remain significant. Therefore, a good way to value the company is to compare it to its peers. Considering the growth, I felt that comparing the companies on last years annual sales would be ignoring relevant data, thus I will compare them based on first quarter performance. I will compare P/ Q1 EBITDA for each company. The numbers might seem high but keep in mind it is only divided by the EBITDA of one quarter instead of a whole year.When comparing these numbers, I found that ADBE trades at nearly 179x Q1 EBITDA as per their 10Q. Microsoft, however, is trading at only 101x Q1 EBITDA, and Oracle is trading even below that at 58x EBITDA. The only explanation is that the market sees much larger growth potential for Adobe than its peers. This could be due to its acquisition of Magento, which allows it to break into the e-commerce space, in which it has had no place in the past. This could open new doors to revenue growth and profit growth in the future.This extremely high trading multiple puts ADBE in a fairly precarious situation come earnings time. If the company fails to meet expectations of $1.25 per share, it would not be out of the question to see their EBITDA multiple come back to earth. This could present a large risk for the company. That being said, if the company does meet expectations, those who have been waiting for confirmation may finally buy in. Thus, I believe that the stock will move largely in either direction come earnings time.To invest in this, I would suggest buying both put options with strike price around 5%-7% below the stock price and Call options approximately the same distance above the stock price. This should allow profitability for either a crash or a pop. At such high trading multiples, the volatility come earnings time tends to be much higher and this could prove profitable."

The market likes the moves though the headline grabbing buyback isn't that impressive or financially wise. The purchase of the commerce platform Magento is needed to drive the growth required to justify the stock valuation. Source: Magento website Adobe Systems announced plans to repurchase up to $8 billion worth of stock through 2021. The total is massive, but the amount isn't necessarily all that material spread out over more than 3 years for a stock worth $117 billion. Buybacks are only valuable to shareholders when the amount meaningfully reduces the share count and naturally that can't occur if the stock is expensive. The biggest issue with Adobe Systems is that the stock isn't cheap. After incorporating tax benefits and strong quarterly results for FQ1 that ended March 2, analysts forecast Adobe Systems earning $7.32 per share next fiscal year. The stock trades at roughly 33x FY19 estimates so repurchasing shares at this level isn't going to move the needle. ADBE PE Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsThe company generates a ton of cash. Adobe Systems generated about $990 million in operating cash flows in FQ1 after about $2.9 billion last fiscal year. The balance sheet is solid with a net cash of about $4.3 billion so the digital content company has plenty of cash to spend. Another reason that $8 billion sounds impressive, but probably isn't that meaningful is that the diluted share count has only dipped around 10 million shares over the last 3 years. The company has averaged quarterly share buybacks in the $250 million range for awhile now, but large share issuance has absorbed a lot of the benefits. ADBE Stock Buybacks (Quarterly) data by YChartsAdobe is replacing a $2.5 billion share buyback so the tech company will likely expand the quarterly buybacks, but the stock has surged in the last few years. The $120 billion market cap will take far more than a $2 billion annual buyback to make any meaningful dent in the share count and the valuation doesn't suggest the company implement an aggressive plan. The deal to buy Magento is probably a more significant move for the digital content company. At a deal price of $1.68 billion, the amount only equates to slightly above 1% of the market value so short term the deal isn't material. The commerce provider competes with the likes of Shopify (SHOP) to provide companies with a platform and the ability to transact business online. The combination with Adobe Systems merges the ability of customers to create digital content, build an online presence and monetize the business. Magento listed the following benefits of the deal:At the valuation multiple of Shopify, the deal would only suggest a revenue base in the $150 million range for Magento. Adobe Systems is approaching annual revenue in the $9 billion range so the deal only adds marginal revenues. Still, a company quickly scaling to annual revenues of $500 million in an estimated digital commerce market with a revenue opportunity estimated by the company at $13 billion could boost the growth rates by a couple of percentage points and help maintain the momentum in the stock. The key investor takeaway is that Adobe Systems is better advised to build up cash balances and make more bolt-on acquisitions. The best way to maintain premium valuations is to maintain robust growth rates and the $8 billion share buyback just doesn't move the needle at the current market valuation. The stock is best owned on dips and market weakness after the big rally of the last few years and these deals don't alter that thesis."

Magento’s software is flexible and open-source allowing its clients to customize its features according to their needs.Management is headed by Mark Lavelle, who has been with the firm since 2015 and was previously the Head of Global Product and Strategy at eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) Enterprise.Below is a video of Magento’s order management capabilities:(Source: Magento)Magento’s primary offerings include:The company has raised $272.50 million from disclosed private investment rounds.According to a market research report by Mordor Intelligence, the Digital Commerce Software Market is expected to reach $8.6 billion by 2023.This represents a CAGR of 12.59% between 2018 and 2023.The main drivers for this expected growth are the increased adoption of cloud-based services and wireless communication networks.Major competitive vendors that provide digital commerce software include:Adobe disclosed the acquisition price of $1.68 billion, but didn’t disclose additional terms, file an 8-K or disclose a change in financial guidance, so the deal is a small one when compared to ADBE’s market capitalization of $117 billion.In its most recent 10-Q filing, Adobe reported $6.1 billion of cash and short-term investments and $3.86 billion in liabilities, excluding deferred revenue, so the firm has ample resources to close the transaction without undue financial hardship.Adobe appears to be paying approximately an 11x revenue multiple, based on Magento’s $150 million 2017 revenue. That is similar in valuation to what Salesforce (CRM) paid on its $2.8 billion deal for Demandware.Adobe is acquiring Magento to have a full-featured ecommerce system integrated into its Adobe Experience Cloud offering.As Adobe stated in the deal announcement:In addition, the Magento deal brings in a large network of ecommerce developers, which will now have a larger solution set to write solutions for.With the Magento deal, Adobe appears to be setting its sights on expanding its offering beyond creating content tools to enabling the commerce process with those tools.ADBE stock hasn’t changed on the announcement, but during the past 12 months, the stock has risen over 70%, as the chart below indicates:(Source: SEEKING ALPHA)Given the S&P 500 Index rose 13% over the past 12 months, ADBE’s 70% rise has been impressive as the company has executed well on a turnaround in the past few years.Management now has the resources to acquire firms such as Magento and expand Adobe’s focus beyond content tools.The deal for Magento is an interesting window into management’s intentions, as it sets up Adobe to move into other adjacent, ecommerce-enabled businesses, potentially including marketplaces.Having an integrated ecommerce capability is table stakes for getting larger pieces of the B2B2C pies that exist in various end-markets.Assuming quick integration, I expect this deal to be a medium-term positive for ADBE and I also believe it won’t be management’s last significant acquisition over the next 24 months."

The company sees the FY19 tax rate at rebounding to 14%, but the rates are a reduction from the January guidance of 11% for this year.The CFO explained the change during the earnings call:For FQ2, Adobe Systems recorded income taxes of only $28 million, down from $118 million last year despite the 33% surge in operating income. One can quickly make the case that the ultra-impressive quarter was due to these currency and tax boosts. An 11% tax rate hits the net income of $878 million to the tune of an additional $53 million, or nearly $0.11 per share.For next year, Adobe Systems will immediately run into a massive tax headwind. The company will have to pay nearly 3x the income taxes, or the equivalent of a 9 percentage point boost.As Adobe Systems tops a market cap of $125 billion, it is entering the tech giant space. The company is going to need the balance sheet to compete effectively for acquisitions and talent.The desire to continue using valuable cash resources to repurchase what can be argued as expensive stock isn't recommended. In the quarter, the cloud document company spent $589 million on share buybacks after promising an $8 billion share buyback program.Over the past 12 months, Adobe Systems has spent roughly $1.2 billion on share buybacks that amount to less than 1% of the outstanding shares.ADBE Stock Buybacks (TTM) data by YChartsSo the stock buybacks sound impressive, but they amount to very little in financial impact to Adobe Systems. The FQ2 diluted share count was only down about 2 million shares from last year's levels.The company ended the year with a cash and short-term investment balance of around $6.3 billion. A nice amount, but not impressive levels in the tech space. Adobe Systems would be wiser to just hold the cash for a better deal either via a cheaper stock price or an acquisition target.The Magento Commerce deal will cost Adobe $1.6 billion in the current quarter, so even positive cash flow in FQ3 will still lead to a reduction in the cash balance. Not exactly a bad problem to have, but not an ideal allocation of capital. A few percentage point boost to earnings per share isn't worth the reduction in the cash balances.The key investor takeaway is that Adobe Systems will face some financial headwinds going forward. The stock trades at 35x FY19 EPS estimates, while the forecast is for EPS growth of only 13%. At the same time, the company is irrationally spending cash buying expensive shares. Look for the stock to plateau here soon around $255."

The company is well-positioned to grow its top and bottom lines with its cloud-based subscription model. The company also has a healthy balance sheet that should allow it to pursue accretive acquisitions and/or further share buybacks. However, its shares are currently fairly valued. Conservative investors may want to wait for a pullback in order to have a higher margin of safety.ADBE data by YChartsWide moat with high switching costAdobe has a monopoly in creative software. It is the number one software that creative professionals use. While numerous competitors exist, Adobe continues to hold on to its market share. The reason is simple: high switching cost. For many creative professionals that want to switch to other software and solutions, it means that they will have to re-learn a new interface. These are not software that are easy to learn, it takes extensive training not to mention that alternative software may not even offer the same features that Adobe offers. There may also be compatibility issues.Strong revenue and EPS growthAdobe has consistently delivered strong growth to its top and bottom lines in the past few years. Below are the two charts that will help investors better understand Adobe’s top line and bottom line growth in the recent quarters. The first chart shows Adobe’s revenue and operating margin. As can be seen from the chart below, its revenue continues to grow quarter over quarter and its operating margin also continues to improve. Similarly, we can also see the same trend with Adobe’s EPS and free cash flow trend in the second chart below.Source: Created by author; Company ReportsSource: Created by author; Company ReportsRecurring revenue is beneficialUnlike its previous perpetual-license model where Adobe’s revenue depends on the quantity of its software licenses sold, the company’s cloud-based subscription model is based on a monthly fee that its users pay. In return, Adobe will provide the latest software updates that include new features tools, cloud services, etc. This model is advantageous because the company’s revenue now largely depends on recurring revenue which is less prone to seasonality and software life cycles. Even in a traditionally low software sale season, Adobe still receives subscription revenue from its subscribing users. This makes its subscription-based revenue predictable. As the chart below shows, Adobe’s recurring revenue now represents about 88% of its total revenue in Q1 2018.Source: Created by author; Company ReportsInvestment grade balance sheetAdobe has an investment grade balance sheet. As we have seen from our previous subsection, Adobe has consistently delivered free cash flow growth. This has helped the company to reduce its long-term debt while accumulating its stockholders' equity. The chart below shows Adobe’s long-term debt to capitalization ratio and its long-term debt. As can be seen from the chart below, its long-term debt reduced from the high of $1.918 billion to $1.875 billion at the end of Q1 2018. Similarly, its long-term debt to capitalization ratio improved significantly from the high of 28.9% in Q1 2015 to 21.7% in Q1 2018.Source: Created by author; Company ReportsAdobe is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 34.4x. This is significantly higher than its 5-year P/E ratio of 29.9x. Its EV to EBITDA ratio of 37.8x is also 2.7x multiple higher than its 5-year average. Both metrics show that Adobe may be overvalued. However, if Adobe can consistently deliver higher top and bottom line growth rate, I believe its valuation can be justified. The consensus estimate of Adobe’s fiscal 2019 EPS is $7.32. Using 30.0x as its P/E ratio and the consensus estimate, we derive a target price of $219.6 per share. This is about $2 below its current share price of $221.90 per share. Hence, we believe Adobe is currently fairly valued.Source: Created by author; MorningstarAdobe still has lots of legacy users that have not yet switched to Creative Cloud. While this presents a huge growth opportunity for the company to grow its recurring revenue, its near-term growth can be restrained if it cannot convince its legacy users to switch. For many legacy users, they are still content with the features available in these legacy software they own. They have little motivation to upgrade to Creative Cloud and pay monthly subscription fees. In addition, the company will likely continue to face competitions from Oracle (ORCL), IBM (IBM), Salesforce.com (CRM), as well as open source software.With a robust business model, Adobe is well-positioned to grow its top line and bottom line. As a result, the company’s operating margin continues to expand. The company also has a healthy balance sheet that should allow it to pursue accretive acquisitions and/or further share buybacks. However, its shares are currently fairly valued. Adobe remains a good investment choice for long-term investors. Conservative investors may want to wait for a pullback in order to have higher margin of safety.Note: This is not financial advice and that all financial investments carry risks.

4163187,103856,2018-04-16T08:42:18-04:00,Adobe's stock price has risen by over 196% over the past three years.Increasing revenue and higher margins have led to rise in EPS of over 415%.Partnership with NVIDIA is great for the development of Adobe's AI systems.,"Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) has been rapidly increasing both its revenue and efficiency over the past few years, which has resulted in significant growth in their earnings. At the moment the company’s valuation is rather high when considering only current performance, but with no signs of slowing down, the stock’s current price will look like a steal in a couple of years.ADBE data by YChartsOver the past three years Adobe’s earnings per share have grown by over 415%, from under $0.8 per share to its current levels of $3.76 per share (TTM). In that span of time, the stock’s price has grown from under $80 a share to over $224 per share, which represents over a 196% increase. The growth in earnings has been spectacular and it should continue in the following years.The fact that the rise in EPS was almost double that of the rise in price resulted in their P/E ratio reducing by over 50%. The company’s P/E ratio, which used to be at over 120, is now at just below 60. While a P/E ratio of 60 is still high, even for a tech company, it's great to know it has dropped considerably. ADBE Profit Margin (TTM) data by YChartsAdobe’s huge EPS increase has come both because they have substantially increased their revenue, and because their profit margin has expanded. In the same span of time as the chart before, Adobe’s revenue has grown from around $4.35 billion, to almost $7.7 billion, a 77% increase. Adobe has managed to create one of the most fascinating product portfolios, and they have transformed the majority of their sales into cloud-based subscription revenues, both of which are great news for future revenue.Adobe’s Net Profit Margin is currently at 24.4%, which indicates that for every dollar of revenue, 24 cents end up as earnings for the company. At the moment their profit margin is almost three times higher than three years ago, which is a very encouraging sign, and a sign the company has been more efficient. The combination of increasing revenue and profit margins is a recipe for success.ADBE Return on Assets (TTM) data by YChartsAdobe has also been making a more efficient use of its resources, generating better returns across the board. The return on equity (23.1%) reveals how much profit a company generates with the money invested by shareholders. On the other hand, the return on invested capital (18.76%), gives us a sense of how well a company uses its money to generate returns. Finally, the return on assets (13.45%) tells us how efficient a company is at utilizing its assets to produce earnings. The three numbers show Adobe is making good use of its resources to generate money, however the trend is what I consider most important. The fact that they have steadily increased their returns on all three metrics is a good indication management has been making better use of its resources each year, and that their increased revenue is not just a result of increased assets, equity or investment. ADBE Quick Ratio (Quarterly) data by YChartsIn the past few years, Adobe’s Quick Ratio has been around 2. Their current quick ratio of 2.039 implies it can repay over two times its short-term liabilities using only its most liquid assets. A lower quick ratio could indicate the company might struggle to repay its short-term obligations, but too high of a quick ratio would mean they’re not fully maximizing their current assets. A quick ratio of around 2 is a great indicator that the company will have no trouble paying their short debt, but also that they are not just sitting around in mountains of cash with no purpose.Another good indicator for the company is the fact that their debt to equity ratio was reduced from over 0.28 to around 0.217. This hints that the company has been using its own resources rather than debt as the main source to finance its projects. While having debt is by no means bad, the fact that the company has immensely grown over the past few years without amounting huge levels of debt is a great sign of their performance.(Chart taken from Finbox) In the chart above are the projected diluted EPS for Adobe. For 2018, Finbox expects EPS of $6.34, and for 2022 of $10.11. This last projection would imply a CAGR of 24.5% for the next five years. For comparison, Finviz expects a similar growth of 26.1% yearly. For 2027 Finbox expects EPS to be around $12.91, which would imply a CAGR of 14.3% for the next 10 years. Adobe has grown at a very fast pace over the last few years, and expectations are they will continue their accelerated growth.In an article by Fahad Saleem titled, ""Adobe Sensei: The Most Powerful AI Platform You Can Use Right Now,"" we can see the importance of Sensei, the technology that powers intelligent features in Adobes products, to its future. The author explains that by using deep learning and contextual algorithms, Sensei can, for example: understand the tone and intent of documents, write summaries, edit the color/lighting/contrast in photos, suggest marketing strategies, etc. Having such a powerful tool is extremely helpful, and the recently announced partnership with NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA) should be a big boost for Sensei's development. The partnership’s goal is to extend the availability of Sensei APIs and to expand the ecosystem of developers, data scientists and partners. The companies plan to work on optimizing Sensei AR services for NVIDIA hardware, and to provide new features and improved performance. They also plan to market Sensei AI services to NVIDIA’s customers and support Adobe’s cloud infrastructure. The partnership should help maximize Sensei and all the products that employ it, as well increase revenues for both companies.Adobe continues to create more and more products, all of which continue to attract customers, keeping their revenue growth at high levels. The company is capitalizing on their cloud-based subscription model while increasing margins and revenue, which has led to higher returns. They have financed their amazing growth without heavily relying on debt and have made strategic moves like the development of Sensei and their partnership with NVIDIA with an eye towards the future. Although their valuation is high at the moment, their expected growth more than compensates for it."
4181838,92586,2018-06-15T03:16:44-04:00,"Adobe beat even my more aggressive earnings expectations, with fiscal 3Q18 projected to be yet another solid quarter.
        Mild after-hours bearishness is likely a consequence of profit taking.
        I continue to see an opportunity for long-term investors to partake in this growth story.","The earnings beat was a beauty -- even if, in many ways, aligned with my expectations.This Thursday after the closing bell, Adobe (ADBE) reported having produced $2.2 billion in revenues and $1.66 in adjusted EPS in fiscal 2Q18, beating consensus estimates by $40 million and 12 cents, respectively, and my own projections by a bit narrower margin. Guidance for the upcoming quarter also came in ahead of expectations, yet the stock took a -3% hit in after hours trading.What might be behind the initial bearish reaction to Adobe's solid earnings report?Credit: BlinkFirst, let's look a bit closer at the numbers.The 24% YOY top-line increase was a pleasant surprise that topped even my above-consensus estimate (see table below). The large digital media creative business once again led the charge, rising 29% YOY after having delivered robust growth of 30% last quarter. As I have argued previously, Adobe's move towards a recurring revenue model (an encouraging 87.6% of sales were subscription-based this quarter vs. 83.7% this time last year) has allowed the company to very reliably predict and plan for future financial performance, which I believe creates fewer risks for the stock.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsIf I proved to be aggressive at all in my projections was in regards to profitability. Gross margin of 87.2% fell just short of my predicted 87.5%, while opex as a percentage of revenues, at 47.2%, landed 10 bps above my expectations. In both cases, however, the results came in significantly better than last year's numbers, underscoring my belief that scale, in addition to cost containment at the SG&A level, will boost earnings growth beyond the Street's current long term 22% projection (see chart below).All accounted for, Adobe's $878 million in op profit delivered in the quarter nearly equaled my expected $873 million, with quite a bit of the net earnings upside to consensus likely materializing in the form of a significantly lower effective tax rate. Had the rate been aligned with the 11% guided three months ago, adjusted EPS of $1.55 would have matched my projections to the penny.I am satisfied to see that such strong performance will likely carry forward into fiscal 3Q18, judging by tonight's guidance (ex-inorganic impact from the Magento acquisition) that also beat top- and bottom-line consensus. Source: Adobe's investor data sheetWith another solid quarter in the pocket, the modest after-hours selloff can be probably best justified by profit-taking, in my view. As I have mentioned before, ADBE is a stock that has returned an impressive 41% per year and produced a relatively small 22% annualized standard deviation over the past five years, with a 90% run having happened in the past year alone.Comments have been made tonight about fears over a slowdown in Adobe's blockbuster growth pace and uncertainty around the new Magento acquisition. But I believe these reported concerns to be either mere rationalization for after-hours trading activity or reflective of certain analysts and investors being a bit too nitpicky tonight. At the end of the day and particularly in the long run, I believe ADBE's share price will follow the company's earnings higher.A recent shareholder at a $247/share entry point, I believe Adobe's beat (results over estimates), raise (outlook above expectations) and dip (share price in after-hours trading) is yet another opportunity for long-term investors to partake in this growth story."
4157303,103480,2018-03-17T06:59:24-04:00,"Adobe's Q1 earnings release has propelled shares another 3%.Year to date, Adobe's stock has already rocketed up more than 25%, virtually eclipsing all other tech stocks.The company showed a decent revenue beat and upside guidance, as well as huge earnings expansion, but the share price essentially already prices in good execution.Adobe faces saturation risk as it's already converted a majority of its business to cloud.At 12x forward revenues, Adobe is looking richly valued.","The strength of Adobe's (ADBE) first-quarter earnings probably came as a surprise to no one. Since announcing its cloud transition a few years ago and focusing the business on recurring revenue subscriptions, Adobe has been one of the most consistent performers in the market, a consistent practitioner of the ""beat-and-raise"" quarterly tactic that investors love to see. Its stock has followed suit, unsurprisingly. Following Q1 earnings and the subsequent 3% pop, Adobe is up more than 25% for the year to date period, and has nearly doubled in the last twelve months.ADBE data by YChartsI keep thinking the same thing about high profile growth stocks like Adobe and Netflix (NFLX) - how much longer can the stock keep rallying? These two have been the market's darlings for so long that it's almost unimaginable to see a scenario in which the trend turns bearish (although investors in cryptocurrencies could once have said the same thing. Surprisingly, the crypto markets have lost more than half of their total market capitalizations in February and March).As much as I believe in the strength of Adobe's core business and in its sheer earnings power, I do believe upside in Adobe is limited at this point. I've been an intermittent investor in Adobe shares and made substantial gains on my position, but with the stock at heady all-time highs, I'm no longer comfortable holding it.From a pure valuation perspective, Adobe looks like a risky play. With its market cap now at $111 billion, Adobe has nearly reached the valuation of German software giant SAP (SAP), which has more than double its revenues (albeit at a slower growth rate). While Adobe's frontend design software may not be a direct competitor to SAP's more backend-oriented technologies, the fact still stands that SAP has its hands in just about everything and, despite slowing growth in the past several years, has also seen decent success with SAP cloud initiatives and has plenty of room to expand into other software categories.Adobe's opportunities, on the other hand, are more limited in nature. It's true that for a company that's best known only for a few ""simpler"" applications like Photoshop, Adobe has an impressive and wide-ranging portfolio of applications. Creative Cloud itself is home to a wide span of apps including the flagship Photoshop, alongside other well-known brands like InDesign, Dreamweaver, and Acrobat Pro. Then there are the marketing products, including the $540 million acquisition of TubeMogul, that is providing Adobe with a tertiary source of growth. Adobe Document Cloud, a competitor to the unicorn DocuSign, is another major source of growth.But with Adobe's cloud transition effectively complete (90% of its revenues are now subscription-based), and with its product set largely already penetrated into existing markets, it's doubtful that Adobe can continue to post >20% growth forever. The company's FY18 revenue guidance of $8.725 billion (which it hasn't raised along with Q1 earnings, despite delivering a first-quarter beat and upside Q2 guidance) implies 19.5% growth - just shy of that psychologically important 20% mark.Note also that this 20% handle is the threshold at which Salesforce.com (CRM) has committed itself to. Salesforce, it must be noted, is substantially larger on a revenue scale basis than Adobe (its most recent quarterly revenues were $2.85 billion, versus Adobe's $2.08 billion). And while it's true that Salesforce's lack of profits (a function of the company's decision to continue pumping cash into sales and investing in growth) accounts for a portion of the valuation gap, the fact that Salesforce's market cap sits at just $92 billion versus Adobe's $111 billion is somewhat jarring.Adobe has undoubtedly become one of the most expensive stocks in software. Not without good reason, of course - Adobe is also one of the most profitable and highest cash-flowing companies in the sector. But with its 12x revenue multiple towering over even the likes of Workday (WDAY), another perennial investor favorite, it's doubtful that Adobe can march on much higher.ADBE EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsAdobe's first-quarter results were good, no doubt - but the beat margin, especially on the top line, was rather slim. And with Adobe having beaten every quarter going back to 2014, a beat was more or less expected.Revenues in the quarter grew 24% y/y to $2.08 billion, a modest beat over analyst expectations of $2.05 billion (+22% y/y). See the company's quarterly growth trajectory below:Figure 1. Adobe Q1 revenue resultsSource: Adobe investor relationsHere's an important metric to note: subscription revenues of $1.79 billion grew 30% y/y, and now represent 86% of the company's total revenue mix. That's up 4% from last year, when subscription revenues were 82% of the total mix.The growing proportion of subscription revenues as a percentage of Adobe's total revenue base has been one of the driving reasons behind the huge Adobe rally of the past year. There are a multitude of reasons for that: first and foremost, subscription revenues represent longer-term benefits to the company. Unlike in the past, when a consumer license sale of Acrobat Pro would be a once-and-done deal, a new subscription customer to Acrobat Pro might be paying only a fraction of that license cost in the current quarter or year, but will likely be paying much more over the total lifetime of the customer's relationship. Thus, a dollar of subscription revenue is worth much more than a dollar of license revenue - one represents a renewable stream, the other does not. For this reason, subscription revenues also are much higher margin.But with subscriptions now hitting essentially nine-tenths of the company's revenue base, the cloud transition story is going to run out of steam for Adobe. There are plenty of SaaS companies that also have nearly pure subscription revenue streams that trade at 6, 7, or 8 times revenues. Valuing Adobe's revenue stream at 12 times revenues when the cloud mix can't really shift much higher doesn't seem to make sense anymore.Of course, on the earnings front, Adobe continues to shine. GAAP operating income grew a staggering 50% y/y to $702.7 million (for a company of this scale, 50% growth in earnings is nearly unheard of). The company has found massive efficiencies in sales and marketing spend (the largest component of its operating expense), which grew ""only"" 11% to $581 million despite the 24% growth in revenues. GAAP net income also grew 46% y/y to $583.1 million, achieving EPS of $1.18 in the quarter.On a pro forma basis (stripping out stock comp and other non-cash items), Adobe's EPS of $1.55 also beat analyst consensus of $1.44 - but again, that's only an 8% upside surprise. For a company like Adobe, that's pretty much expected.There's no doubt that Adobe continues to be an impressive company. Having grown its creative cloud ARR to $5.1 billion, Adobe is sitting on a huge pool of recurring revenues - and moreso than other cloud companies, it has an impressive ability to convert its revenue base into huge free cash flow.Valuation does have its limits, however. With Adobe taking the crown as one of the most expensive stocks in the tech sector, it's hard to make a case that the stock's rally still has steam. At best, Adobe is a hold."
4157650,20521,2018-03-19T18:07:26-04:00,Adobe has been investing organically in AI and mobile technologies and has made very few acquisitions over the past few years.But what other companies are on its radar?How will it utilize its cash reserve of over $6 billion and the rich stock price to leverage the unprecedented opportunity in SaaS?,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has over the past few years reinvented itself as a cloud-based service provider. Today, it helps its customers to not just create content but also deliver, optimize, and personalize marketing content and applications. Last week, it reported its 16th straight quarter of revenue growth driven by growth in its digital media and marketing segments.Adobe's first quarter revenues grew 24% over the year to $2.08 billion, ahead of the market's projections of $2.05 billion. EPS of $1.55 was also ahead of the Street's estimate of $1.44 per share.By segment, revenues from Digital Media Solutions segment were $1.46 billion. Total Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue (NYSE:ARR) grew to $5.72 billion at the end of the quarter. Creative revenues grew to $1.23 billion with its ARR growing to $5.07 billion. Document Cloud revenues grew 18% to $231 million, driven by continued strength with Acrobat subscription adoption, and perpetual licensing of Acrobat through the channel. Document Cloud ARR grew to $647 million.The Digital Experience segment, formerly the Digital Marketing segment, grew 16% to $554 million, driven by success across its Analytics Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and Advertising Cloud offerings, with emerging solutions such as Audience Manager, Campaign, Target, and Media Optimizer solutions achieving strong results. Key customer deals included Braun, City National Bank, Expedia, Ford, the NFL, Rakuten, Samsung, and T. Rowe Price.Deferred revenue grew to a record $2.57 billion, up 25% year-over-year. It ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $6.15 billion.For the second quarter, Adobe expects revenues of $2.15 billion, significantly ahead of the Street's forecast of $2.14 billion. Non GAAP earnings per share are estimated at $1.53, again ahead of the market's forecast of $1.51.Adobe is targeting a broader set of consumers and creative professionals through new applications like Adobe Character Animator, Spark, Lightroom CC, Dimension, and XD. Adobe XD is an innovative new app for designing experiences across multiple screens that combines design, prototyping and collaboration capabilities. Adobe recently delivered workflow enhancements, tighter integration with Photoshop and deeper support for new modalities such as pen and touch. Major companies such as Wipro have standardized on XD as their core design product.Video continues to be a focus area. Editing and production products Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects continued to gain momentum among large production houses, independent film makers, and virtual reality projects.For its swelling base of PDF users, Adobe has launched new services including Adobe Sign Adobe Scan, which has been downloaded over 7 million times, and Adobe Sign, which is now the preferred e-signature solution in Office 365. Adobe Scan is a mobile PDF application that leverages its AI offering Adobe Sensei to capture and create intelligent PDFs.Adobe has been investing organically in AI and mobile technologies and has made very few acquisitions over the past few years. It made the $540 million acquisition of video ad-tech company TubeMogul in 2016. TubeMogul reported annual revenue of $180.7 million in 2015. TubeMogul had listed on the Nasdaq in 2014, but its stock fell from a peak of $22 to nearly $8 apiece before the acquisition. That acquisition has strengthened Adobe's already strong Marketing Cloud offering.Then, last year, there was the acquisition of KyleBrush.com with which Adobe added 1,000 digital brushes in its Creative Cloud tools and hired the creator Kyle T. Webster.But what other companies are on its radar? How will it utilize its cash reserve of over $6 billion and the rich stock price to leverage the unprecedented opportunity in SaaS?Analysts are very bullish about Adobe's performance. Its stock touched an all-time high of $224.9 following its results. It has been climbing steadily throughout the year from the 52-week low of $124.51 a year ago."

This is to limit third-party hyper-targeted ads delivered on Facebook's web and mobile platforms.Facebook's new restrictions will compel many ad buyers/marketers to look for other platforms. Adobe's Advertising Cloud platform is now more attractive when combined with the Nvidia-assisted Sensei AI framework. AI is now a vital component in marketing.Further, Nvidia's GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) are popular in deep learning and blockchain cryptocurrency mining. Going forward, Adobe can boost its cloud marketing/advertising business by combining blockchain technology and Sensei.AI can boost hyper-targeted advertising. However, blockchain technology can help advertisers/marketers get more transparency from their ad buys. IBM and Unilever (UL) are using blockchain technology to improve trust in ad placements. Nvidia and Adobe can level-up their collaboration by becoming early adopters of blockchain-based transparent digital advertising.If Adobe wants to catch up to Facebook and Google, it must also offer the blockchain cure for the persistent fraud in digital advertising. Fake or bot traffic that clicked on online ads in 2016 cost advertisers $12.5 billion.I am a freelance graphic artist/video editor who works mostly with wedding coordinators/photographers/videographers. The promise of more embedded Nvidia-powered Sensei features is a compelling reason to keep paying $9.99-49.99 for Adobe Creative Cloud software products. AI features accelerate the workflows of graphic artists. I love the Sensei-powered face-aware liquefy feature in Photoshop CC and the Auto settings of Lightroom CC.It makes me happy that Nvidia will help Adobe implement AI features that will make video editing/3D compositing jobs less tedious. Video editing is my least favorite task. It takes half-a-day for me to browse through three to six hours of Full HD 1080p video footages (from multiple camcorders) just to select the most suitable scenes.If Nvidia's AI software can help in autonomous cars, it should be able to accelerate scene detection in video footages loaded in Adobe Premiere. AI can also expedite render times. Rendering a 1.5-hour fully-edited 1080p video project is still a lengthy process.Nvidia can also help deliver Adobe's promised ""Project Cloak"" feature for removing distracting objects on video footages. The often-chaotic setting of wedding events leads to perfect footages being ruined by unwanted people, pets, and structures.Adobe's Premiere CC is the top-rated video editing software. Nvidia's help could make it even more popular. Video editors need time-saving AI features to increase their revenue flow.Nvidia's leadership in artificial intelligence is key to Adobe Sensei's adoption in the advertising/marketing industry. Adobe's Sensei needs the master expertise of Nvidia to keep it competitive against IBM's Watson Marketing.Spending on digital advertising is now bigger than traditional TV advertising. Adobe needs all the allies it can recruit to get a bigger share of the $209 billion global digital advertising business.(Source: Recode)"
4178469,102994,2018-05-31T12:12:08-04:00,"Adobe Systems announced plans to acquire Magento Inc. for $1.68 billion. Magento, a digital commerce software category leader, competes with Digital River, IBM, Oracle, Salesforce and SAP.
        Adobe (market cap $119B) is a Digital Experience software platform provider whose digital marketing, digital advertising, creative and analytics products are category leaders and widely adopted.
        Adobe offers the software and analytics that brands need to personalize content and engage buyers. But it lacks eCommerce- the ability to execute sales via web, mobile and in-store.
        With Magento part of its Digital Experience Cloud, Adobe will help power eCommerce ($712 billion market (U.S.) by 2022) by making every moment personalized and every experience shoppable.
        The Digital Commerce Software Market is expected to reach $8.6 billion by 2023. Adobe is defining a new category ""Experience Driven Commerce"" to win the lion's share.","Adobe is in the process of acquiring digital commerce category leader Magento for $1.68 billion. It will become part of Adobe's top-rated Digital Experience Cloud and extend its capabilities beyond the design and delivery of digital experiences through content and data, by adding buying opportunities that can be executed anywhere along the customer journey. Once the integration is complete, Adobe plans to have a new solution---Digital Experience Commerce, which should be attractive to: its large current customer base which is likely to be using someone else's digital commerce solution (because Adobe didn't have one and this one will be seamlessly integrated into its existing products;) to its competitors' customers who want a richer single platform solution; to Magento's install base which might be using inferior Digital Experience solutions, and to companies and brands who are just beginning to market and sell their products digitally. The acquisition could open up an extended money-making opportunity for Adobe and its investors.Adobe: Adobe Systems (ADBE) is a 35-year-old San Jose, Calif.-based software company that provides its customers with creativity & design, marketing & analytics, PDF & E-signatures business solutions. It delivers products that help its customers create best-in-class digital experiences via the Adobe Experience Cloud, Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe Document Cloud and Adobe Cloud Platform. Adobe's goal is to help marketers design and deliver digital experiences through content and data. Adobe (pre-Magento acquisition closing) does not offer a commerce solution. Adobe's customers include many of the world's best brands such as Amway, Coca Cola, Coach, and Lufthansa among hundreds more.Tech industry analyst Gartner and others rank Adobe as the top Digital Marketing Hub: A leader in Digital Marketing Analytics (below)A leader in Digital Experience platforms (below)as well as a leader in Digital Asset Management among other capabilities.Adobe's market cap is $119.92B (May 23, 2018)Magento: Magento (private, Premira Funds and Hillhouse are primary investors) is a Campbell, Calif-based provider of a flexible, digital commerce platform that is used in many vertical markets and by companies of various sizes in many countries. It offers two solutions: an open-source Magento Community Edition and an open-core but extended commercial product that is cloud-based. The ""openness"" of Magento allows its customers to customize it to meet their specific needs. There are over 300,000 software developers providing solutions around Magento, suggesting that most users will find what they want or need within reach.Tech analyst Gartner rates Magento as a digital commerce leader, championing its flexibility, cost-effectiveness and speed. It competes closely with Oracle (ORCL), IBM (IBM), SAP Hybris (SAP), Salesforce (CRM), and Digital River and outranks Episerver, NetSuite, Shopify (SHOP) and more.    Gartner Magic Quadrant for Digital Commerce.Magento has a strong community of more than 300,000 developers who have created thousands of pre-built extensions for tasks like payment, shipping, tax and logistics. Magento's customers include Coca Cola, Warner Brothers Music, Canon Inc. and Nestle. Prior to the $1.68 billion Magento acquisition (closing expected to occur this summer), Adobe's category leading products for content creation, marketing, advertising and analytics cover the customer journey, save a single, important step, enabling commerce.The Magento acquisition closes the loop. Adobe is calling the combination ""experience driven commerce"" and it should be far more seamless than what most eCommerce buyers deal with today--a combination of products that are stapled together to deliver digital experiences and digital commerce. This matters because friction, which disparate software often adds, slows experiences, engagement and buying down to the point that customers leave the websites before a sale begins or is complete. eCommerce is expected to be a $712 billion market (U.S.) by 2022 and every provider of goods and services will fight to win its share. Technology is a big differentiator.Though Adobe aims to define Digital Experience Commerce as a new category, other large vendors like IBM, Oracle, Salesforce and SAP offer solutions that combine commerce and customer experience. It's too early to predict exactly how Adobe's Digital Experience Commerce platform will compete, since the sale hasn't even closed yet. But tech industry analysts like Digital Clarity Group's Scott Leiwehr, who focuses on this area tweetedEven if Liewehr is only 50 percent right, this opens a big money making opportunity for Adobe. Constellation Research president Ray Wang, another tech industry analyst noted that Magento's community of more than 300,000 developers who build custom websites, on-line stores, digital tools like shopping carts, cash registers, inventory trackers and such represent a strategic advantage for Adobe.Almost anyway you parse it, the Magento acquisition should bring to Adobe Magento's business, new add-on business from both Adobe's and Magento's existing customers, new first-time customers who aren't satisfied with their current solutions, and interest from companies who are actively looking at becoming digital or use cloud-based solutions for the very first time.Some industry analysts also believe that with Magento, as part of its Digital Experience Cloud, Adobe could win business away from smaller vendors like Aptos, Apptus, Elastic Path, Episerver, NetSuite, Shopify, Sitecore and many, many more.It's worth noting that some Wall Street analysts look at Adobe's Magento acquisition as a ""beat Shopify,"" webstore play. In that market, WeeCommerce owns 18 percent of the market, Magento and Oracle have 16 percent each, Shopify has 13 percent, and other vendors share the rest. Most tech industry analysts who know Adobe and Magento, as well as the greater Digital Experience, Digital Marketing and eCommerce landscapes believe that the webstore view is too narrow. I agree.At $1.68 billion, Adobe is paying a premium for Magento. The company's last valuation, as judged by its most recent round of funding (China's Hillhouse invested $250 million in January 2017,)was around $700 million according to sources known by the Financial Times.Magento's ""approximately $150 million in annual revenue,"" (according to a press statement issued by Adobe) won't do much to impact Adobe's nearly $9 billion top line in the short term. But over the long haul, Adobe's entry into the growing digital commerce platform market ($15 billion by 2024) should bring in larger revenues, especially as Adobe sales reps pitch Magento to its larger enterprise customers, a market that Magento does not dominate. It's also worth noting that the digital commerce platform market is packed with small private and venture-backed firms many of which do not have the business know-how, pocketbook, customer portfolio, or connections that Adobe does.It would be remiss not to look at the defensive win that Magento brings to Adobe as well. Adobe leads the Digital Marketing Hub technology category now (source Gartner) and tech analysts predict that Digital Commerce will become a key component of the hub. Without that component, buyers might look at competitors who have all-in-one solutions which would take sales away from Adobe's other platforms.Of course, there is always the chance that Adobe will botch the integration, but it's not likely given the success it has had with the Day Software and Omniture buys. Moreover Magento's CEO Mark Lavalle is coming on board. So, if you're willing to hedge that everything, or at least most things, will go right, then Magento will help Adobe grow its top line as well as shareholder value. As one of the top Nasdaq performers for 2018, Adobe traded at $142 one year ago and it's at $242 as I write, you have to believe management is doing something right."
4157079,102007,2018-03-16T10:43:12-04:00,Adobe reported 2018 Q1 beating all estimates.Reiterated 2018 full year guidance and updated Q2 expectation.We believe Adobe will continue its momentum in Digital Media while finding opportunities to accelerate growth in digital marketing.,"Adobe (ADBE) reported F2018 first-quarter results after Thursday closing and the company delivered another quarter of solid execution and accelerating growth in its core product categories. We think Adobe is well-positioned going into the rest of 2018 amid a supportive IT spending environment and tax-reform. Over the years Adobe has delivered impeccable results for shareholders as it transformed into a subscription business model. High recurring revenue and impressive growth in its digital media category have helped Adobe to produce one of the most consistent growth stories. Pre-market shares traded up 3-4%.Adobe saw its revenue jumped from $1,681 million to $2,079 million, a 24% increase year over year. Profits excluding one-time costs were $1.55 per share, beating consensus by $0.11. Revenue also beat analyst estimates of $2.05 billion. Subscription grew 30% to $1.79 billion; Product lowered by 6% to $171.6 million; Services and support unchanged at $113.98M.Digital Media grew 28% to $1.46 billion (Creative at $1.23 billion and Document Cloud at $231 million). The consistent growth has demonstrated a solid track record of consistent growth in Adobe' largest segment by revenue.Digital Experience grew 16% to $554 million. Investors would love to see Adobe accelerate its growth in this segment as the trend of slower growth isn't encouraging. However, given that in Q1 2018 this segment only accounted for 27% of the overall revenue, the fast growth at Digital Media was able to compensate for the slower growth at digital marketing.Another closely watched metric is Annual recurring revenue (""ARR"") for the Digital Media segment. During Q1 2018 Creative ARR grew an impressive 35% to pass $5.0 billion, continuing its strong momentum.Document Cloud ARR also saw accelerated growth of 31% to reach $647 million in the quarter. Albeit a smaller part of the Digital Media segment, Adobe is able to achieve impressive growth from this segment which has grown to become a larger business than Digital Experience.Adobe mentioned that it has provided notice that it is raising prices on its popular software such as Photoshop next month, which helped drive subscription growth in the quarter. Another trend that management mentioned was that buyers are buying multiple products instead of single software, expanding the basket size for Adobe.Adobe confirmed 2018 full year EPS guidance of $6.20 per share. For 2018 Q2 Adobe expects revenue of $2.15 billion and EPS of $1.53, which includes Digital Media revenue growth of 25% and net new Media ARR of $330 million.Another solid beat during the last quarter and investors are reacting positively sending shares up 3-4% in after-hours trading. Over the years Adobe has successfully transformed into a cloud-based digital subscription model and future growth will likely be coming from its Digital Experience segment which offers digital tools for online marketers. However, the digital marketing space is crowded with competition from Salesforce (CRM) and Oracle (ORCL) and we are seeing slower growth from that segment. However, Adobe's core strength in creative software has continued to drive impressive growth year over year. (Bloomberg)Going forward we would be closely watching for the growth at Digital Media as price increases take effect in April this year and growth of ARR, an important aspect of the subscription model. We also think the balance sheet strength and strong free cash flow could support transformative acquisitions in the digital marketing space should Adobe pursues accelerated growth in that area. There is still a long runway for Adobe to continue growing its Digital Media assets while refining its product offerings in online marketing tools and we believe investors will be rewarded nicely along the way. The recurring business model and consistent beat mean that the stock will gradually rise, unlike some stocks with big swings around major announcements or earnings, but the solid execution has produced a commendable track record of value creation.Author's NoteWe hope you found our article helpful.

Adjusted EPS of $1.55 topped the Street by the widest margin since at least early 2014, handily exceeding management's own $1.27 guidance provided last quarter (which at that moment had not accounted for the lower 2018 tax rates).Credit: Yahoo FinanceAdobe's subscription revenues reached an impressive 86.3% of total revenues, higher than last quarter's 84.5% and well above last year's 82.3%. The largest digital media portfolio (now representing 70% of revenues for the first time) continues to lead the charge, with sales of $1.46 billion up nearly 30% YOY - just like last quarter.Margins once again moved in the right direction, with cost of sales rising less than 10% YOY. Opex as a percentage of revenues also remained under check, reaching 46.8% vs. last year's much richer 51.1%. So not only are revenues riding the updraft, Adobe has done an increasingly good job at maintaining expenses relatively low.Helping to generate the robust EPS beat was a low effective tax rate of 11% that was aided by the new tax legislation passed in December 2017. But even if the rate had been 21% as originally predicted, I estimate that adjusted EPS would have still come in a dime ahead of guidance. Lastly, share repurchases caused share count to dip below 500 million in a trend that I expect to continue, as the buyback authorization of $2.5 billion still has a sizable balance of $1.6 billion left to be used.See summarized P&L below.Source: DM Martins ResearchThe outlook for the next quarter was slightly better than the Street had been expecting. However, it has become a habit for management to guide for lower results than it can achieve. A full three months before the next set of results are expected to come out, I am already modestly optimistic that Adobe's beat-and-raise saga will continue.Adobe is proving to be one of the most interesting GARP (growth at a reasonable price) names to cross my radar as of late. Not only does Adobe seem to have a compelling product portfolio that has become the industry standard, the company has turned the great majority of its sales into cloud-based, subscription revenues. The results are steadily increasing and stable revenues and margins over the past several quarters (see graph below).ADBE Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsA current-year P/E of 36.5x may seem like a rich multiple to value-oriented investors like me. But if there is one company whose stock deserves the rich valuation, Adobe is a top contender, given its cash-rich balance sheet and growth profile. In fact, on a PEG basis (current-year P/E over long-term earnings growth expectations), the stock's very reasonable 1.4x multiple sits at the low end of its 52-week range. See graph below.Fundamental Chart data by YChartsAdobe's management team seems to be doing all the right things to ensure that the company capitalizes on the highly favorable macro trends in the digital media and digital marketing spaces. For this reason and given reasonable multiples, ADBE continues to look like a solid stock to me."
4157905,23757,2018-03-20T17:58:53-04:00,Adobe appears to be taking marketing spend share away from the traditional ad agencies.Three key trends in the advertising and CPG sector are set to benefit new digital entrants at the expense of the old guard.Adobe's new products point to a continued assault on the big ad agencies' business models.,"Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) currently trades at a P/E of 65 and a forward P/E of almost 35. The company’s success at transitioning its business model to cloud-based subscriptions (perhaps the most successful cloud transition amongst software companies?) accounts for most of the optimism surrounding the stock. For this article, we want to focus on its smaller Marketing Cloud business. We believe it’s the greatest reason for optimism about the stock and the reason investors in traditional ad agencies such as WPP Group (NYSE:WPP), Omnicom (NYSE:OMC), Interpublic Group (NYSE:IPG), Publicis Groupe (OTCQX:PUBGY), and Denstu (OTCPK:DNTUY) should be very concerned.The most important thing to understand about the advertising industry is that it's essentially a no-growth sector. The chart below shows advertising spend in the US as a percent of GDP.(Graphic source: L2, Inc/Scott Galloway)As you can see ad spending seesaws between 1% and 1.5% of GDP with rare exceptions such as WW2 or the tail end of the Roaring 20s. Because the amount of money in the ad industry is relatively fixed it's critical for investors to identify winners and losers since a growing market won’t paper over company or sector issues.There are several emerging trends in the advertising world that benefit Adobe (and other technology companies) at the expense of the big five incumbent agencies.First, the old style traditional advertising campaign across a variety of media types is losing its importance. A typical old style ad campaign to roll out a new product might combine print, radio, and television ads that would then need to be bought across all the different newspaper, radio, and television companies. Today portions of an advertising campaign are becoming simpler from a logistics perspective as the market for digital advertising is essentially split between two behemoths, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). It’s not a sudden shift and the incumbent ad agencies still fulfill valuable roles, but it is a subtle drip of dollars flowing away to new entrants. For example, companies are starting to find the upstart advertising arms of consultancies like Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and Deloitte more useful because of their quicker embrace of technology (such as Adobe’s products) than the incumbent agencies.Second, the rise of smaller “local” brands and the fall of the old giants in the CPG sector is changing the distribution of advertising dollars. Over the past five years, the 50 largest CPG companies saw their market share drop from 33% to 31%. In their place have emerged a cornucopia of smaller, digital savvy, sometimes solely online, start-ups. As sales fall or stagnate at the big global CPG companies they will inevitably be spending less on advertising which means the dollars flowing through the big five traditional agencies will decline. (Witness the last few earnings updates from WPP Group which has the largest exposure to the CPG sector to see what this trend is doing to the incumbents.) The smaller startup CPG companies are much more likely to use products like Adobe’s offerings then become big clients of the incumbent agencies.Third, the more robust the tools offered by tech companies the easier it is for companies to in-house their marketing efforts. Paying a lot of money to a third party for something you can do yourself is never a sound business decision. Historically designing, managing, and launching a global advertising campaign was not really something every company could do. Plus, it was usually the advertising agencies that had access to all of the data needed to properly design an effective ad campaign. However, new products such as Adobe’s offerings are starting to change that. They are making it easier (not easy, but easier) for companies to move more marketing efforts in-house and they also allow companies to control their own advertising data. Again, the traditional agencies still have a role to fulfill but that role is being reduced and in danger of further reductions.All of these trends can easily be summed up in one graph. The chart below shows the year-over-year revenue growth for Adobe and the five biggest advertising agencies.(Source: Public filings)Note that in an effort to be as generous as possible to the traditional agencies we used top line revenue figures which included foreign exchange effects and the effect of acquisitions.It’s important to note that we are not comparing like to like since Adobe is not an advertising agency. What we want to focus on is that Adobe is growing their advertising industry revenue much faster than GDP growth and much faster than incumbents. We believe what this does show is that companies are spending less of their total marketing budgets going through the traditional agencies and more on utilizing alternative methods which include spending money on Adobe (or competitors) products.The future also looks bright for Adobe’s advertising and marketing products and decidedly dim for the incumbent agencies. Adobe recently announced it was rolling out a new product, Adobe Advertising Cloud, which will basically be in direct competition with the traditional agencies. Adobe’s product aims to help users manage their traditional and digital ad buying and aims to be platform agnostic.While the old agencies are partnering with the new digital “martech” entrants such as Adobe there's one critical and perhaps overlooked aspect of the partnership. While the old agencies traditionally would (and still do) have ownership of the client relationship the new entrants like Adobe will be the ones who have ownership of data. It raises the question about who the true owner of the client is. If Adobe is the one that owns the data related to the client many in the industry think that eventually it will be companies like Adobe that own the client relationship. Thus partnering with new digital entrants could be a double-edged sword for the old guard."

If that path isn't clear, you're likely to lose money.The stock market bubble doesn't pay any attention to systemic risk.","Should investors steer clear of tech-centric unicorns positioning to come to Wall Street? Or could these companies present an opportunity?And what insight can investors gain when reviewing these up-and-coming businesses?Sarmana Mitra has been writing about billion-dollar unicorns, as well as pending and completed IPOs and well-established tech companies, via her One Million by One Million (described as a ""global virtual accelerator"") Website. The venture capitalist and blogger has offered her commentary on Seeking Alpha for several years.In addition to sharing her insights into emerging companies and completed and pending IPOs, Mitra also shares her insight in well-established tech companies in our 2018 Outlook series. Her Q&A with editor Michael Hopkins follows.Michael Hopkins (MH): We like your focus on unicorns and start-ups, not only the basics and leadership behind each company, but also the fundamentals of the business. What are the big obstacles these new companies face? The need for capital? Recruiting and maintaining a strong workforce?Sramana Mitra (Mitra): The biggest problem I see is that often these so-called unicorns are growing without paying adequate attention to unit economics. This growth at all cost strategy isn't one that I believe in. And it has resulted in many ""death by overfunding"" situations that we've covered extensively in 2016 and 2017.(MH): It seems right now is a good environment for some of these fledgling companies to obtain capital and investment. Is that true? And what about 2018? Can start-ups and unicorns expect good access to funding in the near term and long term?(Mitra): Funding is abundantly available for late stage companies right now, and it will be so for a while. There's just too much capital in the system in the hands of large funds, so if the company has some merit, funding isn't an obstacle to growth.(MH): I'm guessing we'll see IPOs from notable companies (in tech and elsewhere) in 2018. Our question: Is an IPO always a viable option for these companies? Maybe staying private is the better course to take.(Mitra): More and more companies are opting NOT to go public. Enter Softbank Vision Fund. First close ~$100 billion. Targeting ~$1 trillion. They can gobble up anything and everything they want to. Many unicorns will exit into Softbank.(MH): Any notable IPOs that investors can expect in 2018?(Mitra): Maybe Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT). With Uber (NYSE:UBER) struggling with scandal after scandal, Lyft is in a good place. It's a much steadier, cleaner company.(MH): What should investors know about any upcoming IPOs. What are the risks? The opportunities?(Mitra): Look for a path to profitability. If that path isn't clear, you're likely to lose money. The opportunities are the bootstrapped companies that are going public like BlackLine (NASDAQ:BL) and Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM). They have good discipline, a culture of profitability and fundamentals, and will be more sustainable in the long term.(MH): Any unicorn or any other tech company that surprised you in 2017?(Mitra): Uber has been a disaster. The surprise is that it actually was brought down in a meaningful way by an employee's candid and powerful description of sexual harassment practices. They have been defying gravity for a long time. I wouldn't invest in that company now or anytime soon unless the new CEO shows he can clean up the culture mess.And Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) will have a tough 2018, again, because of the fact that its core business practices are starting to come under scrutiny. Destroying democracy, turning society into a mass of addicted crazies, facilitating the spread of fake news… these are not going unnoticed. The stock will feel the impact.(MH): And any IPOs that surprised you this year?(NYSE:SM): Not really.(MH): We also like your focus on established companies in tech, especially mid-cap stocks. Can you share candidates you may have that investors should watch closely in 2018?(SM): Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is doing really well. Clean, non-controversial company. Solid numbers.(MH): In general, what ""surprise"" do you see in the market that isn't currently getting sufficient investor attention?(SM): Inequality is increasing. Social unrest is becoming more likely. How will this impact the stability of the current capitalistic system?

Each week we do the following:We also have some fun. We welcome comments, links, and ideas to help us improve this resource for traders. If you have some ideas, please join in!Our previous Stock Exchange asked the question “what can traders learn from poker playing artificial intelligence?” We compared the strengths of machines versus humans with regards to poker, and then discussed their applications to trading. If you missed it, a glance at your news feed will show that the key points remain relevant.The market has been extremely strong over the last nine years. And by many metrics, we’re now entering very rare territory. For starters, here’s a look at the total return of the S&P 500 since the depths of the financial crises, up nearly 400% - truly extraordinary.And according to this next chart, stocks (as measured by the S&P 500) recently crossed the most overbought level in 22 years.Similarly, Chris Ciovacco points out that the Dow Jones daily RSI recently printed its most overbought reading since 1955, as shown in this table.Our trend-following trading models (e.g. Felix, Athena) are more sophisticated than simply RSI, but the continuing momentum in RSI helps explain why these models have been working so well (more on performance later).For more perspective on market strength, Howard Marks (co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management) had this to say:And in the same article, Marks also shared the following positive remarks:Continuing with our theme of extreme strength metrics, additional unusual things have been happening in the market. For example, this article from Bloomberg shows that a normally reliable trading strategy is going haywire. Specifically, quantitative traders have long used liquidity metrics to identify opportunities. According to the article:“bets on the least traded stocks should, in theory, outperform the market because there’s a reward for taking on the extra liquidity risk… But since December the opposite has been occurring, with the most liquid stocks rewarding investors to the greatest degree in nine years.”By contrast, our trading models use the 750 most liquid stocks, thereby also contributing to their continuing strong performance.But what inferences can traders make from continuing market strength? According to the same article by Chris Ciovacco, “after experiencing extremely rare stock market overbought readings, stocks performed very well over the next two years” as shown in the following table.And consistent with continuing market strength, our momentum-based models have been stronger than our dip-buying models; however both continue to deliver strong returns (more on this later).

Dr. Steenbarger’s content is organized, extremely valuable, and goes back for more than a dozen years. Per reader feedback, we’re continuing to share the performance of our trading models, and the following table shows this week’s update.Important to note, we find that blending a trend-following / momentum model (Athena) with a mean reversion / dip-buying model (Holmes) provides two strategies, effective in their own right, that are not correlated with each other or with the overall market. By combining the two, we can get more diversity, lower risk, and a smoother string of returns.This week’s Stock Exchange is being edited by Blue Harbinger (Blue Harbinger is a source for independent investment ideas).Road Runner: This week I like Adobe Systems (ADBE). Are you familiar with this company, Blue Harbinger?Blue Harbinger: Yes, I am familiar. I know Adobe is more than simply a company that lets me save my documents as a PDF before I send them to someone else so I don’t have to worry about the formatting or content getting messed up. Adobe operates through three segments: Digital Media, Digital Marketing, and Print and Publishing. Why do you like this stock, Road Runner?RR: As you know, I like to buy stocks that are at the bottom of a rising channel. And based on the following chart, you can see why I like Adobe.BH: Interesting, Road Runner. I see Adobe’s share price seems to have fallen below this “rising channel” you always talk about. What kind of risk management are you using, if any?RR: You’re right. I purchased this stock on January 26th at the lower end of the channel, and its price did drop a bit in the last few days. I don’t use stop orders like the other trading models, but I do watch it closely. The decline is mostly in line with the market.BH: Hmm. Interesting, Road Runner. Are you aware of how the new tax laws will impact Adobe? Specifically, did you know the company just recently lifted its 2018 earnings guidance to $6.20 from the prior forecast of $5.50, citing recent tax law changes that are expected to significantly lower its effective tax rate?RR: I am aware of the tax law. Did you know my typical holding period is only about 4 weeks, and also that Adobe is tentatively scheduled to announce earnings in a couple weeks on February 15th?BH: I did know that, Road Runner. In case you’d like a little more fundamental information about Adobe, here is a look at the company’s Fast Graph.RR: That Fast Graph is showing some strong future upside, but again—I typically hold for only about 4 weeks. How about you, Felix—what have you got this week?Felix: I have no stock picks this week, but I did run the top stocks in the Russell 1000 large cap index through my model, and I’ve included the top 20 in the following list.BH: That’s an interesting list, Felix. I see a lot of the usual aggressive growth suspects on your list, such as payment processing application Square (SQ), chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and now cell-based cancer immunotherapy company, Juno Therapeutics (JUNO), is at the top of your list. All those companies have been performing well. Are you nervous that any of them are overbought and due for a correction?Felix: I’m a model, not a person. So no, I am not nervous. Besides, the earlier data in this report shows markets often continue rising for two years after printing extreme overbought levels. And in case you have forgotten, I typically hold my positions for about 66 weeks—which is much longer than the other models. I exit when my price target is hit, and I use stops and macro considerations to control risks. And did you happen to notice my strong performance in the performance table earlier in this report?BH: I noticed, Felix. Nice work. I’m also glad Jeff uses a combination of momentum and dip-buying models, just in case market conditions change. It helps deliver a diversified lower-volatility return stream. How about you, Oscar—what have you got this week?Oscar: This week I’m sharing my top 20 rankings from our comprehensive and diverse ETFs list.BH: I see the inverse VIX (XIV) is at the top of your list; that’s been a great trade for years because volatility has been disappearing (the VIX is also known as the market “fear index” because it measures expected future volatility). I especially like that trade now because volatility has ticked up in recent trading days (it’s still no where near financial crisis levels), but that uptick seems to make for a more attractive entry point, assuming the market reverts back towards the ongoing longer-term trend.Oscar: I agree, and I suspect you’re right (that’s why XIV is ranked so highly). And in case you’ve forgotten, I am a momentum trader, and my typical holding period is about six weeks. I use stops to protect against downside, and I exit by rotating into another sector.Just because market strength is unusually high doesn’t mean it’s going to change immediately. In fact, historically, the market has remained strong after reaching extreme RSI levels, such as those it has recently achieved. Nonetheless, we prefer to use a blended approach between momentum and dip-buying models in order to reduce risk while keeping expected future returns high.Each week, Felix and Oscar host a poker game for some of their friends. Since they are all traders, they love to discuss their best current ideas before the game starts. They like to call this their ""Stock Exchange."" (Check out Background on the Stock Exchange for more background). Their methods are excellent, as you know if you have been following the series.

4140775,102830,2018-01-28T13:56:13-05:00,"Adobe's and Salesforce's growth has been impressive, with each projecting 20% sales increases for its next fiscal year.With a Price/Sales ratio of 8.28x, Salesforce trades at a significant discount to Adobe (13.59x).Consensus Wall Street estimates expect 7% upside for Adobe and 8% upside for Salesforce.","There's been a lot of movement in both Adobe's (ADBE) and Salesforce's (CRM) stock prices over the last year. Adobe has increased a whopping 81% and Salesforce has increased 50%, which isn't too shabby either. Even with these large increases, I believe both stocks are still good buys and have plenty of upside left. With that being said, there is a valuation disparity and I believe Salesforce has more upside potential.There's a few things I like about both companies, but Adobe is the clear winner here. I especially like Adobe's combination of strong revenue growth and improving gross margins, which has led to strong free cash flow. Adobe has been using some of that free cash flow to repurchase shares, which is something I like to see because as an investor, you have two forces working in your favor. Profits should continue increasing from revenue growth, and those profits-per-share will be magnified by a reduction in share count. Over the last 3 full fiscal years, Adobe has:Salesforce, on the other hand, has grown sales at a faster rate, but has yet to turn that into meaningful profits and is also experiencing some gross margin erosion. I'm OK with a lack of meaningful profit because Salesforce is spending heavily on acquiring new customers, but the margin compression is a little concerning. Over the last 3 full fiscal years, Salesforce has:Both companies expect to continue strong growth. For fiscal year 2018, Adobe expects $8.7 billion in revenue, YoY revenue growth of 20%. Adobe also expects GAAP earnings-per-share of $4.40, YoY growth of 30%. Salesforce operates on a different fiscal year, but has already projected 20% sales growth for 2019. These are the same sales growth percentages, but Adobe is the winner given its stronger margins. Every incremental dollar in revenue will equal greater profits and free cash flow compared to Salesforce.Adobe has more cash, a lower amount of leverage, and a better current ratio. This should allow more flexibility for Adobe and maybe even some potential for an acquisition in the future.At first glance, it might look like Adobe is better given a more attractive Forward P/E, EV/FCF, and PEG Ratio. However, I think Salesforce is the more attractive choice. I believe the most relevant metric here is Price/Sales given the growth rates. Adobe does deserve a premium given higher gross margins, but a 64% Price/Sales premium is too much in my opinion. Once Salesforce puts more of a focus on profits and free cash flow, I believe this will lead to excess returns compared to Adobe.The chart below also gives me the feeling that Adobe's valuation is unlikely to go much higher from a multiples perspective. You can see that a fair amount of Adobe's stock performance has been tied to increasing Price/Sales multiples, especially over the last two years. Since Adobe has a forward P/E of 28.25x and a PEG of 1.32x, I think this a fair valuation. I just don't see the Price/Sales multiple going any higher. Future stock performance will be more tied to operating performance.ADBE data by YChartsSalesforce Price/Sales multiple has been pretty consistent over time. Stock price increases have been a result of sales increases, so it's been completely tied to improving performance. This creates a chart that shows divergence between stock price and valuation multiples, which is something I like to see.CRM data by YChartsWall Street is slightly more bullish on Salesforce as well. According to MarketWatch, the average target price for Salesforce is $122.49, which represents 8% upside based on the current share price of $113.70. The average target price for Adobe is $215.48, which represents 7% upside based on the current share price of $201.05. What really separates Salesforce is a more consistent analyst consensus, which includes 82% that rate the stock as a 'Buy.'In many ways, Adobe has a superior performance profile compared to Salesforce. Adobe has been able to drive sales growth and turn that growth into strong profits, gross margins, and free cash flow. I also believe that Adobe has an almost impenetrable market position with much stronger barriers to entry. Adobe's software is quite simply the gold standard for digital media solutions. With that being said, this analysis is about which stock is the better buy and I believe Salesforce has more upside potential. I like that Salesforce trades at a significant discount to Adobe in terms of Price/Sales. Salesforce has been putting more spend into acquiring customers, so I do believe that will translate into quickly increasing profit and free cash flow in the future. Salesforce also has a much larger market to sell into. Large enterprises will continue transitioning and upgrading their CRM systems."

Since Adobe began transitioning its offerings onto a SaaS model, the stock's performance has steadily climbed. It has climbed nearly 80% since a year ago, and analysts believe that there is more to come.Adobe's fourth quarter revenues grew 25% over the year to $2.01 billion, ahead of the market's projections of $1.95 billion. Subscription comprised 85% of its revenues, compared with 34% a year ago. Revenue from products brought in 10% for the quarter and the remainder came in from Services & Support. EPS of $1.26 also was ahead of the Street's estimated $1.15 per share for the quarter.By segment, revenues from Digital Media Solutions grew 29% to $1.39 billion. Total Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) grew to $5.23 billion at the end of the quarter, driven by strong growth in both the Creative Cloud and Document Cloud segments. Creative revenues grew 30% to $1.16 billion with its ARR growing to $3.15 billion. Document Cloud revenues grew 23% to $235 million.The Digital Marketing segment brought in $572.7 million in revenues driven by the Experience Cloud business where revenues grew 18% to $550 million. Revenues from the Print and Publishing segment brought in the remaining $43.6 million in revenues.Adobe ended the year with revenues growing from $5.85 billion a year ago to $7.3 billion. Net income per share increased from $2.35 a year ago to $3.43 for the year.For the current quarter, Adobe expects revenues of $2.40 billion, significantly ahead of the Street's forecast of $2.04 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share are estimated at $1.27, again ahead of the market's forecast of $1.24. For fiscal 2018, Adobe forecast revenues of $8.725 billion, marginally ahead of the Street's estimates of $8.69 billion. It expects to end the year with an EPS of $5.50 compared with the market's projected EPS of $5.47.During the last quarter, it announced the release of new applications across the design, video and photography segments. Key product launches included the introduction of Adobe XD - an end-to-end UX and UI design; Adobe Dimension to simplify 3D design; Adobe Character Animator that brings 2D puppets to life; and Adobe Lightroom CC, a photography cloud service that works across desktop, mobile, and the web. It also introduced a premium version of Adobe Spark to help its clients communicate their ideas visually.Adobe also is investing in the Artificial Intelligence segment through Adobe Sensei. Adobe Sensei will become a critical differentiator for Adobe, as it has access to Adobe's massive volume of content and data assets, along with access to Adobe's expertise in creativity, documents, and experiences. Adobe is focusing on making Sensei a foundational part of its creative and enterprise customer offerings.Analysts are very pleased with Adobe's performance. The added AI features along with expected price increases next year are making them very bullish on the stock. Richard Davis with Canaccord Genuity raised his price target to $195 from $185, R.W. Baird's Rob Oliver reiterated an Outperform rating and hiked his price target to $200 from $180. Its stock is currently trading at $174.97 with a market capitalization of $86.25 billion.

4132418,92586,2017-12-17T22:23:01-05:00,"Counterintuitively, the more predictable Adobe's revenue flow becomes, the more the company delivers beyond management's expectations.Gross margins remained stable, while operating leverage helped non-GAAP EPS grow 40% YOY. Fiscal 2018 is looking solid as well.ADBE has been sputtering in the past month, and this may be as close as an investor might get to an entry opportunity into the stock.","It was better than I had anticipated.On Thursday, after the closing bell, Adobe Systems (ADBE) delivered an all-around beat that surpassed even management's guidance - not an uncommon occurrence as of late. The San Jose-based company has not disappointed the Street since September 2014, when it missed on revenues by a meager $20 million.Credit: ReutersRevenues of $2.01 billion surpassed my projections by $47 million and the Street's by $50 million. The widest beat as far back as I can trace came just as Adobe's subscription revenues reached 84.5% of total revenues (much better than 78.5% this time last year). It is a bit counterintuitive to notice that the more predictable the revenue flow becomes, the more Adobe is able to deliver beyond management's expectations. In my view, the top line results speak to the strength of the company's digital media portfolio, up nearly 30% YOY in the last quarter of fiscal 2017 to $1.39 billion.As the chart above illustrates, reported gross margins of 86.5% were materially higher than my de-risked estimate of 86.0%, which, per my calculations, accounted for a penny upside to my EPS projections. I believe the top line strength played a key role in the margin resilience, with scale helping to keep cost of revenue increase below the pace of revenue growth. Non-GAAP opex came in at $930 million, above my expectations. But on a percentage-of-revenue basis, SG&A continued to dip in the YOY comparison and produce op margin expansion - this time breaching the 40% level vs. last year's 36.7%.The outlook for the coming quarter and fiscal 2018 improved slightly, but not enough to cause an overwhelmingly bullish reaction on the Street. If history serves as a guide, however, it is possible that actual results might once again exceed management's guidance in the coming fiscal year. At least this is what shareholders would hope for.I have been warming up to the idea of owning ADBE since around September, when I argued that ""Adobe's management team seems to be doing all the right things to ensure that the company capitalizes on the highly favorable macro trends in the digital media and digital marketing spaces."" Not only that, but I appreciate the company's fast move towards a recurring revenue model that is most likely to keep the top line and possibly share price stable going forward.Back in September, I thought a forward (fiscal 2017) earnings multiple of 38.5x and PEG of 1.9x could be justifiable as a GARP (growth at a reasonable price) play. Today, and now using 2018 in my valuation calculations, forward P/E of 31.9x and PEG of 1.5x continue to support the bull case for ADBE, in my view. Shares have been sputtering in the past month, and this may be as close as an investor might get to an entry opportunity into the stock, absent significant macro shocks.ADBE P/E Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts"
4157130,73185,2018-03-16T13:28:46-04:00,"ADBE reported yet another beat-and-raise quarter.Revenue growth refuses to slow down, while margins are increasing faster than before.The stock still offers good value considering its robust earnings growth prospects.","A big winner over the past several years, Adobe (ADBE) continues to prove why it is one of Wall Street's favorite investments. The cloud giant reported yet another beat-and-raise quarter on Thursday (3/15) afternoon. For those who follow Adobe's stock, you'll know that a beat-and-raise quarter is just more of the same from this big growth company. Each beat-and-raise, though, is more impressive than the last, because estimates keep moving higher as Adobe's stock goes higher. But no matter how high the analysts hike their estimates, Adobe keeps reporting numbers that are above what everyone was looking for.This trend won't stop anytime soon. Adobe is the dominant player in a secular growth market, and this positioning gives the company a big and long growth runway ahead. ADBE stock is richly valued, but big growth deserves a big valuation, and this is a winning name we are sticking with for the long term.ADBE data by YChartsAt its core, Adobe is a one-stop shop for creative professionals of all sizes, backgrounds, and experience levels. Essentially, if you do any work in the creative professional world, you have likely had a run in with at least one, if not multiple, of Adobe's solutions. These solutions are quite powerful, and there is very little competition in the field.That is why when Adobe moved all of its solutions to the cloud and started charging a subscription fee back in 2013, there was no customer churn even though customers were visibly unhappy and competitors tried to woo them away. Instead, customers, no matter how unhappy they were, just migrated to Adobe's cloud solutions because there was no sufficient alternative. Indeed, all that has happened since 2013 is revenues have soared, margins have zoomed higher, profits have blossomed, and ADBE stock has increased 500% in value.ADBE data by YChartsCurrent numbers indicate that this trend won't slow anytime soon. Adobe continues to create more and more cloud-hosted solutions, all of which are being met with huge consumer demand and the sum of which are keeping revenue growth rates high. Revenue growth in the first quarter was 24%, which is actually higher than where it was 12 months ago. Revenue acceleration from a 20%-plus base is rare, and speaks to just how dominant Adobe is in its respective niche of the big-growth cloud market.Meanwhile, gross margins, which already are naturally high because Adobe sells subscriptions on software, are heading even higher thanks to price hikes. This is another benefit of Adobe being so dominant in its field. Much like Netflix (NFLX), they can afford to raise subscription prices without any noticeable churn. This gross margin expansion should continue in the long term with gradual price hikes.Operating margins are zooming higher by even more because big revenue growth is driving huge expense leveraging. Because revenue growth is accelerating and gross margins are up big, the rate of operating margin expansion is actually accelerating. Operating margins expanded 570 basis points last quarter, vs. ""only"" 350 basis points of expansion in the quarter before that.All in all, ADBE is a big revenue growth company with huge margin drivers. The runway for big growth to persist also is quite long. Between the Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud businesses, Adobe estimates that its total addressable market is in excess of $80 billion. Revenues last year were just $7.3 billion.From this perspective, and considering revenue growth has remained resiliently north of 20%, it's easy to see ADBE growing revenues by 15% per year over the next five years. Price hikes, expense leveraging, and buybacks could easily turn that into 20-25% earnings growth over the next five years.Historically speaking, ADBE stock has been maxed out when the forward PEG ratio (forward earnings multiple divided by long-term earnings growth) is around 1.8. A PEG ratio of 1.8 on 22.5% earnings growth gets you to a forward multiple on 40.5. A 40.5x multiple on $6.20 in guided 2018 earnings yields an ADBE stock price of nearly $250.Fundamental Chart data by YChartsADBE data by YChartsOverall, ADBE is a big growth company with muted competition, a really long growth runway, and huge margin drivers. Meanwhile, the valuation on ADBE stock is still a ways from being maxed out. Putting those together, we think ADBE stock offers good value all the way up to $250."
4131709,86786,2017-12-13T17:13:18-05:00,"Falling fundamental ratios from 2010-15 has kept Adobe analysts cautious about whether the current growth spurt is sustainable.Adobe's cash flows are at all-time highs, yet analysts have not raised their EPS estimates to adequately reflect this.With growth rate as our metric, we look to exponential growth in Adobe's sector - growth that the analysts are treating as linear and thus underestimated.I expect earnings to be a pleasant surprise and rocket the stock to $182.50 over the coming quarter.","Below is a sample from my Exposing Earnings marketplace newsletter. This is a typical article you would receive from me. In addition, you gain access to our live chat and can submit your requests for earnings play analyses (e.g., How will stock ABC react this quarter on earnings?).Every quarter it seems I'm playing Adobe (ADBE). Last quarter, one of you subscribers pointed this one out, and again you're asking for an earnings DD, which I gladly give you, as I'm already positioned for earnings. Because ADBE will likely beat, and a beat usually leads to a rally, ADBE is a safe long play in the long term; my opinion is that this quarter is no exception.My only concern is the relative quietness surrounding this quarter's earnings. Usually, there's a lot of talk about ADBE before earnings - and perhaps this is just my subjective judgment of the online atmosphere - but for the risk/reward this trade offers, too few traders are tossing in their hats. With only a couple days left, you'd best ready your hat:This earnings report will come right in December's triple-witching week, which is usually bullish for the market. The exception is the basket of stocks that have performed exceptionally well during the year (I'm currently writing an article about this on Seeking Alpha; check it out if you have the chance.) Right before the end of December - usually by mid-December - those outperformers are sold off so that fund managers can create the appearance of a balanced portfolio.Back to ADBE specifically, this is likely the reason for the selloff. For anyone looking to find discounts in the market, mid-December is the best time. Nearly every stock that has done well in 2018 and is currently experiencing a pullback will be back up by mid-February, and this includes ADBE.It's easy to justify buying ADBE at earnings, then, if we expect earnings to do well. Likely, ADBE will rally on earnings and then again in January, allowing for a long-term position to pay off quite handsomely. You can use this report as a justification for a longer-term position in ADBE or as just a standard earnings play.Review the chart below:Going by the chart above, we are about to see a bullish trend in ADBE. Each step forward brings us closer to the price target of $182.50. The probability of the up gap in late October filling prior to February is almost zero.Analysts want to do their jobs well but still consistently underestimate ADBE's quarterly EPS reports. This quarter, they are giving ADBE a significantly higher estimate, at $0.96, but the bias toward underestimating ADBE persists. The company will still beat, reaching at least $1.15, a significant beat by any measure.This would give ADBE another ""all time high"" EPS, which should (theoretically) send the price to an all-time high. I say ""theoretically"" because - as we know - not all stocks react positively to a positive earnings surprise. However, ADBE is one of those few stocks that shows reliability in its post-earnings price movement direction.The average post-earnings move is 5%. Looking at a straddle can give us the prediction for the dollar-value move in ADBE:Here, we see that options are pricing in a $9 move for ADBE. We, of course, believe this movement will be in the upward direction and therefore can set our price target at $184.Here comes the interesting part, ADBE is one of those stocks who bounces back before and after January:Thus, we really should play and get out after earnings, sometime before January. So if you are to play ADBE for the long term, as I hinted at before, you might want to instead simply avoid January, buying back at the end of January for the rest of the year. Set a reminder.My EDIBTA/EV valuation and DCF valuation of ADBE both put the stock as overpriced at the moment, although that discrepancy is quickly closing as a result of stronger fundamentals and financials. Fundamentally, 2013 was the ideal time to buy, as the stock has become overpriced since then. Still, the earnings surprise is in our favor, and the fundamentals simply bolster the probability for strong future guidance, which can affect a stock as much as an earnings surprise.Even with the overpriced status (see if you can find a stock that's not overpriced at the moment!), ADBE looks good fundamentally. You can see that both the EBITDA/EV and DCF charts are trending upward, which makes selling ADBE silly, once you're long. Going with this idea, I checked the cognitive dissonance in ADBE with one of my newer algorithms to find that sentiment is biased in the long direction, essentially meaning that investors will be more likely to ignore bad news and overhype good news - both good aspects for a long earnings trade.Here's the chart for EBITDA/EV:We are too high in price to justify the EBITDA/EV - vice-versa, actually - but the most important aspect with this chart is the trend. The trend does justify the price. Even if EPS does not beat this quarter, EBITDA/EV will almost certainly continue rising, justifying the long position.Now for DCF:Falling fundamentals from 2010-2015 kept ADBE stagnant. Traders saw ADBE fixing itself in the balance sheets in 2014 and bought in before the fundamentals justified it, and this proved to be the right decision. Now, DCF is again on the rise, justifying the rising prices despite the DCF not being at the same levels as 2005-2010 era ADBE.Except for the actual value of DCF in my model, the other factors have performed well. Looking back, had you made purchase decisions based on the model's trend, you would have made a lot of money. You can dig into the actual metrics used in this model to understand why the trend is correct and why the individual values might not be so important.To do that, we need to look at free cash flow and growth rates. Starting with free cash flows, here are the raw values plotted against time:So we have free cash flows at an all-time high, but we don't want flukes to distort the model. Look at the smoothed free cash flows to get a better idea of the actual trend:Seeing the values smoothed via a rolling average gives a much more reliable idea of the trend. This model moves with the stock price and is the model used in the DCF trend. The other important metric, growth rate, is described in the chart below:Even without smoothing the values, we see a clear trend upward since 2015. For matching the data with reality, this makes complete sense. Even so, the optimal model will smooth the growth rates:Seeing the low but growing growth rates explains a lot. To ADBE, the fast tech growth phase is over and stagnation hit since 2000, actually. You can see the company struggling to catch its falling growth rate, eventually hitting off a turnaround in 2015, which is currently underway and should be positively reflected in earnings.These metrics have implications for the upcoming guidance, as cash implies more aggressive investments and CROIC growth implies higher forward EPS guidance. An earnings report and strong forward guidance should quickly raise the price target of ADBE, immediately sending ADBE to near all-time highs. As we currently have no resistance level above us, the $9 predicted movement upward is justified on many levels.Seeing as the main metric on our plate is EPS, not DCF or the others above, we should take a look at this trend. Notice the all-time high EPS values, which for the year should be really impressive as annual data:You can see how it's already impressive when you take the smoothed trend:Does this mean we are approaching peak ADBE? Who can tell? Looks like ADBE is going to be hitting all-time highs in the stock price going forward, which is really all we need to know.I also wanted to look at how EPS moves the stock. I really care about this, as if the EPS has no correlation to the stock price we are not playing an earnings beat game but a much more complex game. ADBE is easily played on earnings, however, as EPS tracks the stock almost perfectly when you factor in the upward cognitive dissonance bias (i.e., EPS pullbacks lead to price consolidation, not price pullbacks):Much like the earnings and revenue growth in other increasingly successful tech companies (e.g., Amazon), ADBE's is fueled by a transition to cloud-based products and services. These services allow for recurring revenue, as subscriptions are taken. Adobe's is called Creative Cloud and falls in a niche with few competitors.The revenue growth here is the main catalyst driving EPS to all-time highs. Analysts of tech stocks have consistently underestimated the reliable and almost exponential demand for cloud-based services. Companies in this area are beating on EPS left and right, and demand seems to continue its exponential growth rate if you extrapolate IoT device installations as your metric:ADBE, with its near-monopoly on high-ticket creative software, shows only growth. We have no reason to believe that ADBE has slowed down in revenue or margins in the last three months. Thus, the reliable phenomenon of actual EPS beating Wall Street estimates can again be relied upon to open a long position on ADBE before earnings.This time we are going to see ADBE return to near all-time highs. It's odd, however, that options on ADBE are not expensive at the moment; this is rare for a stock before earnings. Check the spread between implied volatility (green), on which option prices are based and statistical volatility (yellow), which is more representative of stock price movements:The lack of a spread here implies options are fairly price. That being the case, selling options makes no more sense than buying options; both options are justifiable and should be left to individual choice. But sold options give a negative vega, so options sellers will make money - all things being equal - as a result of the drop in implied volatility that comes with earnings; the opposite can be said of options buyers.You guys probably know by now that I'm a fan of credit spreads. In this earnings newsletter, you probably see more long options strategies than short; that's because I get requests from subscribers who only play long options. So, please keep in mind that I'm biased toward long options for this newsletter yet play short options just as much as long options in real life.As implied volatility and statistical volatility are even, I'm predisposed to going short with options for the negative vega value. The exception would be in the case where a stock seems to have no price target on earnings; long options allow you to keep your profits uncapped. If you look back to the ichimoku cloud chart, however, you'll see that ADBE has a pretty predictable trend and should hit $182.50, which is almost perfectly in line with the strangle price prediction of a $9 gain.Taking this info into account, you'll understand that short options makes more sense here. Expecting a certain price target, such as $182.50 can justify a short options position because you will know which put strike to choose for your specific risk tolerance. Alternatively, you could mimic me and simply go with the put option that maximizes vega and gamma, which is the at-the-money put, coupled with a protective put, $20 below:I like this strategy because it allows us to open the trade at negative theta. This gives us a head start in making a profit, as the option loses value the closer we get to the earnings report. In addition, we are likely to keep all of that credit because the at-the-money put (and any put within $9 of our current price) will be worthless at earnings day.The danger is if ADBE falls past $165. However, as the options market is pricing in a $9 move, I believe $165 is unlikely to be hit even on a bad earnings release. We will essentially be risk free if the straddle prediction was correct, which it usually is.If you don't like this strategy or feel it's too complicated, just buy the Dec $170 calls or buy the stock. The ADBE price prediction being correct would give you 200% gain on the Dec $170 calls. Otherwise, employ this strategy and earn on both vega (volatility) as well as delta, gamma, and theta. The meat of this newsletter is to explain which stocks will beat on earnings; the options education is secondary.That's it for now. Happy trading!Note: All unlabeled figures were created by me.

4132286,103480,2017-12-16T09:41:51-05:00,"Adobe reported Q4 earnings and closed out FY17 with quarterly revenues above $2 billion for the first time.The company grew 24% y/y and beat analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines.Adobe also raised its FY18 guidance from the preliminary view that it gave at an investor day in October. The company is projecting $8.725 billion in revenue, +20% y/y.The company has become a massive cash-generating operation with extremely sticky revenues across a broad portfolio of products.Adobe is very much a growth stock and it's not cheap, but its massive earnings expansion coupled with continued double-digit revenue growth will power outperformance in 2018.","There's a reason Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) is consistently trending toward all-time highs: the news coming out of the company keeps adding layer after layer of bullish fundamentals. Adobe, which finishes its fiscal year on December 1, just reported Q4 and FY17 earnings that, as always, blew the top off analyst expectations. Growth was strong across all of its product segments, and the company as a whole grew 24% y/y despite reaching a massive $2 billion quarterly revenue run rate. Though Adobe's suite of design-focused applications may seem obscure to some, it is now the eleventh-biggest software company, and nearly all of its revenue comes from recurring subscriptions with software gross margins above 90%.Adobe's combination of growth and profit expansion - along with elevated bullish forecasts for FY18 - make it a top pick for investors' technology portfolios in 2018. Adobe certainly isn't cheap - the stock is up 72% YTD (the earnings release, surprisingly, only added ~1% to the stock - though market reactions to tech earnings this quarter have overwhelmingly been negative, despite performance upside). At $177, the company trades at 32x FY18 pro forma EPS of $5.50 - though we do note, Adobe raised its top-line targets for FY18 without raising its EPS target - indicating that its EPS guidance might be conservative and have room for outperformance. Analysts, as reported by Yahoo Finance, are expecting $5.52.ADBE data by YChartsAdobe's earnings growth, however, is a huge justification for its valuation. With pro forma EPS expected at $5.50 for the following year, Adobe is forecasting EPS growth of 28% y/y over this year's pro forma EPS of $4.31. This year, pro forma EPS was up 43% y/y. It's also indicative to note that Adobe achieved a massive 420 bps of operating margin expansion (from 25.5% to 29.7%) in FY17, an impressive improvement for a company of its scale. As seen in the chart below, Adobe's earnings growth far outstrips any of its peers in large-cap enterprise software:ADBE Normalized Diluted EPS (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsWith Adobe's track record for earnings growth, it's fairly safe to say the company will achieve better than 28% EPS growth in FY18. If the company achieves better than 32% growth, its PEG ratio will be below 1.0x, a typical indicator of a value company.Adobe has already had an impressive run in 2017, so it would be wishful thinking to say that the company can jump another 70% (or even 50%) next year. With its transition to cloud subscriptions mostly complete and investors having already awarded Adobe for its successful pivot, the company can't really benefit from another sudden burst of enthusiasm. But while Adobe is unlikely to be a home run stock in 2018, it's highly likely to be a double or a triple - its top-line growth combined with earnings expansion will almost certainly help the company to outperform the broader markets in 2018. And with the cloud transition complete and expectations on Adobe's growth trajectory fairly moderate, Adobe is a safe stock to bet on for next year - not something you can usually get with high-growth software.Adobe's revenues in the quarter grew 25% y/y to $2.01 billion; as previously mentioned, this is the first time that Adobe's revenues have crossed the $2 billion mark. Analysts were expecting $1.96 billion (+22% y/y), making this quarter a three-point beat to the top line.Figure 1. Adobe Q4 earningsSource: Adobe investor relationsSubscription revenues - the most important piece of the ""new"" Adobe - grew a stunning 34% y/y to $1.70 billion, and now represents 85% of Adobe's revenue mix in the quarter. The prior year's Q4, it was 79% - though Adobe's cloud transition has been mostly complete in FY17, it's gradually filled in the gaps toward becoming as close to pure subscriptions as possible. In the full FY17, subscription revenues of $6.13 billion represented 84% of Adobe's revenue mix - up from 78% in FY16.Bears like to point out that Adobe trades at extremely high multiples of revenue - the company currently trades at ~9.5x FY18 revenues of $8.725 billion (based on Adobe's own forecast), one of the highest multiples in software.When considering the fact that Adobe's revenues are 85% recurring - meaning this is business it doesn't have to chase, and can reasonably rely upon to renew from month to month - as well as the fact that the company's 90.0% gross margin implies that nearly every dollar of incremental subscription revenue is pure profit - Adobe doesn't look that expensive at all. It's a high quality, premium business that trades at a premium valuation.ADBE EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsAdobe's Creative Cloud segment - the largest of its product portfolios, including the popular Adobe Photoshop application - reported a $4.63 billion ARR (annualized recurring revenue) at the end of Q4, up 312e's subscription contracts; revenue that's essentially ""locked in.""Document Cloud, a burgeoning Adobe product that directly competes with DocuSign (a $3 billion unicorn backed by Bain, ICONIQ, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and other big-name backers), reported ARR of $614 million, up 27% y/y in constant currency.Adobe is also bolstering its efforts in Digital Marketing, arm of the business that comprises of marketing software that positions Adobe as an enterprise software company as well as a consumer technology. Experience Cloud revenues grew 25% y/y to $2.03 billion. Given that these enterprise-facing revenues are only about a quarter of Adobe's business, the company still has plenty of room to grow its enterprise software arm. In an interview with CNBC, CEO Shantanu Narayen said:One could argue that Adobe is fairly saturated in consumer software like Photoshop and Illustrator - but Adobe's continued push into marketing software and marketing data analytics greatly expand its addressable market and can provide its next leg of growth.Adobe's refreshed guidance, which includes a $25 million boost to the top line from the version it released in October, calls for 20% y/y growth. As previously mentioned, EPS targets remained constant, pointing to upside possibility assuming Adobe can continue to maintain or expand its margins.Figure 2. Adobe FY18 guidanceSource: Adobe investor relationsEqually worth mentioning alongside top-line growth is the fact that Adobe's ability to grow its earnings eclipses almost every other company in the software sector. The earnings tables below, taken from Adobe's year-end release, attest to the company's sheer growth in profitability and margins in a short span of time:Figure 3. Adobe operating and net incomeAdobe's GAAP operating income in the quarter jumped 38% y/y to $649.3 million. This represents a massive 32% operating margin, three points better than 29% in 3Q16. Scale truly begets scale, and as Adobe reaches for a $10 billion run rate, its operating margin will continue to improve.GAAP earnings in the quarter were $501.5 million ($1.00 per share), up 26% y/y. Adjusting for stock-comp and one-time items, the company generated pro forma net income of $629.9 million, up 39% y/y. Pro forma EPS of $1.26 in the quarter represented a 9% beat to consensus expectations of $1.16.Due to the fact that Adobe's subscription model provides cash billings that aren't recognized as revenue and earnings (instead piled into deferred revenue backlog), the company's cash earnings are even higher than its net income figures. Adobe generated $833 million of operating cash flow in Q4, and netting out $38 million of capex, it generated $795 million of free cash flow.The fact that cash flow tracks much higher than net income suggests that it might be the better yardstick for valuation. Adobe generated $2.91 billion in OCF for the full FY17, nearly double its GAAP net income. Assuming it can continue to grow OCF at 40% y/y and achieve $4.07 billion in FY18 OCF, Adobe is currently trading at a reasonable 21x EV/FY18 OCF - a much more digestible multiple than its P/E.Adobe has amassed a devout collection of fans, both among its customer base and on Wall Street. Its Q4 earnings capped off an extremely strong year in which Adobe continued to convert the remainder of its revenue base into subscriptions, and managed to grow 25% y/y despite hitting an $8 billion run rate.There are now very few software companies that have attained Adobe's scale, and fewer still that have its 85% subscription mix and 90% gross margins - metrics that the rest of the industry envy. With multiple product lines each carrying large TAMs (total addressable markets), Adobe's story looks very similar to Salesforce's (NYSE: CRM) - a dominant software giant occupying leadership positions in several software markets, though much more profitable than Salesforce. The stock certainly isn't cheap, but given Adobe's growth trajectory and earnings expansion, the premium that investors are paying is certainly well-earned.Adobe should be able to hit $200 in 2018, representing ~11x EV/FY18 revenues and 23x EV/FY18 OCF, especially given that it has a history exceeding its expectations and revising its guidance upward."

Both earnings and revenue are expected to show solid year-over-year growth, which makes guidance important and this includes artificial intelligence initiatives.In my opinion, daily and weekly charts show the Summation of all past bullish and bearish reactions to fundamental data and provide road maps for what the volatility might look like going into and in reaction to earnings results.The daily chart for Adobe SystemsCourtesy of MetaStock XenithThe daily chart for Adobe shows that the stock is above 'golden cross'. The chart does not show that this bullish moving average crossover occurred more than five years and tracks the stock higher from below $30 a share to where it is today. A 'golden cross' occurs when the 50-day simple moving average rises above the 200-day simple moving average indicating that higher prices lie ahead. Note how the stock has been climbing its 50-day simple moving average over the past 52 weeks. Not shown is the last time that the 200-day simple moving average had been tested. That day was Dec. 2, 2016 when the average was $98.65.The weekly chart for Adobe SystemsCourtesy of MetaStock XenithThe weekly chart for Adobe is neutral with the stock below its five-week modified moving average of $174.13, and well above its 200-week simple moving average, also known as the 'reversion to the mean' now at $98.07. This key average was last tested at $30.00 during the week of July 20, 2012. The 12x3x3 weekly slow stochastic reading is projected to fall to 84.11 this week down from 89.24 on Dec. 8, still above its overbought threshold of 80.00. Note that when the stock set its all-time intraday high of $186.27 on Nov. 28, this momentum reading was above 90.00, making the stock in a pattern I call an 'inflating parabolic bubble'.Given this chart and analysis, my trading strategy is to buy weakness to my quarterly and semiannual value levels of $154.44 and $152.93, respectively, and reduce holdings on strength to my monthly and weekly risky levels of $182.31 and $203.93, respectively."

And for a change, this time the stock is going into earnings day weak, off 7% from a late November all-time peak.Is this a good time to buy the stock following the modest dip?Credit: AdobeWith Adobe's revenues being nearly 90% recurring and given management's very specific guidance of $1.95 billion, I find it unlikely that the company will disappoint on the top line this week. Considering Adobe's prior 10 quarter history of at least meeting revenue expectations, I find it plausible that sales could come in about $10 million above guidance (see table below for my P&L projections).Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsI will be curious to see whether gross margins recover from last quarter's YOY dip of 43 bps (see chart below). Intuitively, I expect to see profitability move up as the company continues to gain scale, possibly offset but only partially by pricing softness as competition tightens. In my assumptions, I conservatively project a 50-bp dip in gross margin that would be more pronounced than last quarter's decrease. On the opex side, I trust that management will continue to keep costs under check as they have been doing lately. If opex as a percentage of revenues stays just short of 47% as I predict, I would not be surprised to see non-GAAP EPS of $1.20 beat consensus by about four cents.ADBE Gross Profit Margin (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsAlthough last quarter shares traded down following fiscal 4Q17 guidance that failed to inspire, I believe the phenomenon is unlikely to repeat this time around. Adobe just released its fiscal 2018 outlook in October, and I find it improbable that management's views for the next four quarters would have changed for the worse over such a short period of time. Without significant outlook risk and with earnings expectations set conservatively, in my view, I find it most likely that Adobe will deliver a solid quarter this Thursday.High-single digit share price dips don't happen very often with this high-quality name. Today's downgrade of the stock by JPMorgan on the back of valuation, which speaks little to the fundamentals of the software company, is likely to pressure the stock further and will widen the window of opportunity for someone looking to buy ADBE today.ADBE PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe stock is certainly not a bargain (see chart above), with forward P/E of 31.3x significantly higher than last year's 25.0x and PEG of 1.4x also richer than the comparable 1.2x of late 2016. But given the quality of the company, the recurring revenue model, the high margins (increasing, in the case of op margins) and the recent stock price dip, I think this is as attractive an entry point as a new investor will get on ADBE."
4114961,103480,2017-10-20T04:34:44-04:00,"Adobe released its preliminary FY18 guidance in its annual analyst day, pointing to $8.7 billion in revenue and 20% y/y revenue growth, beating consensus expectations of $8.68 billion.Its pro forma EPS forecast of $5.50 also represents a resounding beat over analyst consensus of $5.21.Shares rallied >10% after the announcement, reversing weakness seen immediately after its Q3 release in early October.Adobe remains a fantastic long term investment, with its slight valuation premium more than compensated by its stellar growth on the top and bottom lines.Each of its product lines continues to grow in double-digits, and management has indicated it believes its TAM to expand to $87 billion by 2020.","Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) investors have something new to cheer: fresh, fantastic FY18 forecasts. Adobe is now several years into its cloud transformation, and the bearish camp was worried about saturation in its core products. Adobe's guidance, however, debunks those concerns, with each of its product lines expected to grow in the double-digits in 2018 and overall revenues expected to increase 20% y/y.As I wrote in my previous article, Adobe's Q3 print was met with little fanfare. Despite beating analyst consensus on both the top and bottom lines, shares were knocked off course and had been under pressure. Investors who saw the Q3 dip as a buying opportunity were richly rewarded when Adobe's FY18 guidance sent shares up double digits:ADBE data by YChartsDespite the stock's vigorous run, I believe Adobe remains well positioned for further outperformance. Momentum is strong on the stock, and it's well supported by fundamentals as well. At $171, the company trades at ~30x its adjusted EPS guidance for FY18, which should be seen as a discount when comparing its earnings growth potential.Recall that Adobe's GAAP EPS grew a stunning 55% in Q3 (and in the year 2017 to date, EPS has grown 56%), and this continued earnings expansion - driven by both top-line growth and increased operating leverage - is fully expected to remain on track in FY18. With this outstanding growth in mind, it's the PEG ratio that is the most apt yardstick for Adobe's stock - and a 30x P/E coupled with ~50% growth implies a PEG ratio far below 1.0x, a classic indicator of an undervalued growth stock.Let's take a moment to draw a parallel to Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM), which is considered the first company to deploy a subscription-only software sales model and is also considered the first true cloud/SaaS company. In less than two decades since its founding, it has grown to a multi-billion dollar company, valued now at $70 billion.Part of the reason underpinning Salesforce's success is that it's built on top of several disparate product lines, all of which are sustaining growth. Salesforce is best known for its Sales Cloud app - just as Adobe is best known for its Photoshop app - and both companies have been able to extend the powerful branding of their core applications into a variety of related products and services. The core businesses might be slowing down, but they are still growing at modest rates - while newer applications and initiatives support the company's top-line growth.All of this growth is built on top of recurring subscriptions, which have high 80%+ gross margins, setting up the stage for incredible profitability.Adobe, like Salesforce, is experiencing tremendous growth in all of its product lines, including sustained growth in its core Creative Cloud products (which includes Photoshop). See its preliminary guidance below:Figure 1. Adobe preliminary FY18 guidanceAdobe's Experience Cloud - its secondary product segment which includes is marketing and adtech offerings - is expected to support the company with 15% y/y growth. Digital Media, its largest segment which comprises of its Creative Cloud product suite as well as newer initiatives like its Document Cloud (a competitor to Docusign), is still expected to lead the growth charge with 23% y/y growth.Despite the maturity of Adobe's products - applications like Adobe Acrobat and Photoshop have certainly been around for a long time - Adobe is still finding success in converting its existing customers to a subscription model, as well as finding new subscribers through the appeal of lower upfront costs. No-commitment subscriptions, after all, are much more enticing to a new buyer who wants to try out the software, as opposed to a large upfront perpetual license cost for a product you might not end up liking or using.The company also affirmed its Q4 guidance of $1.95 billion revenue and $0.86 GAAP EPS, setting up the company to achieve $7.14 billion in revenue and $3.27 in GAAP EPS for FY17.Adobe also unveiled key metrics across its product lines at its analyst conference. The slide below, taken from Adobe's analyst day deck, snapshots key metrics in its core Creative Cloud business:Figure 2. Creative Cloud highlightsA doubling of Creative Cloud ARR, as well as strong growth in new subscribers who have never before touched Adobe products, indicates that Creative Cloud still has ample room for upside. The company is also releasing updates to its flagship products. Continued updates keep Adobe's subscriber base engaged and empower subscription retention.Adobe believes Creative Cloud's TAM (total addressable market) to be $24.2 billion by 2020, indicating that the company has barely yet cracked a quarter of its potential.Adobe's Document Cloud initiative - encompassing Adobe Sign, which becomes increasingly relevant as paper-laden processes are shifting over to digitization - is also another important growth anchor, and Adobe estimates its 2020 TAM to be $5.3 billion. 33% of its subscribers are completely new to the Adobe franchise, indicating Adobe's ability to use its brand presence to draw users in and spark possible cross-sales into its other Clouds.Experience Cloud - which is partially built on acquisitions such as Adobe's $540 million acquisition of ad tech platform TubeMogul - is expected to contribute the lion's share of 2020 TAM at $51.5 billion (of which ~$30 billion is attributed to marketing software), more than half of Adobe's estimated total TAM of $87 billion. See the Experience Cloud TAM breakdown, taken from Adobe's analyst day deck, below:Figure 3. Experience Cloud TAM breakdownAdobe's 15% y/y growth projection for Experience Cloud may be overly conservative and leave room for upside, given the variety of products in this segment and the mammoth TAM it addresses. Experience Cloud has grown at a 20% CAGR from 2015-2018; a drop to 15% in FY18 would imply a marked deceleration and is probably unlikely.The chart below offers a succinct visual capstone of Adobe's earnings momentum:Figure 4. Adobe growth trajectoryIn each year (in fact, every quarter), Adobe has been able to steadily march up its operating margins, squeezing more and more profits out of a growing revenue base. With its FY18 top-line guidance pointing to a secure 20% growth rate, Adobe's earnings potential is incredible.Adobe is an old-school technology company, but it's also one that refuses to be left in the dust. Rather than resist the cloud era (a decision several software peers have come to regret), Adobe has fully embraced the subscription model, and it expects nearly 100% of its Creative Cloud revenues to be subscription-based.The rally in Adobe's stock is not yet overdone, there's still plenty of gains to be had."
4108864,24084,2017-09-22T14:26:40-04:00,Adobe began a digital transformation journey several years ago which led to several years of disappointing results.The last two fiscal year results have been stellar as have the first three quarters of 2017.The benefits of this effort are ready to be leveraged to benefit investors in the future providing a useful road map when evaluating companies starting or still in the transformation process.,"Adobe (ADBE) continued to deliver operating results that beat expectations this week. Quarterly revenue of $1.84 billion grew 26% beating consensus expectations by $20 million. Adjusted earnings per share grew 47% to $1.10 exceeding expectations by 9%. GAAP earnings per share grew 56% to $0.84 also outpacing street expectations. The results were met with a yawn by the market which was focused on the Fed. This performance is now expected as evidence by the string of quarters having similar upside surprises. Guidance was increased, also nothing new, and some fundamental analysis shows this is likely far from over. That’s the power of digital transformation in the cloud. This article will attempt to provide some insights into this journey at Adobe and how they are situated for the future. Understanding the Adobe road may ultimately be useful when considering investments in companies yet to emerge from the process.The pain of transforming Adobe was real and prolonged from 2009 through 2014, though arguably the bottom was 2013. Adobe Selected Fiscal Data 2008 to 2014Note 1) Revenues include acquired companies making any growth nonorganic.Note 2) GAAP earnings include expenses for restructuring, stock based compensation and amortization of purchased intangibles.Note 3) FCF (Free Cash Flow) represents operating cash flow less capital acquisition expenditures. It does not include the impact of acquisitions, net of cash or any proceeds from asset sales.Note 4) Subs mix is subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenues for each period.Note 5) Def Rev is the total of current and long term deferred revenues per company SEC filings.The revenue CAGR from 2008 to 2014 was around 2%. Adobe began the transformation process in 2011, but didn’t appear fully committed to it until May 2012 when they launched their Creative Cloud. They also refined their Digital Marketing vision and approach in October 2012 providing further evidence the transformation was being embraced and extended. The Adobe Creative and Marketing Clouds were now in place and ready to rock and roll. Yet financially the performance was almost invisible. Revenues declined in 2013 and were flat in 2014. But those paying attention to financial metrics noted the jump in subs mix from 15% to 50%. How did that happen without revenue growth? The growth in subscriptions brings a disproportionate decline in licensing revenue until scale is achieved. Note also that deferred revenue doubled from $0.6 billion to $1.2b in those same two years. The trend was set and future performance was predictable.       The product launches were essential but the organization and reporting structures still needed work requiring another reorganization in 2014. The restructuring included a revamp of their segment reporting which finally aligned their people, priorities and external reporting. That year the 10K restructuring disclosure stated:“During the past several years, we have initiated various restructuring plans. Currently, the Fiscal 2014 Restructuring Plan is the only plan of significance to us as we consider our restructuring plans initiated in prior years to be substantially complete.” During 2015 Adobe customer traction was gaining momentum, which led to the launch of their Document Cloud. Results in fiscal 2015 and 2016 showed marked improvement. This transition midpoint led to better revenue visibility which in turn lead to better guidance and more consistent results. The power of recurring subscription revenues under contract allows better resource allocation decisions and predictability.Adobe Selected Quarterly Data 2015Adobe Selected Quarterly Data 2016Note 1) The subs mix FY 2016 YY is the revenue growth for sub revenues.Adobe Selected Quarterly Data 2017 SummaryAdobe has undertaken a significant transformation of their business including people, systems, products, brands, organization and reporting structures. The process began several years ago and while there are likely many additional internal steps ongoing, the view from the outside world shows a reborn company. Customers have migrated to a digital world signing long-term annuity agreements to replace up front licensing. A majority of revenue is now recurring providing visibility and consistency, allowing more precise resource allocation. The growth in deferred revenue shows the probability of continued revenue growth which will accelerate with new initiatives such as the marketing collaboration with Microsoft (MSFT) and the launch of the new Experience Cloud, bringing analytics and advertising to their three other clouds. The new Adobe is not only transformed well ahead of their peers but positioned to take advantage of market opportunities still emerging in the cloud. What is also interesting to investors is the ability to use traditional valuation techniques. The current enterprise value is approximately $70 billion representing approximately 10.1 times trailing twelve month revenues. That multiple is at a premium to Salesforce (CRM) which has a 7.3 time multiple but a discount to the Workday (WDAY) multiple of 10.8 times. Salesforce and Workday don't have sufficient profits yet to value on an earnings basis. Adobe having completed the transition is generating substantial profits again. They have a trailing PE multiple of 37 times using Non-GAAP earnings and 47 times GAAP earnings. It's nice to see earnings matter again and to have some validation that nontraditional valuation methods won't last forever in the cloud. Now you just have to decide how much earnings that are growing at 40% to 50% are worth."
4108374,103480,2017-09-20T15:11:42-04:00,"Adobe reported solid top and bottom line beats in Q3 and raised its full-year guidance. Revenues grew 26% y/y and the company's transition to a subscription model remains on track.Revenue and pro forma EPS of $1.84 billion and $1.10, respectively, topped analyst consensus of $1.82 billion and $1.05.Nevertheless, the stock fell 3% in after hours trading, giving up some of its gains this year.","This seems to be a recurring theme in the software sector this quarter: good just isn't good enough. A slew of cloud companies have reported earnings this quarter that beat analyst consensus, yet still suffered a sell-off. Box (NASDAQ: BOX), Cloudera (NYSE: CLDR), and Mulesoft (NASDAQ: MULE) are some good examples of companies whose stocks have underperformed right after an outperformance in earnings. And now, we add Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) to that unfortunate category. Despite its earnings beat, the stock erased some $2 billion in market value.Is this an indicator that valuations have reached a straining point? Is a multiple contraction waiting in the wings, as the Nasdaq tests new all-time highs? These are the billion-dollar questions that are difficult to answer, but perhaps Adobe's puzzling stumble is a hint that tech stocks are about to see a correction.This article will recap Adobe's 3Q performance and offer key takeaways for investors. On a valuation basis, the after-market selloff puts Adobe at a valuation of 9x EV/FTM revenues and 37x forward P/E based on consensus FY17 EPS of $4.06. By no means are these multiples cheap (and perhaps that's why the stock is retreating, as investors capitalize on an opportunity for profit-taking), and Adobe has indeed already risen nearly 50% YTD, but a good earnings quarter should not herald a downturn in stock performance.Recall that Adobe is growing earnings at a much faster clip than peers, and I continue to believe that its PEG ratio of <1 signals a value element in the stock, as I noted in my prior article. If shares continue to show weakness, now wouldn't be a bad opportunity to build a position in Adobe to take advantage of the current near-term confusion.Adobe revenues grew 26% y/y in Q3 to achieve record revenue of $1.84 billion, above analyst consensus of $1.82 billion. Note that this revenue growth represents barely any deceleration from last quarter's 27% growth, a truly tremendous feat for a company at an annual run rate that's now above $7 billion.Another important metric that analysts watch closely in Adobe's results: subscription billings were 85% of the Q3 revenue mix, up from 80% in 3Q16 and 84% in 2Q17. With the subscription mix tilting favorably on both a year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis, we can be confident that Adobe's subscription transition isn't slowing down.In terms of product mix, another encouraging sign is continued growth in Creative Cloud, Adobe's flagship product suite which includes Photoshop and Acrobat. Creative Cloud revenues grew 33% to $1.06 billion, an impressive growth figure for a product with a >$4 billion run rate. Tying this piece of the results with a corollary: one of the main concerns supporting the bearish narrative against Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM) is the maturation and growth slowdown of its core product, Sales Cloud (which is now growing ~20-21%), while at a similar run rate to Adobe's Creative Cloud. With Adobe, however, we see no signs of slowdown in its core product. Creative Cloud continues to sport a massive growth engine, fueling the company's cash flows while it continues to build out its other product lines.The below chart, taken from Adobe's press release, shows the company's quarterly revenue performance since 2015 and its segment mix between its three main application lines:Total annualized recurring revenue (ARR) for the entire Digital Media segment (which consists primarily of Creative Cloud plus a few smaller applications) grew to $4.87 billion exiting Q3, up 12% ($308 million) from 2Q17. Adobe continues to build its massive subscription base, and this ARR indicates that Adobe has a ""starting point"" of ~$5 billion the next 12 months - a huge improvement for a software company that used to start every quarter's revenue base from scratch.Deferred revenue balances grew $130 million in the quarter, up 6% from the prior quarter, and indicating calculated billings of $1.97 billion for the third quarter. Adobe's revenue pipeline continues to grow as it books more deals into the next 12-month time frame.While top-line results are plenty impressive on their own, profitability metrics in the third quarter also stand out. Adobe generated GAAP EPS of $0.85 and pro forma EPS of $1.10 (primarily adding back stock-based comp), beating PF EPS consensus of $1.05.Net income grew 55% from the prior year, and GAAP EPS grew 57% (from $0.54 in 3Q16 to $0.84 in 3Q17). When considering how much earnings growth power Adobe packs, it's understandable to see why shares trade at an elevated P/E multiple.The word growth is used many times in this article, and that's because Adobe's Q3 shows stellar growth across all metrics: revenue, billings, ARR, cash flow, and profits. There's no hint whatsoever from the company's Q3 print that growth will be slowing down any time soon, especially when revenue and profit growth is barely decelerating on a quarter-over-quarter basis.Adobe's stock has rallied ~50% this year (see chart below), reaching an all-time high of $157 right before the earnings post, so it's understandable that the stock needed time for a breather.ADBE data by YChartsHowever, when the traders have locked in their gains and heavy volume settles down on Adobe shares, it's a good time to pick up Adobe at a discount. At the post-market close of $151.50, Adobe trades at:While none of these valuation metrics are cheap, Adobe's growth at scale merits its premium valuation. In particular, Adobe's PEG ratio of 0.67x indicates the stock is actually undervalued relative to its earnings growth power.Adobe's suite of products are inherently baked into the daily routines of its users, forming an incredibly loyal and reliable base of subscriptions. With the subscription mix now at 85% of the business and all product lines growing at phenomenal rates, Adobe is a fairly safe long-term bet despite premium valuations, and the post-Q3 selloff actually presents a rare window to buy shares at a bit of a discount."

Can it do so again this month?In this article, I present my projections for the company's fiscal 3Q17.Trading at a PEG of 1.9x, I continue to find Adobe a potential GARP play worth investigating further.","Can Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) deliver yet another beat this month?It has become a recurring theme. Since fiscal 1Q14, the San Jose-based company has exceeded the Street's quarterly earnings projections 13 times in a row. This time, consensus expectations for fiscal 3Q17 is set at $1.82 billion for revenues, representing a +25% YOY increase that would be the second-best quarterly growth rate since at least 2014. For EPS, analysts are banking on $1.01, an encouraging +35% higher than year-ago levels that is nearly double the long-term earnings growth rate that the Street expects to see going forward.(Credit: Adobe)For the expectations to be at least met, Adobe will first need to show continued momentum in subscription-based revenues, up +37% last quarter in an accelerating growth trajectory, particularly on the digital media side. Since a sizable 83% of the company's revenues are recurring (YTD, fiscal 2017), management's guidance of $1.815 billion in sales should be predictable and achievable.Below the top line, I believe the company's scale should help it expand margins further. Last quarter, gross margins improved by 100 bps, and I project this quarter's to come in 50 bps above year-ago levels (which, in turn, had been nearly 2% better YOY). I estimate that each percentage point of improvement in gross margins would translate into a penny upside in EPS.Further bottom line tailwind could also come from more contained operating costs. Opex had increased at only +14% on a GAAP basis in fiscal 3Q16 but +21% last quarter. Conservatively assuming no sequential improvement in the opex growth rate and using management's guidance for other expenses and non-GAAP tax rate, I estimate that the Street's consensus could be met, as illustrated below.(Source: D.M. Martins Research estimates and historical data from press release)When a stock is up nearly +60% on a 52-week basis, that usually gives me reason to pause and turn cautious. In terms of market value appreciation, ADBE has left the broad market and most within its peer group in the dust over the past year. As the chart below suggests, that jump came on the back of significant earnings multiple expansion: the current forward P/E of 38.5x is much higher than January's 26x and a few turns above last September's 33x.ADBE PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsIt seems to me, however, that the share price run has been largely justified. First, the broad market has seen trailing P/E expand slightly over the past 12 months, with prominent tech names like Alphabet and Microsoft leading the charge. But most importantly, Adobe's management team seems to be doing all the right things to ensure that the company capitalizes on the highly favorable macro trends in the digital media and digital marketing spaces. When factoring in EPS growth in the valuation analysis, ADBE's PEG of 1.9x seems a bit more reasonable, an inch below the peer group's median multiple. Not too bad.I continue to find ADBE a potential GARP (growth at reasonable price) play worth investigating further, even if the optimism that I displayed about owning the (less richly valued) stock back in June is not as pronounced today.Note from the author: If you have enjoyed this article and would like to receive real-time alerts on future ones, please follow D.M.

Adobe has had a strong run this year. Its stock has climbed more than 50% since the start of the year. But analysts suspect that it may be time for a slowdown. After the recent results, the stock fell because its forecast was in line but not higher than market expectations.Adobe's third-quarter revenues grew 26% over the year to $1.84 billion, ahead of the market's projections of $1.82 billion. EPS of $1.10 also was ahead of the Street's estimated $1.01 per share for the quarter.By segment, revenues from subscription services grew 34% over the year to $1.57 billion. Product revenues fell 13% to $159 million and Services and Support revenues declined 2% to $111.8 million.During the quarter, revenues from Adobe's digital media business, which includes Creative Cloud, increased 28.3% percent to $1.27 billion, ahead of the Street's estimates of $1.25 billion. Among other metrics, Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue grew to $4.87 billion exiting the quarter. Adobe Experience Cloud recorded revenue of $508 million, accounting for a 26% growth over the year.For the current quarter, Adobe expects revenue of $1.95 billion, in line with market expectations. It forecast an EPS of $1.15 for the quarter, which was ahead of the market expectations of $1.10.Adobe continued to expand its offerings through partnerships and new product upgrades. Earlier this quarter, it announced the expansion of its strategic tie-up with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Together, the companies will build solutions to help organizations improve their customer experience by leveraging the capabilities of Adobe Experience Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft Dynamics.The alliance will help improve workforce productivity and drive more efficient business processes. For instance, Adobe Sign will now become Microsoft's preferred e-signature solution across the company's portfolio. Similarly, the new chat-based workspace in Microsoft Office 365 will now become the preferred collaboration service for Adobe Creative Cloud, Document Cloud, and Experience Cloud. Additionally, Adobe also will make Microsoft Azure its preferred cloud platform for Adobe Sign.Among product upgrades, Adobe recently released new email innovations for brand marketing management. It is integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities in the service through Adobe Sensei. Sensei now powers Adobe Campaign's predictive capabilities and helps predict the best images for emails and predict customer churn. The improved capabilities also include a dynamic reporting capability that presents actionable and visualized data in real time to improve reaction time. It is also helping marketers scale their campaigns across the globe with an integration between Adobe Campaign and Adobe Experience Manager so that email marketers can now an author and translate emails directly.Finally, Adobe is growing its market reach by offering its services in web-connected vehicles. Recently, it announced plans to provide new auto-focused analytics, personalization, and advertising capacities for Adobe Experience Cloud. It is allowing marketers to use Sensei, analytics, and market capacities to assess data from web-connected vehicles so that marketers can personalize audio as well as in-car screen ads based on behavioral patterns of car drivers.This is an interesting move for Adobe as it extends its reach to a new market and will open up additional opportunities for the company. Marketers will be able to carry highly specific location-based promotions and deliver targeted messages based on the location of the vehicle.Its stock is currently trading at $156.60 with a market capitalization of $77.3 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $157.89 earlier this week. It has been growing steadily from the 52-week low of $98.00 it had fallen to in November last year."
4109323,98236,2017-09-25T17:05:00-04:00,Adobe reported the results of its fiscal Q3 about a week ago.Results were another beat in terms of both revenues and earnings.The company indicated that bookings of its Experience Cloud had not achieved planned levels.The company did not raise the outlook for its fiscal Q4.The shares have pulled back about 5% since the earnings release and are providing investors with a decent entry point.,"I have written on Adobe (ADBE) a couple of times in the past, but not very recently. It has been hard for me to find something unique and read-worthy that hasn’t been said earlier. The only significant question for investors in evaluating Adobe has been what level or valuation might be a good entry point. That is the kind of debate that doesn’t allow one much scope for making insightful comments.Last week, Adobe announced the results of its fiscal Q3. The results themselves were exemplary. But the company indicated that it had missed its booking target for a business segment called Experience Cloud. Some observers were upset by this. I have read one article on this site downgrading the shares.I take an exact opposite viewpoint-the share price pullback, albeit modest, affords investors a better entry point than has most recently been the case. At this point, everyone who is interested in such things knows that the company missed its bookings expectations in its digital marketing segment-experience cloud. On the other hand, Adobe certainly had an exceptional quarter in its digital media segment. Since the digital media segment is twice the size of the digital marketing business, at the least, the results for the quarter were actually better than might have been expected prior to the earnings release.I have never heard that it was helpful to investors to tell them what they already knew. I do think it might be helpful to suggest to investors that the focus on what appears to have been soft bookings in experience cloud is way off base. Adobe is one of the strongest of the large-cap names in the IT space these days, and the fact that it has had one quarter of one business component below its bookings target should be construed by investors as not some sign of weakness but merely that this company, like almost all companies, has ebbs and flows in its business. If investors want a large cap IT growth company that is on a bit of a sale-here is your opportunity.The company has been an unstoppable machine both operationally and in terms of its share price for the last year or so, at least until this latest earnings release with a year-to-date appreciation of more than 45%-even after the recent sell-off. It is probably that record that made the shares a bit vulnerable-Adobe was construed to be a perfect company-but there are no such things.I think one thing to remember in considering the performance of this company is that growth, even with s Q4 forecast that wasn’t raised, has been able to reaccelerate growth this past year. One does not often see that in a company of the scale of this one. There are simply not that many companies that are generating more than $8 billion in annual revenues that can sustain growth consistently greater than 20%. This company is more likely than not to be one of those that can pull off that trick.I sometimes like to look back over the course of the year and see how a company has done with regards to achieving its annual objectives. At the start of the company’s fiscal year it had forecast that it would achieve revenues of $6.95 billion. It is now forecasting that revenues will be a bit above $7.25 billion. That has had a salutary effect on EPS which initially was forecast to reach $3.75 and is now forecast to reach almost $4.25. When analysts look at what was said to be a disappointing bookings, it is well to consider the context.Conference calls can be dreary affairs. The first three analysts on this call decided to focus their attention on what were said to be disappointing bookings in a specific sector of Adobe’s operations. There are many smart and able analysts who get paid to keep track of the performance of specific business lines of larger and even smaller companies on a quarterly basis. Once upon a time, I did some of the same things myself. Looking back on that phase of my career, it is my contention that doing so often stands in the way of making an appropriate investment recommendation.In particular, for those interested in such things, the Adobe Experience Manager had light bookings during the quarter. Experience Cloud is smaller than the part of Adobe most widely known, its Creative Cloud, but a significant growth driver, nonetheless. For those unfamiliar with the solution, this set of products is basically a content management suite that is designed to help users provide content on their web sites and mobile apps. This product area is part of the Adobe Digital Marketing operation which represented about 28% of total revenues last quarter-significant, no doubt, but hardly dispositive, short of an apocalyptic event.Management said that it was taking longer than heretofore to close larger deals in the segment and hence the growth slowdown. It is forecasting that bookings growth will strengthen because of seasonality this quarter and the company remains very focused on sales execution. There is really no reason to doubt management-its track record in terms of delivering on its forecast overall has been as good as anyone else in the business. As Adobe and its segments get larger, and deal size gets larger as well, it is not surprising that it will experience a bit more lumpiness in the performance of some segments. That is less likely to be true within the context of the company’s largest single business, Creative Cloud, that still sells loads of subscriptions for $32/month.While experience cloud includes several different solutions, many observers tend to classify the major revenue driver as the company’s Web Content Management offering. The Web Content Management space includes several major competitors including Oracle (ORCL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM). Adobe, as has been the case for some time now, remains the solid leader in the space. Simply put, the folks at Gartner love the functionality that Adobe brings to users looking for a solution in this space. According to Gartner, “Adobe’s market understanding and product vision have consistently inspired WCM (web content management) customers and prospects; making what might otherwise have seemed mundane and tactical into a vehicle for business transformation and nurturing the relations of its customers with their target audiences. Adobe has effectively raised the expectations and aspirations for customers, compelling its competitors to follow."" The report was issued less than 2 months ago and is as “gushy” as anything I have ever seen from Gartner. But the point is, the Adobe product in question is the best in class. It has been so for years now and its positioning has only gotten stronger. The fact that it didn’t close a handful of transactions in a particular quarter in one segment of its business means nothing with regards to its ability to execute and the overall growth potential of the space. Focusing on a particular product in a particular quarter is not really an effective way to make an investment decision on a company as large as Adobe with tentacles in so many different areas. I will discuss some further salient elements with regards to the outlook for the Experience Cloud a bit later in this article.Adobe’s guidance for this current quarter, fiscal Q4 is for revenues of $1.95 billion. That forecast yields top-line growth of 21.4% and sequential growth of 6%, an unusually low level for a Q3-Q4 progression, especially one that includes the end of the Federal government fiscal year. The forecast is for a noticeable slowdown from growth in prior periods, even including this last reported quarter. Management suggested that the growth slowdown is a function of the strong level of perpetual license revenues that were achieved the prior year. That said, I am a bit more concerned about the modest level of sequential growth forecast by the company, especially one like this that nowadays has a very high subscription revenue content in its revenue mix.The company will see some minor compression in top line percentage growth with the one-year anniversary of the acquisition of TubeMogul in December. That said, the company is seeing significant organic growth of its advertising cloud that was launched about 6 months ago.On the other hand, essentially all of the analysts who cover the name have raised their EPS estimates for both this current quarter, i.e. the balance of this fiscal year and for fiscal 2018 in line with company guidance. Expected EPS growth for this current quarter is projected to be at 29% and EPS growth next year is expected to grow by 24%. As the company has beaten its quarterly targets every quarter for a long time now, and did so again this last quarter, it would seem most likely to expect that trend to continue. Yes, Q4 guidance was said to be only “in-line.” But the fact is that it was in line with a number that had been raised consistently during the year and which was impacted by some specific one-time events. Rather than focusing on one business segment in one quarter, I think it makes more sense to handicap the growth potential for this company in the coming fiscal year. The company has an analyst meeting scheduled next month during which it will outline some of the initiatives that will accelerate growth. Some of these were foreshadowed to one degree or the other during this latest conference call. But it is hard, when viewed holistically, to evaluate the outlook for Q4 as even anything as significant as a speed bump.Adobe often uses the metric, Annual Recurring Revenue to measure its performance. I will use that as well and it does provide the most transparency in terms of how the company is actually doing in building its revenues. It is the metric least susceptible to misinterpretation or to special influences that are… well, not recurring.At this point, Adobe has three reportable business segments. By far, the most important of these is what the company calls Digital Media which accounts for more than two-thirds of total revenues. Within Digital Media is Creative Cloud, the part of the business most familiar to readers with millions of subscribers. At this point, Digital Media has reached almost $5 billion a year of annualized revenues and that number has seen strong increases quarter after quarter. It is hard to believe, but Creative Cloud revenues grew by 33% last quarter. In Q2, the Creative Cloud had 34% growth and crossed the $1 billion rate of quarterly revenues. It is those numbers that should be the focus of investors.Adobe’s second major product family is Digital Marketing-which as mentioned earlier, includes Experience Cloud. Experience Cloud includes many bits and pieces including such offerings as Marketing Cloud, Analytics Cloud and Adobe’s newest set of solutions, Advertising Cloud which is mainly built around TubeMogul as well as some legacy acquisitions in the space that Adobe had made in years past.The company places what it calls Document Cloud within Digital Media. Document Cloud has been the smallest and slowest growing of Adobe’s offerings. It includes such solutions as Acrobat and Adobe Sign. Overall, Document Cloud is around 11% of total Adobe revenues.Document Cloud has been the last significant business of Adobe to fully convert to a subscription revenue model. While revenue growth last quarter was only 10%, the company increased its ARR in this business segment from $520 million to $556 million. Obviously, growing ARR at that rate will have a very salutary impact on reported revenue growth over the next few quarters.I think, for the most part when investors look at Adobe, the piece of the business that is valued most highly is Creative Cloud. When I first wrote about Adobe, I said it had few real competitors in the space. At this point, that hasn’t seen meaningful change. I don’t think it would be terribly valuable to investors to go through all of the things one can do with Creative Cloud. Even this writer uses it occasionally in other endeavors. As mentioned on this latest call, and as is well known, the video offerings of Adobe are showing explosive growth.About a year ago, Adobe introduced what it calls Sensei, basically a set of AI technologies. Sensei means respected teacher in Japanese-and that is essentially what it does. Sensei is not a specific product offering but what the company’s CTO calls a “unified framework.” I think it can best be compared to IBM’s Watson or the Einstein capabilities offered by Salesforce (CRM).Adobe Spark is a relatively new offering for consumers and smaller businesses. It can be used to create what are called social graphics, web stories and animated videos. It is a free app from Adobe that will help boost the consumption of other Adobe products. It is a tiny revenue stream at this point but perhaps it will become a mainstream way of delivering content. On a personal note, it is incredible to me that in my own lifetime, consumers have seen technologies go from recording experiences on 16MM home movies to something like Spark with which users can make all various kinds of video imagesOverall, Digital Media revenues grew by 28% last quarter with an ARR growth during the quarter of $308 million. That compares to 29% growth in the prior quarter which saw ARR growth of $312 million. In Q3, fiscal 2016, ARR grew by $285 million. Simply put, Adobe continues to increase the dollars of new ARR even as it grows its total size. It is that statistic, among others, I believe that makes Adobe such an attractive investment and worth the valuation that I will discuss below.The digital marketing space for Adobe has enormous potential and lots of competitors. It is the part of Adobe where that probably has the smallest relative advantage and the most ruthless competitors starting of course with Salesforce and including Oracle (ORCL) as well as many other vendors both large and small. Gartner has rated Adobe the absolute leader in the space for some years but both Salesforce and Oracle and also in the leader quadrant.Because the opportunity for Digital Marketing is so large, as it continues to displace traditional advertising spend, the competition is more difficult to evaluate than it might be in some other segments of the IT landscape. For example, the core of the Salesforce digital marketing has been built on its acquisition of a company called Exact Target a few years ago. Will a user obtain a greater ROI using the Salesforce tools as compared to the offerings that Adobe has put together from its series of acquisitions? I think it is almost impossible to know that or to forecast that Adobe is going to be able to enjoy consistent market share gains based on organic growth.Adobe’s most formidable differentiator is the integration between the Creative Cloud and content development tools to use in a digital marketing strategy. That is really the focus of the Experience Manager but as Gartner puts it, “the integration between AEM and the Creative Cloud and AEM and Audience Manager - which is central to Adobe’s hub, leave room for improvement.”I think it is fair to say that if Adobe could really offer users a seamless connection between its Creative Cloud and its Digital Marketing Hub it would have a very substantial advantage compared to all of its competitors. But at this point, that really hasn’t happened and thus the Digital Marketing wars continue unabated.Digital Marketing is an immense opportunity and it keeps getting larger. Depending on who is doing the defining, the space overall has been said to worth as much as $400 billion. That is really a far larger number than the specific segments in which Adobe competes. Adobe is not an advertising medium, in itself, and it is still more of a nascent, than full-fledged competitor in the digital advertising space. But it is the leader in the creation of digital marketing hubs which are said to have a CAGR of above 20% as enterprises rush to develop capabilities to replace traditional advertising models.Adobe basically has three problems in dominating this space the way it does with the Creative Cloud and its Document Cloud business segments. The first of these is that the company's offering has had a foundation based on Web Analytics (the Omniture acquisition) which is probably not the core of user thinking when it comes to creating a digital marketing hub. It bought a French company Neolane a few years back that provides automation and cross channel campaign management. It also purchased Efficient Frontier which is a company with online performance and social media marketing tools that is used to manage social media campaigns for advertisers and agencies.Most of what is today Adobe Digital Marketing has come from acquisition and it can be very complex to use all that Adobe has to offer to create a real digital marketing hub. It is really because of this complexity, as well as the time to benefit and the costs involved, that have led to the Digital Marketing operation having a rather lumpy set of growth parameters. The odds are that this kind of performance is going to continue on into the future-but at least to this writer, that constitutes no real cause for concern or alarm.Investors can fret about the results of one component of Digital Marketing in a particular quarter, but the fact is that Adobe has the most competitive set of products in the space, it continues to close large deals and the space continues to expand rapidly. And while Adobe faces lots of strong competitors, the opportunity it has to integrate Creative Cloud and Digital Marketing simply can’t be matched-and when that happens in a way that users feel is truly seamless, I think the company will be in a position to enjoy significant market share gains.Is this a reasonable entry point into Adobe shares for investors? Should current investors add to their positions? I think Adobe’s outlook, as I have tried to present, is that it will continue to exceed 20% top line growth for some period ahead. Not that 20% growth is some magic number, but when considering valuation it is well to understand that Adobe is still close to being a hyper-growth business and can be compared in that regard to much smaller IT vendors.I think in looking at valuation, investors should start by considering just how much benefit the company gets from the competitive positioning of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. By that I mean, this company has a far more profitable business model now, and is likely to continue more profitable in the future than most of its comparables. While the company is spending about 30% of its revenues on sales and marketing on a GAAP basis, that ratio compares favorably to the vast majority of companies in the IT space, and particularly those with a primarily subscription business model. Because of the influence of subscriptions and their renewals, that ratio continues to drop. Last quarter’s 30% ratio compares to sales and marketing expense of 32.5% the prior yearIn addition, the company continues to squeeze general and administrative costs which fell from 9.8% last year to 8% this year. Overall, on a GAAP basis, the company reported operating margins of almost 30%, up from 25% the prior year. That level of growth in operating margins is probably unsustainable. But the consensus forecast for the fiscal year that starts on December 1 continues to expect major margin improvements which are primarily the result of increasing proportions of subscription renewals which have very low associated costs in the company’s revenue mix.In addition, Adobe has and will continue to record substantial operating cash flows. CFFO grew by 36% last quarter and the growth was not related to changes in balance sheet items. Free cash flow, which reached 35% of revenues last quarter, grew by over 40% year on year.While the company does use stock based comp, the levels it spends on that expense category are at a far lower ratio than most peers. Last quarter, stock based comp was 17% of CFFO compared to 16.3% in the prior year.In considering valuation metrics, it is important to note just how much better Adobe’s overall set of both expense ratios and the trend of those ratios have been and continue to be when compared to the ratios of almost all of its peers. Adobe is a widely owned favorite of large institutions, not just because of its predictable growth, but because of its high and rising levels of profitability and cash flow which provide it with exceptionally favorable screening characteristics that are most often used by larger institutions in determining portfolio weightings.Just to return to the specific valuation metrics I use the most, Adobe currently has a market cap of about $74.1 billion. It has net cash of about $3.5 billion which yields an enterprise value of $70.6 billion. The revenue forecast for the next 12 months is about $8.7 billion, which yields an EV/S of 8.1X. That is high, perhaps, on an absolute basis but not considering the company’s level of profitability and cash flow.Based on the current First Call consensus, Adobe has a forecast non-GAAP P/E of 28X. The company’s track record in terms of earnings attainment is such that it seems highly likely that it will handily exceed the current EPS forecast, dropping the “real” P/E several notches.Adobe doesn’t forecast cash flow. As mentioned, all of the drivers of cash flow are seeing substantial expansion. About the only exception to that is that the increase in deferred revenue may have topped out for the moment-although the deferred revenue balance still is rising at 23% on an annual basis.I think that free cash flow is likely to rise to the range of $3 billion to $$3.3 billion as I do anticipate some continued growth in free cash flow margins. That yields a free cash flow yield of about 4.6%, a strong metric for a high growth company.Should investors initiative or add to positions in Adobe? Very much so, in my opinion. No, the pullback hasn’t been huge. And on some basis, some commentators will find the shares to be fully valued. But for a large-cap name, with great visibility and a great financial profile, this is about as good as it gets in my opinion. This is about as good an entry point - at least on a relative basis - as investors are likely to see. I think there is plenty of positive alpha ahead."

Although this new Software-as-a-Service (or SaaS) business model caused its EPS to slump and its revenue growth stagnating in 2013/2014, its EPS growth took off soon after. As the company continues to shift its business towards cloud-based subscription, Adobe’s revenue has become more stable and predictable as recurring revenue now represents 86% of its total revenue in Q2 2017. As its legacy creative suite users continue to transition to its cloud-subscription, we believe Adobe’s revenue growth will continue.Source: Created by author, Company ReportsBefore we dive into Adobe’s financial metrics, let us first discuss the advantages of Adobe’s new cloud-based subscription model. Unlike its previous perpetual-license model where its revenue depends on the quantity of its software licenses sold, this new cloud-based subscription model is based on a monthly fee that Adobe charges to its users. In return, Adobe will provide the latest software updates that include new features tools, cloud services, etc. We see two main advantages of this model:First, Adobe will receive monthly subscription revenue from its users. This recurring revenue is not prone to seasonality and product cycles. Even in a traditionally low software sale season, Adobe still receives subscription revenue from its subscribing users. Since Adobe’s creative software package is virtually a monopoly, its subscriber base is less likely to massively lost due to competition. This makes the subscription-based revenue predictable, and stable. Its recurring revenue now weighs about 86% of the company’s total revenue, up from 27% in 2012.Source: Created by author, Company ReportsSecond, Adobe’s cloud-based subscription model (or Software-as-a-Service) allows its subscription users immediate access to new features that the company release with its software update. This makes its subscribers more loyal to the company’s product. Its new feature also helps maintain and widen the moat that they already enjoy.Let us now look at the impacts of Adobe’s subscription model has on the company’s revenue.As its users continue to shift from its legacy creative suite products to its cloud-based subscription, we see its revenue continue to grow as indicated in the chart below. As the chart below shows, its revenue grew from $1.1 billion in Q1 2015 to near $1.8 billion in Q2 2017. Because its operating expense does not grow proportionately to its revenue (due to the nature of Software industry), its operating margin gradually improved from 18.4% in Q1 2015 to 32.9% in Q2 2017. As the company continue to shift its legacy software users to cloud-based subscribers, we anticipate the operating margin to continue to improve.Source: Created by author, Company ReportsAdobe’s growth in revenue and operating margin has directly transferred to its growth in EPS and free cash flow (or FCF) per share as indicated in the chart below. As the chart indicates, both EPS and FCF per share shows an upward trend. In its past quarter (Q2 2017), its EPS and FCF per share declined primarily due to higher tax amount despite positive quarter over quarter revenue growth.Source: Created by author, Company ReportsSimilarly, Adobe’s long-term debt to capitalization ratio also continues to improve due to strong cash flow generation. Its total cash reached $4.9 billion in its last quarter, up from $3.1 billion in Q1 2015.Source: Created by author, Company ReportsWe believe Adobe will continue its trend to grow its recurring revenues through its cloud-based subscription model. There is still a large subscriber growth potential as there were roughly 8 million legacy Creative Suite users, who have yet to migrate to subscription-based products as of December 2016. This will continue drive growth in its user base.While Adobe has not released much information about its retention rate, ARPU, nor its existing subscribers, management indicated that its retention rate and ARPU growth is very high. With the ability to gradually increase ARPU, its revenue will increase even without user base increase. With its strong product line, the sophisticated features that most of its professional subscribers rely on, and the vast amount of training time required to master the software (and the same is true to switch), we believe its subscribers retention rate will remain very high.Adobe’s presence in marketing cloud is also growing rapidly. However, unlike its dominance in its Creative Cloud suites, its market share in marketing cloud is roughly 15%. This is only modestly ahead of IBM’s 13.9%, SAP’s 11.3% and Salesforce.com’s 10.5%. Nevertheless, there is potential to integrate its marking cloud with creative cloud to create synergy and widen its moat.Adobe’s competitive advantage in its creative cloud services and its continual transition of its legacy creative suite users to subscription services should continue to drive its subscription services. The increase in subscribers along with its ability to increase its ARPU will allow growth in its revenue and cash flow. The added recurring revenue is predictable and consistent and makes it less prone to economic recession. Therefore, we believe Adobe will have strong growth with its current business model. The company’s future remains bright.Thank you for reading. If you like my article, please scroll to the top of the article and click on ""follow"" to receive future updates."

The San Jose-based company delivered another all-around beat coupled with better-than-expected guidance this Tuesday, and reinforced my belief that the stock is a potential GARP (growth at reasonable price) play worth closer inspection.Source: Adobe BlogsRevenues of $1.84 billion, higher than consensus by a small margin of $20 million, were driven by a strong subscription-based business that was up +34% vs. last quarter's 37%. As I had stated previously, the success of Adobe's quarter would be reliant on this high-growth segment, particularly on the digital media side, staying healthy. The company certainly did not disappoint.I was a bit surprised to see gross margins contract by 43 bps after having expanded about 100 bps last quarter over a fiscal 2Q16 that had already seen nearly 200 bps of YOY improvement. I expect scale to be a positive driver of increased profitability, but will be curious to learn more about what may be behind this quarter's dip - which, for now, I do not find concerning or indicative of long-term margin deterioration.The magic, however, happened below the gross profit line. Accounting for all the EPS upside to my estimates (see table below), opex as a percentage of revenues came in light, at 47.7% vs. my aggressive expectations of 50.9% and last year's 52.6%. Adobe is an example of a high-growth company that unlike many other names in the tech sector can manage operating costs conservatively for the sake of bottom-line results while still focusing on revenue expansion.Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company reportsDespite the solid beat and a fiscal 4Q17 guidance that met revenue and topped EPS expectations, ADBE is trading down -3% after hours. I might end up filing this name under my ""heads you win, tails I lose"" bucket of stocks that failed to gain market appreciation after a robust quarter. This would be a somewhat understandable reaction, considering ADBE had been up nearly +60% on a 52-week basis prior to the print and investors might be cashing in some of their chips.If shares in fact face weakness during the trading session tomorrow, I will see the dip as a buying opportunity as earnings expectations will likely improve a bit.

4107861,55342,2017-09-19T05:48:05-04:00,"Adobe Systems is scheduled to report its Q3 earnings today.
        The company has a strong track record of trumping Wall Street estimates.
        Is Adobe a good buy going into the earnings announcement?","Adobe Systems, Inc.(ADBE) the San Jose, California based provider of digital marketing and digital media solutions is set to report its Q3 2017 earnings today (September 19), after the market close. Adobe stock closed the last trading session at a price of $155.77 a share, nearly $2 off its all-time high of $157.89 which was hit a few trading sessions ago. Adobe shareholders have had a solid run, with the stock rising by 51.3% year-to-date. In comparison, the Nasdaq Composite has risen by less than 20% in the same timeframe. The important question now is: Will the Q3 2017 earnings announcement lift Adobe stock to fresh all-time highs? Is Adobe stock a good buy going into the Q3 earnings release? Let's take a closer look to understand what might be in store for us.The current Wall Street consensus expects Adobe to report earnings per share of $1.01 on a top line of $1.82 billion for the quarter. These estimates imply earnings growth of 34.7% and a revenue growth of 24.2%, both on a year-over-year basis. And, what does the management think the numbers will be like?The Wall Street estimates are in-line with the management's Q3 2017 targets. The management had, on June 20 2017, issued financial targets for Q3. The financial targets call for non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.00 and a revenue of $1.815 billion. The big question here; Can Adobe better these numbers?Adobe has a pretty solid history of trumping Wall Street estimates. As per the Estimize database, Adobe has beaten the Wall Street consensus as well as its own guidance (when issued), on both the top line as well as bottom line, in each of the last 8 quarters. And, if that wasn't good enough, here is something more impressive. The company has met/beaten the high end of these estimates in most of the trailing 8 quarters.Looking at the EPS history, Adobe's management had issued a guidance in 3 out of the last 8 quarters. And well, the company went on to trump the top end of the management's EPS guidance in each of these 3 quarters. When compared to the Wall Street estimates, Adobe has met/beaten the top end of Wall Street estimates in all of the last 8 reported quarters.Source: EstimizeMoving on to the revenue numbers, the story hasn't been too different. As per the Estimize Database, the management had issued a revenue guidance in only 2 out of the last 8 reported quarters. And, how did the actual numbers fare against these? The company beat the top end of management's guided range in one-quarter while missing the top end in the other. However, it's hard to base our expectations on just two data points. Hence, we look at the actual numbers in the context of Wall Street estimates.And, How did Adobe's reported revenue compare against the Wall Street estimates? The company beat the high end of Wall Street's revenue estimates in 5 out of the last 8 quarters. When considering the more recent 4 quarter timeframe, Adobe has beaten the high end of Wall Street estimates in each of the trailing 4 quarters.Source: EstimizeIt's clear, from the above data, that Adobe has a pretty strong history of crushing Wall Street estimates. Given the earnings history, Adobe will, more likely than not, report closer to the high end of the Wall Street estimates, which call for a top line of $1.824 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.03. The case for an earnings beat is also supported by the current Adobe Q3 2017 earnings whisper number, which anticipates earnings of $1.05 a share.Let's now take a look at the reaction of Adobe stock price to historical earnings announcements. Adobe has a history of making big up/down moves in the trading session immediately following an earnings announcement.When looking at an 8 quarter timeframe, Adobe stock has gained 1.73%, on average, in the trading session immediately following an earnings release. Looking at the more recent 4 quarters, the stock has risen by an average of 2.95% in the trading session immediately following an earnings release.Given Adobe's strong earnings history and the encouraging post-earnings movement of Adobe stock, a beat in Q3 could lift Adobe stock to fresh all-time highs. Hence, investors looking to play Adobe stock through the earnings announcement should buy Adobe stock going into the earnings announcement."
4108345,51452,2017-09-20T14:39:42-04:00,Adobe reported upside August FQ3 results.FQ4 Revenue guidance only in-line with prior expectations after it was higher each of the two previous quarters so revenue growth will be slower in the seasonally strongest quarter.Experience Cloud bookings below expectations and the reason FQ4 guidance is not stronger.,"Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) – RATING LOWERED FROM STRONG BUY TO BUY: ADBE reported August FQ3 results of $1.84 billion and $1.10, above expectations for $1.81 billion and $1.01 that were based on $1.82 billion and $1.00 guidance. These revenues were up 26% YTY comparable to increases of 20%, 23%, 22% and 27% the prior four quarters in that order.For their November FQ4, ADBE management guided earnings $0.05 above prior expectations at $1.15 in revenues in-line with expectations for $1.95 billion. These revenues would be up 21% YTY compared to that 26% in FQ3. They would also be up just 6% sequentially in the seasonally strong FQ4 compared to a 10% sequential gain last year.This was the first quarter this fiscal year that there was no upside in the revenue guidance for the next quarter. The principal reason is that Experience Cloud bookings were below expectations due to longer sales cycles on some larger deals. ADBE management said they were disappointed with their Experience Cloud bookings in FQ3 but are confident of their ability to execute against the large opportunity it addresses.And Experience Cloud ARR is forecast to increase less than previously expected in FQ4 - despite FQ4 being the seasonally strongest quarter in which it would normally be expected that ADBE’s sales organization would be making a strong and successful fiscal year-end push.Experience Cloud is ADBE’s digital marketing offering. It includes three clouds, Marketing Cloud, Advertising Cloud and Analytics Cloud plus the AI-based Adobe Sensei technology that leverages ADBE’s massive volume of content and data assets plus its domain expertise in the creative, document and marketing segments. Experience Cloud represented 27.6% of total company revenues in FQ3 at $508 million, up 2.6% sequentially and 26% YTY, so highly important to ADBE’s overall financial performance. This YTY growth rate was lower than the 29% achieved in FQ2.Reflective of the quality of ADBE management and the current times in technology, ADBE management announced in FQ1 that they are beginning to train all of their technical people in the fundamentals of artificial intelligence. Experience Cloud including Sensei AI technology is a larger sell impacting more departments of enterprise clients and is highly important to ADBE’s future – it needs to see stronger bookings.ADBE management said they may provide an update for Experience Cloud bookings and other guidance at their October 18th investor meeting at their ADBE Max customer event that week in Las Vegas. This event provides the opportunity for Experience Cloud and ADBE’s other offerings to be presented and customer responses to be seen.88% of FQ2 revenues were from recurring sources, up sequentially from 86%.Total digital media sector revenues were $1.27 billion, up 5% sequentially and up 28% YTY compared to up 29% YTY in FQ2. Creative cloud revenues increased 33% YTY to $1.06 billion compared to up 34% YTY to $1.01 billion in FQ2. Digital media ARR was $4.87 billion, up 6.8% sequentially from $4.56 billion compared to up 7.3% in FQ2.Document Cloud revenues increased 3% sequentially and 10% YTY to $206 million. Document Cloud ARR increased 6.9% sequentially from $520 million to $556 million. Within this Acrobat revenues increased compared to some prior quarters of declines.After rising 52% YTY through yesterday, ADBE shares are correcting about 3% in pre-market trading this morning. On FY2018 earnings expectations of $5.10 they now carry a P/E of 30 for 25% earnings growth on 20% revenue growth. This is reasonable for a company of ADBE’s quality.We look forward to seeing more details of ADBE’s near and longer-term outlook on October 18th, especially relative to Experience Cloud bookings.For now, we are taking a more conservative view and lowering our rating one step from Strong Buy to Buy, which suggests a less heavily-weighted position in your growth portfolios. However, if you have been missing having ADBE among your holdings, this correction may provide an attractive opportunity in the coming days to take a partial position on the bet that this quality management team will be successful in improving Experience Cloud bookings."
4104155,103480,2017-09-05T11:52:58-04:00,"Fundamentals look amazing for Adobe, the maker of Photoshop, Illustrator, and other creativity software.The company has fully transitioned to the SaaS model, and subscription revenues are growing at an unprecedented scale.Revenue growth in the first half of 2017 actually accelerated over growth in 2016.Adobe is also immensely profitable and is trading at reasonable valuations of cash flow and earnings when factoring in massive y/y earnings growth.","Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE) is a company almost everyone can get behind. But this wasn't always the case. Back in 2011, when Adobe mentioned it was first planning on transitioning to the cloud model, many doubted Adobe could pull it off. After all, Adobe's core products - Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Dreamweaver - have always been sold as expensive, one-time licenses.The transition to cloud is not an easy one. Revenue (and earnings) suffers in the short term because that perpetual license stream that used to bring all the cash through the door on Day 1 is now split into monthly installments over a year or more. But this transition is already complete at Adobe, eliminating risk for investors: subscription revenues derived 84% of total revenue in Adobe's most recent quarter.Typically, a software company growing at Adobe's pace (26% y/y growth as of the prior quarter) is also eating through cash. Not the case here: in fiscal 2016, Adobe generated $1.2 billion in earnings (a 20% net income margin) and $2.2 billion in operating cash flow (a 37% margin). This point illustrates a gleeful truth: while the subscription model is difficult to pull off, it's immensely more profitable in the long run.Why? You don't have to start from scratch every quarter, as Adobe's CFO highlights in this interview. There's already a revenue base, and every new subscription you sell adds not only to this quarter's revenues, but each quarter in perpetuity. When downturns hit, subscription companies are also more immune. In 2009, only 5% of Adobe's revenues were subscription; the top line sank 20% immediately following the recession. SaaS companies experience a much kinder drop in revenues because their revenue base is already contracted and recurring.Since completing its cloud transition, Adobe shares have virtually traded in a straight line up. While this usually makes me shy away from buying, Adobe's fundamentals make clear that the rally still has legs.ADBE data by YChartsThis article will do a deep dive into Adobe's business, dissect the financials, and discuss valuation. Overall, Adobe makes a fantastic addition to any growth portfolio. Each of its product segments is growing like a weed, and to artists and creative people Adobe's products are as vital as Microsoft Excel is to others - ensuring a long, steady stream of subscription revenues.Adobe was founded in 1982. Its first products were PostScript, a program to control printers, and digital fonts. In 1989, it introduced its flagship product - the one for which it's still known for today, Adobe Photoshop. It had gone public three years prior, in 1986. Among the other things Adobe is known for is creation of the PDF file format, first compatible with Adobe Reader and Adobe Acrobat.Today, Adobe is organized into three segments:A full list of Adobe's product lines is shown in the chart from its website, below:You probably have used several of Adobe's products, and you've definitely opened a pdf. Adobe's ubiquity in the modern world is uncontested. While the majority of its applications are catered toward super-users and high-creative types, its core product - Photoshop - is almost as basic and essential as Microsoft office. Try to think of a competitor to Photoshop, and most will draw a blank. It's become an industry standard in image editing, much like Microsoft Word is the standard word processor.Let's dissect how successfully Adobe has transitioned to the cloud by breaking down its recurring revenue.Figure 1. Adobe subscription revenueSubscription revenues grew an incredible 42% in 2016, and comprised 78% of total revenues. One-time product license revenues have become an increasingly smaller part of the business, reducing the variability in Adobe's quarter-on-quarter results.This trend continues through 2Q17, Adobe's last reported quarter. Subscription revenues comprised 84% of Q2 revenues and grew 37% y/y.Each of Adobe's product categories have shown tremendous growth in subscriptions in the past few years, with Digital Media (Adobe's largest product category, encompassing Creative Cloud) growing at 49% - an incredible figure given it ended 2016 with $3.4 billion in revenues. For comparison, this makes Digital Media a larger product for Adobe than Sales Cloud (~$3.2 billion run rate) is for Salesforce (NYSE: CRM); yet Sales Cloud is only growing at ~20%.Figure 2. Adobe revenue contribution by productNote that Tubemogul, which contributes about $200 million to the top line, was not folded into 2016 figures, as the acquisition closed following the end of Adobe's November 30 fiscal year. In 1H17, however, Tubemogul's contribution is apparent, with the Digital Marketing segment growing 23% y/y and adding ~$250 million in incremental revenue from 1H16.Another useful metric that Adobe reports is annual recurring revenue (ARR) for its biggest product category, Digital Media. Adobe exited 2Q17 with $4.56 billion in Digital Media ARR, comprising of $4.04 billion in ARR within Creative Cloud and $520 million for Document Cloud. Note that Adobe's current Digital Media ARR is already larger than its entire 2016 revenue, without adding the contribution from Digital Marketing.How does Adobe's massive growth translate into profits and margins? Let's start with gross margins:Figure 3. Adobe gross margins by quarterAdobe's gross margins in the mid-high 80s have held consistently, and are best-in-class in software. For comparison against other cloud companies, see the chart below:Figure 4. Adobe margins vs. cloud compsAdobe generates strong GAAP profit margins as well, with both operating margin and net income margin seeing strong quarter-on-quarter growth:Figure 5. Adobe operating and net income marginsIncreases in both margins and the top line have driven strong earnings growth. Earnings and EPS in each quarter have exceeded 50%, with Adobe delivering 53% y/y earnings growth in Q2:Figure 6. Adobe earnings growthAdobe's largest cloud peers, Workday (NYSE: WDAY) and Salesforce, are yet to generate profit on a GAAP basis, whereas Adobe has delivered continuously improved earnings and high, 20+ net income margins. In fact, Adobe has been profitable since its first year of operations in 1986. With the cloud transition mostly under its belt, Adobe sits on a ~$5B mass of recurring revenue, with each contract providing 86% gross margins and costing virtually nothing to provide. It's hard to argue with the thesis that Adobe possesses one of the best fundamental stories in software, more than supporting its premium multiple.Management has also set lofty, yet completely attainable targets for the company through FY18:Figure 7. Adobe management long-term targets, FY18Targeting just 20% of top-line growth and 30% in profit growth (vs. 40% revenue growth and nearly 100% net income growth in FY16), Adobe has plenty of room to outperform through FY18.Let's compare how Adobe trades relative to its peer set of large-cap, profitable software names.ADBE PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsAs seen above, Adobe trades at a healthy P/E premium to its peers in large-cap software. But how does its earnings growth compare? Adobe generated 86% EPS growth in 2016, versus only 26% for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), 19% for Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and 5% for SAP (NYSE:SAP). Nor is Adobe's outsized EPS growth an anomaly; it has continued into 2017, with Adobe delivering 53% y/y EPS growth in Q2.Factoring earnings growth into the picture, Adobe actually sports the lowest PEG ratio - a forward P/E of 38x relative to 50% estimated EPS growth translates to a PEG ratio of approximately 0.76x, a typical indicator of a value trade.Adobe has plenty of room for upside. Its valuation is high, but its growth more than compensates for the richness in the stock. With financial targets of ~20% revenue growth and ~30% EPS growth through 2018 set rather conservatively compared to recent earnings trends, the Adobe rally still has plenty of fuel left.Adobe is set to report earnings on September 19th after the bell. I'd use any temporary pullback or market selloff to build a position before an upside catalyst takes the stock beyond buying range."
4082781,24823,2017-06-20T19:15:04-04:00,Our buy on weakness signal was sent to subscribers before earnings.Adobe was put in our Daily Index Beaters portfolio just before earnings.Our conclusion based on valuation.,"Just before earnings we placed Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) in our Daily Index Beaters' portfolio, notified our subscribers and told them it had a buy on weakness signal. You can see it in the chart below. We also published this chart before earnings. At the bottom of the chart you can see our passing grade, a fundamental and technical buy signal. You can also see our purely fundamental buy signal, implied return well above the 10% we require to be in the portfolio. Finally you can see Demand had dropped below the line into Supply. That is our buy on weakness signal anytime we have the two other buy signals shown at the bottom of the chart.Is it too late to buy?Let's drill down on the fundamentals and technicals to come up with the answer.AnalystsNasdaq.com showed 16 out of 20 analysts had buys before earnings. The consensus target was $150 and the high was $160. ADBE is trading at $146 up $5, after hours, as I write, so they are buying after earnings. I think this is probably a short covering pop. Some bearish analysts may raise their targets, but ADBE looks fully priced.Flashrating.com showed that most recent analysts were positive with a median target of $155. But a couple of analysts were worried with targets of $131 and $112. Obviously the bearish analysts were wrong and the bullish 16 analysts were right before earnings.FundamentalsFinviz.com gives us the fundamental metrics along with a chart. The fundamentals look overvalued with the standard metrics of P/E, P/S, P/B and PEG coded red meaning that ADBE is overvalued. But this is a short-term earnings growth story and the FPE and next year's earnings growth look great. I was surprised the short ratio was not higher before earnings. That was an indication that the two bearish analysts did not have a great deal of support. With this positive earnings report, the shorts are squeezed and price is jumping after earnings.TechnicalsAs you can see on our proprietary chart above, ADBE has our buy signals both fundamental and technical. When we have buy signals like this, any Supply, shown at the bottom of the chart, triggers our buy on weakness signal. Also note the Supply has reversed and turned up, improving, which is our swing trade, buy signal before earnings.ConclusionAll signals pointed to a good earnings report after the close. ADBE is priced to perfection, and most analysts have optimistic targets. The two bearish analysts may reverse themselves tomorrow and raise their targets. But all the other analysts will probably sit pat, comfortable that they were right before earnings. Maybe they will reach for the high target of $160 but I don't think they will come out with $175. That is what is needed to justify this price. Therefore, I think it is too late to buy ADBE. It is about to lose our buy on weakness signal and I would wait for the next one to buy.

But I believe the stock has gone too far too soon.Since the company is blending creativity and marketing via AI in a unique way, long-term investors should buy the stock on dips.","Adobe (ADBE) has been selected as a leader in the 2017 “Magic Quadrant for Web Content Management,” by Gartner. Adobe’s stock is currently hovering around the all time high of $150. Adobe’s venture into AI (artificial intelligence) via its Adobe Sensei platform, which the company introduced last November, is driving its stock price upward.The platform allows creators to design and monetize almost every creative piece in cloud, right from sophisticated 3D videos to targeted marketing campaigns using Adobe Marketing Cloud (for simplicity’s sake, let’s say intelligent cloud). This article delves deeper into Adobe’s future in intelligent cloud and how that could boost its stock price in the long run.Adobe Marketing Cloud, i.e., the intelligent cloud, is a rule-based testing and targeting tool. It includes five platforms, viz., Adobe Experience Manager, Adobe Target, Adobe Campaign, Adobe Primetime and Adobe Social.Earlier this year the company introduced Auto-Target, a new feature of Adobe Target, through which it has integrated the data science and algorithmic optimization capabilities of Sensei to its intelligent cloud. The intelligent cloud allows Adobe’s CMS (content management system) to create and publish highly creative websites, mobile sites, and on-site screens. According to Gartner:Image Source: GartnerI believe Auto-Target is so far the best feature the company has introduced for its intelligent cloud, powered by Adobe Sensei. Major brands like AT&T (T), Sprint (S), Marriott (MAR) and Lenovo use Adobe Target. The moot question is how would the Auto-Target feature result in more revenue generation?Adobe Sensei has been made to work across the company’s entire intelligent cloud stack from behind. In addition to its marketing aspects, Sensei’s creative aspects have the ability to anticipate content creators’ moves in advance. In this way, it can recreate elements in images and fonts by studying surrounding pixels and observing creators’ usages of fonts respectively. It can also recognize human faces and allows the creator to change expressions by highlighting areas near eyebrows and lips.It saves creators’ time to a great extent. Adobe expects Sensei will be able to attract more brands for using its AI-driven creative targeted marketing campaigns. As a result, the company believes revenue will expand. However, we don’t yet know if the Auto-Target feature driven by Sensei’s algorithms is efficient enough to drive revenue growth.As far as revenue is concerned, Adobe has remained successful to boost annual revenue consistently in the past four years. Its earnings also increased, even in higher proportion especially in the last two years. Image Source: AuthorThe company’s stock at present is trading at a trailing 12-month P/E multiple of 51x and P/S multiple of 11x. I don’t think Adobe’s valuation is compelling enough to dive into the counter before a meaningful correction. Although Sensei is a great platform that uniquely handles both marketing and creative aspects of digital content, its acid test is pending since Adobe’s earnings improvements happened prior to the release of Sensei. Competition from big players like IBM (IBM) and Oracle (ORCL) is a concern.IBM’s cognitive solutions software suite, IBM Watson Visual Recognition, could pose a significant threat to Adobe Sensie. Although IBM doesn’t currently offer solutions for targeted marketing campaigns, IBM developers can easily create apps that can compete with Sensei for creating successful marketing campaigns.Oracle is a different type of competitor. Although its cognitive solutions are insignificant, its hybrid cloud strategy combined with Oracle Content and Experience Cloud makes it easier for publishers and marketers to create marketing and community websites and mobile sites. In addition, custom user interfaces can be created with the help of developers using Oracle’s rich set of content APIs and robust DevOps infrastructure.Adobe is the world’s top creative company and I believe Sensei’s creative side would surpass its marketing side in the coming years. As far as creativity is concerned, Sensei could help creators save time, and there's huge scope for further improvement. For marketing, though, it could be a really effective platform even today. Since the stock has gone too far too soon, long-term investors should wait for a correction before buying Adobe."

Revenue plunged in 2013 after slowing down in 2012, partly by design, and partly because the software giant hit a headwind. The headwind was competition - some of it free - and a shrinking need for what Adobe offered. The 'by design' lull was the impact of a rebuilt business model that better reflected how the modern software market works.In retrospect, it was a brilliant move. Last year's top line of $5.8 billion was a record for the company, but perhaps more noteworthy was last year's revenue growth pace of 22%. Analysts are expecting more of the same kind of growth going forward.Source: Thomson Reuters, image made by authorMost investors have no problem buying into the optimistic outlook, but maybe without a full appreciation of why expectations are so high. The explanation is simple enough though. Indeed, it's just two words - recurring revenue. Adobe generates a lot of it, and is only going to drive more of it going forward.It's All About Recurring RevenueMostly anyone reading this likely knows Adobe has spent the past four years migrating away from one-time sales of boxed software and towards sales of subscription-based products. What may not be as clear is how significant these subscriptions have become. More than anything though, current and would-be owners alike should know that the recurring revenue market has only seen its surface scratched.It's called the Netflix model, though on-demand video giant Netflix (NFLX) is hardly the only enterprise using it. Netflix was the organization that validated the idea of digital subscription-based services though, charging users a monthly fee for web-based entertainment as early as 2007.That model has turned Netflix into a behemoth in the meantime.Other companies have followed suit, partly because they wanted to, and partly because they had to. Case in point? Microsoft (MSFT). Through the early 2000s, its off-the-shelf office productivity suites ('Office') were the leading name in the category. As cloud-based alternatives like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Docs became increasingly used though, Microsoft made a countermove. Cloud-based Office 365 was born, and the iconic software company has enjoyed its fair share of recurring monthly revenue.It's also become a popular model because as Netflix, Microsoft, Adobe and a myriad of other organizations have learned though - some by accident - it's cheaper and easier to keep a customer than win a new customer over.The best is yet to come for the model, however.Changing Workplace PreferencesSay what you want about millennials in the work place (everyone else seems plenty willing to do so), but they are the future, if only because of attrition of older employees. And, with millennials in touch and in love with subscriptions in their personal lives, it's only a matter of time before that mindset becomes the norm at work... under the direction of these up-and-coming chiefs.Payments processor Vantiv recently unveiled some telling statistics on the matter, pointing out that 70% of millennials have a product subscription, while 89% of them have service subscriptions for things like Netflix or Spotify. Last year's Deloitte Digital Democracy Survey upped that metric quite a bit, suggesting that most of the millennials who subscribe to at least one streaming-video service average three different over-the-top services. Even as early as 2015, 40% of millennials were paying for internet-delivered news despite a plethora of free alternative sources available to engage the exact same informationThey're all just microcosms of the changing, evolving consumer market and mindset. That mindset is already creeping its way into the world of work, well beyond Microsoft's Office 365 subscription offer. Adobe is winning more than its fair share of that revenue.The company's most recent version of its investor presentation/deck tells the story of Adobe's recurring revenue machine in pictures. The bulk of Adobe Creative Cloud revenue is now recurring revenue, while the Adobe Document Cloud revenue is en route to becoming primarily a recurring revenue venture.Source: Adobe investor presentation, June 2017Source: Adobe investor presentation, June 2017All told, Adobe's annualized recurring revenue between 'Creative' and 'Document' now stands around $4.5 billion, and is on an impressive upward trajectory. As of the end of last quarter, it was 86% of the organization's revenue mix, up from only 27% of total revenue in fiscal 2012, and up from 83% as of the end of 2016.Source: Adobe investor presentation, June 2017That's only a drop in the bucket though.To be completely fair, Adobe's lofty projections about the total addressable market for its 'creative' and 'document' market are at least partially self-serving, painting an encouraging growth picture. On the other hand, the growth outlook is difficult (if not impossible) to refute. And those outlooks are for $19.5 billion worth of revenue by 2019 within the market the company's 'creative' arm aims at, and another $4.5 billion market (again, by 2019) Adobe's 'document' arm caters to. For perspective, Adobe Systems has generated $6.5 billion worth of revenue over the course of the past four reported quarters.Source: Adobe investor presentation, June 2017Source: Adobe investor presentation, June 2017As the younger workers of the current labor pool grow into the mid-career and then senior leadership of the nation's and the world's companies - a shift that's already starting to become evident - look for their affinity with subscriptions to become the new business norm rather than the exception.Simultaneously, look for Adobe to continue the development of its platforms to make its wares the must-have document management and creativity tools in the workplace. Sramana Mitra touches on that idea here, though perhaps her take doesn't do the opportunity justice. Once subscribers are in the SaaS ecosystem, they'll get any software/platform updates automatically. That feature largely negates the need to upgrade later, which are a chance for rivals to win those customers over.Of course, the longer Adobe dominates its key markets, the more attrition it sees among its competitors.Looking Ahead For ADBE StockWhile Adobe is one of the few tech-service names on a truly reliable growth trajectory, stepping into that growth won't come cheap. Even the forward-looking P/E of 27.8 is frothy relative to its peers and the organization's revenue growth pace. Throw in the fact that ADBE shares are up 36% year-to-date, and the odds of a correction are further ramped up.Just be sure to use any healthy pullback as a buying opportunity. Adobe has already effectively secured a huge swath of its future revenue, even if many of those customers don't even know it yet. It may well be the most overlooked recurring revenue champion within the business-software world."

Non-GAAP EPS estimate average of $0.95 is an inch above management's guidance of $0.94, and points to 34% growth over last year's period.Credit: adobe.comAdobe strikes me as one of the most compelling software and digital marketing names in the market. The company is well positioned to benefit from current industry trends, as it is deeply involved in digital content creation and marketing analytics - businesses that I do not expect to reach their maturing stages anytime soon. While Adobe faces competitive threats from multiple players of different sizes and catering to different customers, the San Jose-based company seems to be the one that owns the most complete portfolio of products and services to offer to its target audience.The chart below is management's quantification of the company's projected TAM (total addressable market) for total digital media (left) and digital marketing (right).Source: Analyst meeting slidesNot surprisingly, the numbers point to what seems to be a healthy business. Looking back (see graph below), total company revenues have increased from about $4 billion in early 2014, on a trailing-twelve month basis, to $6.2 billion last quarter, or about 55% in just about three years. The stickier and more reliable subscription sales have increased from 77% of total revenues in fiscal 1Q16 to a sizable 82% last quarter.For reference and to give scale to the fast shift in the monetization model, perpetual licenses and OEM accounted for more than 70% of revenues back in fiscal 2012. Meanwhile, GAAP op margins continue to improve from a low of about 10% in 2014 (22% non-GAAP) to over 25% today (around 35% non-GAAP).ADBE Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsLooking forward and using management's projections as a yardstick, the company's prospects also look solid. As the table below indicates, Adobe is expected to generate growth of at least 20% through fiscal 2018 across a range of financial metrics, from total revenues to EPS and op cash flow.Source: Adobe's reportWhen Adobe reports earnings next week, I will compare the quarterly results against the long-term goals above and assess whether there might be substantial risk to the targets not being reached. Solid 20%-plus top line growth, an even higher mix of subscription revenues and improving margins will likely suggest that the company continues to be on track.On the stockADBE is not necessarily a cheap stock. As the graph below suggests, the 35.2x forward P/E is significantly higher than any multiple in my selected peer group of Adobe's mega-cap competitors Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and SAP (NYSE:SAP). The multiple is also about three full turns higher now than it was right around the same time last year, and almost 10 turns higher compared to late 2016.ADBE PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsYet, ADBE seems to be nicely placed in what I call the stock market's ""goldilocks zone"": not too aggressively priced like many other fast-growing tech names, but still expected to see EPS grow a hefty 26% next year.As cautious as I am about growth investing, but considering the factors listed above, I would not be opposed to giving ADBE a shot, despite having missed a good portion of the stock's upward movement in the past year.Note from the author: If you have enjoyed this article and would like to receive real-time alerts on future ones, please follow DM Martins Research.

Each quarter, it keeps surprising the market with its stellar performance. Last week, it reported its second quarter results that helped send its stock to a lifetime high.Adobe's FinancialsAdobe's second quarter revenues grew 27% over the year to $1.77 billion, ahead of the market's projections of $1.73 billion. EPS of $1.02 was also ahead of the Street's estimated $0.95 per share for the quarter.During the quarter, Adobe's Subscription revenues grew 36% over the year to $1.48 billion.

Creative Cloud and Document Cloud adoption and retention helped drive Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue to $4.56 billion for the quarter, recording a growth of $312 million over the previous quarter. It also delivered a record revenue within the Adobe Experience Cloud segment, which ended the quarter with $495 million, growing 29% over the year.For the current quarter, Adobe expects revenue of $1.815 billion with an EPS of $1. The market was looking for revenues of $1.8 billion and an EPS of $0.95.Adobe's Creative ExpansionAdobe continued to improve its content offerings for its customers. Its Adobe Stock offering, which offers stock photography to users, now has a library of more than 90 million graphics. It continues to add to the service and recently introduced Aesthetic Filters, a next-gen search capability that will leverage Adobe Sensei to streamline search for images or video content for creative projects. Recently, it also expanded its library with the availability of new collections from Reuters and Stocksy. Adobe is working on the addition of content from USA TODAY Sports to its stock collection as well.Within the video business, Premiere Pro recorded a 49% growth in single-app subscriptions. It recently unveiled a major update to the service that allows filmmakers and video producers to create, deliver, and monetize their video assets faster than earlier. The latest update offers new features for graphics and titling, animation, polishing audio and sharing assets, support for the latest video formats such as HDR, VR, and 4K, and new integrations with Adobe Stock. Other updates within video include the launch of Character Animator that allows users to create instant walking animations by tagging a character's legs, arms, and body and Audition that lets users edit and mix sound types to clips.Besides video, Adobe also is innovating across other categories like Experience Design, 3D, and mobile apps, through offerings like the Adobe Spark that simplifies the process of designing social graphics, web stories, and animated videos. Adobe is counting on these new offerings to help drive more users to the Creative Cloud.Its stock is currently trading at $143.69 with a market capitalization of $72.7 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $147.45 earlier this week. It has grown significantly since it touched the 52-week low of $90.35 in June last year."
4085527,52852,2017-07-03T15:12:19-04:00,"Last week, Adobe announced new voice analytics capabilities leveraging its Sensei platform.Sensei is a new AI platform announced last November, but few retail investors are aware of it.Investors should pay attention because of the growing importance of this platform.","Last Thursday, June 29th, Adobe (ADBE) announced new voice analytics capabilities in Adobe Analytic Cloud. How great these new set of tools are and how material they will be to ADBE’s bottom line remain to be seen; however, that isn’t the important takeaway from the press release. The important thing is that these tools leverage ADBE’s artificial intelligence capabilities of Adobe Sensei, which is one of the most important drivers of ADBE’s future. However, given how new Sensei is, and the lack of disclosure in ADBE’s public filings, many investors are not aware of the importance of Sensei.For those of you who are not up to speed on AI, it is important to know that AI is simply mind-blowingly important. However, few people truly understand or appreciate the importance of AI. This is likely due to the fact that the “AI Big Bang” occurred around five years ago, and since then technological advances have been happening at a mind-blowing pace. Secondly, the cutting edge also is dominated by a small number of institutions, so the vast majority of us are far removed from the latest technology. Take a look at this table – it clearly shows that the tech giants are outspending everyone else. For example, Amazon (AMZN) is spending 22 times what GE is spending on AI. Or take a look at this article which is one of the many articles highlighting the war for scarce AI talent: “Microsoft research chief Peter Lee says the cost of acquiring a top AI researcher is comparable to the cost of acquiring an NFL quarterback.”ADBE also says very little about Sensei in its public filings, which contributes to investors’ lack of awareness. According to ADBE’s 10-K, the following are effectively everything ADBE says about Sensei (I’ve left out redundant wordings): “A core part of Creative Cloud is Adobe Sensei, a new framework and set of intelligent services for dramatically improving the design and delivery of digital experiences. Adobe Sensei leverages machine learning, artificial intelligence and deep learning capabilities to tackle today’s complex creative experience challenges… we believe Sensei will increase the value we provide our customers and create a competitive differentiation in the market.”ADBE first introduced its Sensei platform in November 2016. Sensei was introduced as ADBE’s effort to unify its existing AI technologies to be deployed across the entire Adobe platform. Sensei will use ADBE and its customers’ content and data to automate work processes, assist in the creative process, and help businesses better understand their end customers, among other capabilities not discussed during the event.While there is no direct monetization of Sensei, it will potentially impact all of ADBE’s existing and future products and achieve indirect monetization through technology leadership, improved conversation rates and retention. For example, as of November 2016, management said there are 50 capabilities already baked into the marketing Cloud levering Sensei.Management made it absolutely clear that Sensei is of fundamental importance, using language, for example, such as the following during the MAX 2016 event: “(Sensei is) a big bet… this is actually a very, very foundational bet, and you will continue to see us expand into new categories, new scenarios on the basis of this platform bet for us… (Sensei is) one of the biggest strategic investments that we will continue to make to deepen the technology moat that we have associated with our platforms, so other people cannot compete with the breadth and depth of the offerings that we have in the marketplace.”In March of 2017, ADBE announced additional Sensei features described as “Adobe Sensei for the enterprise.” New features include Intelligent Alerts and Anomaly Detection to generate an appropriate response to milestones reached in the customer journey. In the same event, demonstrating that it is serious about enterprise, ADBE announced a partnership with the king of enterprise software – Microsoft (MSFT). ADBE is now “actually open for business in terms of key solutions” with three specific solutions available on the Azure platform (with more to come).Given the context above, it is no surprise that ADBE announced a new suit of tools that leverages the Sensei platform. Investors should expect more to come. Sensei is a platform that will drive every aspect of ADBE's business."

The analysts expect CEO Shantanu Narayen to report a strong quarter but slightly slower EPS growth, with a YoY increase in Non-GAAP earnings per share (+34%) and a YoY increase in revenues (+24%). Adobe management outlook is basically the same at +32% and +24%, respectively.The average estimated Non-GAAP EPS of $0.95 by the analysts is an increase of +34% YoY and much higher than the four-quarter earnings per share average through QE February 2017 of $0.83. This would be another all-time high. Non-GAAP earnings per share have been $0.94, $0.90, $0.75, $0.71 for the past four quarters, in reverse chronological order.Adobe's financial performance has been amazing and continually upwards. Each quarter has seen record revenues and earnings per share for several years.Estimated QE May 2017 Earnings per Share (Non-GAAP):Earnings per Share Year Over Year Growth Rate (%)The estimated Non-GAAP earnings per share average of $0.95 for the QE May 2017 is an increase of +34% year over year. The most recent four-quarter average growth YoY is an exceptional +44%. Adobe has set the bar very high and growth may actually slow, at +34%, this next quarter!RevenuesTotal revenues have averaged $1.54 billion for the past four quarters. An increase to $1.73 billion is projected for this next QE May 2017. This would be another all-time high.Estimated QE May 2017 Revenues (GAAP & Non-GAAP):Revenues by SegmentQuarterly revenues by segment are comprised of Digital Media (68%), Digital Marketing (29%), and Print and Publishing (3%). Adobe management continues to aggressively transform the cloud. CEO Shantanu Narayen stated in the prior earnings call for the QE February 2017, ""In Digital Media, we continue to be the undisputed leader in helping customers inject creativity into their jobs, schoolwork and their daily lives.."" As can be seen in the chart below, the Digital Media segment is driving the revenues, and earnings, upwards.Revenues by RegionQuarterly revenues by region are comprised of the Americas (58%), Europe, Middle East, Africa (27%), and Asia Pacific (15%). As can be seen in the chart below, the Americas is driving the revenues, and earnings, upwards.Return on Assets & MarginsBecause Non-GAAP earnings are higher than GAAP earnings, the return on assets is also higher. For the QE February 2017, the annualized return on average assets was +13.3% for Non-GAAP and +10.6% for GAAP. Both measures have been increasing as the overall profitability of Adobe has increased. For both Non-GAAP and GAAP, gross margin has remained relatively stable while operating and net margins have been increasing.ConclusionFinancial Performance: Amazing Adobe. Non-GAAP & GAAP financial performance has steadily increased and each quarter is a record quarter for total revenues and earnings per share.Financial Position: Financial position is strong with a capital to assets ratio of 58%. Total assets of $13.04 billion are at a record high. Working capital of $2.8 billion is adequate. The current assets to total assets ratio is 44%, so there is liquidity. The total debt ratio, both short-term and long-term, is an acceptable 14% of total assets.Dividends: Adobe does not pay dividends.Stock Repurchases: Adobe repurchased $200 million of common stock in the QE February 2017. The ongoing repurchases equal $1.125B for the past four quarters. The repurchases for the past four quarters have been $200M, $300M, $400M, $225M, in reverse chronological order.Stock Price: ADBE stock has been in an exceptionally long-term upward trend. ADBE does have price support from stock repurchases and institutional buyers. The stock beta is a low 1.03, so this stock is steady and there normally is not much excess volatilityStock Evaluation & Opinion: As an intermediate-term to long-term investor, and from that perspective, I consider Adobe stock to be a Buy, compared to Hold or Sell. I am Positive on Adobe stock, compared to Neutral or Negative. Both the revenues and earnings per share growth has been exceptional but may be slowing. Even at a slowing rate, Adobe is a top tech financial performer.(Graphs created by author using data from Adobe.

Unlike the go-short recommendation of Investor Wand last month, I am again endorsing going long on ADBE. Adobe's phenomenal performance in the stock market is largely thanks to its continuing monopoly on commercial design/creative software. As long as there is a lack of pro-level alternatives to Adobe's Creative Cloud software products, Adobe's stock will continue to be valued at a lofty 50x P/E.The recurring revenue from Creative Cloud is and will remain Adobe's main growth engine.(Source: Adobe)Adobe will not have an easy time as an advertising platform provider competing against Facebook (FB) or Alphabet (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). On the other hand, I'm pretty confident Adobe will remain unchallenged for many years to come when it comes to design software. The enviable moat of Adobe's apparent monopoly on design/creative software has even inspired another Seeking Alpha author to suggest Adobe should be bought by Apple (AAPL).You can search it online. No respectable employed or freelance graphic artist is using non-Adobe software for their paid projects. Check all the job boards, 99% of the job offers involving creative/design positions require proficiency in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, After Effects, Premiere, and Animate.The Creative Industry Itself Elected Adobe Nobody is hiring designers that are using cheaper alternatives like Autodesk's (ADSK) Pixlr or Graphic. As far as I know, all colleges and vocational schools offer just Adobe-branded software training/courses. The reason for this is that schools had to offer what the industry wants from its employees – proficiency in Adobe software.Synergy Research has consistently recognized Adobe as a leader in Enterprise SaaS. This is thanks to the industry standard edge touted by Adobe's software products. Enterprise customers liked it that Adobe offered its entire business Creative Cloud software products for just $69.99/month per user.Adobe's long-term prosperity is guaranteed by the persistent preference of the global creative industry (print, web, and multimedia) for Creative Cloud products. If there were 9 million paying customers of Creative Cloud last year, I estimate that there are now more than 10 million subscribers.The November 2016 release of Creative Cloud CC 2017 might have encouraged more people to sign-up for subscriptions. The release of the dedicated UI/UX/Wireframing design software, Adobe Experience Design CC, could also have encouraged more UI/UX artists to subscribe.UI/UX designers are now the top earning creative professionals. They are desirable long-term customers for Adobe's Experience Design CC subscription software product.ConclusionI approve of Adobe's growing clout as a cloud marketing platform provider for advertisers. However, I still want the company to continue improving Creative Cloud software products. Taking care of its main revenue and income generator is always important for any company.I want Adobe to keep building new software like genre-specific Experience Design CC to increase its total addressable market. Going forward, I expect Adobe to eventually challenge Autodesk's monopoly on commercial CAD (Computer-Aided Design) and 3-D software.In my book, Adobe is currently king of the Software-as-a-Service [SaaS] industry. The shift from boxed software to subscription-only software distribution has been a bonanza for Adobe. Compared to Microsoft (MSFT), which is also a player in SaaS with its Office 365, Adobe's stock made a better return since June 20, 2016.(Source: Google)If you like MSFT as a long-term investment, ADBE should also get a place in your portfolio."
4085087,103339,2017-06-30T11:23:10-04:00,Is Adobe a monopoly in the design industry?Adobe's revenue sees record growth in Q2 2017.How their new subscription model affected revenue.,"Anyone in the creative industry knows that Adobe (ADBE) is the gold standard for multimedia/creativity software. It boasts an impressive 69.86B Market Cap and maintains incredible brand recognition (Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign) to every amateur photographer, graphic designer, and creative professional.ADBE Market Cap data by YChartsWhat Can't They Get Away With?In 2013, Adobe announced that it was converting its popular Adobe Creative Suite software to a subscription based model and the creative world went nuts (source). Meaning instead of paying once for the piece of software, you'd be paying a monthly reoccurring fee in order to use it.Who are Adobe's Competitors?So while the users went berserk, no one could offer a sufficient alternative software that matched Adobe's Creative Suite capabilities. Sure, there are alternatives like Capture One Pro that substitutes Adobe Lightroom and Affinity Photo that is moving up to compete with Adobe Photoshop, but there lacks a comprehensive replacement that scales as much as Adobe's flagship product, Creative Suite.The competitors that do exist primarily compete with the Adobe Creative Suite on only one or two levels. You have rival photo editing companies competing against Adobe Photoshop and page layout software competing against Adobe InDesign, but there lacks a comprehensive system to rival the complete design package Adobe's built.These competitors did try to steal segment customers during the initial 2013 subscription announcements. Competitors like Corel, a primary illustration software company, Xara another primary photo editing software and Quark, a page layout software, all offered promotions to existing Creative Suite users to encourage the switch (source).However, these competitor promotions had little effect on the long-term growth of Adobe's flagship product or share price.Adobe's Subscription Revenue Continues To GrowFor all the uproar over the 2013 Adobe Creative Cloud subscription announcement, there wasn't much backlash in terms of revenue for Adobe. Since Adobe announced their move to a subscription service, revenue has progressively grown for their flagship product. See their June 2017 Investor Presentation.Is Adobe A Monopoly?For the amount of hate Adobe received over the Subscription move in 2013, little of that backlash affected revenue. Simply Adobe held all the cards since their software tightly webbed into the daily workflow of the professional world.We could question if Adobe is a monopoly? Yes, there are competitors to Adobe, but at the professional level, Adobe dominates the industry.Similar to how Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) dominates web searches. 64% of web searches are done on Google and 33.1% are done on Bing and Yahoo combined (source). Yes, Google has competition, but it maintains a solid hold on searches similar to how Adobe maintains a solid hold on the multimedia/creativity software industry.How Is Adobe Benefiting From A Multimedia/Creativity Software Monopoly?At this point, Adobe is its own worst enemy. They even state this in their 2016 Form 10-K as a Risk Factor. ""If we cannot continue to develop, market and offer new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services that meet customer requirements, our operating results could suffer."" If they can't compete with themselves, their products will become stagnant. It's the old tortoise and the hare race, if the Hare (Adobe) slows down too much, they'll be passed by the tortoise.Look at the share price the last 5 years, you'll notice a nice consistent stream of increase in share price. No multimedia/creativity software businesses have the capabilities of Adobe to compete, so Adobe has enjoyed regular growth with few interruptions.ADBE data by YChartsOne of these contributors is the $1.77 billion in quarterly revenue shared in their 2017 Q2 Investor Earnings Report. This is a record in quarterly revenue, nearly $400M more than their Q2 in 2016 (source). $1.21 billion of that comes from Digital Media, which contains their flagship, Adobe Creative Suite's reoccurring revenue.These trending graphs can give us a pretty good indicator that Adobe's revenue will continue with consistent growth while there is little software competition to disrupt their reigning market cap over the multimedia and creative software."

4062780,103035,2017-04-17T12:15:52-04:00,Adobe has successfully transitioned to a subscription-based business model.There is still plenty of opportunity left for Adobe.Continued growth of their Creative Cloud platform should help drive revenue growth and margin improvement.Expansion of Adobe Marketing Cloud will also help drive revenue growth.,"Business DescriptionAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) offers a line of products and services that are used by marketers, creative professionals, application developers, and enterprises. They operate in three segments: Digital Media, Digital Marketing, and Print and Publishing. Below is a breakdown of revenue by segment. Their Digital Media segment consists of flagship products such as: Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Stock. Digital Marketing consists of eight key solutions. These include: Analytics, Target, Social, Media Optimizer, Experience Manager, Campaign, Audience Manager, and Primetime. Adobe's Print and Publishing segment consists of PostScript and PDF products.Source: Company FilingsInvestment ThesisBears believe that the successful transition to a subscription-based business model is already priced in. While that may be true, they are underestimating just how much growth is left ahead for Adobe. My thesis focuses on this opportunity.CatalystsContinued Growth of Adobe Creative CloudThe switch to a subscription-based model has created substantial value for Adobe and its customers. This model will continue to drive revenues and expand margins as Adobe expands their core market into adjacent markets, and continues introducing value-adding services. Adobe estimates the Creative Cloud will have a total addressable market of $19.5 billion by 2019. As of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter, Adobe ended with Creative annualized recurring revenue of $3.76 billion. Because of this, I believe there is still a substantial amount of growth opportunity left for Adobe's Creative Cloud.Source: 2016 Financial Analyst Meeting PresentationAdobe estimates that there are approximately 9 million existing Creative Cloud subscribers. When Adobe disclosed they had 8.6 million (see Figure below) Creative Cloud subscribers, they also estimated that there were approximately 8.3 million people who were still using their Creative Suite product. Assuming that all new additions were migrated Creative Suite users rather than new users, I estimate that there are approximately 7.9 million remaining users on Adobe's Creative Suite base.Adobe can nearly double the number of Creative Cloud subscriptions by migrating their existing Creative Suite users. In addition, these users are already familiar with the product, so there are not as much costs associated with migrating users over to the new platform as there is with targeting and attracting new customers.Source: 2015 Financial Analyst Meeting PresentationThere is also a large incremental opportunity for Creative Cloud with new creative jobs being added every year. Adobe estimates that 675 thousand new creative jobs are added each year and corporations spend nearly $275 billion on creative content. Adobe can leverage their industry-leading applications and take advantage of these opportunities. In addition, the expansion into education offers another great opportunity.It allows Adobe not only to drive current subscriptions, but also allows them to build relationships with the next generation of customers. This is a strategic move because these future generations will likely be more comfortable with their services later in life.This switch to a subscription service has provided their business model with more operating leverage. Adobe no longer must create and copy software onto DVDs, rather they just upload any updates or new product features onto the cloud.In addition, they no longer must package and distribute their products to stores. Thus, most of their costs are fixed. As Adobe grows revenue, it should allow them to further expand margins. I estimate that approximately 57% (digital media subscription revenue of $3.3 billion divided by total revenue of $5.9 billion) of revenue comes from the Creative Cloud, which should allow it to have a significant impact on Adobe's margins.The Creative Cloud is more valuable to customers than the Creative Suite because it gives subscribers access to desktop apps, mobile apps, a marketplace for all creative needs, and access to a community of creative designers. It also gives subscribers ongoing product upgrades and new feature additions, which should further add value as customers will no longer have to shell out thousands of dollars to upgrade their version (all application Creative Cloud subscription costs $50 per month for individuals).To put the subscription's added value into perspective, it took Adobe a little over 13 years to reach approximately 13 million users on the Creative Suite. There are now 9 million subscribers on the Creative Cloud, which was only introduced 3.5 years ago.Adobe will continue to add value to customers with new innovative services. These new services are meant to enhance value for existing consumers, as well as expand their consumer base. Adobe has recently introduced Adobe Stock and has even launched VR features. Adobe Stock simplifies the buying and selling of work for Creative Cloud users. This plan is available as an on-demand or subscription service. It is priced at $10 per image for on-demand use or ranges from $30 to $250 per month for a subscription service.Their newly announced feature, Adobe Sensei, will utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve the creation and delivery of digital experiences. It will also allow users to navigate across Adobe's Creative Cloud and Marketing Cloud services. Adobe's Creative Cloud is creating an entire ecosystem for creative designers to create, share, sell, and sync content across devices, which gives them a competitive advantage over their competitors.Expansion of Adobe Marketing CloudThe expansion of Adobe Marketing Cloud provides another major growth opportunity for them. The total addressable market for this platform is expected to be $40 billion by 2019. Adobe differentiates their platform with an integrated and unique combination of data and content, which enables subscribers to deliver personalized experiences across multiple devices.In their 2016 Enterprise Marketing Software report, Adobe was recognized by Forrester Research as being the industry leader. In addition, they were recognized by industry analysts as being a leader in mobile application development, cross channel campaign management, and enterprise marketing software.Source: 2016 Financial Analyst Meeting PresentationEven with large competitors such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), I believe Adobe will continue to be the leader in this category. Entire industries are experiencing disruption and are aggressively investing in technology that will drive customer loyalty and growth. Customer loyalty is a byproduct of understanding the needs and wants of a customer base. Content and data can both be leveraged to help companies better understand customers' needs. Adobe is known for its ability to offer creative content and has increasingly become the leading big data digital marketing company.This shows that they have consistently increased the number of managed data transactions over the years. In fiscal year 2016, Adobe managed a record 90 trillion data transactions. Since 2012, the number of managed data transactions has increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 55.2%. Adobe can leverage this data to predict consumer and retail trends. As they continue to manage more data transactions, Adobe should further their dominance within this space. Adobe's main competitors, Oracle and Salesforce, do not disclose the amount of data transactions they manage.Source: Company FilingsAdobe's Marketing Cloud offers eight best-of-breed solutions to some of America's largest corporations. As they continue to add new features and enter strategic partnerships, I believe they can further outpace their competition.The figure below shows which industries they serve. In addition to serving many companies, Adobe has driven customers to adopt multiple solutions (in 2014, 66% of their top 100 customers had 3+ solutions, and by 2016, 90% had 3+ solutions), which shows that customers are seeing added value from additional solutions.Source: 2015 Financial Analyst Meeting PresentationAs companies look for ways to invest in data-driven solutions, Adobe will continue driving the adoption of multiple solutions. Solutions such as Adobe Campaign, Adobe Audience Manager, and Adobe Media Optimizer are seeing strong growth because of this. In addition, as of September 26, 2016, Adobe has entered a strategic partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).This partnership will leverage artificial intelligence, machine learning, and advanced analytics so customers can create new data-driven marketing and sales capabilities. It will also allow them to integrate aspects of Microsoft's sales software. This will allow customers to use data in new and more efficient ways. With data increasingly being utilized in marketing and sales, Adobe is positioning themselves well for future success.ValuationSource: Based on my own estimatesAdobe was valued using a discounted free cash flow model. Revenues were projected out 10 years using a CAGR of 12%. In addition, the model assumes operating margin improvement. I believe that Adobe can achieve a peak operating margin of approximately 35% due to the nature of their business. As previously mentioned, the switch to the subscription-based model has helped lower their cost structure. As Adobe continues to grow the top line, I believe the incremental margin on these revenues will be the primary driver of margin expansion.I feel that a 35% operating margin is reasonable, as Microsoft has achieved an average adj. operating margin of approximately 34% over the last seven years, with the high being 40%. Using these assumptions, I have a one-year target price of $151, which offers a potential return of 17% from its current trading price of $129.05.Porter's Five ForcesBuyer PowerAdobe does not have a single customer that accounts for a large portion of revenue or ARR. Their services are used by many organizations including: individuals, creative professionals, governments, schools, and businesses. As previously mentioned, subscriptions start as low as $50 per month. As a result, buyer power is low.Supplier PowerI believe supplier power is low. Although some of their lines of business rely on third-party service providers, Adobe does not rely heavily on suppliers to operate their business. In addition, Adobe enters strategic partnerships, which help maintain relationships with suppliers. Adobe recently entered an agreement with Microsoft, in which Microsoft's Azure cloud will be the preferred cloud platform for Adobe's Creative, Marketing Cloud, and Document Cloud. This partnership will benefit both parties as they leverage their platforms to increase value for customers.SubstitutionThere are not many forms of substitution. Individuals and businesses can develop their own software internally. This is not that likely, as it would require a large investment from corporations. It is also estimated that 90% of creative professionals use Photoshop, so many people are already familiar with Adobe's product. In addition, Adobe gives subscribers access to over 70 million assets. Because of this, substitution is quite low. Because of this, I believe substitution is low.Threat Of New EntrantsThe threat of new entrants is moderate. The main barrier to entry is accessing capital and attracting talent. Once a company enters this industry, it is hard to attract users, as they are loyal to their current providers. Companies within this industry spend large amounts of capital on marketing, which makes it more difficult for smaller companies to compete.Existing CompetitionExisting competition is moderate. Critical factors for this industry are new product innovations, short product life cycles, and price sensitivity. The reason for this is because there are many companies that compete. Companies compete for customers and key personnel, which increases competition. Adobe's main competitors are IBM (NYSE:IBM), Salesforce, and Oracle.Adobe has been named a leader in the marketing cloud by Forrester Research. Their closest competitor was Salesforce, but they have acquired their way into the space. Because of this, they have faced integration problems. Competitors can also cut prices to compete. I believe that Adobe's products are offered at affordable prices, and thus believe this it would be hard for competitors to offer lower pricing than Adobe.RisksI believe the risk of piracy is quite mitigated. One of the benefits of the subscription based business model is a lower upfront fee. Management is confident that subscription offerings have decreased piracy rates because of the low fee and added value that is provided by the Creative Cloud. In addition, Adobe has initiated measures to address piracy such as the shutting down of websites. As Adobe continues to introduce updates and new features, many customers will see the benefit of migration, which should help further mitigate this risk.ConclusionAdobe will be the preferred choice for all creative needs, because they are the only company that helps all the way from the creation through the monetization of a digital experience. Companies are going through a digital transformation and Adobe will utilize their size and well-known brand name to deliver these industry-leading services to their global and growing customer base."

In terms of its share price, the company is valued at just under $120 a share, whilst it continues to expand its market share and its product offerings, including a variety of cloud-based software, with Adobe Document Cloud, and Adobe Sign, a digital signature security system, being amongst the latest. Whilst not what one would term a cheap buy, and accepting the logic of what goes up must come down, there seems to be a level of growth left in this stock, making it potentially worth having in your portfolio this year.Adobe's Belief in the Cloud's $27bn Market. Source: AdobeWhilst Adobe's high price marks it out as anything but a value stock, the company's consistently strong results indicate that something is going very right in California. When Adobe turned its focus toward a subscription model, its CEO Shantanu Narayen took a risk; however, it has paid off handsomely, and as the above slide illustrates, Adobe believes that further investment in the cloud, both in terms of its traditional software development base, and in marketing and analytics, will see revenues continue to rise. At the end of 2016, revenues came in at record levels of $5.85bn, and $4bn of this was subscription backed, offering the company a very stable base on which to build. This means less chance of volatility in quarterly announcements, and in turn gives ADBE extra stability, which translates into strong share price growth.Adobe Share Price Forecast. Source: FTThe company, according to its CEO, believes that it is in a ""sweet spot"" between design and digital transformation, with consistently rising digitalization, personalization, and creative offerings from companies ever more in vogue. Adobe believes its suite of products is the right tool at the right time. That this suite is full of market-leading products that we use every day further strengthens the company's value. Names like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Acrobat fall off the tongue with ease, and whilst Flash seems to be a slowly fading concern, the company's expansion into other markets, including EdTech, audio, and marketing management, where Adobe Marketing Cloud is a market leader, makes it seem like the company has struck the right balance between innovation and stability.Adobe Earnings. Source: FTThe three charts below show the performance of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) vs. the S&P Index (SPX) over the last month, the last year, and the past five years. Each shows the California-based company, with a market capitalization of $59bn, consistently outperforming this measure of the market. Figures taken from Bloomberg charts show that over the past month, Adobe is up 7.8%, as against the S&P's 4.42% (an increase 1.77 times larger). The year-to-date figures are 16.2% vs. 5.65% (an increase 2.87 times larger), with the past twelve months showing 42.7% against 24.21% (an increase 1.7 times larger). In the last five years, Adobe is up a huge 258.07%, whilst the S&P has climbed 73.19% (an increase 3.53 times larger). These are outstanding figures, and analysts, including those at RBC Capital, the Royal Bank of Canada, and the FT, see ADBE as a stock that will continue its excellent half-decade long performance into 2017, with target prices ranging up to highs at the $150 mark, which would be a 20% increase in its current valuation.Adobe 1-Month Share Price Performance vs. S&P 500 - Source: BloombergAdobe 1-Year Share Price Performance vs. S&P 500 - Source: BloombergAdobe 5-Year Share Price Performance vs. S&P 500 - Source: BloombergAnalyst Opinion - Adobe. Source: MarketbeatConsidering the company's key earnings data, the signs remain broadly positive. A forward P/E ratio of 38.73, when compared with its trailing P/E of 51.57, suggests that the market believes there is still room for further growth for Adobe. Revenues and net income are up, debt in relation to total capital is down 7%, cash flows and reserves are up, and so is inward investment. In the last three months, Adobe has also acquired, through M&A, TubeMogul (NASDAQ:TUBE), a company expected to boost its extremely competitive Cloud Marketing service, and, in part, as a result of this acquisition, with these figures taken from Zacks, revenue guidance for the company is also up, from $1.625bn to $1.644bn. Cloud Marketing is also expected to post extremely healthy revenue growth, at levels of 20% to 24%. Over the whole of 2017, revenues are expected to be in the region of $7.09bn, also an upward revision since the turn of the year, from a previously expected level of $6.95bn.Revenue & Income Adobe. Source: FTADBE Cash Flows. Source: FTThere are, of course, some voices in the markets that suggest Adobe is overvalued. Its debts are argued to be too high. Compared to the market at large, so is its P/E ratio. It is also said that its price to sales multiple of 10.3 is far too high in comparison to the broader software industry average of 2.6. These are, of course, legitimate concerns, and since no stock can defy gravity forever, and five years on the up is a long time, there is the risk that Adobe's stock might indeed come to be seen as overvalued. That said, the company's financials are sound, returns on investments are, as per Reuters, at a level of 12.04, as against an industry average rate of 9.55, and the company continues to develop several product lines that are likely to continue to boost its bottom line. If you are looking for a solid medium- to long-term buy, in the anticipation of future growth, Adobe, both because of, and despite, its long history of growth, certainly seems to be a stock worth keeping in your portfolio."

Profits and revenues slumped in the initial transition period, but that phase is finally over. The company is now producing impressive growth. Last week, it reported its twelfth straight quarter of revenue growth driven by growth in its marketing cloud and digital media segments.Adobe’s FinancialsAdobe’s first quarter revenues grew an impressive 22% over the year to $1.68 billion, ahead of the market’s projections of $1.64 billion.

In January, it announced another share repurchase grant for $2.5 billion.Subscription revenues grew 29% to $1.38 billion and services and support revenues grew 2% to $0.11 billion. Product revenues fell 9% to $0.18 billion.By segment, revenues from the Digital Media segment grew 22% over the year to $1.14 billion, with record Creative revenue of $942 million, up 29% driven by strong subscription adoption and retention, strength with Creative Cloud for teams – particularly in Europe – and continued growth with Adobe Stock.

4063100,52472,2017-04-18T13:43:22-04:00,"ADBE is overbought: the stock price is close to the 52-week high, and we expect a cool-off in the following 1-3 months.The 20%+ revenue growth rate, fueled conversion of Creative Suite customers to cloud, is not sustainable in the near-term.Valuation ratios (forward P/E, Price/Sales) are very high compared to the industry peers.","Over the last three months, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) appreciated significantly. Fueled by revenue growth and its last quarter's earnings report, the stock gained 6.57% in the last month compared to S&P 500 loss of -1.84%. Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock's next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Our thesis is the stock is a tad overheated, and we are shorting it at this point until it hits $110 again. Before we dive into our concerns around valuation, let's take a quick look at the big picture-revenue and growth drivers.The Big PictureAt $1.68 billion, Adobe's quarterly revenues increased 21.6% year over year vs. industry average of 5.6%. Since the reported revenues exceeded management's guidance of $1.62 billion, the stock shot massively over the last couple of months. A major driver of the revenue was Digital Media Solutions, which jumped 22% year over year. The Digital Media Segment (with annual recurring revenue of $4.25 billion) exhibited strong growth in the Creative Cloud and Document Cloud businesses.Creative Cloud revenue grew 29% year over year, and is a major growth driver for Adobe. The Document Cloud grew as well, though not as rapidly. Its growth is driven by the adoption of Acrobat subscriptions and additional services such as Adobe Sign. The ADBE management team is particularly optimistic about Creative Cloud and expects to build a strong pipeline for its potential paid subscribers through marketing programs, trial downloads and free memberships. Management expects growth to be fueled by three initiatives: migrating the Creative Suite installed base, drawing new clients and driving ARPU higher through cloud services like Adobe Stock.Our ConcernsWhile Adobe's products are the industry standard for creative professionals, with significant network effects and high switching costs, we think that a large number of legacy Creative Suite users have yet to migrate to Creative Cloud, a pool of customers Adobe is counting on for near- to medium-term growth. Our belief is that the firm still has roughly 8 million legacy Creative Suite users who have yet to migrate to subscription-based products, and we don't see most of that happening in the near term.While Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) discontinued its Expression Studio, a direct competitor to Adobe's Creative Suite, after seven years on the market, competition for Adobe's marketing solutions is becoming very intense. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) runs Oracle Marketing Cloud as a separate division of the company, with its own P&L. Other heavy hitters such as Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and IBM (NYSE:IBM) are also jockeying for the top position in the marketing cloud space-and heavily investing in building out the offering and M&A. We think that Adobe's biggest drawback is lack of sophistication when it comes to client relationship management applications vs. competitors such as ORCL and SFDC.ValuationAt 26x Price to Earnings ratio, ADBE is valued richly. Our thesis is the price is peaking and can't be supported in the near-term, particularly given the near-term challenges around converting creative customers to cloud, and competing against Oracle and SFDC in the marketing cloud space. We think a more defensible price point could be the one where the P/E ratio is comparable to the rest of the industry. Assuming a forward P/E of 22, the price should be equal to $110 per share (our near-term target). Also, Adobe's price/sales ratio is the highest in the industry.We do acknowledge that the company may eventually continue rapid, double-digit growth, and the price we're setting now is strictly for the near-term (those short-term traders looking to capitalize on overbought stocks).To further grow shareholders' returns, Adobe must convert the several million users that remain on legacy Adobe products over to its cloud offerings much more rapidly. Second, the company must execute on its plans to expand its Digital Media addressable market, including new product packages built around Creative Cloud, in the lower segments of the market. Third, the firm will need to invest more heavily in Digital Marketing and fend off competition from the likes of Oracle, SFDC and IBM.Trading StrategyIn summary, our specific trading strategy is to short ADBE until the stock hits $110 again. Our cost to borrow the stock is 3% annually, and we believe we will hit this price target in the next 3 months (corresponding to 0.75% in fees). Overall, the return we're hoping to make is in the ~12-15% range. There are two scenarios under which we'd cover the short: 1. quarterly revenue growth in the upcoming earnings report north of 21%; 2. potential significant M&A moves, i.e., acquisition by a larger company such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Microsoft, although at this valuation ($64 Billion market cap) we don't think this is very likely."
4059708,78545,2017-04-03T02:23:43-04:00,"Adobe's Digital Media segment has benefited from the shift to the cloud, which has led to reduced piracy, more stable revenue, higher margins, and a broader market opportunity.Adobe's Digital Marketing segment has also benefited from a fast-growing industry and unique positioning driven by Adobe's dominant position in content creation.While these factors have led to strong fundamental performance, bears believe the risk/reward is unfavorable, especially given the increased competitive environment in Digital Marketing.","Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has shot through the roof, gaining 279% over the last 5 years. The stock has benefited primarily from the ongoing shift of marketing/media to the internet, as well as Adobe's product shift towards the cloud. As people's eyeballs move towards our screens, advertising and content creation are increasingly following it. In turn, people are increasingly demanding more tools to create, distribute, and analyze/optimize content. Adobe's suite of products is perfectly positioned to address these issues.Given the stock's outperformance, I am going to spend a larger amount of time discussing what has driven recent performance and why investors are so bullish on the stock going forward. I'll then jump into the bear arguments.Bulls tout the large growing market and benefits from the shift to the cloudDigital Media SegmentAdobe's Digital Media segment is comprised primarily of Creative Cloud and its associated products. These apps help professional creatives create and edit content.Context: Prior to 2012, the company was dependent on the product launch cycle. Back then, Adobe sold its products on a perpetual license - you pay a large one-time fee and you get the product forever. This led to very lumpy revenues as sales would jump when they released a new product, then tail off until the next product. It also led to a high degree of piracy given the high up-front cost (if you are familiar with the product, you probably know of at least one person who has pirated it), and a very limited audience that was able to enjoy the product.In 2012, management shifted gears on pricing. They allowed people to pay a subscription fee for monthly/annual use of the product, and could access the product over the cloud. This led to some difficult years in the beginning, as new customers were now paying a significantly lower fee up front (prior model: up-front cost of owning the product forever; new model: up-front cost of access for one month). However, longer-term, Adobe was capturing more value. Finally, Adobe ""bottomed out"" in 2014 (the point at which the drop-off from perpetual licenses to cloud purchases was offset by recurring revenue). The company has now largely transitioned over to most of its customers to a subscription model and is now reaping the benefits, which include:Stable revenue trends: now, fees are paid on a monthly/annual basis and are not based on the product cycle. This leads to higher revenue visibility.Lower piracy: products are now priced with lower up-front costs. The barriers to accessing their products are lower, which now opens the addressable market to more casual users, and makes customers less likely to pirate the product.Higher margins: Normally, software over the cloud would carry with it increased expense related to providing service over the cloud. However, Adobe is positioned favorably as many of its customers continue to use Adobe products on their own drives (and not on the cloud), while still paying the new pricing model. As a result, Adobe's cost structure remains the same, allowing them to benefit from increased leverage of sales and thereby higher margins.Fewer resellers: Adobe also benefits from fewer resellers who might eat away at their margins. Now, the company sells more of its products directly to consumers, allowing them to hold onto profits.More interaction with customers: Adobe is able to maintain a stronger, closer relationship with the customer as they now interact and engage more frequently with them. The prior model involved seeing the customer once for a large purchase before they disappeared offline.Significantly broader addressable market: With monthly fees, more people can afford to use Adobe. This significantly increases the user base and revenue opportunities. In fact, Adobe noted that 35% of its users are new to Creative Cloud.Source: Company filingsMajor growth drivers going forward:In addition to the benefits mentioned above, investors expect several factors to drive growth in the coming years:Market growth: Estimates vary widely on the market size for content creation, from $5B (from IDC) to $20B (Adobe's figure). The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. Estimates are important as it implies how much upside there is for Adobe to capture. Growth estimates also vary widely from mid-single digits to mid-teen growth. The primary driver of the market growth is the continued shift of media online.Market leading position: Adobe has a stranglehold on the content creation market as they provide tools that are considered must-have for creatives. As the market grows, Adobe is expected to grab much of the growth given their leading position. Some estimates place Adobe's market share at a commanding 70%.New users that were previously priced out: With a larger TAM, Adobe is hoping to capture more users that were previously priced out of purchasing the Adobe product. Specifically, management highlighted photo hobbyists and mobile users as additional opportunities on top of their existing creative professional audience.Upselling new customers: With lower tiered pricing, many users are being introduced to Adobe products at inexpensive prices. Adobe is using this opportunity to then introduce them to other products in their suite (in some cases, using promotions) and gradually upselling them. As an example, as a creative with a need to use Adobe InDesign and Photoshop, you might start out with their $50/month package for Creative Cloud. Adobe would then try to upsell Adobe Stock to you, which provides additional stock photos to users either for a fee per photo or for an extra $30 per month, or Adobe Typekit, which offers more fonts. Data points suggest that this strategy is working, as Adobe Stock has grown revenue by over 40% in 2016.Margin expansion: As noted above, Adobe's cost structure for cloud customers is largely the same, but their pricing model allows the company to monetize its product more and broaden its addressable market. As a result, the company should drive significant margin expansion as more customers come onto the platform.As a result of these numerous factors, investors are extremely bullish on the segment. Consensus estimates are for 23% growth in 2017 and 18% growth in 2018.Source: Company filings, brokerage estimatesDigital MarketingAdobe's Digital Marketing segment is comprised of marketing solutions, including analytics, social marketing, targeting, cross-channel campaign management, audience management, video delivery and monetization, and media optimization. It is a complete end-to-end tech solution for the marketing department.Context: The segment started in 2009 with the acquisition of Omniture, a data analytics company. Adobe has gradually built on this product through organic investment and M&A activity, purchasing a bevy of companies to build out their marketing tools and features. Today, the product operates in a more competitive environment than its digital media segment, competing with other large players such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG). However, Adobe has also made impressive gains and now owns the largest market share in the industry at roughly 17% of the total market (compared to 12% for IBM and Salesforce, each).Source: Company filingsMajor growth factors going forward:Unique position in the market: Most competitors in this space provide marketing tools along with sales and CRM tools (i.e. Salesforce, IBM), or alongside media distribution (Google). Adobe positions itself as a provider of marketing tools along with content creation tools. This is a unique position that only Adobe can offer given their strength in Media highlighted above. The company offers a strong end-to-end solution, from creation to distribution. Their position also provides Adobe with an advantage in penetrating new clients given their existing relationships with CMOs and advertising agencies.Cross-selling: In 2014, 66% of Adobe's top 100 marketing customers had 3 or more products (of the company's 8 products), and an average annual recurring revenue (ARR) of $2.8 million. By 3Q16, this had grown to 90% of Adobe's top 100 accounts with an ARR of $4.4 million. The company has a broad product suite and has been able to effectively cross-sell those products to their existing customer base.Market growth: Adobe's Digital Marketing segment operates in a large and fast-growing space. The total addressable market estimates vary from roughly $20 billion to $30 billion. Additionally, the market is expected to grow in the low double-digits, according to industry experts. Gartner expects digital spending to increase from 18% of IT budget to 28% by 2018 as CIOs shift IT budgets towards digital channels. And several banks have forecasted even higher growth for the market as companies shift their marketing strategies towards the online channel.As a result of these factors, investors expect 24% growth in both 2017 and 2018 from the segment. While the growth is higher than the Digital Media segment, note that Digital Marketing is less than half its size in revenue, and therefore contributes less to the company's overall revenue growth.Source: Company filings, brokerage estimatesBears do not like the risk/reward as expectations have crept higherIn general, the bears admit that Adobe's fundamentals have had impressive growth and tailwinds behind them. However, as is usually the case with high growth stocks like Adobe, bears believe expectations are starting to get ahead of the company's prospects and do not like the risk/reward profile. With such high valuation, something like 15% growth vs. expectations of 20% (illustrative figures) would be a big hit to the stock.Valuation and high expectations: As shown in the above charts, investor expectations have crept up with each quarter beat, and Adobe's segments are now baking in high growth estimates. These high expectations are seen in its valuation as well, where ADBE trades at 30x PE NTM and 25x EV/FCF estimates. In order for the stock to move higher, the company will need to at least achieve consensus estimates. Digital Media, in particular, will most likely need to get above 20% growth for 2018. Any signs of a slowdown will hurt the stock significantly.Shift towards lower priced products: While cross-selling is an opportunity for the company, there is some evidence (in the form of declining ARR / customer) that shows pricing pressure more than offsetting any potential upselling in Digital Media. New customers are coming in at lower price points, which could weigh on revenue trends to a greater degree than investors are expecting.Competition in Digital Marketing is heating up: Competition in the Digital Marketing segment is more fierce than in Digital Media, where Salesforce and Oracle are in a heated race to acquire more tools and products to fill their enterprise product suite. Salesforce alone has acquired ExactTarget for $2.5B in 2013 and Demandware for $2.8b in 2016. With significant M&A activity and differing positions in the space, it's unclear who will win. Adobe's segment is likely to continue to grow, but the key question is whether they will be able to continue to hit higher investor expectations for the segment as competition simultaneously increases as well.This article originally appeared on The Non-Consensus."

Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is counting on this growth trend as it continues to expand its digital footprint in the market.Adobe's FinancialsAdobe's fourth quarter revenues grew 23% over the year to $1.61 billion, ahead of the market's projections of $1.589 billion. EPS of $0.90 also was ahead of the Street's estimated $0.86 per share for the quarter. Clearly Adobe has shown how to successfully migrate from a license-based model to a subscription, SaaS-based model.For the quarter, Subscription revenues grew 39% over the year to $1.26 billion and services and support revenues were flat at $0.11 billion. Product revenues fell 22% over the year to $221.93 million. Services and support revenues grew 8% to $124.22 million.Among other business segments, revenues from Digital Media brought in $1.08 billion in revenues, ahead of the Street's estimated $1.06 billion. Within the segment, digital marketing revenues grew 32% to $465 million, compared with the market's projected revenues of $482 million.Annualized recurring revenue for the company grew from $3.7 billion a quarter ago to $4.01 billion. The market was forecasting recurring revenues of $3.97 billion.During the year, Adobe repurchased 10.4 million shares for $1.01 billion.Adobe ended the full year with revenues growing 22% to $5.85 billion and an EPS of $3.01.It expects first quarter revenues of $1.625 billion with an adjusted EPS of $0.87. The Street had forecast revenues of $1.65 billion with an EPS of $0.85. Adobe expects to end the current year with revenues of $6.95 billion and adjusted EPS of $3.75 compared with the market's projected revenues of $7.07 billion and EPS of $3.83.Adobe's TubeMogul AcquisitionEarlier last quarter, Adobe announced plans to acquire video ad-tech company TubeMogul (NASDAQ:TUBE) for an estimated $540 million. TubeMogul was founded in 2006 and offers a programmatic platform to enable agencies and brands to plan, procure and evaluate video advertising spend across all platforms. TubeMogul had listed on the Nasdaq in 2014, but depressed market conditions along with realistic investor valuations had caused its stock to fall from a peak of $22 to nearly $8 apiece. The acquisition will help strengthen Adobe's already strong Marketing Cloud offering. Adobe's Marketing Cloud includes Adobe Primetime, which helps with creating and monetizing video across devices. Adobe expects the acquisition to help it deliver end-to-end advertising and data management services by providing a one-stop shop for video advertising.Despite the upbeat performance, the stock fell 2.5% in after hours trading. It is currently trading at $105.10 with a market capitalization of $52.3 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $111.09 in October this year. It has recovered significantly from the low of $71.27 it had fallen to in February this year."
4056234,75715,2017-03-17T21:42:22-04:00,"Adobe reported fantastic earnings yesterday after market close.The company is expecting a solid 2017 as well, and investors have taken kindly to the news (stock jumped after hours).I rate Adobe a Buy after earnings.","Earnings ReporterMy goal in this segment is to unlock both short-term and long-term growth in stocks that have just reported earnings. These stocks are specifically subject to enormous volatility, as earnings reports are seen (and rightfully so) as a significant display of a company's progression in the market. What I offer you is an analysis of the economic well-being of the company, and whether I think the stock is a buy, hold or sell for either (or both) the short term or long term. To get used to the format of this segment, take a look at my last article on Air Lease (NYSE:AL)After careful consideration, I have rated Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) as a Buy for the short term.What Adobe's FQ1 Results MeanAdobe reported FQ1 earnings after market close on March 16th, and once again, strongly delivered for its shareholders. The company reported revenue of $1.68 Billion, topping expectations by $30 Million, but more importantly, representing a 21.7% revenue increase year over year. Adobe has made some key strategic changes in its recent history (creative cloud being the key), and clearly has seen the fruit of its labor. Earnings per share came in at $.94, which beat expectations by $.07. While beating expectations looks nice and dandy on paper, it is quite meaningless most of the time. Here's why: Reg FD and companies circumventing it. I won't bother with a whole analysis of how companies routinely steer analysts to lower expectations leading up to an earnings call, because the Wall Street Journal has an excellent piece on it right here. The reason why Adobe is seen in such a positive light is because of its performance, its growth, and its potential. This is how the company has been trading as of late:ADBE data by YChartsThe $1.68 Billion figure actually happens to be Adobe's best revenue figure for any quarter, ever. The company managed to break a record for quarterly revenue, with superb support from the creative cloud segment, which generated $942 Million. Becoming a software as a service company has allowed Adobe to bolster its margins and its revenue as well. This explains its operating margin of 33.9% for this quarter compared to last year's 28.75%. Its annualized recurring revenue came in at $4.25 Billion, up a tremendous $265 Million from last quarter. Overall, operating income was up 40% Year over Year, net income up over 42%, and a significant amount of deferred revenue ($2.1B) moving forward. What is driving this unprecedented growth? A consumer shift. According to the CEO Shantanu Narayen:This is absolutely key to Adobe's success. Beforehand, the company would sell its products at a high price but would forego recurring revenue from subscriptions. Now, the entire landscape has changed, and the company is benefiting from stronger margins and a more diverse customer base for its product.And its product is absolutely top notch. Premiere Pro is the top video production software, and was chosen as the official editing tool for the Sundance Film Festival, an amazing accomplishment.Leading document services and photography platforms also help the company cater to a wider-range audience. Its marketing cloud revenue came in at a record $477 Million, which is a 26% increase Y/Y, showing that demand has substantially increased for its products.In terms of guidance, the company made sure not to disappoint. Adobe is anticipating FQ2 revenue of $1.73 Billion, with a 26% growth in Marketing Cloud revenue and 24% growth in Digital Media segment revenue.ConclusionAdobe has performed extraordinarily well over its recent past, and looks poised to continue its historic run. The company's conversion into a software as a service has gone exceedingly well, helping bolster margins and revenue, respectively. The ROIC (as shown below) has also fared well over this period of change:ADBE Return on Invested Capital (Annual) data by YChartsAdobe is a Buy after earnings, and can help an investor gain entry into an incredibly lucrative field: Design."
4030580,75575,2016-12-14T18:16:19-05:00,Adobe releases fourth quarter earnings.Is the good news priced in?Digital future still looks strong.,"Adobe releases fourth quarter earningsAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) releases its fourth quarter earnings tomorrow at 2pm PT with analysts expecting a sixth-straight quarter of 20% plus sales growth.Revenues of $1.59bn are expected from the San Jose, California,-based digital powerhouse, which is certainly achievable on recent performance. However with the stock up 287% over the last five years the stock runs the risk of a technical pullback on an earnings miss or negative news. (Source: Reuters)Some highlights from the company's third quarter earnings release were records in quarterly revenue of $1.46bn, cash flow at $518m, and digital media revenue at $990m.Is the good news priced in?Adobe's investment in the cloud and a transition to a subscription-based service has provided strong returns for investors who put their faith in the switch. However with valuations at 54x earnings and no hint of a dividend, the barriers to entry for new investors are seen as being on the high side at the current valuation of $106/share and investors will therefore have to rely on further price gains in the stock to drive returns.With strong performance comes higher expectation and management will be under further pressure to continue growing the business and may seek out further acquisitions such as the $540 million paid for video advertising leader TubeMogul (NASDAQ:TUBE).(Source: Reuters.com)Adobe said of the purchase: ""Video consumption is exploding across all devices and video advertising is the fastest growing advertising category. Adobe is the leader in video content creation and delivery with its Premiere Pro CC and Primetime solutions. Adobe's acquisition of TubeMogul will enable brands to capitalize on the meteoric shift to online video.""TubeMogul was acquired for just under 10x revenues with negative earnings so Adobe will be looking to streamline this business and get earnings streams moving quickly as it leverages the potential of video.Digital future still looks strongSales growth from Adobe has been impressive and the future of the business looks strong as the company seeks to harness the full potential of the cloud and a growing appetite for mobile, video and digital metrics. Adobe is positioning itself in three key segments: Creative, Marketing and Document Cloud, with all three providing healthy revenues.(Source:Adobe)(Source: Adobe)Alongside the $990m return in the digital media segment, Adobe grew creative revenue by 39% Y-O-Y to $803m and its Marketing Cloud platform returned $404m showing a good product mix in the cash flows.Returns on capital in the digital business space are performing strongly and operating cash flow has moved beyond the transition investment period of 2013-2014 and on current trends Adobe management will be busy putting this excess of cash to work with all the asset-light benefits that tech companies operate with.An interesting new product from Adobe is ""Sensei,"" an artificial intelligence product that combines Adobe's knowledge of media and marketing data with a machine learning framework that they will look to roll out across their products. This approach to AI and smart analytics could streamline their products further and attract new subscribers if they can create real value from such technology.With that in mind, we need to look beyond the current revenue growth and consider a company that is increasing cash flow and diverting it into exciting new products and technologies which could lead to even further expansion.A leaked email earlier this year noted that Adobe had been on a takeover list for Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) so the company may pop up on the radar of other tech giants such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) that are both seeking to infuse all of their products with ""intelligence.""The current valuation of Adobe may be in the clouds but if a technical sell-off arises it would be an opportunity to jump on board an earnings machine that shows little sign of slowing down. Beyond 2017, if the company can continue its double-digit growth in revenues, Adobe at $100 may not seem so expensive. With the company light on assets and generating strong returns there is little value to shareholders in receiving a dividend until the company has completed its digital expansion plans.ConclusionAdobe's stock currently looks high at 54x earnings and currently paying no dividend but the company offers exciting potential in the years ahead through further growth in its digital business areas - some of which are still untapped in terms of their full potential and the moves to artificial intelligence could redefine some of its existing offerings. If growth continues at the current pace that p/e ratio will become irrelevant and any technical correction would be a good opportunity to get involved in the stock for longer-term growth."
4022252,26891,2016-11-10T17:54:31-05:00,Tech stocks continue to feel the pain while the broader market rallies.Disney misses on top- and bottom-line estimates. Twitter COO Adam Bain resigns.Adobe sends TubeMogul's shares higher by 80% after agreeing to buy it for $540 million.Yahoo apparently knew of the breach prior to Verizon's acquisition.,"Tough Day for TechSo far, a reason can't be pinned on why tech has been struggling so much. The NASDAQ fell almost 1% Thursday, and the PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) dropped 1.6%, while the S&P 500 and Dow both finished higher.Here are the one- and two-day performances for some sizable stocks:On Wednesday, we talked about what the impact could be on tech from a Trump Administration, but it doesn't seem like anything that would warrant this type selling in these stocks.Are investors selling the stocks to make room for other momentum plays? Maybe, but they're so large there would have to be a lot of repositioning for that to happen. I'm not going to speculate right now. But the drop is noteworthy, especially when the rest of the market is trading pretty well.Biggest Shock About Disney?That the stock is only down ~3% in after-hours trading, after Disney (NYSE:DIS) missed earnings per share estimates by 5% and came up short on revenue expectations, reporting a YoY decline of 2.7%. The drop takes the stock down near its October lows, but the current after-hours price of ~$92 is still higher than its 52-week low of $86.25.Again, I'm shocked it's not down more.Not long ago, Nielsen reported that ESPN suffered its largest-ever decline in ESPN subs, with a drop of 621,000 for the month of October. This is particularly concerning because it's more than double the average loss of about 300,000 subs per month.This could be part of the explanation as to why NFL viewership has been so bad, but it also comes at a surprising time. There's a lot of catalysts that should be stopping the bleeding at ESPN, not squeezing it dry. A crazy end to the World Series, the NHL and NBA seasons getting under way, the thick of football season. These are catalysts, but they are not helping ESPN right now.Will it get worse? Who knows. If it does though, look out. Disney will not be a pretty performer should ESPN subscriber losses start to accelerate, rather than bottom out like many are hoping.For its part, ESPN says that these numbers aren't counted correctly, with a lot of viewers switching to skinny bundles and the such, but not fully abandoning ESPN. It doesn't matter though. The TV segment was down, and while there was an extra week in last year's Q4 numbers, that's not really the point. We're not nitpicking a percent here or a percent there.There's a very serious shift going on in the way we consume entertainment. ESPN has been a workhorse for Disney for years, and unless it finds a way to stem the bleeding, the stock will have a hard time rallying.Combine that with the potential currency headaches we might have under a Trump regime and Disney could have a number of headwinds blowing it in the wrong direction.I personally have owned the stock for years and would consider myself patient. But watching CEO Bob Iger fade off into the sunset rather than riding off is getting a bit frustrating.I'm not throwing in the towel, and there were some positives. For instance, the company hit record revenues, net income and EPS. Net income grew 12%. That's good. It's positioned well in the studio and in theme parks with its Shanghai location. It's got good long-term catalysts, valuable assets, and I trust that management will be on the right side of the content consumption of the future.But it's the short- to mid-term issues that investors will have to live with.If investors are truly long-term thinkers, scooping up Disney while it's struggling may be a good bet. But they should be prepared for the stock to have a tough time moving higher until it's able to sort out its ESPN mess. At least the valuation is near its lows.Twitter's COO Steps DownShares of Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) are off to another rough day on more bad news Thursday. Well, perceivably bad news anyway. Chief Operating Officer Adam Bain announced his resignation from the company.While many viewed the trio - Bain, along with CEO Jack Dorsey and CFO Anthony Noto - as the group that would lead a resurgent Twitter, that much has yet to materialize. In fact, the opposite has happened, with shares down more than 40% since Dorsey was named the full-time CEO a little more than a year ago.Although shares are up more than 30% from the lows, assuming that's a consolation of any sort.With Bain now out, Noto has shifted over to the company's COO role, where he will continue his work on live-streaming content (a promising arena for Twitter), while the company searches for a CFO to replace him. Until one is found, Noto will juggle the responsibilities of both roles.The latest development continues to show that Twitter doesn't seem to be anywhere near a turnaround. With a seemingly revolving door in its management team, continued lackluster growth and no apparent buyout in sight, what announcement could be next? Will it be good news or bad?While Prince Alwaleed had some promising comments on the property, it largely appears to be in limbo, still searching for its way. The one catalyst investors can hope for is a strong fourth quarter.The company beat on EPS and revenue expectations last quarter, which was a good start, but I think Q4 is sort of make or break it. For instance, how will Twitter grow its users in the future if it can't do so in a quarter where:I mean really, what the heck is going to drive growth more than those catalysts?Adobe Buys TubeMogulTech might be struggling today, but shares of TubeMogul (NASDAQ:TUBE) sure aren't, after the company received a buyout offer from Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE). The $277 million company was offered a buyout price of roughly $540 million in an all-cash deal, valuing the stock at $14 per share and representing an 82% premium.What will Tube do for Adobe?Adobe wants the company to help solidify its leadership in digital marketing and advertising. Tube has been no stranger to growth, either. The company has topped revenue estimates for eight straight quarters, and while it's beat or met earnings per share estimates in six of those eight quarters, it hasn't turned a positive net income.Often times companies sacrifice profits in lieu of sales growth, the latter of which has been pretty impressive for TubeMogul. I think this is a good acquisition for Adobe. Digital display advertising is eclipsing traditional search ad spending while the former market is forecast to roughly triple by 2019. That's where TubeMogul operates and why it makes for a smart pickup by Adobe.Tube's revenues aren't robust necessarily, but they will add to Adobe's in a noticeable way. Given that it's combining with Adobe, perhaps tying the duo together will lead to better solutions for ADBE too, helping to increase its market share.Yahoo Knew of the Breach?The rumor mill has been in full force since it was first made public that Yahoo (YHOO) suffered a security breach and compromised more than 500 million users' accounts.The hack, which only recently came to light, actually happened a few years ago, and it wasn't made public until after Verizon (NYSE:VZ) agreed to purchase the company's core assets for about $4.8 billion.Initially, reports suggested that Verizon might consider asking for a discount to the buyout price in light of this new discovery. Then, management seemingly clarified with investors that that isn't the case, but it wants to see the details of the current investigation.Now, it comes out that ""some Yahoo employees were aware that a state-sponsored hacker had breached its network.""I stand by the notion that had Yahoo known about the hacking pre-buyout, then Verizon has every right to be pissed, especially Tim Armstrong. Armstrong, the CEO of AOL, is heading the acquisition for Verizon, after VZ acquired AOL last year.He seemingly had a good relationship with Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer, who almost had to have known of the breach if others knew of it. How would you feel to buy something, with the seller knowing that it was flawed in some form?The worst part for Verizon is that it's now stuck with Yahoo. Technically yes, it can drop its bid, but given that it was the so-called winner in a multi-month auction process, previous potential buyers would likely step back up to the plate to buy Yahoo if Verizon backed out.It would be one thing if Verizon was the only interested buyer. Then it could force Yahoo's hand for a cheaper price. But I don't know if that's the case in this situation, unless Verizon really is fine with walking away from the table should it come to it.Just the other day, Armstrong was talking about the potential of the two combined properties. Verizon seemingly wants Yahoo, even though this marriage is off to quite the rocky start."

A terribly tragic life cut far too short and a wonderful talent. ""Easy Living"" is as typical a song as any she ever recorded and dates to 1937. It has been recorded by many performers and according to Wikipedia the last recording was made in 2012 by Andrea Molis but the recordings by Ms. Holiday will always be the ones I remember.When Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported its quarter yesterday afternoon, the words of the song came immediately to my mind. If this wasn't easy living, what would easy living actually be? After I got that out of the way to use as a lead in, I thought about another very famous tune that is always associated with Billie Holiday called ""I'll Get By."" If ever there were a quarter that was more than just getting by this was it. And so I had my title and my lead-in both celebrating the talent of one of the best singers of the mid-20th Century. I do try to attribute these songs properly and I found to my surprise that Billie Holiday was not the original artist to record the song. The music is by Fred Ahlert with lyrics by Roy Turk.Companies have released quarterly earnings at all times in all seasons. The most devious I have ever seen was a Siebel release that was a downside announcement that was issued at 4:45PM in New York on a Friday in July with a conference call that started at 6PM. Sometimes, news press releases follow a similar cycle. Silly buggers.Here the exact opposite is the case. I do not imagine that this company will ever have more to brag about than the release that went out yesterday afternoon but it is likely to overshadowed by discussion of macro issues. No doubt, the decision of the Fed has lots to do with the forward valuation of Adobe shares while the results of Adobe have nothing to do with the decisions of the Fed, but this is a company whose shares should be in every portfolio of investors with a long-term horizon.The shares are up almost 7% today and are at a new all-time high and this may not be the absolute best moment to put in a buy order. And while dividends may soon be forthcoming, this is nothing like a yield stock either. But it is a name that should be on the watch list of growth stock investors for purchase at a reasonable time in the market cycle or when it has calmed down from reacting to the quarterly overattainment.I first recommended Adobe shares on this site when the stock was at $86 at the end of February. The shares have delivered modest positive alpha since that time as the IGV is up by 20% since the end of February and Adobe shares are up 22%. Given the business performance of the company over the last three quarters, the shares are relatively cheaper now than they were then and the outlook is clearer and more favorable. For long-term investors who want to own growth stocks with better than average visibility, Adobe is one of the better names to consider.Most quarterly earnings releases are about hype and spin. More than a little time and effort is spent on scripts that are meant as promotional copy and not to enlighten the reader. In this case, however, hype and reality coincided. The fact is to quote company CEO Shantanu Narayen, ""We drove strong revenue and earnings performance in Q3 further distancing ourselves from our competitors."" There are details and nuances and of course issues with valuation that I will discuss in detail below - but frankly that short quote is about all most investors really need to know. If you like beer, it doesn't get much colder than this quarter was for Adobe and if you like champagne well this was the equivalent of Krug's 2003 vintage.As a company like this gets larger it is hard to pull off a quarter that works in terms of all product lines and works on the bottom line as well and actually satisfies investors with regards to guidance. This was one of those kinds of quarters and how soon again it can be repeated is not really knowable at this point.As with everything there were some standout elements to this quarter that are worth reprising but the point to make here is that despite the company's size there were literally no areas of regret or might have beens. And readers can know what kind of quarter it has been when the CFO, Mark Garrett, tells investors and analysts that he is ""encouraging them not to raise your EPS models right now and please wait until we provide '17 revenue and earnings guidance later this year."" In other words, we will tell you when to go hog wild. That being said, most analysts will raise their numbers for fiscal '17. It is how models work for a subscription company in that when the base is higher, and the growth rate assumed is consistent, then the outcome will also be higher.How they got there?No, I will not review every number amongst the many that were published. I will tread lightly in reviewing the company's competitive positioning. I did that in an earlier report and things have only gotten better since that point. In many cases, Adobe is the dominant or even the only player in its markets. It probably faces its most significant competition in the marketing cloud - but it is still managing to grow more than 20%+ in that space although there are other participants that are probably growing a little faster.Adobe operates in three basic ""clouds"" or product families  - Creative, Marketing and Document. Probably most readers are familiar with Creative  - that is the product area that includes Photoshop and allows users to find the images in Adobe Stock and in general allows users to develop visual experience for more or less anything they want to do. The Adobe Marketing Cloud is based on many acquisitions, most importantly being Omniture that was the pioneer and largest company in the web analytics space and Neolane which was a company that had developed software for Cross-Channel campaign management. The Document Cloud is probably best known for Acrobat but Adobe Sign is becoming an important contributor to revenue as well.Most observers look at the increase in Annual Recurring Revenues as the best indication of Adobe's sales success in the quarter. Obviously, at some point, ARR will actually come very close to matching Adobe's annual revenues. Digital media ARR, which includes the Creative Cloud, grew 29% year on year and the ARR increase of $285 million, or 8% sequentially was on target. The Creative Cloud itself grew by 39%. The growth of Creative Cloud is multifaceted. Retention rates were higher than planned. The Annual Revenue Per Unit (ARPU) has risen across all commercial offerings as users move from promotional to normal pricing. The company also has enjoyed success in combating piracy and Adobe Stock has proven to be a very successful acquisition and addition of the product line. At this point, the Creative ARR is more than $1 billion greater than the peak annual Creative revenue when the company sold its software outright. A growing market, more functionality including mobile and Stock, greater market share because of improved functionality and just outright better marketing and less piracy - not too much more to wish for, I suppose.How long can the company keep growing Creative Cloud at this kind of rate? Simple answer - as long as there are millions of users both in the US and increasingly abroad who still have to migrate from Creative Suite. The growth of the Creative Cloud, as measured by the ARR of that particular product line, will slow down at some point but not for the next couple of years, apparently. At that point, some of the more far ranging product initiatives that CEO Shantanu Narayen discussed during the call will likely be ready for prime time and ought to take up the slack. But as much as anything else, the growth of Creative Cloud is allowing the company to continue its investments while enjoying visible scale economies.The Marketing Cloud had a strong quarter. Did it grow faster or as fast as Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in the space? It is very hard to measure because of the transition from perpetual to subscription licenses ongoing in this component of the Adobe product line. As shown in the reference above it gets very high marks in the Forrester Wave. My own anecdotal checks suggest that Adobe was very successful indeed within its marketing automation space. The company's reported revenue growth of 10% was ahead of target according to management - basically because business came in sooner than forecast. Subscription revenues grew by more than 25% and subscription bookings while not reported were apparently well above plan. The company has a new measurement for compensation that should help to convert bookings into reported revenue more quickly going forward.Document cloud has the smallest revenues of the three segments and it reported revenues that were sequentially flat at $187 million for the quarter. But it had a significant ARR increase of $27 million or 6.5% from the prior quarter which equates to ""real"" growth of 25%. Neither Acrobat or Sign are exactly the most exciting things people think about when they look at this company but the increasing ARR which is now $442 million is creating a stable source of profitable revenue.The Real Secret of the QuarterAgain, simply put it was operating leverage at scale. Adobe is the first of the larger cloud companies to make a significant amount of profits both GAAP and non-GAAP. The three major operating expense categories all showed improvements both year on year and sequentially. Research and Development expense came in at 17% this past quarter, which is down from 18% in the year earlier period. Sales and marketing expense dropped from 35% to 33% in this latest period. And general and administrative expense dropped a bit from 10% to 9.8%. There has to be some number, out of so many, that is improving more slowly than the others. Overall, GAAP operating margin grew by 500 bps to 25% despite the addition of a record 500 heads this past quarter. Now that is economy at scale! And that is the reason for the earnings beat and the guidance raise.So far as the company has indicated, there is nothing anomalous about these numbers that represent a one-time benefit. It is just what happens when a cloud model starts to mature. Adobe has been at this transition for five years now and they have pulled it off. At the end of the day, there is something qualitative as well as quantitative when a company of some maturity, with no restructuring or change in product offering, can achieve that kind of GAAP margin improvement. As I said earlier, it is difficult to imagine that this kind of improvement will be seen again in a single quarter in the foreseeable future which is why the CFO was at pains to attempt to rein in expectations.Adobe has cash balances of more than $4 billion currently and it has debt of $1.9 billion. The company bought back $400 million of stock last quarter and still maintained its cash balances. It has another $800 million in share repurchase authorization.Cash flow from operations ballooned by 44% year on year. That is not a function of any increase in stock based comp as that was actually down marginally year on year. And the change in operating assets/liabilities was not a material factor either although it was less a negative this year than in the prior period. The big drivers of cash flow growth were the improvement in profitability and the growth of deferred revenues. Those should both continue into the future and it seems highly likely that CFFO will be significantly greater in Q4 than it was in this past quarter. The company's capex of $55 million last quarter left free cash flow at $462 million which certainly seems enough to provide for a dividend in addition to share repurchase depending on management priorities.Some thoughts on the outlookAs mentioned earlier, Adobe chose to increase its EPS guidance significantly for this current quarter although it left its revenue guidance consistent with the prior consensus. The company hasn't guided for its 2017 expectations. I think most observers really focus on the increase in ARR when evaluating the success of the company's sales activities. The company doesn't explicitly forecast ARR growth although it did forecast that the ARR growth of Digital Media will exceed $300 million for the quarter providing an exit rate of $4 billion. The math suggests that this is an annualized 34% growth in ARR and I doubt that anyone would think that such an estimate ought to be increased. I would be surprised to see ARR growth percentage continue to sustain 34% growth, but the wind is full in the sails of that product family.The company's marketing cloud has the greatest potential in terms of seeing reported revenues jump above expectations. The new comp scheme that I have mentioned (basically there is a spiff for signing customers to annual contracts that are billed once a year) is leading the company to achieve a greater flow of annual payment bookings which means that revenues and bookings should match more closely. That is why the 30% growth forecast in reported revenues might be exceeded in this business segment. And I assume that with the strong growth in ARR last quarter, there will be a nice jump in reported revenues in the document cloud and I have no reason to think that the transition of Acrobat and Sign to cloud based services will not continue for the foreseeable future.As mentioned earlier, the company will not give guidance for its fiscal 2017 year for a bit and it has cautioned analysts from raising their expectations. I find myself under no similar injunctions.Consensus revenue growth next year had been forecast to be 21.6% prior to the quarterly earnings release. I do not think it will change all that much although the growth in ARR overall has exceeded estimates. It is the absolute size of the creative cloud that might deter an increase in estimates - one wonders just how many people there are who want to Photoshop which has graduated to the status of a verb so far as I can tell. But my younger acquaintances just keep surprising me with what they can do with the technology and what they want to do with the technology. The company had the chance to talk about the macros in the world and said they saw no impact. The company reported no material FX impact.Adobe had been forecast to enjoy a significant increase in operating margins in its fiscal 2017 in any event. Non-GAAP EPS had been forecast to rise from $2.87 to $3.81. As the company is now forecasting about $3.00 in EPS for this year, it seems reasonable to suggest that much of the upside this year will be carried into FY 2017 estimates. I imagine the consensus for the year in terms of earnings will settle out at a bit above $4 at some point regardless of the admonitions of the CFO.ValuationIn the period when Adobe was transitioning from one model to its current cloud based model, the shares were difficult to value because both reported revenues and EPS were suppressed. Although most of that is in the past, there is still some of that going on in the marketing and the document clouds. So the numbers to an extent inflate the valuation metrics which would otherwise be a bit more reasonable than is presented by the raw numbers.The company currently has 504 million shares outstanding and it is trading around $107/share as I write this. So that is a market cap of $54.9 billion. It has net cash of $2.5 billion which brings the enterprise value to $52.4 billion. The consensus sales forecast for fiscal '17 is currently $7.1 billion which yields an EV/S of 7.4X. Not cheap to be sure, but this is a profit making, cash generating company unlike some other highly valued growth names.The PE based on what I expect to be the 2017 consensus non-GAAP is 26X. The GAAP based P/E is moderately higher as stock based comp is running at 5%+ of expected revenues. Again, the P/E is not the greatest bargain to be seen although again, it is a real P/E and has a lower percentage of stock based comp than is the case for many other tech companies.I have consistently written that in my view, the most objective measures at which to look include CFFO and its growth and the free cash flow yield. For nine months, CFFO is standing at about $1.49 billion, a CFFO margin of 32%. My guess is that CFFO will show a decent sized sequential increase in Q4 based on the upward earnings guidance. Last year the sequential increase in cash flow Q3 to Q4 was almost $100 million. Using that as a base line would bring CFFO for the year to $2.09 billion and would bring free cash flow for the year to just below $1.9 billion. That is a free cash flow yield on current year numbers of 3.6%. Cash flow to a greater or lesser extent ought to track the growth in earnings next year which has been estimated at 33%. I will use 30% as a guess - and forecasting free cash flow a year in advance is most certainly a guess  - and that yields a free cash flow yield of 4.6%. Again, not the greatest ""value"" but given the scarcity value of mid-size momentum growth names that are profitable, this one seems to have a lot going for it in terms of achieving positive alpha."
4021066,98236,2016-11-08T11:39:16-05:00,"Adobe is the leader in providing creative software to consumers and to enterprises, and it's a leader in the marketing automation field.The company held its analyst day last week. Takeaways were simply that the company was keeping on, with financials continuing their steady upward cadence.The company's transition to a subscription model is almost complete, and 83% of revenues now come from recurring sources.As a result, cash flow metrics have been rising strongly and seem to be doing so at rates beyond those understood by many.It is likely that the company will be a leader in providing software to provide for VR and 3D experiences and it is beginning to offer nascent AI capability.","Adobe - A case of Ol' Man RiverI first became involved in Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) when it bought a company that had been a burr under my investment saddle, called Omniture. At the time, many observers thought it was crazy - see the Wall Street Journal article highlighted. Here it is a few years later, and the $2 billion purchase seems to be one of the better bargains in the software world.When Adobe decided to move all of its solutions to the cloud and to essentially tear up its business model, it was derided for being so bold by other observers. A few years on, basically the entire world is following that trail.At the moment, the real issue for Adobe is finding new worlds to conquer. What does a company of this scale and with this track record do for an encore? And that was the question the company wanted to address, at least at a high level, when it held its analyst day last week.Before readers think that there was some kind of Rosetta Stone like disclosure during the course of the presentations - which filled up hours with many graphics and pictures - no such thing happened. If you knew Adobe before, you still do. The event is called Adobe MAX and it is more of a conference for developers than an event for analysts. If you are a company that sells creative solutions, it is important to show developers what can be built on the platform. And developers, being human or almost so, enjoy the many opportunities that San Diego provides for recreational activities of almost all kinds.Even though the analyst event was neither full of surprises nor disclosures, I was asked by some readers on this site if I might review the event, and it makes a nice break from reviewing torrents of numbers that animate earnings release after earnings release. But the estimates for this company have not and will not change materially in the wake of the analyst meeting. Most expectations were and remain that - the company is growing its reported revenues in the low 20% range and its operating margins are rising slowly as well. The presentation was designed to offer a point of view that suggests that this cadence of growth can continue for several years to come. If you felt that way before - and I have - then you still will. If you need to be persuaded, well, these kinds of events rarely do the trick in that regard and this one was no exception.I confess that as a bit of an old curmudgeon, the event doesn't do as much for me as it does for some. I have never used Photoshop or any other part of the creative cloud - or at least not personally - and I haven't found it all that easy to find appropriate pictures with which to illustrate my articles on this site. I am just not that sure about which photo might best illustrate a free cash flow yield and pictures of currency do not stir my creative juices. Adobe Stock has millions of pictures to choose from, but it is hard to put everything into pictures. The company has now announced that it will incorporate 18 million photos from Reuters into its content portfolio and will be receiving another 4,000 photos daily. That is about the level of information to be had from these events which really isn't likely to or should be expected to move share prices.It used to be that it was possible to approach executives during the breaks at these interminable sessions and hopefully find a quote. Those days are long past for a company of this scope. There are companies where the analyst day may be of significance in terms of presenting a new business model or an alternative strategic direction. I expect that the analyst day at Teradata (NYSE:TDC), a far smaller and far more controversial company with the aspiration of achieving a dramatic inflection, may be such an event.But the Adobe analyst event was no such meeting, and the shares barely budged in the wake of the presentation. Merrill raised its price target on Adobe. It is well loved by many investors (92% institutional ownership) and commentators, and it is simply hard to move the shares in the wake of a ""feel good"" event.Just for the record, the event specifically reaffirmed guidance, both for the company's current quarter that ends on 11/30 and for fiscal '17 that starts December 1. Specifically, preliminary numbers that were forecast at the event were for revenues of $7 billion and for EPS of $3.75 (non-GAAP) for the fiscal 2017 period. Those numbers are marginally below the currently published consensus, but it is expected by almost everyone who follows the company or who owns the shares that the commentary was meant to suggest that current expectations are consistent with or a bit less than internal forecasts for the company. This event was not meant to portray any problems with the model, and anyone who might misread management statements would have been disabused by the context in which the forecast was delivered.Adobe shares are up 16% YTD and are up 25% since I first recommended the name back in February. I claim no special prescience - the market went down in February before turning around, and I recommended Adobe before it went all the way back up. But regardless, ADBE's shares have tracked the major software/tech index, IGV, relatively closely with a moderate upside bias. IGV is up 10% or so, YTD, and up about 22% since the end of February. The question I will address in the balance of this article is whether ADBE's shares have more positive alpha and what is their level of risk in the light of the discussion/presentation the company made during its analyst meeting.And just for those interested, the lead in to this article is the song from the musical ""Showboat,"" first staged in 1927 and written by Oscar Hammerstein and Jerome Kern and re-staged many, many times through the intervening years. And these days, Adobe reminds me of nothing so much as that Ol' Man River who just keeps rolling along. If there is anything that might stop either the river (the Mississippi) or the company, it isn't really apparent what it might be.The TAM, the whole TAM and nothing but the TAMI think writing in early November, it is straightforward to suggest that Adobe has turned itself into an execution machine. The company holds a dominant position in its major markets and its major markets have continued to grow significantly. The transition to subscription revenue is essentially complete outside of the business that Adobe calls its document cloud where perpetual and OEM revenues still represent 40% of revenues. At this point, recurring revenue has reached 83% of the total, up another 900 bps in this current year.As some readers may be aware, there is a new FAS with regards to subscription revenue that is to become effective shortly. This new regulation will tend to hasten the recognition of subscription revenue particularly for some larger and more unique enterprise agreements. The company is planning to use FAS 606 as its revenue recognition standard in fiscal year 2019 and it will provide transition forecast before that time.Like Gaul in the days of the Romans, Adobe's business and its revenue opportunity are divided into three significant but unequal parts. Clearly, the most important business at this time for Adobe is the creative cloud.I have written at some level of detail about the company's business in the first piece that I wrote about the company. Again, there is nothing strikingly different that was portrayed in the November analyst day.What Adobe calls digital media remains the largest revenue driver for the company, and it has continued to develop substantial growth as the economy creates more creative jobs as ADBE recaptures users who have used pirated software and as it continues to convert its installed base to its new subscription offerings. The creative cloud represents about 50% of total revenues, and the document cloud represents an additional 14% of revenues.Not too surprisingly Adobe is currently focused on 3D content creation and VR capabilities. No one really can forecast with any degree of accuracy or specificity the potential for those capabilities. What is perhaps more reasonable to suggest at this point is that Adobe is going to achieve more than its share of what that market turns out to be. And it continues to focus on replicating its capabilities for mobile platforms which is driving increased business volumes currently and has been one of the more successful product initiatives in recent years.Adobe has forecast that its market opportunity in Digital Media will be $24 billion by 2019. About 40% of the total that ADBE will attain is expected to come from existing customers expanding their consumption of both new and current Adobe products. The ability that the company has had to expand its annual revenue per user (ARPU) continues to be something of envy for many software vendors who find that their ARPU declines because of price competition.In an all-day session like this, there are many numbers presented, and many of those numbers are redundant and are difficult to reconcile because of inconsistent definitions. I will try to briefly discuss the outlook for the three clouds which hasn't changed substantially over the past several months. Overall, Digital Media, which includes both the creative cloud and the document cloud, is expected to achieve an ARR of $4 billion by the end of the year, up more than 35% from its run rate at the start of fiscal 2016. The bar chart presented as part of the investor presentation (slide #32) represents revenue growth really does look like a representation of a mighty river in full spate. At this point, while there are competitors in the space, none of them have a complete library of capabilities that matches Adobe. Because of its market position, the company has been able to charge prices more befitting those of a monopolist - but in this case a benign monopolist who tends to reinvest surplus profitability back into product development expenses that remain at 17% of revenues on a GAAP basis.Adobe lumps its document cloud with its creative cloud for reasons that are not immediately apparent. The transition to a subscription model is not as far along as it is elsewhere in the Adobe universe, and so while annual recurring revenue is rising at 20% or more, reported revenue has been flat or down slightly. Needless to say, at some point, the ARR metric will pass revenues which will then inevitably start to rise significantly. Given the current size of the company and its overall growth rate which in dollars is about $1.5 billion/year of new revenues, the specifics of reported document cloud performance are simply not terribly important. That being said, the best-known offering of document cloud, Adobe Acrobat, continues to see 13% unit growth with some increase in pricing as users turn to the subscription model and add functionality. The company has seen enormous growth in the Sign application on mobile devices and the overall growth of the document cloud in the enterprise has been 31%.Adobe has and continues to refer to its TAM based on both its core market as it exists today and the expansion of that TAM through what it describes as value creation as well as the opportunity it has to sell new products to existing customers and value expansion which is essentially new products. The digital media market, including the document cloud, is said to be worth $24 billion/year by 2019, and the ARR that Adobe has sold is just passing $4 billion. It might be interesting to note that at this point there are still 7 million users who are paying maintenance of the Creative Suite and who will eventually convert to the creative cloud. So, the runway is enormous, and given the demonstrated capabilities the company has seen shown in terms of execution, I think the ability Adobe has to continue to achieve reported revenue growth of 20% with ARR growth of 25% in its overall Digital Media business seems to be a reasonable forecast.Adobe's marketing cloud is about 30% of the company's revenues even though it has a greater TAM ($40 billion/year) than the digital media component of its business. The major factor leading to that kind of result is simply that the company has far more competition in the marketing space than it does in any of its digital media offerings. One of the issues I have always had with these massive analyst meetings is the unwillingness of management to discuss the competitive landscape - which is mainly what analysts want to know. In the Marketing Cloud, Adobe obviously competes with most of the other major software vendors and, in particular, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL), IBM (NYSE:IBM) and SAP (NYSE:SAP), all of which have acquired major cloud players in the space over the years and are busy cobbling together integrated solutions based on their own platform. Adobe said about the same thing regarding its platform and how it is differentiated that its major competitors say about their own offerings.Management is forecasting that through the extension of its solution offerings, primarily it is going to increase the TAM of its Digital Marketing space by almost 50% to around $40 billion in 2019. Will that happen? TAMs are very slippery things and they rarely stand up and tell you what they are in advance. I might be skeptical as to the precise quantifications here, but it really doesn't matter - there is plenty of TAM for Adobe to grow at rates above 20% for years to come and that is all that is necessary to know or believe.In addition to platform vendors, there are almost an innumerable variety of specialist vendors who automate one part of the marketing task and are considered to be best of breed. Is Adobe better than all of them? Does Adobe have a secret sauce? Probably not. But what it does have is lots of momentum, a great reputation and many references and its overall ability to execute. The TAM for all of what the company does in marketing automation including personalization, content, data and analytics and advertising is forecast to be $40 billion by 2019, and Adobe is likely to have revenues in the space of about $1.8 billion. The company is forecasting that it will grow its annual subscription value in the cloud for marketing by 30% next year and increase reported revenues by 20%. Those seem to be reasonable, if not conservative expectations, that the company ought to be able to at least meet and most likely surpass.Neither the competition nor the ability to execute has changed in the space for years. Does CRM have a greater product footprint this year than in the past? Do companies such as Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) or HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) impinge on the TAM? While the answer to both of those questions is yes - does it matter with regard to the ability Adobe has to maintain or even accelerate its growth rate? I think the answer is no, because the opportunity is so large that no one company is likely to sell the preponderance of marketing automation solutions.Adobe's valuation is squarely built on expectations of maintaining a CAGR several years of 20%-plus. The major risk to that expectation is that some of the newer initiatives such as virtual reality and 3D content creation will not prove to be major demand drivers. I have no way of objectively saying whether they will or will not. The company's mobile initiative has proved to be more successful than it had planned and it is certainly possible that the same will be true for its other initiatives. But aside from the risk of not being able to get revenue traction from newer products, Adobe faces fewer obstacles to continued growth than most other large/medium cap IT growth names and that is the source of its valuation.Valuation and all thatThere are many kinds of investors looking for companies that fit one kind of profile or the other. Adobe at this stage of its progression is not likely to see some major unforeseen inflection in its growth rate or its profitability. The shares have quadrupled over five years - this is no unknown, under-followed name residing in a dusty corner. It is and is likely to continue to outgrow some of the other large-cap software names such as Oracle. But this company is still far smaller than Oracle or SAP - it will not run out of runway any time soon, and so long as the creative cloud TAM continues to expand and so long as users invest in marketing automation, this company will have years of growth above 20%. What is that worth?Adobe's shares do not come cheaply by the standards of many. The company currently has 504 million shares outstanding so its market capitalization at last night's closing price of $108.66 was $54.8 billion. With $2.5 billion of net cash, most held offshore, the company has an enterprise value of $52.3 billion. That is an EV/S of a bit greater than 7X based on expectations of $7.1 billion in revenues over the coming year. Definitely not cheap.With the company and analysts forecasting non-GAAP EPS of a bit over $3.80, the P/E based on expected earnings is 28X. The company has a non-GAAP tax rate of 21%. That is not terribly surprising given the strength and profitability of the company's non-US operations. Non-GAAP operating income is currently bolstered by about 17.5% due to stock-based comp. That number has declined significantly from 23% in the prior year so reported numbers understate the rate of earnings growth. Overall, non-GAAP operating margins are continuing their climb that began as the transition to a subscription model passed an inflection point in 2014. Last quarter non-GAAP margins were 33.5%, up from 29.7% the prior year. GAAP operating margins increased from 20% to 25%. That performance was really not driven by any outlying factor. Revenue growth continued to be faster than the growth of OpEx and gross margins, which are mainly coming from subscription revenues reached 86%, up from 84%.How high can margins realistically reach? I do not think it is a question that can readily be answered. Subscription software companies such as Adobe do not have lengthy operating histories. And Adobe has a rapid growth rate at scale which perversely depresses gross margins to an extent. Observers can only guess at the average installation period for creative cloud seats since the product hasn't been offered long enough to evaluate how long users will continue to pay subscription fees, on average.How fast can CFFO and free cash flow grow? Without understanding the longevity of product licenses, it is more or less impossible to compute any kind of reasonable growth rate estimate for those metrics. It is my contention that many complaints about the valuation of these shares stem from incomprehension as to what the business model of a secure company that gets 85% and more of its revenues from subscription might look like.During the course of the presentation, Adobe presented a chart which showed a lovely green colored bar that suggested operating margins might reach 50%. If the average term of subscription revenues is long enough, then that will surely happen. And if it does, cash flow growth will be far higher than is projected by some.The company is seeing a rapid growth in its cash flow based on rapid expansion in both GAAP profitability and a substantial increase in deferred revenues. Stock-based compensation actually declined slightly year on year in the last quarter although it is still 16% of CFFO.In addition to the growth in deferred revenue, the growth in unbilled backlog also is significant and would appear to be likely to surpass 30% this year. Overall, the sum of deferred revenue, unbilled backlog and reported revenue shows a company growing at significantly faster rates than the numbers currently being reported or anticipated.During the presentation, management presented a slide (#94 actually) that forecast that CFFO would reach $2.200 billion for the year. CapEx only runs at $240 million/year, so free cash flow for 2016 should track close to $2 billion, providing investors a free cash flow yield of just less than 4% on enterprise value. Not cheap certainly - but reasonable enough for a company with reported growth of greater than 20% and substantial increases in unbilled backlog as well. Unbilled backlog grew by 32% in the prior fiscal year and is likely to grow at comparable rates this year.The company has so far chosen to return capital to shareholders via share repurchases which escalated significantly last quarter. There is no particular reason why Adobe cannot pay a dividend having significant cash flow to fund a dividend that might provide a 2% yield to investors at a 50% payout ratio. While Adobe has been built on the back of long-ago acquisitions, it has not chosen to enter the consolidation bazaar lately. Its last purchase of note was Fotolia, which is the foundation of Adobe Stock. It may be that the company's capital return policies are based on securing capital to make an acquisition.As many readers may be aware, Adobe appeared on a recent list of potential acquisitions presented to the board of Salesforce. I think the odds of such a transaction are minimal. At the very least, the two companies are comparable in size, and it's hard to see how levered the debt marketplace might allow Salesforce to reach. It would be an excellent merger in terms of putting together the two leaders in the marketing automation space - but it is not likely to happen. Investors should pay no merger premium for Adobe's shares.At this point in an article, it would seem customary to do some price target calculations. I simply will not do that because of the uncertainties involved in trying to project the growth of free cash flow for years into the future. I doubt that free cash flow will grow at a consistent rate of 42% - last quarter's growth rate in that metric. But given the trajectory of margins, revenues and deferred revenues, cash flow growth is going to be much higher than many investors realize, and this company should have a relatively low weighted average cost of capital because so much of its revenues already are subscription based. I doubt that anyone has a reasonable handle on just how long Adobe will be able to grow its CFFO at very elevated rates.It is my view that Adobe's shares continue to offer investors consistent positive alpha despite what seems to some to be an elevated valuation. The math suggests that the shares are actually cheaper now than they were at the start of the year because of the rapid growth in cash flow which is significantly greater than the increase in the share price. The elevation of the valuation is in the eyes of the beholder, and my contention is that the profitability and cash generation potential for a mature, well-run SaaS company at scale have yet to be seen."

Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) continues to expand its offerings within the segment and is thus delivering strong financial results each quarter. It recently announced its third quarter results, and this was the tenth successive quarter where it reported revenue growth.Adobe's FinancialsAdobe's third quarter revenues grew 20% over the year to $1.46 billion, ahead of the market's projections of $1.45 billion. EPS of $0.75 also was ahead of the Street's estimated $0.72 per share for the quarter. Clearly Adobe has shown how to successfully migrate from a license-based model to a subscription SaaS-based model.For the quarter, Subscription revenues grew 40% over the year to $1.17 billion and services and support revenues were flat at $0.11 billion. Product revenues fell 34% over the year to $0.18 billion.Among other business segments, revenues from Digital Media came in at a record high of $990 million with Creative revenue growing 39% over the year. At the end of the quarter, Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue came in at $3.7 billion. Adobe Marketing Cloud also achieved record revenues at $404 million, growing 10% over the year. But competition in the Marketing Cloud segment is heating up. Earlier this year, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) expanded its presence in the marketing cloud space with the $2.8 billion acquisition of Demandware. Oracle too has been building its marketing arsenal with acquisitions including AddThis, Responsys, DataLogix, BlueKai and Eloqua over the past few years. But Adobe has an advantage as Gartner admits that it is the leader in the Magic Quadrant for Digital Marketing Hubs.For the current quarter, Adobe expects to earn revenues of $1.55 billion-$1.60 billion with an EPS of $0.83-$0.89. The market was looking for revenues of $1.575 billion with an EPS of $0.78.Adobe Expands Creative OfferingsAdobe is expanding its digital offerings by including features like Virtual Reality (NYSE:VR), 3D, motion graphics and character animation within its Creative and Marketing cloud services. The new features will be supported by tools to deliver, measure and monetize TV and film content across multiple screens. The features in the next release of their products will include auto-aware VR that is able to seamlessly detect and apply the correct setting to stereoscopic and monoscopic media. The service already includes video playback support, dynamic ad insertion and content protection via Adobe's Virtual Reality Digital Rights Management.Within 3D content, Adobe is now showcasing a 3D rendering engine that will increase the pace and efficiency of 3D content generation. The platform now allows artists to create editable 3D elements such as text and shape layers intuitively from within After Effects CC with new Cinerender technology from MAXON. Adobe also is improving the live motion-capture tool for Puppet creation and animation with Character Animator through integrated functionality between Adobe Photoshop CC and Adobe Illustrator CC.The Adobe Creative Cloud will now allow post-production teams to move freely across applications without interrupting the creative flow. The real-time playback in a new After Effects video preview architecture also will allow users to play raw footage in real-time. The Premiere Pro CC now provides HDR10 metadata support for editing and delivering HDR10 for new HDR-enabled TVs and displays.Within analytics, Adobe Analytics for Video will allow users to measure streams instead of just video starts and stops and thus deliver a more comprehensive view of how videos are consumed. The system also allows for collaboration of teams through Team Projects that integrate collaboration features including version control and smart conflict resolutions, and allows editors and artists to work simultaneously.Adobe also is expanding its video experience offering. Earlier this week it announced a tie-up with Foster City-based Conviva, a leader in over-the-top (OTT) experience management for media companies. Through the agreement, Adobe will be able to closely monitor the video quality of ads served via Adobe's ad insertion platform to help Adobe Primetime customers maximize consumer engagement and revenue.Its stock is trading at $106.54 with a market capitalization of $53.7 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $104.16 earlier this month. It has recovered significantly from the 52-week low of $71.27 it had fallen to in February this year."

Microsoft has long-term benefits from Adobe’s defection to Azure.Microsoft's new hybrid CRP/ERP software product is going to use Adobe Marketing Cloud as its preferred marketing partner.Adobe could help Microsoft gain ground against ERP industry leaders Oracle, SAP, and NetSuite.","Design software leader Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is shifting its Adobe Marketing Cloud, Adobe Creative Cloud, and Adobe Document Cloud services to Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure platform. Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced this new partnership at Microsoft's Ignite event in Atlanta, Georgia.Adobe is a high-profile recruit for Microsoft Azure. Others may follow. Adobe used to be featured client of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services and Nadella made it join the Azure camp.The switch to Microsoft Azure is more than just about pricing. Amazon is the king of low-margin services/products. Microsoft did something more than just offer a lower fee to instigate Adobe's switch to Azure.In return for Adobe's cloud platform business, Microsoft has agreed to use Adobe Marketing Cloud as the ""preferred marketing service"" for its new Microsoft Dynamics 365 Enterprise. Dynamics 365 is Microsoft's combined Dynamics CRM (Customer Relationship Management) and Dynamics ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) product.The deal is Adobe will pay Microsoft to host its three cloud-based services. Microsoft will pay Adobe to improve its CRM/ERP cloud product gain more customers. Microsoft is already a leader in Enterprise Collaboration Software-as-a-Service. However, Microsoft is still not among the leaders in ERP SaaS applications. Microsoft is also still second only to Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) when it comes to Enterprise CRM.Nadella probably liked that Adobe was named earlier this year as the leader of Gartner's Magic Quadrant for Digital Marketing Hubs. Adobe Marketing Cloud could prove effective in disseminating Dynamics 365 to small and big enterprises. Adobe's marketing expertise could assist Microsoft to build up its CRM and ERP software services.Adobe's assistance could help Microsoft compete better with ERP leaders SAP (NYSE:SAP), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and NetSuite (NYSE:N).As per the Gartner chart above, Amazon has no service that could help Microsoft improve the marketing of its Dynamics 365 product. Microsoft has compelling reason to increase Dynamics 365's presence in the ERP industry. Allied Market Research expects ERP software to grow to a $41.69 billion/year business by 2020.Adobe Can Accelerate Azure's GrowthAdobe making Azure as its preferred cloud infrastructure service provider for all three of its products/services can accelerate Microsoft's rapid growth as a cloud infrastructure service provider. As of Q2 2016, Microsoft is estimated to have posted a 100% year-over-year growth over its cloud infrastructure services.Microsoft's Azure is now only second to Amazon Web Services when it comes to cloud infrastructure services. As per Synergy Research Group's estimate, the cloud infrastructure service industry reached the $8 billion milestone in Q2 2016. It also has a trailing twelve-month revenue of $28 billion.Azure business from Adobe could help Microsoft catch up faster with Amazon Web Services. As of now, AWS still has a disproportionately large 35% share of the cloud infrastructure services industry. Microsoft's share is less than 12%. AWS is emerging as a $10 billion/year revenue generator for Amazon. Taking a customer away from AWS is beneficial to Microsoft.Adobe's Creative Cloud software subscription service alone already touts more than 7 million customers. Azure therefore has long-term economic benefits from hosting Creative Cloud. The potential economic benefit to Microsoft Azure is easy to guesstimate. Just check Adobe's latest 8-K filing. Adobe's Creative Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and Document Cloud services have combined quarterly cost of revenue of more than $202 million.Most of that expense likely goes to the cloud infrastructure service provider of Adobe Creative Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and Document Cloud.Amazon losing Adobe Creative Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and Document cloud as AWS clients means it has freed up more servers and internet bandwidth to support its expanding Alexa artificial intelligence services. Adobe's switch to Azure means Microsoft will probably have to build/buy more server farms.I predict that Adobe Creative Cloud will continue to grow in subscriber count. Adobe customers will need the fastest Azure servers. Adobe Stock is now also contributor-driven. Azure will have to host billions of crowd-sourced stock photos, animations, mobile and game assets, and videos that will get traded among millions of Adobe Creative Cloud subscribers.My TakeawayThe new deal between Microsoft and Adobe is akin to 'Jugaad' or the Indian term for creative improvisation to solve a problem. Microsoft's current problem is how to better market its new Dynamics 365 hybrid CRM/ERP to compete better with SAP, Salesforce and Oracle's products. This problem could probably be creatively solved by digital marketing hubs industry leader Adobe.It also helps that Adobe and Microsoft both have Indian-American CEOs. Nadella and Narayen were both born in India. These two leaders could collaborate more efficiently by sharing similar traits. The Chinese called this personality-based networking between businessmen as guanxi. Adobe's surprise defection to Azure from AWS strongly hints that Nadella made a great guanxi connection with Narayen.With Adobe's help, Microsoft is now even more a bigger threat to AWS's leadership in cloud infrastructure services. The new ""preferred partnership"" between Adobe and Microsoft is a formidable tag team. Before Nadella was even made CEO in 2014, Adobe already popularized cloud-based subscription-only software services in May 2013. I think Nadella took his cue from Adobe's early success for his Cloud-First vision April 2014 mission statement for Microsoft.The future prosperity of two collaborating companies is much better off when their leaders have a great guanxi connection.MSFT and ADBE get a Buy recommendation from me."
4037974,68695,2017-01-19T12:51:11-05:00,"Markets expect ADBE to see Adjusted ROA improve to unprecedented levels.Management’s confidence surrounding fundamental tailwinds indicate that even at elevated valuations, near-term downside might be limited.However, given aggressive expectations, and ADBE’s inability to improve profitability through cycles, longer-term downside is likely warranted.","Performance and Valuation Prime™ ChartAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is one of the largest and most diverse software companies in the world, selling a variety of software and licensed technology through SAAS, cloud-based, subscription, and pay-per-use models. ADBE's portfolio of products is separated into two buckets: Digital Marketing and Digital Media. The Digital Media segment delivers products designed to help small businesses and enterprises create, publish, and promote their content. Digital Marketing focuses on the creation, management, and execution of multi-channel digital advertising campaigns.Historically, ADBE has seen highly cyclical UAFRS-based ROA. There have been three identifiable cycles since 2000, with Adjusted ROA continuing to reach lower lows, from 22% to 18% to 15% in 2002, 2006, and 2014 respectively; and lower highs, from 38% in 2006 to 31% in 2011, and currently 22% in 2015. The firm has struggled with both competitive pressures and headwinds related to their shift from a perpetual sales model to a subscription based model. This has been coupled with consistently positive UAFRS-based Asset growth (Asset' growth), ranging from 5-31% pre-2008 (2001 notwithstanding), and from 3-9% from 2010-2014. Notably however, the firm failed to grow its Adjusted Asset base in 2015 for the first time since 2001, as Asset' growth has slowed recently as the firm has struggled to grow under its new business model.For context, the PVP chart below reflects the real, economic performance and valuation measures of Adobe after making many major adjustments to the as-reported financials. This chart, along with all of the charts included in this article, as well as the detail behind the graphics, can be found here.The four panels above explain the company's historical corporate performance and valuation levels, plus consensus estimates for forecast years as well as what the market is currently pricing in, in terms of expectations for profitability and growth.Performance Drivers - Sales, Margins and TurnsIt can be helpful to break down Adjusted ROA into its (DuPont) formula parts, UAFRS Earnings Margin and UAFRS Asset Turnover. The chart below details both Adjusted Earnings Margin and Adjusted Asset Turns historically, to help us better understand the drivers of the firm's profitability and performance.Trends in Adjusted ROA have been driven mostly by trends in Adjusted Earnings Margins, which reached lows of 22%, 23%, and 19% in 2002, 2009, and 2014 respectively, while reaching highs of 35% in 2006, 32% in 2011, and 24% in 2015. Meanwhile, Adjusted Asset Turns have remained in the 0.8x-1.1x range for the past 15 years, with the timing of peaks and troughs lining up with Adjusted Earnings margins.Impact of AdjustmentsThis analysis uses Uniform Adjusted Financial Reporting Standards (UAFRS) metrics, or adjusted metrics, which remove accounting distortions found in GAAP and IFRS to reveal the true economic profitability of a firm. This allows us to better understand the real historic economic profitability of a firm as well as allows for better comparability between peers. To better understand UAFRS, please refer to our explanation here.The chart above highlights the impact UAFRS adjustments have on ADBE's asset base and earnings. The first adjustment to the firm's Adjusted Net Asset base comes from UAFRS capitalization of R&D. ADBE has regular, and material investments in R&D each year that as-reported financial statements treat as expenses. This violates one of the core principles of accounting, which is that expenses should be recognized in the period when the related revenue is incurred. R&D investment is an investment in the long-term cash flow generation of the company. Because as-reported metrics treat R&D investment as an expense, as opposed to an investment, net income is artificially decreased.An additional, material adjustment to ADBE's Adjusted Net Assets revolves around the firm's cash balance. Corporations inherently need some level of cash to operate their business, without which they would have liquidity issues and customers and suppliers would be hesitant to build long-term relationships with them. However, companies with substantial cash balances (above what one might view as ""operating"" cash) can see as-reported ROA diluted because of the substantial portion of the balance sheet that ends up being taken up by cash that is earning limited or no return, especially in the current environment. As such, if excess cash is not removed from the asset base of a company before looking at performance metrics, a company can appear to have substantially lower operating profitability than it actually has.Embedded Expectations AnalysisAs investors, understanding what the market is embedding in the stock price in terms of expectations is paramount to making good decisions. Without understanding what the market is pricing in, it is impossible to claim that the market is wrong. We derive market expectations for the firm from valuations and historical performance trends, to give a clearer picture into what the market is projecting for the firm.ADBE is currently trading at a 29.7x UAFRS-based P/E, which is near historical highs. At these levels, the market is pricing in expectations for increasing Adjusted ROA, from 22% in 2015 to 47% in 2020, accompanied by 7% Adjusted Asset growth, both levels well above recent performance.Peer Analysis - Valuations Relative to ProfitabilityA major benefit of adjusting as-reported financial statements is to clear away accounting distortions, to allow for more accurate peer-to-peer comparisons. To this end we have included a scatter chart below, that plots ADBE against its peers based on their Adjusted Price-to-Assets ratio (P/B) and Adjusted ROA.Looking across industries, markets, and time, there has been a very strong relationship between a company's Adjusted ROA relative to the corporate average (6%) Adjusted ROA, and the multiple the market will pay above the value of the company's Adjusted Asset base, in terms of a UAFRS-based P/B (V/A') multiple. A company that generates a 6% Adjusted ROA will tend to trade at a 1.0x Adjusted P/B, and company that generates a 18% Adjusted ROA will trade at a 3.0x Adjusted P/B, etc.Relative to its peers, ADBE appears overvalued with its 9.4x UAFRS-based P/B and 31.7% Adjusted ROA. The market expects ADBE to grow faster than all of its peers with the exception of VMW, which helps justify a higher multiple. That being said, ADBE has grown by 7% in only one out of the last five years, which brings into question the validity of the market implied growth rate.Analyst and Management Expectations and AlignmentAnalyst expectations are in line with the market's view. Analysts project Adjusted ROA to improve to 32% by 2017, accompanied by 11% Adjusted Asset growth, inclusive of the TubeMogul acquisition.Moreover, Valens' qualitative analysis of the firm's Q4 2016 earnings call highlights that management is confident about revenue growth, their expected acquisition of TubeMogul, and consumer market expansion. Furthermore, they are confident in their initiatives to expand their digital marketing segment and integrate their full ETLA suite of solutions into one package. However, management is also confident that the business's seasonality will continue to produce declining Q3 results. Moreover, they may be concerned about their Digital Media ARR growth.Valuation Matrix - ROA' and Asset' Growth as Drivers of ValuationWhen valuing a company, it is important to consider more than a singular target price, and instead the potential value of a firm at various levels of performance. The below matrix highlights potential prices for ADBE at various levels of profitability (in terms of Adjusted ROA) and growth (Adjusted Asset growth). Prices that are in excess of 10% equity upside are highlighted in black, and prices representing an excess of 10% equity downside are highlighted in red.To justify current prices, ADBE would need to see Adjusted ROA double to levels not seen in the last 15 years, accompanied by 7% Adjusted Asset growth annually. Not only do these expectations appear incredibly bullish given the firm's increased competitive pressures and transition to a subscription based sales model, but ADBE is also a mature company that has not sustained a 5-year 7% CAGR in nearly a decade. Without these levels of improved profitability and asset growth, over the longer-term, substantial equity downside could be warranted. However, given management's high degree of confidence surrounding fundamental tailwinds, near-term downside is unlikely.To find out more about Adobe and how their performance and market expectations compare to peers, click here to access the open beta of the Valens Research database.Our Chief Investment Strategist, Joel Litman, chairs the Valens Equities and Credit Research Committees, which are responsible for this article.

Maybe we should just wait for the company's earnings report.Google plans to show off a number of new hardware devices on October 4th. Comcast is planning on providing wireless service.Adobe beat on earnings per share and revenue expectations, sending shares to would-be all-time highs in after-hours trading.","Too Much Flip-Flop for AppleIf you're skeptical and don't believe in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), that's fine. And if you're a long-term Apple bull, that's just fine too. Because over the past few weeks, we've gotten enough bits of news to form both bullish and bearish takes on the company.Last week, shares of the $600+ billion company climbed more than 10% as optimism welled over Apple's new iPhone. These feelings of joy were fueled by comments from wireless providers that demand was seemingly off the charts and the company's confirmation that many models are out of stock and will remain that way for some time.Others look at comments from the analysts, which say, hey, maybe things aren't quite as rosy as it seems. JPMorgan is cautious on demand, as is Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster. Of the latter, his team says their data ""contradicts what were generally positive initial demand indicators from T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) and Sprint (NYSE:S).""So who's right?We don't know and assuming that you've picked a position, it doesn't really matter now. Most investors either believe the device is selling like hotcakes or they think the initial wave will die out relatively quickly.The reviews of the device are strong and the guts of the iPhone are impressive. With all due respect, if Gene Munster doesn't know how the iPhone is faring, few of us will know either. Let see what the company reports in October and let's listen to the conference call to get a sense of what to expect going into the holidays.If demand disappoints for Q1 (in January), I would suspect that the stock will really struggle. Why? Simply put, if Apple can't exceed expectations during its busiest season, how can it possibly fare okay during its slowest? So far though, it seems like the holiday season won't be an issue.Google's New DevicesThere's been a lot of new product announcements recently, most notably the products from Apple and from GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO). But Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) doesn't want to miss out on the action either.The company has set an October 4th date for its hardware launches, with expectations to see new phones, a new speaker/assistant (similar to Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo), and possibly a new Chromebook and virtual reality platform.There's quite a bit of debate about Google. Not necessarily on software or search, but more so on the hardware front. Given that Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Apple have entrenched themselves into such dominating positions in the smartphone market, many question why Google is still involved.In fact, many wonder at all why Google bothers with hardware and doesn't focus simply on its collection of powerful businesses and brands, (think search, Gmail, YouTube, etc.).Perhaps Google's other successes are exactly why it forges forward with new hardware endeavors. They may not be the most popular products on the market, but it keeps Google's name out there. It keeps its software and OS on devices. It gives Google a chance to strike out, but also to hit a home run.Google's version of Echo could really be something great, kickstarting Google Home. That has potential, especially between Google's Nest acquisition and its other applications like Maps, Gmail and Calendar. Along with search, it can all be tied together. And that offers potential.While it remains to be seen if it will work, the company is at least taking its shot with finding future growth - even if that growth will never top its larger businesses.Comcast's New Wireless ServiceCould Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) be your next wireless carrier? It could, but it's not going to start building cell towers and competing directly with companies like Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T). In fact, Comcast and Verizon will even be working together.While details are still sparse, such as the price or which devices will work it on it, we do know that Comcast is looking to launch the service by mid-year 2017. Comcast is working on an MVNO - or a mobile virtual network operator service.In a nutshell, an MVNO provides users mobile service via Wi-Fi networks. When that user's device is not connected to a Wi-Fi network, Comcast pays wireless carriers' to use their cell towers for the service. Comcast then charges the user for data. In this case, it appears Comcast would use Verizon.Verizon could be set up for a big payday if the service picks up pace. It's also an interesting development given AT&T's semi-recent acquisition of DirecTV.So far, that move appears to be paying more dividends than Verizon's acquisition of AOL (NYSE:AOL) and Yahoo! (YHOO). However, a partnership with Comcast could give Verizon a financial boost, while also technically helping Comcast better compete with AT&T/DirecTV.We'll have to see how this all plays out, but given Verizon's potential payout, the stock's 10% pullback and the 4.5% dividend yield, perhaps it is the best play from all of this.Shares of Adobe Hit New HighsThe stock hit new 52-week and all-time highs, although its 4% after-hours gain will have to hold up until Wednesday's session to officially count.Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) beat on earnings per share estimates and marginally topped revenue expectations. Initially, the stock traded lower in post-market action, but it has since shot up toward $104.75 a share. Its previous high-mark stands at $104.16.Since switching to a subscription-based model, shares of Adobe have been on fire. And in fact, the stock has been a monster, up almost 300% over the past five years alone.Some investors may just assume Adobe has been rolling along for years, like Google or Amazon. But that's not the case. In the five years prior to that period (so Sept. 2006 to Sept. 2011), the stock was actually down 31%.So the turnaround is very much noteworthy. Its products are loved by many and its 20% year-over-year sales growth shows that momentum remains strong. Despite the company's strong performance and the stock's resilience, the valuation has to be becoming a concern. Its price-to-sales ratio remains elevated at 9.5x, while its P/E ratio of 57 is sure to keep some investors away.However, despite the numbers, Adobe keeps delivering. It expects EPS of 83 cents to 89 cents on $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion in sales for next quarter, both ahead of consensus estimates of 78 cents per share on $1.57 billion. Its full-year revenue guidance is also ahead of analysts' average estimates.Until that stops, the stock will likely keep moving higher.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3989440,68695,2016-07-19T11:02:39-04:00,"Using Adjusted Earnings and Assets, ADBE’s Adjusted Return on Assets was 17.1% in 2015 – greater than thrice the as-reported 5% ROA most financial databases report.This difference is primarily caused by ADBE’s $338mn stock option expense, which significantly distorts the firm’s economic reality.Another factor that significantly distorts the firm’s economic reality is their $5.4bn goodwill, which inflates their asset base.Despite the huge difference in adjusted and as-reported ROA levels, the firm’s stock may already be overvalued by the market.","Performance and Valuation Prime™ ChartThe PVP chart above reflects the real, economic performance and valuation measures of Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) after making many major adjustments to the as-reported financials. The four panels explain the company's corporate performance and valuation levels over the past 10 years plus best estimates for forecast years based on quarterly financials and consensus estimatesThe apostrophe after ROA', Asset', V/A', and V/E' is the symbol for ""prime"" which means ""adjusted."" These calculations have been modified with comprehensive adjustments to remove as-reported earnings, asset, liability, and cash flow statement inconsistencies and distortions. To better understand the PVP chart and the following discussion, please refer to our guide here.The problem with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is that they create inconsistencies when comparing one company to another, and when comparing a company to itself from year to year. By making adjustments, we aim to remove the financial statement distortions and miscategorizations of GAAP. Some of these can be automated through consistently applied formulas; however, many must be made manually. Manual adjustments that cannot be automated include mergers and acquisitions accounting, special charges, business impairments, and others. The practice of creating consistent, apples-to-apples comparable measures of financial performance is often considered either tedious or overly complex by even seasoned financial analysts.Under GAAP, the as-reported financial statements and financial ratios of ADBE do not reflect economic reality. The traditional ROA computation understates the company's profitability by incorrectly including certain items. The distortion of both profitability measures and valuation metrics of ADBE are primarily driven by the inclusion of the firm's goodwill ($5.4bn), which inflates the firm's asset base, and by incorrectly expensing their non-cash stock options ($338mn).After adjusting for similar issues and a host of other GAAP-based miscategorizations, Valens calculates ADBE's Adjusted Return on Assets as 17% in 2015. In contrast, most financial databases show an as-reported ROA of only 5%. However, our analysis shows that ADBE has an Adjusted Forward P/E of 28.1x and an Adjusted Price-to-Book ratio of 7.1x, both of which are trading at the high end of historical valuations. Despite the distortions caused by GAAP on the firm's profitability, the market's view of ADBE may already be too bullish.Adjusted Return on Assets - ROA'The top panel of the chart shows the firm's Adjusted ROA (a.k.a. ROA', or ROA Prime). This measure is comparable from year to year and across peers as it ""cleans up"" the aforementioned GAAP accounting issues to provide consistent analysis.Adobe's Adjusted ROA was 17% in 2015. This is not only close to 3x the U.S. average cost of capital, it is also greater than thrice that of the as-reported 5% ROA being reported for the firm. The spread between ADBE's Adjusted ROA and its as-reported ROA is driven by an understatement in the company's Adjusted Earnings From Operations (the numerator, Earnings'), and an overstatement of their Adjusted Total Operating Assets (the denominator, Asset').Earnings are understated because the traditional calculation treats non-cash stock options ($338mn) as an expense to the company in accounting statements, when it is actually a way for the company to give employees an ownership stake in the company. As such, this non-cash expense should be treated as dilution to equity holders and another claim against the Enterprise Value of the firm, as opposed to it being treated as an annual expense. This is especially true as, unless the company uses cash to buy shares (to suppress dilution for equity holders from the option grants being exercised), there is no cash impact on the company. This type of non-cash expense is particularly important for technology companies like Adobe, where due to accounting distortions, what is actually an above-cost-of-capital business can appear as though they are a weak performing business year after year.Furthermore, by adjusting for the firm's goodwill of $5.4bn, the returns earned by ADBE through its operations can be identified. This adjustment provides better investment analysis because it separates the firm's profitability into: 1) organic Adjusted ROA, which indicates how well management executes the business, and 2) acquisitive Adjusted ROA, which shows how well management does when they acquire a business.With everything considered, ADBE appears far more profitable than what traditional metrics suggest. This is clearly seen in the chart above where the firm's Adjusted ROA is materially higher than their as-reported ROA. That is a major difference in context and concept for evaluating the firm's situation.Growth in Adjusted Business Assets - A'In the second panel of the chart, Asset' growth stands for ""Asset Prime Growth"" (or Adjusted Asset Growth) and is the real annual growth rate of the cleaned-up and properly adjusted asset base of the company. This metric shows the management team's propensity to reinvest or divest over time. When viewed in context of the Adjusted ROA, the growth rate explains a lot about management's intended strategies and even performance incentives.After an average of 14% Adjusted Asset growth from 2000 to 2010, Adjusted Asset growth slowed down, reaching a low of 1% Adjusted Asset growth in 2015. This may be related to management's concerns about revenue growth and their competitive positioning, highlighted during their Q2 2016 earnings call.Valuation Relative to Adjusted Assets - V/A'The third panel shows the Adjusted Value to Assets ratio (V/A'), a ""cleaned-up"" Price-to-Book metric that compares the Adjusted Enterprise Value (V') of the company to its Adjusted Asset level (A'). The Adjusted Enterprise Value is the market capitalization of the company plus the total debt of the company, including off-balance sheet debt, and less excess cash (or non-operating cash balances). Meanwhile, the Adjusted Asset level reflects the total operating assets of the firm, necessarily adjusted for problematic accounting standards for reporting of the balance sheet. The Adjusted Asset level is the same as the denominator of the Adjusted Return on Assets calculation and the Adjusted Asset growth panel.The firm's as-reported 6.7x P/B is confirmed by our Adjusted Value to Assets ratio of 7.1x, which indicates that ADBE is trading toward the high end of historical valuations relative to asset values. Considering that the firm's Adjusted ROA of 17% actually warrants a much lower V/A' of 2.6x, the firm's equity may already be greatly overvalued relative to its assets.Valuation Relative to Adjusted Earnings - V/E'In the fourth panel, we have another perspective of valuation to help triangulate the market's embedded expectations for company performance. We always want to know what is ""priced in"" to the stock price. In this case, Valens evaluates the Adjusted Enterprise Value (V') of the firm relative to their expected Adjusted Earnings (E') for the next year. Adjusted Earnings are earnings resulting from the company's core business operations, regardless of how it is financed, and adjusted to its current dollar value. This is adjusted to eliminate accounting distortions and shenanigans, and to enhance comparability across different companies, industries and geographies, to determine potential mispricings. The Adjusted Enterprise Value (V') numerator is the same as that in the Adjusted Value to Assets ratio.ADBE's as-reported forward P/E is at 29.7x, and our analysis finds that the firm's equity is trading at historically high levels with an Adjusted Value to Earnings ratio of 28.1x. The as-reported P/E calculation distorts valuation because it focuses on equity and ignores debt. It appears that ADBE's equity may also be greatly overvalued relative to its earnings.ConclusionAs-reported financial statement information and financial ratios, which make up most of the publicly available financial databases, do not consider the extent to which distortions, miscategorizations, and misclassifications cause as-reported financial statements to depart from economic reality. Even the venerable ""statement of cash flaws"" - pun intended - is horribly distorted, as many items in the statement of cash flows are actually non-cash related. What is deemed cash flow from operations, investing, and financing activities are inconsistently booked from company to company and even just from year-to-year at an individual company. The distortions are material and directionally changing, and the mis-measurements that result are decision-changing issues.A far better picture of the economic reality of Adobe Systems Incorporated can be seen once those distortions are removed. The firm is generating returns greater than thrice what most financial databases report. However, adjusted valuations indicate that ADBE's stock price may already be greatly overvalued relative to its assets and earnings.

4007596,80085,2016-09-21T11:49:59-04:00,Adobe Q3 earnings were released last night.Adobe racked up QoQ Sales growth of 20%.80% of Adobe Sales are now Subscription based.Adobe is fairly valued in my opinion.,"BackgroundAdobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) released its third quarter results last night for the 3 months ending September 2nd, 2016.I am a very happy user of Adobe's Document Cloud. I use the service to manage a few contracts with remote parties. The ability to workflow documents to different parties via email is really well thought out and easy to use. It has made the hard and tangible task of actually getting (digital) signatures far more convenient. My only gripe with the service is that the problem of witnessing signatures, where required, has not been cracked by Adobe. But, all in all, it's a great service and I am happy to pay the subscription fee.But whilst I am a happy Adobe customer and firmly believe that the Adobe Document Cloud can only grow, I am far from sure if it's a good investment. When I look at the Adobe P/E of 50+ on Google Finance, any interest I have of considering an investment in the stock quickly evaporates into thin air.With the latest earnings just out on September 20th I thought it was time to have a quick review of Adobe to determine if it a worthy investment candidate.How did the quarter go?Adobe had a great quarter in terms of growth. Quarter-on-Quarter Sales were up 20%, but what really impresses me is the transition to a subscription based model.The Subscription share of the revenue has shot up from 68% to 80%. Customers are loving the subscription services. Subscription Sales increased by +$250M against lost Product Sales of -$100M. Service Revenues have not really been impacted by the move to a Subscription based business model. Adobe is executing very well on its evolution as a company to the cloud.Subscription Sales are important because they are very predictable. We can annualize the most recent quarter to get a more accurate picture of ""real"" annual sales. Looking at the above figures for the quarter, we can be quite confident that annualized Sales for Adobe are $6B Vs ttm Sales of $5.5B, and we still have to consider growth that is likely to occur in the next few years.Discounted Cashflow ValuationI like to take the Free Cashflow of a business and work out the present value of discounted future cashflows. I often find that a 3% growth rate and 8% hurdle rate results in a DCF value that is quite near the market cap. If you have analyzed the stock you can adjust the growth rate away from 3% to a figure you feel is appropriate.Here's the formula I use:DCF Value = Annual FCF * (1 + growth rate) / (hurdle rate - growth rate)Now typically I would use the TTM FCF or perhaps an average of the FCF of the last several years if we are dealing with a mature cyclical business. In the case of Adobe, it's probably reasonable to annualize the quarter's FCF as opposed to using the ttm FCF.The FCF for the quarter came in at $462M and this annualizes to $1.85B. Using this annualized FCF and a hurdle rate of 8% we can obtain the following DCF Valuations for the following growth rates.The current market cap before the market opens is $50B. So Adobe is priced for 4% perpetual growth that takes into account a discount rate of 8%.The current surplus value on the balance sheet is about $350M (Current Assets Less Total Liabilities). Whilst this is nice, $0.35B is not too material in terms of a $50B valuation.Since we know Adobe's near term growth rate will likely be far higher than 4% we can take advantage of the information.Given sales grew at 20% over the last 12 months it seems reasonable they might grow as I have forecasted. Using the above you see that the sum of future discounted FCFs comes to $62.6B.As I write this, the market has opened and the market cap has shot up 6% from $50B to $53.5B as the latest earnings data is acted upon.ConclusionWhilst the DCF approach is not perfect it certainly seems to get you in the right ballpark. In the case of Adobe, the market and myself seem to be thinking along the same lines. I think Adobe is fairly valued by the market on the belief it can continue with strong growth.I prefer to invest in situations where the market and I think differently about a stock. Rackspace (NYSE:RAX) presented the perfect opportunity for me. I went quite long on this - it was 3X my average portfolio position. Rackspace was a subscription business growing at 20% and the market completely mis-priced it. Apollo took a view on the value of RAX that was more in line with my own (although I still think they are getting a good deal and should be paying more).When you see the market mis-price a stock like Rackspace, I feel you also need to bet your beliefs and assign greater portfolio weighting to worthy value opportunities."
3983631,73185,2016-06-22T11:04:04-04:00,"Despite strong Q2 results and affirmed full-year targets, shares of ADBE slid in after-hours trading.We argue the stock is fully priced.We think the stock is set for a multi-month pullback, though not a dramatic one, and think investors can wait for cheaper prices to buy into the growth story.","Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) announced Q2 results after the markets closed on Tuesday, 6/21, and the results were generally in-line with expectations. The Q3 guide was slightly light, and so shares sold off around 4% in after-hours trading. They're down nearly 5% late Wednesday morning in New York. While we are fans of the growth story at ADBE, we feel the stock is fully priced here and investors should avoid buying the dip.The quarter was quite good. Like many other software giants, ADBE is transitioning to a higher-margin, sub-based business model. The company features multiple cloud-based sub plans that provide the consumer with apps focused on different purposes. Unlike many other software giants, ADBE is experiencing tremendous success in growing its cloud business without over cannibalizing its product business. Product rev fell 28% Y/Y, but this $78 million decrease in the quarter was more than offset by a $310 million increase in sub rev (+40% Y/Y). The result was net revenue growth of 20% Y/Y, with Creative and Digital Media setting quarterly records. Digital ARR exited the quarter at $3.41 billion, representing a $285 million sequential increase. Margins expanded and both GAAP and Non-GAAP earnings were up significantly. The Q3 rev guide was light, but EPS was guided more-or-less in-line. Full-year targets were maintained, with management saying the company was on-track to even surpass the targets, and those targets include 20%+ rev growth and 30%+ earnings growth. If the stock was trading around 20-30x earnings, then we likely would've seen a significant rally in shares following the ER.The unfortunate truth here, though, is that the stock is trading nowhere near 20-30x LTM EPS. Going into the ER, the stock was trading at over 60x earnings. It was also trading at 26x Fy17E earnings. While this looks favorable on a management-guided earnings CAGR of 30% over the next 3 years, investors should remember the FY17E estimate of $3.79 is a non-GAAP estimate. The Non-GAAP adjustments usually amount to $1.00 per share per year, with the controversial stock comp contributing roughly $0.70 per share. The GAAP estimate for FY17E, then, is more like $2.80, meaning the stock was trading at 35.6x forward earnings on a 30% earnings CAGR. The PEG ratio blows up to above 1 and the one multiple that looked attractive on a Non-GAAP basis (1y forward P/E) all the sudden looks like a premium to growth. Despite being a fantastic growth company, the stock looks fully priced here without much upside.We think historical data adds credence to this argument. When one analyzes the historical P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples for ADBE, a clear pattern forms wherein ADBE's valuation is subject to spikes and pullbacks. The valuation seemed to spike late in 2014 when the stock was trading north of 125x trailing earnings. We seem to currently be on a pullback in valuation to the more historical normalized levels ~25x earnings and less than 20x EBITDA. This means that we see a significant risk of continued multiple compression over the next several quarters.Multiple compression isn't necessarily a bad thing if the company can continue to grow earnings. It simply means the stock is growing into its valuation. Looking at the stock price chart since before 1990, we can see that the stock has been on a strong run-up over the past several years despite a lower multiple. This is due to earnings growth. We feel though, that the company has already grown into its valuation. The chart indicates the stock is primed for a multi-month pullback, as the stock has traded above its 200-day moving averages for several years now. The stock had similar ableit shorter run-ups into the dot-com bust and the 2008 financial crisis. The chart indicates something similar is going to happen soon.We do not think the pullbacks will be as drastic as the two previous ones for multiple reasons. Firstly, we do not see any foreboding economic crisis on the horizon which will send broader market averages spiraling. Secondly, the company is expecting a 20% revenue CAGR and 30% Non-GAAP earnings CAGR into 2018. This sort of consistent growth in both revenue and earnings is something the company has struggled to do in the past, especially on earnings. While the trendline is clearly up, there tend to be pullbacks in LTM EPS. Converting to a sub-based, ARR driven model eradicates a majority of this ""cyclicity"", so we should just see steady earnings and revenue growth over the next several years. Thus, we do not foresee a dramatic pullback in the near future.But we do see some sort of correction. The multiple is already compressing. The stock was heading into earnings at a P/E multiple higher than 60x (on GAAP EPS) The after-hours quote puts the trailing P/E multiple below 55x. A $2.00 Fy16E EPS means the stock needs to sport a 47.5x P/E multiple or higher to support the current $95 share price. For all the reasons listed above, 47.5x seems like a high estimate for LTM P/E by the end of this year. Moreover, when a stock trades at this rich of a valuation, it needs to blow estimates out of the water to shoot the stock price higher. With the consensus analyst estimate for this year set above the guide and next year's consensus estimate calling for 33% growth, we don't see significant enough upside to the estimates to warrant buying here.We are fans of the ADBE growth story, but just can't get our heads around the valuation. We think this sell-off will persist and start a multi-month downtrend in shares. While we do not expect this decline to be of the dramatic variety (maybe 5-10%), we do think investors can wait for cheaper prices to buy into the growth story."
3983071,58641,2016-07-04T10:05:52-04:00,"Adobe is still the runaway leader on software used to create ads and content for print, web, broadcast, and mobile devices.It is the creative industry’s bias toward Adobe software that fuels my long-term bullish outlook.The 2013 shift to a subscription-based software distribution has helped Adobe solidify its grip on the creative industry. Software-as-a-Service also minimized the problem of software piracy.The rapid rise in Creative Cloud’s number of subscribers means the Annualized Recurring Revenue from Creative Cloud remains the most important metric to gauge Adobe’s future.The rise of ad blocking is not a threat to Adobe’s content creation and advertising design software.","The undisputed leader in design/creative software, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), will report its quarterly earnings on June 21. The recent pullback is a good opportunity to buy the shares at below $96. Getting a cheaper entry point should always be exploited when it comes to ADBE. Adobe remains a topnotch buy-and-hold bet for long-term tech-only growth investors. Adobe's Creative Cloud software service truly has no serious competition.The stock trades at a lofty 60x P/E valuation but I expect the price to shoot up higher after its June 21 earnings report. Adobe will beat estimates and traders in turn will most likely push the stock like what happened after the Q1 2016 earnings report. If Adobe reports another earnings/revenue estimates beat, I expect the stock to post another 52-week high within the next few weeks.Please study the one-year chart below. ADBE's recent stock trend pattern seems to say that it drops before earnings report and then it will recover/surge after post-earnings.(Source: Finbox.io)Adobe has consistently beaten the quarterly earnings and revenue estimates of Wall Street analysts and Estimize users. I expect ADBE's price to breach the $101 price level soon. The management will most likely report better-than-predicted earnings and revenue numbers next week. Adobe's move last May to cut down the free 30-day trial period to a 7-day trial likely boosted the number of paying subscribers of Adobe Creative Cloud.Compelling people to pay earlier to use Creative Cloud software products helps the bottom line growth of Adobe. The better EPS performance that ADBE delivers, the higher chances there are that the stock price will increase.(Source: Estimize)Creative Cloud's Growth Dictates Adobe's FutureAdobe still gets the majority of its revenue from the recurring stream of Creative Cloud subscription fees. The surge in Creative Cloud subscribers is largely responsible for Adobe's recent excellent earnings performance. Any corporate decision that can further increase the number of people paying for Photoshop CC improves the top line and bottom line performance of Adobe.Learning just the basics of Adobe's software products already takes more than a month. Compelling people to subscribe after their free 7-day trial increases the chance that people will make it a serious objective to really learn Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. It is basic psychology that once a person spends real money for a software he is interested in, he would be more obligated to put more efforts learning it.The next logical aftermath is that, after being compelled to pay and really learn Photoshop, the individual now becomes a potential repeat customer of Adobe's Creative Cloud. A working knowledge of Photoshop will let a person get employed or make money from retouching/editing photos, making logos, print ad posters, billboards, web/mobile ad banners, webpages, and UI/UX designs.Yes, some people will get turned off by the shortened trial period for Creative Cloud products. However, they are not the set of people that Adobe wants for long-term relationships. Adobe implemented the 7-day trial period to weed out those individuals who are not serious in making a career in design.The more people who get compelled to learn/master the complicated software products of Adobe, the better it will be for ADBE. These select individuals will become consistent monthly/annual subscribers of Creative Cloud. As of Q1 2016, Adobe has 7 million paying customers for Creative Cloud.The Creative Cloud software-as-a-service business model was only adopted last May 2013. There were initial protests over Adobe's decision to abandon its old model of pay-once-only to get perpetual license to its software products. However, the 7 million subscriber count achievement (in less than three years) confirmed that Adobe was right to abandon the old pay-once-only on-premise software distribution model.The quarterly subscribers chart below from ProDesignTools clearly illustrates why Adobe's stock now trades at a high valuation. The creative industry has rapidly embraced the subscription-only policy for their favorite Adobe software. The chart below should also be sufficient evidence that Adobe is the runaway leader in creative/design software.(Source: ProDesignTools.com)Investors should really appreciate that Adobe's subscription-only software service is its main bread-and-butter and growth catalyst. In spite of the initial resistance, more creative professionals are subscribing to Creative Cloud and abandoning their legacy Adobe software.RBC Capital Markets' survey of creative/design professionals revealed that there is indeed a strong shift toward subscribing to the $49.99/month full Creative Cloud service. As of February 2016, 46% of surveyed creative professionals are now loyal customers of Creative Cloud's full suite of software. There are now only 14% (it was 46% in December 2014) of design professionals that are still clinging on to their old, 2012-era Creative Suite 6 tool.RBC Capital's March 2016 survey also revealed that the hold-outs will eventually subscribe to Creative Cloud within the next 12-months. I am therefore confident that Adobe could breach 10 million subscribers for Creative Cloud before 2016 ends.Churn rate is also not a debilitating factor for Creative Cloud. RBC Capital's chart below again illustrates that creative professionals consistently renew their Creative Cloud subscriptions. The $9.99/month subscription fee for Photoshop plus Lightroom CC is so cheap that anybody can afford it. I could create two $5 corporate logos in one day using Photoshop CC and be done paying my monthly dues to Adobe.Adobe Creative Cloud Is A Favored Giant Among MidgetsMy bullish long-term outlook for Adobe is basically because of its favored status in the creative industry. I'm a retired art director but I'm still an active freelance graphic artist. Believe me when I say that Adobe does not have a monopoly on great design software. Adobe's success is because the creative industry elevated Adobe's software products to become the de facto industry standard. There are free competent alternatives to Creative Cloud products like Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, InDesign, and After Effects.Sad but true, job seekers who want to get employed in the creative industry are compelled to fulfill the requirements of companies that post on job boards. A job offer for junior graphic designer/artist, web designer, UI/UX designer, video editor, motion graphic artist, animator, mobile app designer, usually requires proficiency in Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, Dreamweaver, After Effects, or Flash/Animate CC. Even freelance jobs will oblige designers like me to provide designs using only Adobe's proprietary .PSD, .PDF, and .AI file formats.As a result of the creative industry's lingering bias toward Adobe's suite of software, colleges and training centers also create their curriculum that favors learning Adobe software. This is especially true here in the Philippines. Universities that offer Advertising Arts or Multimedia Arts courses are full of lessons toward mastering Adobe Creative Cloud.As far as I know, there are no colleges that offer courses toward becoming a diploma holder/expert in open-source and free software like Inkscape, Scribus, or GIMP. I also have yet to see a college curriculum that focuses on teaching cheaper-than-Adobe-software like those offered by Corel or Serif Software. Corel has pay-once-only alternative products to Adobe's subscription-only design software suite. Serif Software and Xara also have very cheap Windows and Mac alternatives to Creative Cloud CC products.Unfortunately, for Xara, Corel, and Serif, the firms that hire designers are only keen on employing people with Adobe-focused proficiencies. Consequently, the rivals of Adobe will forever remain as midgets with little to no chance of growing big enough to threaten the lucrative annual recurring revenue of Creative Cloud.I previously suggested that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) (which used to own more than 20% of Corel) should buy the rivals of Adobe to grow its cloud-centric software business. Unfortunately, Microsoft already took a big $26.2 billion gamble in buying LinkedIn. I do not think Microsoft will ever threaten Adobe's favored giant status. Microsoft will be too busy trying to become the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) for job seekers and HR recruiters to have the time competing with Adobe.Microsoft has also previously tried and failed to challenge Adobe's dominance in web/print design. The rapid growth of Creative Cloud subscribers meant Microsoft had no choice but to just give away its Expression Design and Expression Web software suite for free. In spite of Expression's competent features, nobody was hiring graphic or web designers that are proficient in Expression Design and/or Expression Web.Can Autodesk Challenge Adobe?Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is the only one left that's big enough to challenge Adobe. Autodesk bought Indeeo last year to get the Mac-only Graphic vector drawing software. I said this move was to challenge the dominance of the $19.99/month Adobe Illustrator CC. Autodesk is now selling Graphic for a one-time payment of only $29.99. Autodesk previously bought Alias and its SketchBook Pro digital drawing software in 2006. Buying Alias also allowed Autodesk to compete in the motion graphics sector that is currently dominated by Adobe's After Effects and Animate CC products.After Effects is also used for broadcast video digital compositing and Autodesk is selling Flare as an alternative. Autodesk also bought Pixlr to try and compete with the $9.99/month Adobe Photoshop CC. Pixlr Pro is now being offered for $1.99/month or $14.99/year.Unfortunately, for Autodesk, the job ads still do not require designer applicants to be proficient in Pixlr, Flare, Autodesk Graphic or SketchBook Pro. In short, the creative industry is blatantly ignoring Autodesk's alternatives to Creative Cloud products. Without the support of the design industry, I conclude that Autodesk cannot challenge Adobe's software leadership in print/web content creation.Yes, Autodesk will remain the leader in 3D/CAD (Computer-Aided Design) software but it will never be able to threaten the growth of Creative Cloud.Adobe Can Threaten AutodeskOn the contrary, I think Adobe has what it takes to threaten Autodesk's leadership in 3D/CAD design software. Adobe's smart answer last year to Autodesk's annoying attempts to challenge it in photo editing, motion graphics, and vector illustration software was to buy 3D character modelling/animation vendor Mixamo.With Mixamo membership now a free part of Creative Cloud, there is less need for graphic artists and video game designers to subscribe to Autodesk's very expensive ($185/month) Maya or 3D Studio Max ($185/month). Mixamo's fully-rigged, ready-to-use animated 3D models are good enough for video games and broadcast video.I am instead looking forward to Adobe eventually buying Dassault Systemes (OTCPK:DASTY) to try and threaten Autodesk's pricey AutoCAD product line. DASTY's market cap is less than $350 million. It's a cheap purchase for Adobe to use as a hammer against AutoCAD. Dassault offers a free version of its excellent DraftSight 2D CAD software. The Pro Version of DraftSight is only $299 and it's already a good deal compared to the $45/month Autodesk AutoCAD LT 2016.Buying Dassault will help Adobe intimidate Autodesk. The future danger is that Autodesk's continued failure to compete with Creative Cloud will force it to buy Corel. In my honest opinion, Corel's excellent print and web design software could compete better with Adobe under Autodesk's control. Autodesk certainly has more money for advertising and marketing Corel products. Autodesk could also bundle CorelDRAW suite for free with its AutoCAD or 3D Max Studio software.Ad Blocking On The Web Is The Annoying ThreatSeeking Alpha readers should also understand that Creative Cloud's growth rate depends on professionals and ad agencies getting more advertising/design projects. The internet and the mobile web is the future of advertising. Adobe, as the favored supplier of software to create promo/advertising materials, is therefore also affected by the rising use of ad blocking browser extensions.It is not Microsoft, Corel, or Autodesk that could hinder the growth of Creative Cloud. It's the ad-blocking web surfers.My bull case thesis for Adobe is hurt when there are more computer and smartphone users who use ad blocking software. Ad blocking browser extensions denies website and content owners from displaying targeted/localized ads. The job orders for creating web and mobile display ads isn't going to grow bigger when more people are blocking ads on desktop and mobile browsers.The less ads that content owners or site operators can serve, the lower revenue there is for them. When content publishers and site owners have less income, they also have less budget to pay content creators to create new content and the ads to promote them. Consequently, Adobe's content creation software business is also affected by the rise of ad-blocking software.Fortunately, for ADBE investors, the site owners and content publishers are fighting back. There are now free software that lets websites automatically detect and prevent ad block-using site visitors from accessing their websites. Block Adblock is my favorite free anti-adblocking software script.As long as content publishers and content owners can forcibly dissuade people from using ad-blocking browser extensions, they can earn enough advertising money to hire/pay creative professionals. As long as creative professionals can get job orders to design ads and digital content, they will have enough money to rent Adobe's Creative Cloud.Ad blocking is therefore a mere fleeting problem for Adobe. I firmly believe that the online ad-blocking trend will eventually peak or die down. Ad-blocking never slowed down the ad revenue growth of Facebook and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). The truth is that advertising platform providers like Google can pay money to developers of ad-blocking software so that its ad products are whitelisted.My RecommendationAdobe has the invidious status of being the most-favored supplier of design/content creation software for the creative/design industry. Smart investors should therefore load up on ADBE shares while it still trades at below $96. My 12-month price target for ADBE is $110. This target is feasible because Creative Cloud's membership count is clearly on a massive upward trend.Having 10 million or more paying subscribers for Creative Cloud will likely boost ADBE toward my $110 price target. The quick rise toward 7 million subscribers for Creative Cloud definitely helped ADBE achieve a 3-year return of 109.8%. Adobe's growth story will continue to face little to no headwind because, while there are alternatives to Creative Cloud software, the collective design industry is satisfied being dependent on Adobe's software products.Adobe's management only guided for a FY 2016 estimate of $4 billion/year run rate for its annual recurring revenue (ARR) from Digital Media/Creative Cloud segment. However, I'm expecting $4.5 billion/year in ARR mainly because of Creative Cloud's unimpeded growth rate.Let us also not forget that renting out software has greatly minimized the previous problem of on-premise software piracy. Adobe's old business model of selling a perpetual license for Photoshop CS6 can cost at least $649. It's the reason why many hackers targeted Photoshop for cracking and pirating. Now that Adobe Photoshop CC and Lightroom CC can be had for just $9.99/month, there's really zero reason to use pirated, often virus-infected versions. Adobe's top line growth is better when less people use pirated versions of its software.Adobe's affordable monthly Creative Cloud subscription plans is the perfect implementation of software-as-a-service. They are affordable enough even for designers located in Third World countries like the Philippines and India.(Source: Adobe)Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Such demand drove revenue growth of 20% in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 (ended June 3) and resulted in record quarterly revenue of $1.4 billion. Strong adoption rates in Creative Cloud and Document Cloud helped push Digital Media Annualized Recurring Revenue to $3.41 billion at the end of the quarter. Operating income leapt 78% in the quarter on a year-over-year basis.More than 80% of Adobe's second-quarter revenue was of the recurring variety, which gives the firm considerable visibility into its future operations. Nevertheless, management has disappointed the market with its full-year guidance for fiscal 2016 as both top- and bottom-line in-house projections came in below consensus estimates. The company's fiscal second quarter report was a prime example of the notion that the market is entirely forward looking. Immediately following the release, shares traded off as a result of the weak guidance, despite the record quarterly revenue.We're still big fans of Adobe's asset-light business model, which enables it to generate copious amounts of free cash flow and maintain a healthy balance sheet. The firm's large and growing addressable market should provide a solid runway for growth moving forward, and value expansion opportunities exist in the upselling of current customers. On a fundamental basis, Adobe is a great business, but let's take a closer look at its investment considerations to determine how attractive its shares truly are.Adobe's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Adobe is one of the largest software companies in the world. The firm's flagship offering in its digital media business is Adobe Creative Cloud, which allows customers to download the latest version of Adobe Creative Suite products (like Photoshop). The firm also continues to focus on digital marketing solutions. It was founded in 1982 and is based in San Jose, California.• You're not going to find many business models as lucrative as Adobe's. More than 80% of its revenue comes from recurring sources as of the second quarter of fiscal 2016, and the mix continues to increase. Asset-light operations contribute to significant cash-flow generation.• Adobe continues to gain significant traction with respect to Creative Cloud subscriptions. Growing from just 195k in the third quarter of 2012, Adobe anticipates exponential growth in coming quarters. We love this recurring, subscription-based model. Adobe Marketing Cloud is quickly becoming a favorite of Chief Marketing Officers, as digital marketing bookings continue to expand at a nice clip.• Adobe believes its Creative Cloud will have a total addressable market of more than $17 billion, including more than $8 billion in its core opportunity. New customer acquisitions will drive ~$3 billion in additional market expanding sales, and there may be more than $6 billion available in value expansion through higher average revenue per user opportunities.• The company's cash-rich business model generates excess capital to be used for share repurchases. In January 2015, the firm approved a new buyback program to purchase up to $2 billion of shares through the end of fiscal 2017.Business QualityUnderstanding the Flaws of Selecting Peers in Relative Valuation AnalysisThere sometimes isn't a great peer, rival, or business model to use in relative valuation analysis, but we cover a large number of equities in the software industry and the median forward metrics seek to be representative of this sprawling group. Even in the case of a near-perfect peer, rival or business model, there are still myriad potential pitfalls of using any relative valuation approach, which is why our research and analytical work is grounded instead (or in addition to) in discounted cash-flow analysis and a firm-specific fair value estimate based on the intrinsic qualities of the actual firm being valued.Many investors may feel that multiple analysis or relative value analysis is the only way to view equity valuation. It's possible that a lot of investors may not know the benefits of the discounted cash flow (DCF) process over any other valuation process. The DCF focuses on the intrinsic qualities of the firm to arrive at a firm-specific fair value. Using a variety of different valuation approaches, including relative valuation, remains the cornerstone of the Valuentum process, but with any relative valuation assumption, the very idea of comparing it to another firm will always be imperfect (no two firms are ever the same).Adobe Systems' Economic Profit Analysis""In business, I look for economic castles protected by unbreachable moats."" - Warren BuffettIn the world of investing, no other saying is more widespread. The teachings of Warren Buffett have become a favorite among individual investors, having been adopted by money-management firms and sell-side firms alike in order to better connect with their clients and readers who have been 'under siege' by the topic in recent years. The phrase 'economic moat' - or sustainable competitive advantage - has simply become ubiquitous in the investment world and has lost much of its significance and meaning along the way.The pioneer of the 'economic moat' concept is Michael Mauboussin, and his work at Credit Suisse in 2002 has paved the way for widespread application of the medieval nomenclature across a broad swath of investment frameworks. He states that sustainable value creation is rare and sustainable competitive advantages are even 'more rare' (given that a firm must perform not only better than its cost of capital but also better than its peer group to achieve both). The widely accepted view within the investment community is that at some point in the future, competitive forces will erode a firm's competitive advantages and drive return on new invested capital (RONIC) to a company's cost of capital. This very dynamic is embedded within the framework of the three-stage discounted cash-flow model we use at Valuentum, where we fade a company's RONIC at the end of Stage I to its WACC at the end of Stage II.The concept of an economic moat - or sustainable competitive advantages - focuses purely on thesustainability and the duration of the competitive advantages that a firm possesses. The concept of an economic moat does notconsider the cumulative sum of a firm's potential future economic profit creation, but only that at some point in time in the future, a moaty company will continue to have an economic profit spread and a no-moat firm will not. Let's examine the problem that arises by focusing exclusively on companies that have economic moats, or sustainable and durable competitive advantages.Image Source: Valuentum; EVA is trademarked by Stern Stewart & CoThe problem with using solely an economic moat framework to assess businesses becomes readily apparent in the above example. Though moaty firms are durable and sustainable businesses, they may not be the best value-generators for shareholders. To business owners, this issue is very clear. Business owners want to maximize shareholder value - and a firm's competitive advantage assessment may be independent of that view. Business owners want to generate the most economic value.Before moving on, let's clarify one concept. The trajectory of a firm's economic value creation (or the blue and red areas in the graph above) is not equivalent to the trajectory of a firm's stock price. A firm's valuation, which is used to identify stock mispricings, already embeds the future economic value creation, as it is a function of 'earnings before interest,' which itself is the primary driver behind future free cash flows to the firm (enterprise cash flows) - or that which we use in our valuation framework at Valuentum. Said differently, the above graph shows pure economic value-creation, or in other words, the spread between a firm's return on invested capital and its cost of capital. It's possible, though unlikely, that the stock price volatility of the no-moat stock above can be less than that of the moaty stock. I say this to drive home the differences between stock price volatility, which is based on expectations revisions, and economic profit volatility, which is based on fundamental business dynamics.Regarding a moaty firm's or a no-moat firm's stock price, if the firm is fairly valued, the stock will already reflect its respective forecasted economic profit trajectory. As Moubaussin puts it in his paper, under a scenario where the equity is fairly priced, investors should expect a risk-adjusted market return. The value of fairly-priced moaty stocks, which tend to be less risky, will advance at a lower annual pace than the value of fairly-priced no-moat stocks due in part to the lower risk-adjusted discount rate applied to their respective future free cash flow stream. Generally speaking, a firm's intrinsic value will advance at the annual pace of its corresponding discount rate less its dividend yield. Since moaty firms generally have lower discount rates and pay dividends, the pace at which their fair values increase in any given year will trail that of a no-moat firm, assuming the future forecasts are accurate. Intrinsic value estimates are never static.What we are after as investors, as Moubassin states in his paper, is anticipating revisions in expectations of financial performance. Is a no-moat's economic value trajectory correctly priced in? Is a wide moat's economic value trajectory overvalued? Is a no-moat firm's economic value trajectory undervalued? The economic moat concept is less important to the valuation and global investment framework than the actual future economic value stream of each individual company. In Valuentum parlance, this means that we're looking for companies in the global investment universe that have mispriced future economic value streams (i.e. stocks that are underpriced relative to their discounted future free cash flows and net balance sheet impacts) and are just starting to have their 'expectations revised' by market participants (i.e. their equities are just starting to be purchased). We call these stocks Valuentum stocks - underpriced stocks that are just starting to go up.The sustainability and duration of a firm's economic value creation - or its competitive advantage period - tells us little about a company's economic castle, or the magnitude of the value creation that it is expected to deliver to shareholders. Though a focus on economic moats is important to Warren Buffett's process, identifying ""economic castles,"" or those that will deliver the most value to shareholders may be equally, if not, more important to an investor's process. We are keeping the horse before the cart.Valuentum's Economic Castle rating assumes that 'economic profit' (as measured by ROIC less WACC) is the primary factor in assessing the value that a company generates for shareholders. Whereas an economic moat assessment evaluates a firm on the basis of the sustainability and durability of its economic value creation stream, Valuentum's Economic Castle rating evaluates a firm on the basis of the magnitude of the economic profit that it will deliver to shareholders (as measured by its ROIC-less-WACC spread). Firms with the best Valuentum Economic Castle™ ratings are poised to generate the most economic value for shareholders, regardless of their competitive positions.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. Adobe Systems' 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 224.4%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.6%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Adobe Systems' free cash flow margin has averaged about 26% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Adobe Systems, cash flow from operations increased about 28% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 2% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisWe think Adobe Systems is worth $82 per share with a fair value range of $66-$98.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them. Our near-term operating forecasts, including revenue and earnings, do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 16.5% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 2.9%.Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 38.8%, which is above Adobe Systems' trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 4.6% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Adobe Systems, we use a 10.6% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $82 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future were known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Adobe Systems. We think the firm is attractive below $66 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $98 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Adobe Systems' fair value at this point in time to be about $82 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Adobe Systems' expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $112 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $82 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

3984650,20521,2016-06-27T14:01:47-04:00,"Recently, Adobe released new advertising capabilities for its Adobe Media Optimizer.Adobe also announced its first integration between Adobe Sign and Adobe Marketing Cloud.Adobe also is growing its Marketing cloud service through acquisitions.","According to a RnRMarketResearch.com report published last year, the digital marketing software market is projected to grow 17% annually over five years to reach $56.613.2 billion by 2019. The growth in the industry is attributed to the increasing availability of SaaS-based, cost-effective and easy-to-deploy products that are helping drive adoption of the tools in Small and Medium Businesses.Adobe's Financials Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) second quarter revenues grew 20% over the year to $1.39 billion, falling marginally short of the market's projections of $1.404 billion. This was the ninth successive quarter where Adobe reported revenue growth. EPS of $0.71 was ahead of the Street's estimated $0.68 per share for the quarter.By segment, revenues from the Digital Media segment grew 26% over the year to $0.94 billion, which included a 37% growth in Creative business revenues to $0.76 billion. There was a continued increase in the Creative Cloud and Document Cloud adoption which helped drive Adobe's annualized recurring revenue in the digital media businesses to $3.41 billion. Marketing cloud revenues increased 18% to $0.39 billion. Print and publishing revenues came in at $0.04 billion.For the quarter, subscription revenues grew 40% over the year to $1.08 billion and services and support revenues grew 4% to $0.12 billion. Product revenues fell 28% over the year to $0.2 billion.For the current quarter, Adobe expects to earn revenues of $1.42 billion-$1.47 billion with an EPS of $0.69-$0.75. The market was looking for revenues of $1.47 billion with an EPS of $0.71.Adobe's Cloud Marketing PushAdobe continues to enhance its marketing cloud offering. Recently, Adobe released new advertising capabilities for its Adobe Media Optimizer. The enhancements include the complete integration of Adobe's Dynamic Creative Optimization (DCO) across Adobe Marketing Cloud to deliver personalization so that advertisers can leverage granular audience segments. It now supports video ads and is able to leverage the growing mobile audience through integration with Adobe Analytics and Mobile Core Services SDK. The service is now able to deliver a complete view of the process from app installation to usage behavior to conversions so that data can be analyzed for higher conversions. Additional enhancements include improved reporting capabilities and the ability to deliver localized offerings.Last quarter, Adobe also announced its first integration between Adobe Sign and Adobe Marketing Cloud to help eliminate the need for manual, paper-based process for enrollment, onboarding and servicing. Adobe Sign, which was earlier known as the Document Cloud eSign service, has now been integrated with Adobe Experience Manager Forms, which is a key component of Adobe Marketing Cloud. The integration will allow organizations to go digital for all paper forms including credit card applications, government benefit forms, or even medical forms. To strengthen the service, Adobe tied up with Box and Microsoft OneDrive so that customers can now find it easier to access and work on PDF files from anywhere.Besides product enhancement, Adobe also is growing its Marketing cloud service through acquisitions. Last month, Adobe announced the acquisition of audience-engagement firm Livefyre for an undisclosed sum. Livefyre's platform allows brands and publishers with access to user generated content that can be streamed real-time right to their sites, ads, emails, TV, digital billboards and apps. Adobe plans to integrate Livefyre's tools into its Adobe Experience Manager so that its customers will be able to collect, curate and publish user-generated content from major social networks into their own marketing channels. The integration will help drive user engagement and conversion as the service will be able to successfully leverage social media capabilities as well. Livefyre customers include names like CNN, Coca-Cola Company, Cox Media Group, Dow Jones Wall Street Journal, Hallmark, and Huff Post Live. Livefyre's valuation is not known, but Adobe was an investor in the company, and Livefyre had raised $63 million in venture funding prior to the acquisition.Its stock is trading at $92.20 with a market capitalization of $46.12 billion. It has fallen from the 52-week high of $100.56 it had peaked to in May this year. But the stock has recovered from the 52-week low of $71.27 it had fallen to back in February this year."
3964037,24276,2016-04-08T11:21:27-04:00,"Adobe is suffering from bad publicity over malware getting into its Flash player.Adobe's future is not tied to Flash but the Creative Cloud.Adobe can afford to let Flash go away. Look for weakness, then buy.","All the technology news this morning is about problems with Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Flash.The cross-platform plug-in that plays animations, videos and sound in a format called .swf was important in the early years of the Web. It enabled browsers to handle complex files at a time when download speeds were measured in kilobits per second.Today, with download speeds measured in megabits, the speed improvements are not as important. Flash has instead become a liability, a vector for malware, even ransomware. Many of the largest sites on the Web, including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), have already stopped supporting it.The fact that Adobe has now provided an update for the latest Flash emergency is not going to save the technology. Browser companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), are reducing their support of it.The question you, as a shareholder, are probably asking is, if this technology is so important, why is Adobe's stock on the rise? Over the last month, it has gained 11% and in early morning trade Friday, it was up another 50 cents.The fact is that Web technologies like Flash are no longer what Adobe is about. Adobe is now about its Creative Cloud, which puts all its popular graphics tools under a single license, and delivers them as a service. For Adobe, this means regular subscription income rather than a reliance on product sales and expensive updates.Creative Cloud has been a huge hit, not only allowing Adobe to grow its top line 30% year over year, but dramatically increase margins at the same time. For the quarter ending March 4, for instance, Adobe reported net income of $254 million, 50 cents per share, on revenue of $1.383 billion. This compared with net income of $85 million, 17 cents per share, on revenue of $1.1 billion a year earlier.The heavy lifting to get the Creative Cloud running is now done, and so is much of the heavy marketing expense. Now, when Adobe wants to update its software, it does so once, and that update is instantly available to all its customers. ""Cloudonomics"" like this are a powerful profit driver, once a company gets on the right side of it, and Adobe is now clearly on the right side of it.The bottom line is Adobe does not need Flash to remain relevant or profitable. Adobe can address its problems with Flash at its leisure, knowing that it is mainly taking a public relations hit from it, not a financial one. Expect that Flash will be deprecated, essentially going away in favor of HTML 5, but don't worry about that.The bad news is other investors also know this one weird trick, to look for weakness in Adobe stock and pounce. You'll need a wider market fall to get your next shot at buying Adobe, but when it comes, pounce."
3972364,58641,2016-05-06T12:56:26-04:00,Adobe is working on a new product dedicated to UI/UX design and prototyping.It was a mistake of Adobe to stop development of Fireworks CS6 last May 2013.The shelving of Fireworks CS6 forced UI/UX artists to use other commercial software like Sketch and Axure.Creative professionals are increasingly getting hired to do more work for mobile screens.Adobe Experience Design CC could attract former clients of Fireworks CS6.,"Yes, it is true that more people are signing up for Creative Cloud subscriptions. Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) proclivity for special promotions (like the use-all-our-products for only $49.99/month individual plan) is very effective. On the other hand, Adobe's decision to stop the development of Fireworks CS6 hast left it playing catch-up in the growing User Interface (NYSE:UI) and User Experience (UX) design industry.Lack of foresight caused Adobe to lose important clients when it discontinued developing Fireworks CS6. Catering to designers who only need software like Sketch/Fireworks (and not Photoshop and Illustrator) is a long-term necessity.The rapid rise in sales of smartphones, tablets and touch-enabled laptops has made UI/UX jobs become the most lucrative gigs in the world. Adobe lost its leadership in mobile UI/UX design software when it killed Fireworks.Without a specialty product for UI/UX design and prototyping, I estimate that Adobe is missing out on seven-figure monthly revenue. The reality now is that many UI/UX artists (who earn an average of $91k/year) have abandoned bloatware products like Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop.Most of them prefer lightweight UI/UX-focused programs like Sketch, JustInMind and Axure RP. The meteoric rise of the $129 Sketch has even prompted its developer to sell it directly. This is probably because Bohemian Coding no longer wants to pay the 30% cut demanded by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) (when selling inside the Mac App Store).The Blunder Over FireworksSince Adobe stopped updating it three years ago, Fireworks CS6 can no longer install/run on Mac OS X El Capitan and Windows 10. It's a shame because, just like Sketch, Fireworks was ideal for mobile screen UI design and testing.On Windows 7, Fireworks is still an excellent tool to create cross-platform, resolution-independent and interactive webpages. It can edit imported bitmap/raster images and create animated vector graphic elements.With full support for HTML/CSS export, Fireworks CS6 is great for rapid prototyping of responsive websites and mobile apps. Unfortunately, getting Fireworks CS6 now requires you to buy the whole $2,442 Adobe CS6 Design and Web Premium bundle.This wallet-busting price tag is even more disappointing considering this discontinued suite of software products is no longer supported by Adobe.Adobe made a major blunder when it discontinued Fireworks. It was a unique product that combined the best features of Illustrator, Photoshop, Axure and Sketch. I suspect Adobe killed it precisely because Fireworks was so useful that UI/UX designers have no need for monthly subscriptions of Photoshop/Illustrator.Below is a screenshot of my Fireworks CS6. I used to abuse it to make jQuery themes and quickly convert desktop-only sites to work on touchscreen mobile devices.(Source: Motek Moyen)Adding Sketch-like features inside Photoshop CC also was wrong. Photoshop is Photoshop, it is best-suited for image editing, not for serious user interface/experience workloads. The threat now is that the (still Mac-only) Sketch is fast emerging as the de facto industry standard for UI/UX design.Like Fireworks, Sketch can competently edit raster images and create/manipulate vector drawings. Current Sketch users therefore are most likely no longer paying customers of Photoshop ($9.99/month) and Illustrator ($19.99/month). This could get worse once Bohemian Coding releases a Windows version of Sketch.Judging by the dozens of third-party plug-ins available, Sketch has already achieved enough mainstream success.Preview of Adobe Experience Design Is UnimpressiveRegaining a foothold in the UI/UX design market is now a priority for Adobe. Instead of coming up with a 2016 version of Fireworks, Adobe is experimenting with Experience Design or Adobe XD CC. Once done with beta testing, it's going to be a $14.99/month product aimed at UI/UX creative professionals.There's a free preview or beta version of Adobe XD available for Mac users.As you can see from the screenshot below, Adobe XD CC is notably different from Fireworks CS6. Because of its minimal interface and limited set of only seven tools, Adobe XD CC sure looks it's just another companion product for Photoshop CC.(Source: Adobe)As of now, Adobe XD Preview remains a watered down version of Fireworks CS6. It needs further improvement before it could compete with Sketch. Like other creative professionals, I'm unimpressed with the two beta versions released for Adobe XD. Its lack of layers and reusable symbols makes it a pain to use beyond creating simple user interfaces.In contrast, Sketch and Fireworks CS6 have layers that makes it easy to identify, select, organize and tweak dozens of design elements quickly. Without the workflow enhancements of layers and reusable symbols, I fear Adobe XD also will get cancelled like what happened to Adobe's Edge family of products.Edge Animate CC and Edge Reflow CC were lightweight (separate subscription) products that could have replaced some of the function of Fireworks CS6. Their cancellation last year meant that web/mobile UI designers ignored Edge Animate and Edge Reflow.ConclusionAdobe has no choice but to adapt its strategy to cater to all kinds of paying customers. Monetizing the well-paid population of UI/UX design professionals is very important. Going forward, designing mobile content is the new growth driver of the creative industry.As per the success of Sketch, UI/UX design professionals prefer a lightweight, all-in-one product similar to Fireworks CS6.I'm therefore not losing hope that Adobe XD CC would eventually be released as a standalone, all-around product, like Fireworks CS6/Sketch.I like the developers (in-charge over Experience Design CC) are working on implementing layers. The reusable symbols feature request is still under review, but I also expect to be approved soon.The ability to do universal edits on a graphic/text element or symbol (already used in dozens/hundreds of working mobile web pages) is absolutely needed by deadline-constrained designers."

During the quarter, Adobe recorded over 30% of Creative Cloud subscribers as new to Adobe, and to date, it has seen more than 23 million new Adobe IDs created through its mobile apps.Adobe continues to improve the product offerings to attract more users. Within video services, last quarter, Adobe added over 100,000 native 4K video assets to its library at the Adobe Stock. Adobe Stock is part of its Creative Cloud service which boasts of over 1 million video assets and over 45 million image and graphic media files. It is now also the leader in video production and editing services as it noted that more than 175 films that debuted at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival used Adobe Premiere Pro CC and other Creative Cloud tools.Within mobile, last year, Adobe began to push into the space by allowing iOS and Android users free access to Lightroom, its photo editing software. While mobile access to Lightroom is free, consumers wishing to edit and sync files through desktop still need to subscribe to Adobe's Creative Cloud software.More recently, it announced the preview release of Adobe Experience Design CC, a design and prototyping product that simplifies and accelerates the process of user experience designers to deliver new mobile apps and web sites. Adobe Experience Design (BATS:XD) is currently available as a free download to anyone with an Adobe ID and is expected to become commercial release to Adobe Creative Cloud members later this year. According to Behance, the leading online creative community, interaction design projects grew by 52% last year and was the fastest growing creative field in 2015. Adobe XD will be able to integrate designing and prototyping capabilities in a fast and easy to use desktop application that will help designers to move seamlessly from wire-framing and design to prototyping and preview.The market is pleased with Adobe's initiatives.

ADBE offers a line of products and services used by creative professionals, marketers, knowledge workers, application developers, enterprises and consumers to create content across multiple operating systems, devices and media. Some of its illustrious products include Photoshop and Illustrator. No other company offers as comprehensive of a collection as Adobe does; in fact, the term ""Photoshopped"" is used by the masses to connote an image that has been altered in some way although the alteration may not have been done with Adobe's Photoshop.(Chart 1) Adobe Systems five-year price chartAdobe is in a strategic transition from offering perpetual licenses for its products to a subscription-only cloud model. Four years ago, the company offered its Creative Suite 6 (CS6) product as a Master Collection for $2,599 or as a stand-alone. Photoshop as a stand-alone purchase, for example, would cost $700 for a new customer, or $200 for an upgrade from the older CS5. The new subscription model is called Creative Suite, and the subscription model will, over the long term, improve margins because there no longer is the need to physically distribute the software. During the great recession, Adobe's sales peaked in 2008 at $3.6 billion and subsequently fell 18% in 2009 to $2.9 billion. This subscription model will decrease the cyclicality of the business, because rather than paying $2,599 or $700 for a product, pricing is now much more flexible; one can effectively subscribe to Photoshop for $19.99/month. The caveat is that the software is rented forever and cannot be owned. This is an industry-wide trend; Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has done the same with its popular Office product, although it still offers an ownership option.Adobe operates under three segments:(Image 1) Adobe segments (Source: 10-K)The Product segment, which represents the previous strategy of licensing, is being phased into the Subscription segment, the new strategy. That is the reason why the change in growth for the Product segment was -31% in FY '15 and the growth rate for the subscription was 55% for FY '15.The Subscription segment is comprised of:Digital Media - Provides tools, services and solutions that enable individuals, small and medium businesses and enterprises to create, publish and promote their content anywhere. This segment includes the flagship Creative Cloud.Digital Marketing - Provides solutions and services for creating, managing, executing, measuring and optimizing digital advertising and marketing campaigns across multiple channels.Print & Publishing - Provides eLearning solutions, technical document publishing, web application development and high-end printing services.(Image 2) Subscription segments (Source: 10-K)These three segments will be the primary drivers of the business going forward.Why short such a great company?Acquisitive GrowthAdobe has spent $4.7 billion on acquisitions since 2009. This is only seven years, and yet we have only seen revenues move from peak $3.6 billion in FY 2008 to $4.7 billion in FY '15, or a 4% CAGR. It is even more important to note that $1.5 billion of those acquisitions have come since 2013. Wikipedia has laid out a list of those acquisitions; it's important to note though, that it does not have a complete list of the purchase price. These acquisitions have been consolidated into the Digital Media and Digital Marketing segments, and I believe that they are the primary drivers of the Digital Media and Digital Marketing growth you see in (Image 1) above. Let's examine some of them:FotoliaFotolia is a microstock photo bank that caters to businesses or individuals who are in need of royalty-free photos. It is basically an eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) for Photographers to ""rent out"" their photos to people or corporations in need of copyright-free photos and videos. These photos are generally used for advertising or as stock photos. Fotolia was acquired by Adobe in December 2014. I noted a few odd things while digging for data on the company:According to Moody's Investor Service, the company recorded revenues of $87 million for fiscal 2012, and $90 million for the 12 months ending June 2013. The last equity transaction was when KRR acquired 47% of the equity from TA Associates (PE Firm), and Oleg Tscheltzoff, a co-founder and CEO. This transaction valued the company at $455 million. According to Moody's:It is rarely ever a good idea to throw $300 million in debt on a company with $90 million in revenues, but PE firms are all about the money. Fotolia ""raised"" ($210 million) more money in September to ""refinance the existing debt"" and to ""pay a $73 million special dividend"", as if the $161 million was not enough. KKR seriously sucked the company dry. My guess is that the company became unstable since Adobe paid only $800 million for it. Conservatively assuming that the debt balance stayed at $300 million, if we subtract the $300 million from the $800 million Adobe paid, ADBE acquired the equity for $500 million, which is a paltry 9% premium over the $455 KRR bought it for in 2012. Since this was done in 2014, if we take on Moody's expected 5% revenue growth, then we would have approximately $95 Million in sales for FY 2014, and $100 million in FY 2015. Fotolia was consolidated into Adobe's financials in FY 2015, so that would mean that it added $100 million to ADBE's top line.AviaryAviary is a photo editing app offered on both Android and iOS mobile operating systems. The app has been downloaded over 50 million times and also received solid ratings from its users. The app makes money through in-app enhancement purchases and also by leasing the SDK to developers. It offers a premium and a basic version (free). Adobe did not disclose the price paid for Aviary, but given the obscene multiples, these app companies are bought and sold for in the name of ""growth""; my assumption is that it likely overpaid. We know that Adobe acquired Aviary on September 22nd, 2014, which was Q4 of 2014. Adobe's Q1, Q2 and Q3's 10-Qs did not record any ""acquisitions net of cash acquired"" in the cash flow from investing section. We only saw that in the 10-K, meaning that it was done in Q4; $29.8 million was recorded. If ADBE only paid $29.8 million, then Aviary likely lost the interests of venture capitalists, which is extremely difficult to do in this tech/app bubble 2.0 environment. My guess is that it was burning too much cash while margins were falling as a result of competitors entering the market. Avairy was consolidated in FY 2015. Only thing mentioned about Aviary in the 2014 10-K was:The singular nature of the following quote proves that there was only one acquisition, and we also know that Aviary was acquired in FY '14, therefore, it was the only acquisition in 2014.I don't know how much revenue Aviary has added to Adobe's top line, and while I loathe making these sort of estimates, it is required in this situation. The company announced in March 2013, that 3 billion photos had been edited through its platform. Just 10 months later, in January 2014, it announced that it had crossed the 10 billion mark. If we assume that just 1% of the photos that were edited via Aviary had a $0.99 enhancement attached, it'd imply $70 million in revenues for Aviary during just that 10-month span. It is important to note that the 10 billion mark was two years ago, and since Aviary tripled the number of photos edited from 3 billion to 10 billion in 10 months, so it is likely that the number today is now a multiple of 10 billion. According to App Annie, Aviary's ranking in the App Store has fluctuated between 208 and 252 over the past month, so it's obviously still popular when you take into account the over 1 million apps available in the App Store. Users are also recurring, as it is rated a solid 4.5 stars in the App Store. So, a 20 billion base sounds conservative for FY '15. 20 billion recurring edits equate to 200 million in revenues, and if you take the conversion rate up to 2%, it becomes 400 million in revenues. It's important to remember that these numbers that I calculated do include revenues from the SDK segment of the business; just an FYI to remind you of my attempt to keep these calculations conservative. My guess is that this is what is truly driving top-line growth at Adobe, which is why management has kept details of this under the radar.Honorable Mentions: Neolane for $600 million; Behance for $111 million.I see nothing wrong with acquisitive growth during a recession/bust, but any company that is serially acquiring companies during a boom is likely overpaying, particularly in tech. This destroys shareholder value in the near term and poses the risk of a goodwill write-down in the future.Numbers Don't Add UpIn the FY 2015 10-K, management said:How does a company that recorded $4.1 billion in revenues in 2014 miss $433 million of unbilled deferred revenues? $433 million was over 10% of FY 2014's total revenues.Issues With Serial AcquisitionsUnder ""Note 2 Acquisitions"" in the FY '15 10-K, management discusses recent acquisitions. We see mentions of Fotolia, Neolane, and Behance. Avairy is not mentioned, and 2014 acquisitions are written off as ""immaterial"". If Adobe did pay $29.8 million for Aviary, then it is indeed immaterial, but management also does not separate the financials of the acquisitions from the organic business.My guess is that Aviary is the growth driver behind the scene. The more important question, however, is - does it or will it make money? While the conversion rates I mentioned above of 1% and 2% seem realistic to me, it is unlikely to provide any reasonable profits for Adobe. But to be more optimistic, let's assume 3% of the photos that flow through Aviary attach a fancy $0.99 filter or option to them, this would mean that 97% of the other photos are free loading and Aviary still has to cover those costs. Also, this app has virtually no barriers to entry; there are multiple apps in the App Store with the same features and ratings as Aviary and other photo-editing SDKs. Low margin(s) is a reasonable expectation; Aviary is likely to provide revenue growth, but minimal profits, if any, in the long run. Apps that depend on internal purchases will require loads of traffic and hopes of higher conversion rates to be profitable. While I expect Adobe to able to stretch its synergistic resources over some of these companies, cutting expenses in the process, the benefits of the cuts will recur forever, but there will be no growth in those benefits.Management has also refused to discuss subscriber numbers, yet it effortlessly forecasts annualized recurring revenue (ARR) growth of 20% through 2018. Oddly, the strategy for ""annualized recurring revenue"" generation according to management is subscriber growth and conversion to the Creative Cloud. This implies that revenue growth does not necessarily imply subscriber growth.Management also says:That's not necessarily true. During Q3 and Q4 of FY 2015, operating margins rose to 20% and 22% from 7% and 12% while gross margins contracted and stayed flat. The profit margin increase was driven by a reduction in SG&A and R&D as a percent of revenues. Adobe can only stretch the SG&A over multiple products, the benefits of that will recur forever, but will not grow. As a tech company in a rapidly changing industry, it also cannot cut R&D forever. So while I expect management to push up those operating and net margins in Q1 and Q2 of 2016 indicating profit growth, the more important number to watch is the gross margin. If this does not move up in Q1 and Q2, then we are likely to see minimal to no profit growth in Q3 2016 even though revenues will likely keep growing. These acquisitions are likely masking Adobe's true profit potential. My hunch is that Wall Street will start asking serious questions after Q3.Adobe sales FY 2015 (Source: 10-K)Product revenues declined by $497 million, but subscription revenues increased by $1,147.9. Of the $1,147 in subscription revenue growth, $100 million can be attributed to Fotolia, $400 million (depending on what conversion rate that is used) can be attributed to Aviary. Let's also conservatively assume that only 2/3, or $330 million, of the $497 Product revenues were converted to Subscription. The real subscription growth would be $319 or $519 ($1,149 - $100 - $400 (or $200) - $330 = $319 or $519), a growth rate of 25% or 15.3%. If we take out the Aviary and Fotolia revenues ($4,795 - $500 = $4,295), total organic revenue growth comes out to a paltry 3.5% ($4,295/$4,147 - 1). This does not bode well for a company trading at 70x earnings. Adobe also made another purchase in July 2015, Mixamo, for another ""undisclosed sum"".Unaligned Shareholder InterestsExecutive compensation (Source: DEF-14A)Per the proxy, executive compensation is based on the following:ARR for Digital Media and Net Bookings for Adobe Marketing Cloud are basically revenue growth metrics. Customer advocacy is vaguely defined in the proxy as:No clear metrics are provided. Individual goal(s) includes the following:CFO Matt Garrett is tasked with driving profitability, which implies cost cutting. That is precisely what we saw in Q3 and Q4 of FY 2015. Employee count rose by 11% while revenues grew by 20%, increasing operating margins while gross margins stayed fixed. This implies synergistic advantages being implemented. There are no other profitability metrics. Operational efficiency and even the ""drive profitability"" are also not quantitatively defined, but the executives are clearly being paid for hitting their targets. What are these targets? (ex. operating or gross margins to X percent, operating profits to X... etc...) and how can shareholders confirm that they are being hit? Stock-based compensation also accounted for a staggering 8 and 7 percent of total revenues in FY 2014 and 2015. This is dilutive and very common place amongst tech companies, and the weight of this dilution is never truly felt while the stock price remains inflated.Stock Is Expensive At 48x Free Cash FlowAdobe trades at an enterprise value of $43 billion with earnings of $630 million in 2015. The EV/earnings ratio sits at 68. If we assume that:Assuming the above, and using 2015 revenues of $4.7 billion as base with a 10% discount rate and a 2% terminal growth rate, Adobe would have to compound its revenue and earnings growth at 16% over the next 10 years to justify its current valuation. Wall Street will soon realize that organic growth within the company is almost non-existent, and that the growth is being driven primarily by unprofitable acquisitions.Short StrategyThe number to watch for Q1 and Q2 is the gross margin. If these margins do not move up substantially or they stay flat while operating and profit margins expand, then the net income for Q3 is likely to stay flat or decline. Adobe's 20-year SG&A/revenues percent average is 43.5%, SG&A/revenues fell to 44.7% and 44% from 55% and 51% in Q3 and Q4 of FY 15. The 20-year R&D as a percent of revenues is 19.2%, R&D for the third and fourth quarter fell to 18% and 16.9% from 21.1% and 20% for FY '15. ADBE can only marginally squeeze SG&A to increase profitability in Q3 and Q4 of 2016, but the R&D has been exhausted. For as long as we are seeing only operating margin expansion, the company will remain a short. If this does not materialize in 2016, then it should in 2017 since there will certainly be no more room for expense cuts. That is why I'm shorting this over two years.As I mentioned earlier, I bought the January 2018 $50 (strike) put options for $2.41 on the 24th. This makes up 1.1% of my portfolio.Note: I don't have access to a Bloomberg terminal or Capital IQ, it makes retrieving information about some of these acquisitions that much more difficult. If you do have access to more information than I have laid out here, please let me know, and I will gladly update my write-up.Additional disclosure: I posted this article about a week and a half ago on my website, so any dates in this article refer to that period."

After offering a 30-day trial for decades, prospective customers of Adobe's latest software products will have to contend with just a 7-day freeride.This brilliant move will further accelerate the growth of Adobe Creative Cloud's quarterly revenue. It is obvious that Adobe reduced the trial period to encourage more people to immediately subscribe to its software when they try to learn it. Quickly monetizing from self-taught designers and freelancers could substantially increase the 7 million paying customers of Creative Cloud. Extracting money from people attempting to go through the steep learning curve of Adobe software is favorable to ADBE investors.(Source: Prodesigntools.com)Any one who wants to learn any of the Creative Cloud programs will be compelled to subscribe for at least one month. The one week free trial is not enough to learn the user interface, tools, panels, or master the keyboard shortcuts of Illustrator CC or Animate CC.I also dismiss any suggestion that the 7-day trial would alienate potential customers of Creative Cloud. Most people who try to learn Adobe Software are usually intent on getting high-paying jobs.Adobe's software products, Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere Pro, After Effects, Dreamweaver, are the industry-standard software in print/web/animation services. A person who downloads a trial version of Photoshop or Illustrator CC is intent on improving his chances of getting employed.Sure, some people will subscribe for one month. Some of them will quit when they discover Photoshop CC is too hard for them. These kind of people are not the customers that Adobe wants for Creative Cloud.The target customers are those who spend serious time learning the. Adobe software. They are likely to make money from their newfound skills. Consequently, a well-paid artist can easily afford the $9.99 - $19.99 monthly fees of individual Adobe software.Genius Marketing StrategyThe substantial reduction in the free trial period is a masterful psychological ploy from the management. Making people like me fork out cash just after one week of free trial use will compel us to really go through all the tutorials/lessons. Doing 30 or 60 days of Illustrator CC lessons/practice will in turn make us proficient enough to make money from this software.Adobe's software is bloated with complex features that even photo editing in Photoshop CC is intimidating for newbies. Mastering the fundamentals of Illustrator CC 2015 will take more than one month. I am a happy subscriber of Photoshop CC (and sometimes Premiere Pro CC). However, the declining average fees for photo/video editing here in the Philippines is forcing me to learn vector illustration. I need Illustrator CC for 2D game graphics design and/or web & mobile UI (User Interface) design.With the reduced 7-day free trial of Adobe, I was compelled to immediately pay $19.99 just to learn Illustrator CC's vector drawing workflow. Below is my initial attempt to learn mobile game character illustration. I love the new Curvature tool of Illustrator CC 2015. It's like a supercharged version of Freehand MX's Bezigon tool. These characters are from YouTube/web tutorials.(Source: Adobe/Motek Moyen)Illustrator CC Is Still The Best For Vector DrawingI am a diehard loyalist of Macromedia Freehand. Unfortunately, Adobe decided to end the life of Freehand MX in 2007. My beloved Freehand MX is already 12 years old. It is no longer compatible with the latest OS, third-party programs, and file formats like SVG (Scalable Vector Graphic).The responsive-friendly SVG is now the most optimized format for creating 2D graphic assets for mobile games. SVG is also the preferred file format by UI/UX designers. I had no choice but to pick Illustrator CC for my planned expansion as a vector artist.Furthermore, my Serif Affinity Designer is Mac-only and I now prefer to grind on my Core i5/8GB DDR3 RAM/2GB Radeon GPU workstation Windows PC. I only use Affinity Designer for making $5 logos and $10-$20 tarpaulin billboard layouts. Affinity Designer supports SVG but it does not have the Shaper tool, Curvature tool or Shapebuilder tool of Illustrator CC. The new drawing tools of Illustrator CC makes it simply the best software for creating mobile games-centric 2D characters and environment and world objects.Lastly, Adobe Illustrator CC 2015 is now also decent for UI design. If I don't make serious money from creating 2D game assets, I will shift to User Interface design using Illustrator CC and the Armature plug-in. Adobe got threatened by Sketch 3 but I think Illustrator and Armature will keep Windows-based UI designers subscribing to Illustrator CC.ConclusionI rate Adobe as a long-term bet for growth-minded investors. I like how management is finding new ways to increase the number of subscriptions for Creative Cloud. Adobe still gets most of its revenue from recurring monthly revenue of Creative Cloud subscribers. ADBE's price is notably higher compared to my last Adobe article.The May 2013 decision of Adobe to shift to a subscription-only service did great for the stock. The 3-year market performance of ADBE showed it went up more than 190%.(Source: Finbox.io)"
3959563,98236,2016-03-18T13:42:08-04:00,"Adobe's Q1 results released last evening showed gains greater than forecast in terms of earnings, revenues, bookings and particularly free cash flow.The company has increased forward guidance quite modestly, and I suspect that it has more quarters coming up in which it will beat and raise.ADBE's free cash flow trebled in the period, and I think that it will rise by at least 40% for the fiscal year as a whole.It has taken interesting steps to expand the addressable market for creative cloud.The company's marketing cloud is at the least maintaining and is probably increasing its market share in a crowded field.","The profit potential of real cloud companies!I like to try to start these articles off with some kind of interesting headline. But you need controversy to write a good headline, and the fact is that there is little controversy surrounding this name at this point. Since I first wrote about this company at the end of February, it has mainly been onward and upward. About the only thing controversial to say about Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is that there is very little controversy, and that isn't the best of environments in which to achieve share price appreciation. According to the Thomson/First Call information, the last time someone downgraded this name was about three years ago. Out of 24 brokerages that follow the name, there are a couple of hold ratings including that of Oppenheimer. It will be harder to maintain a hold rating in the wake of Adobe's first-quarter financial performance and its forward guidance.What's really going on at Adobe? I don't propose to reprise the press release or all of the numbers that were reported as they are available on this site and across the web. For the record, however, total revenues increased by 25% to $1.36 billion and EPS rose to $.66 compared to a prior expectation of $.61The company's larger business is that of the creative cloud. Overall, that business rose by 44% to $732 million for the period. The web has seemingly created an inexhaustible demand for content, and ""the creatives,"" as they are called by this company, are seemingly embracing ADBE's expanded set of product offerings. While it is rarely a great idea to take management commentary at face value, the numbers going back some time now would certainly seem to support the contention of management regarding the opportunities the company has to grow the creative cloud.Historically, the way to think about Adobe in terms of modeling its operations was to take net sub adds and multiply them by the annual revenue per unit (ARPU). The theory went that rising sub add coupling with rising ARPUs would, over time, provide the company with a decent growth path. Along the way, the company has found a host of different ways for ""the creatives"" to buy and use the product. Most notably, and perhaps surprisingly at least to me, is that mobile apps are increasingly prevalent. There are surveys that suggest as much as 25% of creative cloud users will turn to mobile apps over the next few years. Another underappreciated growth opportunity are apps that speak to the K-12 education market. As a result, sub adds are rising far faster than previous expectations, and the company has decided to use a different approach in portraying growth.Adobe has given estimates for Annual Recurring Revenue since it introduced its subscription based pricing in 2012, but that will now be the principle and most objective metric that it uses to convey the real growth of the company beyond the raw revenue numbers. Needless to say, that number, based on higher-than-anticipated sub adds and health ARPUs were significantly above expectations and enjoyed a 7% sequential quarter increase that essentially suggests that the ""real"" growth rate in creative cloud is beyond the headline numbers. The company raised its ARR forecast for the year around 4% from prior expectations.One point that needs to be made emphatically. I have spent some time and some electrons describing just how arduous the on-premise to cloud transition is for Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). But looking at ADBE, one is able to see what a real transition to the cloud is supposed to look like. Product license revenues were down $90 million year on year during the quarter, and subscription revenues were up by more than $350 million. Operating margins increased from 15% to 22%. Stock-based comp. declined from 7.7% of revenue to 6.6% of revenue, and free cash flow rose from $148 million to $451 million with the improvement driven by both the rise in net income coupled with a noticeable spike in deferred revenues. The net change in deferred revenues was actually more than six-fold increase from the prior year driving that metric to $123 million.One inevitable question after the company started off its fiscal year on such a strong note is what kind of encore can it muster. Is the market for Creative Cloud really large enough to support quarterly net subscriber adds of 800,000? Fortunately, going forward, the company is going to stop forecasting net sub adds simply because it is creating so many different SKUs that the statistic is becoming less and less relevant. Because the company has developed different creative cloud bundles for education and has seen a massive interest in its mobile creative cloud apps, the actual number of net new subscribers is going to rise significantly and steadily if the company achieves its objectives.To answer the question I posed above, this company's growth opportunity has never seemed larger than it currently is. It appears as though its total addressable market is rising significantly as it continues to add new products to its offering. Most analysts have Adobe's growth targeted at around 20% over the next couple of years. Given that the company raised its guidance a bit in the wake of its strong Q1, revenue growth estimates are going to rise for this year. But I think the takeaway that seems to resonate is that the company's opportunity is larger and that its long-term growth rate should be higher than previously anticipated.Was there anything wrong with the quarter? I suppose for those who choose to be picky, the company's non-GAAP tax rate of 21% is below current normal levels. But it doesn't seem as though it's going to change any time soon, so it really isn't any alarming risk.What is perhaps most unique about Adobe when compared to most other cloud vendors is how little competition there is for creative cloud. There are, to be sure, some competitors that I called out when I wrote my initial report on the company, but on balance, Adobe is the market. Most enterprise software companies have loads of real live competitors that always represent a potential threat. As of this writing and in the creative cloud, that simply isn't a significant factor for Adobe.There is little price competition as can be somewhat seen in the ARPU statistics, although as time goes forward, that metric is becoming less meaningful due to the broadening of the company's product set. In fact, management was at pains to indicate that it is seeing significant renewals for creative cloud at un-discounted pricing compared to the discounts that are used to lure first-time users. That is not true in the space that Adobe calls marketing cloud which is getting more crowded by the month. That being said, marketing cloud still grew by 21% during the quarter above planned levels. And marketing cloud is 27% of revenues. The 73% of revenues that are creative cloud revenues really have few impediments to continued strong growth.How to value a force of nature or what is a practical limit to Adobe margins?One of the principal issues in trying to value cloud-based software companies is that we don't have the experience to know how high margins can go. Some analysts have opined that it takes five years for the total margin from a cloud sale to equal that of a perpetual sale. There are many moving parts to the calculation. Selling perpetual licenses in high volume and deriving lots of revenue from maintenance can be quite a profitable business as Oracle used to prove quarter after quarter. Before that company lost its way, it used to regularly achieve operating margins that broached the 50% range and were set to go higher.Adobe's gross margins only increased by a bit over 70 bps year over year. That is primarily a function of what appear to be stranded costs in what are the company's product revenue and service and support revenue buckets. Gross margins on subscription revenues continued to rise from about 87% to 90%. That is pretty much a function of an increasing proportion of subscription revenue that is recorded from renewals which have no product cost at all. That is eventually what can happen in a cloud model.The company achieved leverage in terms of its three major expense buckets which are R&D, S&M and G&A. One thing to note is that the company's Q1 was a 14-week quarter so opex was 7.5% greater than might normally be anticipated. In addition, like many companies reporting in Q1 of this year, merit raises were pretty universal and the SS contributions start over in January. Again, that is what you expect to see with a successful cloud transition and is why valuations of cloud names appear so stretched to many. ""Selling"" a renewal to creative cloud customers costs very little. In most cases, the user gets a notification of a bill and indicates which credit card should be charged. The process involves little G&A, which is why that line is flat year over year. Adobe spends enough on R&D which was still 17% of revenues this quarter, down from 19% in the earlier period. ADBE's strategy with creative cloud has been to continuously upgrade the product to discourage potential competitors and to keep its installed base content that the product is being steadily enhanced. All I can say is that the strategy appears to be working well.S&M dropped a bit from 35% to 34%. It is my belief that over time this line item can come down sharply as renewals become a higher and higher proportion of revenues.Overall, Adobe beat by $.05 in the quarter and beat on revenue as well. In addition, the company raised guidance modestly from the prior consensus of $2.75 to $2.80. As this guidance represents no change in expectations for the balance of the year and yet the ARR metric was stronger than anticipated, it seems likely that the forecasts are erring on the side of conservatism.I don't suppose that anyone can really address just how high Adobe's operating margins can reach. The current consensus for operating margins is clearly going to be surpassed this year, and there has been some significant margin expansion baked into the consensus expectations for FY 2017. I think after reviewing the metrics of the past two quarters that there is much doubt that operating margins for Adobe can readily reach 30% sometime in the next few years as the cloud model continues to mature and as the company continues to expand the scope of the creative cloud, especially on the mobile and education side to levels significantly greater than had been previously speculated.While competition in the marketing cloud is fierce and some of the competitors offer very strong solution sets, the market space is growing rapidly. I don't propose to try to evaluate the strengths and the holes that Adobe's marketing cloud has vis-à-vis Oracle, SAP (NYSE:SAP), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and IBM (NYSE:IBM). And while certainly all of the companies compete directly in some parts of the market, all of them have unique offerings as well. There is no way to find apples-to-apples comparisons and hence market share statistics are really sketchy and don't mean too much. As this point, the transition to a subscription model is more or less complete in the marketing space as the company indicated it booked no perpetual deals this quarter and had only a small level of perpetual license in the prior quarter. Over time, therefore, bookings growth and revenue growth should converge suggesting that the growth rate for marketing cloud should rise from 20%.What's it all worth?Setting price targets is really a thankless exercise. One is trying to forecast the state of business several years into the future. Not only are Black Swans always present, but so too are inevitable changes in discount rate assumptions, acquisitions and execution capability. At some level, setting a price target for this company or any other is representing that one knows facts that really are unknowable that far in advance.Adobe's shares are simply not going to be a bargain after the company's performance of the past several years. Most analysts either like it or love it, and the ones that don't like it are going to have to fudge their explanations a bit harder. The company will now be forecast to achieve revenues of about $6 billion this year and perhaps $7.25 billion the following fiscal year (ends 11/30). The company's enterprise value adjusted for the price spike of about 6% seen in after-hours trading will be about 44 billion. So that is an EV/S of 7.3X on the current year estimates and about 6X on the estimates that are likely for fiscal 2017. Not a real bargain except for the recurring nature of the company's revenue stream.The company's P/E based on estimates that seem likely in the wake of the company's strong Q1 performance and increased guidance are about 33X this year's forecast performance and at a bit less than 25X the likely estimate for the following fiscal year.What has really changed in terms of valuation is the company's free cash flow generation. Free cash flow in Q1 was $450 million, which is triple what it was in the year earlier period. Adobe is going to continue to show a certain level of seasonality despite the higher proportion of subscriptions in the mix. Q1 EPS is only about 23% of the expected level for the full year. So simply based on that and consistent assumptions for capex, I imagine that free cash flow for the full year is going to reach close to $2 billion. That works out to around $4/share this year and something like $5.50/share next year, suggesting free cash flow yields of a bit over 4% and just less than 5.5%, respectively.No, Adobe's shares are not cheap and they have appreciated by 13% in the few weeks since I published my initial report. I think it is reasonable to suggest that all other things being equal, with the current interest rate background and the slim pickings available to large-cap growth investors, that Adobe's shares can appreciate about 15% compared to the $95 after-hours price.Some Final ThoughtsAdobe's Q1 performance was basically all that anyone might have wished for or expected - well if they were long, of course. The company beat on revenues, beat on margins, beat on bookings and beat on free cash generation. The 3x growth in free cash flow is not something that many companies of this scale will ever be able to accomplish.The company's real growth rate continues to exceed published headline numbers as its ARR base is growing by 30%. Its market opportunity in creative cloud continues to expand and competitors are scarce on the ground. The company has exhibited strong operating leverage, and as its cloud model matures, it seems almost certain (well as certain as things get in software land) that margins can continue to grow for several years to come. The company's reliance on stock-based compensation is small to begin with and is declining as well.Yes, valuations are high, but not whip-crackingly so. I don't expect that the upside for these shares is enormous at this point, but I do think they have a potential to increase another 15% through the end of the fiscal year, particularly as I imagine that the company guidance and therefore consensus expectations are deliberately conservative. A sting of beats with all metrics on board really has the ability to change valuations."
3604076,48411,2015-10-26T14:24:18-04:00,Adobe is out with quite a few meaningful updates to its Adobe Target platform.I've been open that I really like Target so the updates simply reinforce my opinion of the platform.But what good is a great platform without visibility? Adobe needs to do a better job marketing the marketing optimization platform.,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is out with some notable upgrades to its Adobe Target platform which further builds out the Adobe Marketing Cloud. Oddly enough, despite its prevalence at Fortune 50 companies, as pointed out by a recent writeup by Mark Sullivan at VentureBeat, the Adobe Marketing Cloud is the ""under the radar"" marketing platform in the space. At least in my opinion. But, that doesn't mean it's not capable and/or effective. It is. Recent updates will help with that.So, what is Adobe bringing to the masses with the Adobe Target updates? Quite a bit actually and this is for an already really nice analytics-based, quasi-BI solution. With the announced updates, Adobe has integrated a machine learning engine to provide predictive analytics to users. Adobe has provided testing, optimization, and personalization on mobile sites, apps, and IoT devices, and in offline locations. Adobe has also built out a much more comprehensive A/B micro-testing platform. Again, this wasn't an incremental update.What should this mean for Adobe, assuming the company can adequately get the word out for its slept-on marketing platform? I think it could mean big things. Again, Adobe Target already brought seriously unique capacity to marketers in that it allowed near-open architecture campaign-structuring as well as super competitive analytics. From a pure-play marketing platform - meaning the platform wasn't intended to be a blend that multiple positions within the company spend time on - Adobe Target might be the best platform regarding analytics integration. That matters. Adobe does a great job at exampling this (as well as its new A/B testing capacity which is substantial) in a well put together demo/marketing video on its website. I recommend a watch by all.The ability to run multiple campaigns simultaneously with analytics gathering and dashboard presentation for all, broken out up to and inclusive of variable changes for each campaign, should make the analytics capacity even more visible for Adobe Target. I can't understate how much that has and will matter going forward. A/B and multi-variate testing is to marketers what visualizations have become to data scientists, ways to make collaboration and value-prop more visible to non-technical experts and ways to improve outcomes. If Adobe Target helps marketers 1) keep their jobs and 2) drive effective outcomes, that's a really good thing. It should be able to do both.But, what good is A/B and multi-variate testing, automated personalization, mobile app/non-website optimization, and smart recommendation capacity without awareness? I still think, for whatever reason, that Adobe Target and the Adobe Marketing Cloud lack the ""sex appeal"" and general market awareness of other platforms. In a hugely competitive and well-capable space, that's a big problem. I would think that without an expansive marketing campaign itself that the financial driving of Adobe Target would be muted at best. Which is a shame.So, while the platform upgrades are substantial, I'm not changing modeling for Adobe just yet. With shares trading at 10-year highs many, investors won't notice but there's a bunch of market cap not being captured by an under-marketed marketing platform not realizing its potential. If Adobe ever gets this figured out though, look out above. Great platform, bad awareness.Good luck everybody."
3960488,24276,2016-03-23T10:34:22-04:00,"Adobe had a blow-out quarter fueled by its Creative Cloud.Clouds make updates easier, reduce costs, and allow for rapid expansion.Clouds also lower barriers to entry.","Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) success in following Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) into cloud delivery of its applications offers an important lesson to all software vendors.Adobe reported earnings of $254 million, or 51 cents per share, on revenue of $1.383 billion during the first three months of the year. This compared to earnings of $85 million, or 17 cents per share, and revenue of $1.1 billion a year earlier.By moving its software online under the Creative Cloud brand, Adobe has been able to steadily increase revenues, operating income and margins. For the quarter, research expenses were up about 10% while revenues from subscriptions rose 12%, and service and support revenues rose 37%, from $51 million to $72 million. Sales and marketing expenses jumped 21%, but those increases might be expected to moderate in the future, meaning further margin expansion is possible.Small wonder that the stock popped after earnings, rising from $90 to $96/share overnight, before settling down over a few days' trading to its current level of about $92.50. You can say that the company is on Cloud 9 but there is a warning in that.The software business has now been transformed. I'm old enough to remember floppies, then CDs and DVDs. Software updates were one thing, but cloud is quite another. Cloud software is updated once, on the cloud, and that update immediately becomes available to everyone, because they're no longer working on their local machines but online. Over time, this provides a huge pop to earnings for companies that make the transition.But it also lowers the barrier to entry for new players. These won't be companies that go directly against Adobe or against Microsoft. They will, instead, offer add-ins, small niche programs that do things the big boys don't do, but that a subset of high-end customers need done. The companies will grow, they will multiply, and while some may be bought out by the big boys, others will combine to form real competitors.In a way, this is how Adobe itself was constructed. The original company was founded on desktop publishing and eventually had to acquire things like video editing (through Macromedia) that built out its suite. These companies did not go directly against Adobe. They created new niches, expanded them, and eventually challenged them as large Adobe clients demanded more.This could happen, for instance, in areas like virtual and augmented reality. Software for such devices only starts with their user interfaces. There will be applications, there will be content tools, and these will be made quickly available to users via clouds. Adobe may think it can wait on these opportunities to become ""ripe,"" but clouds let companies scale from 0 to 100 very quickly. Probably more quickly than even Adobe imagines.The point is that Creative Cloud, and cloud applications in general, create a new world for software designers and everyone involved in the business. We're seeing the benefits now, but downsides are sure to follow. They always do. Which is why the stock did not jump nearly as high as some might have expected, given the results, and why it was right not to do so."
3559776,32711,2015-10-08T12:05:49-04:00,"Adobe came out with guidance that missed the analyst consensus by a fairly wide margin.Fortunately, the guidance miss was largely due to forex on the one hand and investments in cloud migration on the other.Still expecting to post very respectable growth in fiscal 2016, I remain bullish on Adobe.","Quite recently, I wrote an article touting Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) progress in the cloud and the amount of revenue the company now derives from recurring sources. It thus came of something of an unpleasant surprise to me, and investors, that Adobe recently disappointed on its full-year 2016 guidance. However, the soft outlook doesn't seem due to weakness in demand as much as forex swings and investments. As such, I'm not too worried about Adobe yet, and my investment thesis remains intact.Panic buttonThe initial reaction to Adobe's guidance was fairly extreme. At one point, shares traded down as much as 13%, but as investors mulled over the numbers, Adobe trimmed its losses for the day to around 3% in after-hours trading, and ended up the next day down around 5%. Clearly, investors were rather panicky before figuring out that things actually didn't look quite as bad as all that.To be fair, it was a fairly sizable guidance miss. Adobe said it expects to make around $5.7 billion in revenue and $2.70 in EPS excluding items for fiscal 2016. Analysts however were expecting around $5.94 billion in annual sales and $3.20 in EPS. What's behind the miss?Fortunately for Adobe, seemingly nothing particularly related to demand or the strength in the company's underline business. According to management, currency translation is going to shave some $200 million off full-year sales, while the migration of the products not yet hosted on the cloud, such as Adobe reader, would cost another $100 million. If not for these expenses, revenue would be around $6 billion, beating the analyst consensus.Ultimately, the continued investment in migrating its product portfolio to the cloud is a good sign, underscoring the company's commitment to recurring revenue sources. Indeed, in a tech climate where many major companies are struggling to make the transition, Adobe's ride has been relatively smooth.Growth drivers intactAlthough overall top and bottom line growth are of course important to any company, a particularly closely watched metric for Adobe is subscriber growth. Essentially, this is a predictor of future revenue streams to some degree, as subscription costs get pushed back. Last month, the company announced it had added some 684,000 subscribers to its Creative Cloud services, or roughly 44,000 more than analysts had expected.Moreover, while EPS guidance missed estimates, full-year 2016 EPS of $2.70 would still mark a huge improvement over current fiscal 2015 estimates, representing an increase of around 30%. Revenue, meanwhile, will still rise by around 19% over 2015 full-year estimates. All in all, these are certainly not the kind of numbers to warrant a double-digit percentage drop in stock price, and if subscriber growth keeps up at this rate, Adobe should be looking forward to a very profitable time over the next few years.ConclusionInvestors were initially appalled by Adobe's guidance, which came in well below analyst views. However, much of the miss is due to forex swings on the one hand and investments in cloud migration on the other. The second bodes well for the company's future, as it reaffirms its commitment to a recurring revenue model. Even with the lower guidance, the company is still shaping up for some very respectable growth in 2016, and we may well see some upside surprises over the next few quarters."
3560196,47521,2015-10-08T14:16:33-04:00,"There will be some pain in the short term, but Adobe's long-term performance expectations remain strong.Currency is the major short-term catalyst, which should improve after the first fiscal quarter.The installed base numbers appear uneven to some, which has called into question the growth trajectory.Adobe Stock will probably surprise to the upside in revenue, and doesn't seem to be priced into the share price.","After Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) recently downwardly revised its sales and EPS guidance, its shares took a big hit, plunging 5.3 percent once the new numbers were released.At its annual analyst meeting, Adobe adjusted its fiscal 2016 revenue to come in at approximately $5.7 billion, down from the $5.93 billion analysts were expecting. Earnings per share projections were estimated to reach $2.70 for the next fiscal year, also significantly down from the $3.19 being looked for by analysts.These numbers aren't as ominous as they appear at first glance because it was no surprise foreign exchange headwinds were going to have an effect upon Adobe's performance. And everyone knew about the transition of customers from licensing software to subscriptions. What needs to be looked at closer there is at what stage the company is at in that area of the business and how much more upside can be expected.More of a concern is the 15 percent increase in spending announced by the company, which would have an impact on margin and earnings.My view is this was primarily a reality check by Adobe for investors, allowing them to get a look at the factors affecting the business in the short term, while reiterating its long-term outlook.Foreign exchange is taking longer to improve than expected, which will have a negative impact into the next quarter. Further out that should reverse, turning it into a positive catalyst as headwinds from FX shrink.When taking into account expectations for the next 3 years, the outlook for Adobe remains very positive.It also appears the market may not be pricing the acquisition of Fotolia into the share price, which has a lot of growth potential left in it, along with stickiness that should help retain existing customers while attracting new customers.Source: StockCharts.comLonger outlookTalking about its total addressable market (TAM), Adobe said it could reach $48 billion in 2018, a big increase from the $35 billion TAM in 2016.Breaking down the TAM figure, $27 billion of that would be in digital marketing, $17 billion in digital media, and $4 billion in Document Cloud, according to Adobe.Annual growth rates for fiscal 2015 through fiscal 2018 are projected to be 20 percent annually for revenue and 30 percent annually for non-GAAP earnings.The company said:So while the near-term outlook is a little weaker than expected, the longer-term growth narrative remains in place. With the company usually understating its general outlook while overstating spending, it's likely to perform better over the next three years than the above numbers suggest. But even as they are, it should more than double the share price through 2018, barring currency headwinds that extend much further into the future than believed at this time.Currency effectAs mentioned, currency effects weren't a surprise, as it was an expected outcome under the existing conditions.This is an area where the actions of the Federal Reserve will come into play. The dollar will be further strengthened if it eventually boosts interest rates, which would be a negative headwind for Adobe. It appears that is no longer a guarantee because of the data coming out is confirming global economic growth is slowing down.That said, a bigger factor in play for the near term has been the hedging program of Adobe, which has been somewhat aggressive. Those actions have changed what was originally believed to be the peak of the impact of FX on the company in this quarter, out to the next quarter.After that, we should see some FX relief. The next quarter, as it relates to foreign exchange, will probably put more downward pressure on the company, but afterwards, it should be a positive catalyst.SpendingAnother surprise coming out of the meeting was the announcement there would be a 15 percent increase in operating expenses for full year 2016, which will be compounded through full year 2018.That has created some concern for investors, but I'm not that worried about this because of similar spending announcements in the past that have been overstated by Adobe.Based upon past spending practices, the 15 percent projection looks high to me, and that is probably going to come in under that level as it has in prior years. In my research, I haven't been able to find a time when Adobe management actually spent to its estimates.For that reason, I don't see opex CAGR putting pressure on margin or earnings. The main threat there in my view will remain the level of currency effect.After the next quarter, that should improve, which is why I view it as a positive catalyst for fiscal 2016. Under that scenario, even if revenue is down in the short term, earnings would get a boost for the full year from the increase in margin. That would either offset the loss in revenue, assuming that is how it plays out, or it would provide an upward surprise. It depends on how much FX improves during that time.Transition stage of the companyOne that isn't as visible is where Adobe is at in its transition to a subscription model. Those more bearish on the company look to this as the key to growth expectations.For example, Wunderlich's Rob Breza believes the company is about 77 percent through the process, with Credit Suisse's Philip Winslow also seeing the transition as being further along than the majority of the market thinks.If that is true, it means revenue and earnings from subscriptions don't have the upside potential being assumed for over the longer term. Also of concern is if the transition is further along, then there isn't the consistency in results that should accompany it.Where the discrepancy seems to be coming from is management has pointed to there being about 8.3 million more Creative Suite users that have yet to make the transition, which would suggest an installed base of about 16.9 million.Going back to its analyst meeting in 2013, Adobe said its installed base was 12.8 million. The answer to the question of which one is accurate is important to future growth projections and expectations.That is something management should address. Either the numbers in 2013 were widely understated, or the number of users still needing to make the transition to Creative Suite was overstated. That's over a 4 million gap concerning its installed user base.This is why some believe the transition is further along than assumed.On the other hand, it's possible the installed user base did enjoy a big surge in numbers. If it did, it would be in the range of 32 percent since 2013.Until management gives some clarity there, I'm going to go with the latest numbers. Those saying the transition is further along than investors believe, assume the installed base is much smaller than being stated because of disbelief in the growth trajectory implied in the numbers.I think if it was on the lower side, the company wouldn't have been willing to make the projections it did for the next three years, although sustainable growth after fiscal 2018 would be more of a concern when taking into account the size of the installed user base being smaller than believed.FotoliaEarlier I mentioned the market may not fully appreciate the value the acquisition of Fotolia adds to Adobe. It seems to me it's being considered more of an add-on than a solid revenue stream.The stock photo subscription licensing fee market is a decent $3 billion, according to Heidelberg University, with services like Getty Images and Corbis being among the more well known.Demand comes primarily from businesses needing images to place with marketing materials, articles and reports, among other uses.Using the platform of Fotolia, the company launched Adobe Stock in June 2015, which included over 40 million images at that time, which most importantly, is part of its Creative Cloud suite.Adobe has estimated approximately 85 percent of those buying stock images are using Adobe tools at this time. Not only does it add impetus to acquire subscriptions, but it also adds a stickiness to the suite, which increases perceived and actual value, which should result in a higher percentage of users maintaining their subscriptions.The competitive advantage and potential here is obvious to me. If someone is using Photoshop or Illustrator, why would they take the additional step of going somewhere else and getting an image, when they can do it with a single click with Adobe Stock? For that reason, not only do I see this as an underrated revenue stream for the company, but it will eat into market share of Shutterstock Inc. (NYSE:SSTK) and similar competitors.Based upon a market of about $3 billion, it's not hard to figure out the annual revenue potential Adobe Stock offers the company. Just a 10 percent share would add $300 million in revenue to the company annually, and I believe it's going to get a lot more than that.ConclusionThere is no doubt in my mind Adobe will have to endure some downward pressure in this quarter, and probably the next, based on foreign exchange issues.With existing information and hedging changes, this will improve in the second quarter of its fiscal year. I think this will be the case even if the Federal Reserve increases interest rates, because the hedging effect is probably stronger than the impact of a Fed move. That conclusion is based upon only one interest rate move, not a series of moves over the next couple of years, which is very unlikely.On the revenue and earnings side, the estimates are in line with my outlook, and over the next three years, Adobe should be able to come close to doubling its share price if its projections are in line with actual performance.With the possibility of a nice boost from an improved currency outlook, strong growth prospects, and more revenue coming from Adobe Stock, it looks like the outlook from Adobe is understated for the next several years."
3522866,40351,2015-09-21T03:12:26-04:00,"Adobe Systems has recently released its Q3 results, in which it managed to beat revenue, earnings and margin estimates.The strength was largely driven by the digital marketing business and subscriber growth.The company has slightly lowered its annual guidance.But the results show that the company’s transition is well on its way.","Software maker Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) has recently reported its third-quarter results that were better than market estimates, but the maker of Photoshop slashed its revenue guidance for the year.Earnings recapDuring the third quarter, Adobe's total revenues climbed by 21% from last year to $1.2 billion, driven by a 51.4% increase in subscription revenues to $829 million. In digital media, once again, creative-cloud subscriptions increased on a year-over-year (89.8%) and sequential (14.7%) bases to $5.33 million. Due in part to the increase in subscriptions, the creative annualized recurring revenues (Creative ARR) climbed to $2.29 billion from $1.79 billion in the first and $2.02 billion in the second quarters of the current year. This has pushed the total digital media ARR to $2.65 billion, up from $2 billion in the first and $2.35 billion in the second quarters. On the digital marketing front, marketing cloud revenues increased by a strong 27% from last year and 12.8% from the second quarter to a record level of $368.4 million.Despite the strong growth in revenues due to the above-mentioned reasons, Adobe's operating expenses increased by just 0.9% from the same quarter last year. Consequently, excluding the impact of one-off items, the company's operating income nearly doubled to $360.7 million. The company's operating margin has risen from 18.9% a year earlier and 27.5% in the second quarter to 29.6%. The company's adjusted profit increased from $0.28 per share a year earlier to $0.54 per share.Adobe ended up beating both revenue and earnings estimates of $1.21 billion and $0.50 per share respectively, as per the data compiled by Bloomberg. The company's operating margin was also ahead of market's consensus estimate, according to Credit Suisse's Philip Winslow.For the fourth quarter, the company said that it is going to earn a profit of $0.56 to $0.62 per share from revenues of $1.28 billion to $1.33 billion. The top end of the guidance was lower than analysts' consensus estimate of earnings of $0.64 per share from revenues of $1.36 billion. The company's guidance also implies that it has reduced its annual revenue outlook from its previous estimate of $4.85 billion to between $4.76 billion and $4.81 billion. On the other hand, the digital media ARR is expected to climb to $2.95 billion in the current year, which is higher than the company's previous guidance of $2.93 billion.AnalysisAdobe not only managed to deliver better-than-expected results, it was a text-book high-quality earnings beat, meaning that the company managed to beat both revenues and earnings estimates while improving profitability, which also came ahead of analysts' estimates. This strength was largely driven by the digital marketing business and subscriber growth. These quarterly results have also confirmed that the subscriber growth is the most important metric investors should watch out for. If the company continues to deliver strong subscriber growth, then everything else will also likely fall in place.In the third quarter, Adobe added 684,000 subscribers. That's not only higher than the addition of 639,000 subscribers in the second quarter, but also greater than the analysts' consensus estimates who were not expecting a significant increase in these numbers as compared to the second quarter. The data compiled by Bloomberg suggested that the markets were expecting 640,000 additions. If Adobe continues to go this way in the fourth quarter as well, then it will likely end up beating its annual target of having 5.9 million subscribers.Adobe has been a transition story for the last three years, as it switches its business model from selling packaged software to cloud-based subscription pricing. The latter is more profitable and comes with predictable, recurring revenues, thereby improving the long-term growth visibility. On top of this, it also allows the company to improve its revenue per user metric. The switch, however, led to an 8% decline in the company's revenues in 2013, as it began to recognize revenues over the course of subscription rather than a single lump-sum payment. But revenues have picked up since then as customers are getting used to the new cloud-based business.The strong number of new subscriptions shows that the transition is going better than expected. And it is nearly complete. In the previous quarter, Adobe said that recurring revenues now account for 73% of the company's total revenues. That's up from 63% in the same quarter last year.Even the slight decline in annual guidance is due in large part to the fact that the transition is catching up with Digital Media. The Acrobat Lightroom and Photoshop Elements are witnessing faster-than-expected growth in subscriptions, which is going to have a negative impact in the short term.TakeawayAdobe Systems has delivered a high-quality earnings beat that shows its transition is going smoothly. So far this year, the company's stock has appreciated by 11.75%, easily outperforming the broader S&P 500 index, which has dropped by 5%, and the Nasdaq, which has gained by less than 2%. I expect Adobe's stock to continue going this way as the company shifts to a cloud-based, subscription-pricing business model."
3429916,78725,2015-08-12T17:10:31-04:00,"Legendary investor Philip Fisher once presented 15 points that a company must pass in order for it to be justified as a strong investment.Philip Fisher's long-term track record is truly magnificent, and any stock that passes his criteria should be seriously considered for an investment.Adobe is a modern company that passes almost all of Fisher's 15 points, and therefore could perform very well over a long-term period of time.Further analysis of Adobe's performance in each individual point will be presented in the article.","Philip Fisher was a well-known stock investor who lived and invested throughout the 20th century. Focused on long-term growth, Fisher has become something of a legend throughout the investment community due to his amazing track record. Just some of his numerous successful investments include decade-long investments in Nucor (NYSE:NUE), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), and Motorola (NYSE:MSI). He is quite well known for his book, ""Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits."" In this book, he presents 15 points that he used to find the kinds of investments that made him so successful. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a modern company that passes almost all of Philip Fisher's 15 points, which shows that it may be a strong, long-term growth investment. This article will go through Adobe's performance in each of these points individually.1. Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?Adobe 's operations consist of three different segments: Digital Media, Digital Marketing, and Print and Publishing. These segments compose 65%, 30%, and 5% (approximately) of the company's total revenue, respectively.The company's Digital Media segment is comprises their Creative Cloud and Document Cloud products. In this segment the focus will be on Adobe's Creative Cloud offering, which easily represents the most growth potential for the company. The company's Creative Cloud offering currently has over 4.5 million paid subscriptions, up from zero just a few years ago. This shows an extremely high amount of demand for this kind of a product, signifying that the potential market for the product is multiples of its current size, especially as it appeals to almost all levels of customers, from creative individuals to innovative businesses. The company estimates a potential 8 million creative professionals that could be interested in their product, and tens of millions more traditional consumers. Currently, however, Adobe has only succeeded in capturing ~20% of the professional market and only a minute amount of the total consumer market, showing that the Creative Cloud still has significant room to expand in its market. Subscriptions for the Creative Cloud have been growing at 30%+ yoy consistently since Adobe launched the product. This rapid growth rate further validates the commercial viability of the product and the earnings potential it has over the long-term.Furthermore, Adobe's Document Cloud solution, which aims to convert Acrobat users to a new $15/month cloud-based solution, just launched a few months ago, and is already growing at 10%+ sequentially, indicating a high demand for the product and a large potential market for it.The company's digital marketing segment also has significant potential for growth: this segment generated $1.2 billion in revenue last year, representing 30% yoy bookings growth, in-line with past results. The company estimates a $21 billion total addressable market across all of their marketing platforms. This hold significant potential for growing their sales in the industry. Furthermore, the company is a strong leader in the mobile marketing industry, which is just starting its growth cycle. The mobile industry itself is already growing at aggressive rates. The mobile marketing industry is following suit; however, that industry is only just developing, and so vast portions of the market are up for grabs to high quality companies. Adobe offers both app-development products for its customers, as well as mobile marketing solutions. These two industries are both in their infancy and offer considerable growth prospects for the company. The same can be said for many of the company's other marketing segments , including their market-testing and social media marketing solutions, both of which represent under-addressed and growing markets.Given these 30%+ growth rates and large addressable markets in the company's two main segments, I believe that Adobe has considerable potential to grow sales organically in their industries over the long-term. PASS2. Does the management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will still further increase total sales potentials when the growth potentials of currently attractive product lines have largely been exploited?In just a few years, Adobe's management has completely transformed the company into a high-quality, high-growth SAAS platform with significant long-term growth potential. This shows that management definitely doesn't value inaction and watching the world go by them. This transition into the SAAS business has been attempted by many, with only few pure successes. Therefore, management definitely has a proven ability and desire to continuously evolve their business and products to ensure long-term success and growth.Since the launch of Creative Cloud, Adobe has continuously built onto their platform with new offerings and innovative solutions. This plethora of updates and upgrades to the software has opened up multiple new market opportunities for Creative Cloud in the photography, mobile, corporate, and multiple other industries. A more recent example of new Creative Cloud developments is the acquisition of Fotolia, which adds onto Creative Cloud's photo offerings and services. Over the long-term, Adobe should be able to continue to expand their offerings and solutions to cover a larger addressable market or maximize the value of the offerings provided to current users, both of which should lead to long-term growth after current markets dry up.In the shorter term, Adobe launched two new offerings in their digital marketing segment just a few months ago: Primetime and Audience Manager. These two offerings focus on multi-screen video monetization and advertising, and customer/visitor demographics and targeted marketing, respectively. These new offerings add significant value onto Adobe's existing platform and allow for expansion into two new industries to continue the company's stellar growth record. Their development reflects management's commitment to innovation and new development.Also, the aforementioned recently launched Document Cloud solution is another testament to management's innovative ability in expanding the markets for current products, and should allow for further monetization and increased market potential of their Acrobat software.Because of these reasons, I believe that Adobe's management has a strong sense of long-term value through new development, which should ensure that there will continuously be new revenue streams to take the place of old and stagnating operations. PASS3. How effective are the company's research and development efforts in relation to its size?Adobe spends roughly 20% of their revenue on R&D, nothing special for a SAAS and tech company. The aforementioned upgrades to Creative Cloud, digital marketing, and Document Cloud are direct effects of Adobe's spending in R&D. The costs of these projects should seem minimal compared to the long-term growth and earnings that they should bring. I therefore believe that Adobe's R&D expense is being allocated toward the right causes, are very effective, and should continue to bring success to the company. PASS4. Does the company have an above-average sales organization?Adobe's sales organization is relatively easy to analyze: the company has no production and no distribution; almost everything is in the cloud. The marketing for many of their products is relatively easy too. Adobe's Digital Media strategy is to convert users of their old products into their new, cloud-based ones, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud. This is relatively easy, and has a very low customer acquisition cost because they technically have already acquired the customers. Furthermore, Creative Cloud and Document Cloud are currently their respective industry standards, and therefore don't need much marketing to get to customers.The Digital Marketing segment has a normal marketing program in place, and is growing at rapid rates through that program, indicating its success. Furthermore, the comprehensiveness of their Marketing Cloud offerings should help attract diverse customers and offer those customers a 'one-stop shop' for marketing tools. PASS5. Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?Adobe currently has a ~12% profit margin.Of note is that Adobe has for years sustained an 85%+ gross margin because of their software/SAAS-based business model, which allows them to incur little to no COGS. The remaining 72.5% worth of earnings between the gross profit and net income is mainly taken up by SG&A and R&D expenses. Fisher specifically noted in his book that a low profit margin could be ignored if the reason for it is high investment into future growth through successful R&D and advertising efforts. Early-stage SAAS companies are notoriously unprofitable, leading some investors to call them overvalued because of their high sales multiples and lack of profits. However, in reality, most SAAS companies have easy potential to generate profits, but instead they choose to reinvest their profits into R&D and SG&A in order to continue to ensure long-term growth.Adobe is similarly an early-stage SAAS company still in its growth phase. Because of this, I believe that Adobe's relatively low profit margin, especially given the high-margin characteristics of the industry, is a direct result of management's determination to invest into growth rather than build up a cash pile. At this point in the game money reinvested into Adobe's rapidly compounding business is worth multiples more than retained cash generating 0.1% interest in a bank. Because of this I don't think a current analysis of Adobe's profit margin is of any particular benefit to investors. Further down the line I believe that Adobe's margins will grow as the company matures and they cut down on investing into growth. Fisher would likely also agree with reinvesting profits into the business. PASS6. What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?As was discussed in the previous point, as Adobe's business matures, management will either invest expenses into new business to generate continued growth, or will cut down on reinvesting expenses back into Adobe's core business, which will grow profit margins through the reduction of operating expenses. Also, the recent release of the Document Cloud should add a new, high margin, revenue stream to the company, which should allow for margin growth as time goes on. PASS7. Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?Adobe is rated 4.0 on Glassdoor by ~12% of their 12,500 employees. Fortune also named them one of the top 100 places to work in 2014 (no. 83). I believe that this suggests that Adobe has good relations with their employees.Also, the company's Senior VP of People and Places, inclusive of the position of human resources, Donna Morris, has been with the company since 2002 and has experienced little turmoil since then. This indicates that she is both skilled at her job and that Adobe's overall employee relations are good. PASS8. Does the company have outstanding executive relations?Adobe has not had many executive departures over the past few years, especially after the transition of the company's business model. There have also been very few executive complaints and negative actions over the years. This indicates that there are good relations among the company's executives. PASS9. Does the company have depth to its management?Adobe is a $40 billion corporation with 12,500 total employees. It would be almost impossible for a highly centralized management team to run the entire corporation. Multiple subsets of management and directors exist below the company's top executives, who themselves are already a diversified team. PASS10. How good are the company's cost analysis and accounting controls?This point of Fisher's has, since the publishing of his book, lost its necessity in a company analysis. Today, giant databases and high-tech computers store information and make it readily accessible. Fisher's companies did not have access to these kinds of machines in 1958, and so back then accounting processes were of major importance in determining the value of a company. Nowadays this issue has been resolved with the advancement of technology. Irrelevant (we'll count that as a PASS)11. Are there other aspects of the business, somewhat peculiar to the industry involved, which will give the investor important clues as to how outstanding the company may be in relation to its competition?This point is basically asking for the company's competitive advantages, or something that sets it apart from competition. In the company's Digital Media segment, Adobe has two distinct competitive advantages which should allow them maintain and grow their market share. The company's Creative Cloud has already established itself as an industry standard, largely because of a lack of better products. Designers, professionals, and businesses alike use the Creative Cloud and have propelled the product to high brand recognition and industry necessity. Document Cloud also a similar competitive advantage in its already established scale and its position as the industry norm.Regarding the overall business, I believe that Adobe has a special competitive advantage in its management's ability to adapt. After seeing an opportunity in the SAAS business, management was quick to advocate and execute on changing the business model. They are currently still working rapidly to innovate and upgrade Adobe's current offerings and add new ones. This kind of management decisiveness and action is very rare, and should allow Adobe to indefinitely stay ahead of competition in terms of product development and adaptation. PASS12. Does the company have a short-range or long-range outlook in regard to profits?Management's decision to embark on their business transition was a risky but calculated play that wound up landing them in an extremely promising market position with high growth and future potential. This business transition was and is currently still hurting the company's short-term sales growth and bottom line. Management, however, looked further than the next quarter's and even the next year's sales numbers in deciding to adapt their business. The below chart shows Adobe maintaining high SG&A and R&D expenses even as the top line fell back in 2013. These expenses were incurred back then to develop and commercialize many of their current high-growth offerings, including Creative Cloud.ADBE Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsThis shows dedication to long-term value creation for shareholders, even at the expense of short-term growth or profits.This is further shown by the aforementioned decision to reinvest Adobe's profits back into the business to secure more growth. This sacrifices bottom-line earnings by increasing R&D and SG&A expenses in the short-term. Many, especially on Seeking Alpha, have began calling the stock overvalued for this reason, on a earnings valuation basis. Management, unfazed, is still dedicating a substantial portion of profits to maintaining and even possibly growing their 20-30% annual growth rate, showing that they have long-term profits in mind as oppose to short-term shareholder appeasement. PASS13. In the foreseeable future will the growth of the company require sufficient equity financing so that the large number of shares then outstanding will largely cancel the existing stockholders' benefit from this anticipated growth?Adobe commands a reasonable 12% profit margin, which, based on current trends, should net them ~$650 million in a year's time. They currently also have $950 million in cash and equivalents. The recent Fotolia acquisition, the first one in 2 years, cost only $800 million. As management has historically not been very acquisition-prone, I don't think Adobe will be announcing a new acquisition anytime soon, and, if they did, I would likely be easily covered by their existing cash reserve or future cash flows.Furthermore, Adobe authorized a $2 billion buyback earlier this year good for ~5% of shares outstanding. This indicates that management both doesn't anticipate using the cash anytime soon, and believes that shares are currently undervalued. Furthermore, if Adobe does for some reason need equity financing in the future, this repurchase program could potentially cover a portion of it. Although that would be fairly counter-intuitive. PASS14. Does the management talk freely to investors about its affairs when things are going well but ""clam up"" when troubles and disappointments occur?Like most companies in the current American economy, Adobe hasn't had very many troubles or disappointments in the past few years. The odd miss on earnings or growth have all gone by with complete management transparency. Furthermore, back in 2011, when the company's growth was stagnating, management was quick to discuss and act on their Digital Media plan to grow sales and appease investors. As usual, however, investors should pay close attention to management's commentary and actions, especially once something particularly bad happens to the business, in order to analyze their actions in a negative environment. PASS (But Watch)15. Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?Adobe's management has never exhibited any signs of mal-practice or unethical behavior. PASSOverall:PASS: 15FAIL: 0Conclusion:Adobe surprisingly passes all of Fisher's points. This is an extremely good sign that the company has strong potential to d o well over the long-term. If investors choose to invest into the company based on Fisher's criteria, they should continuously monitor and analyze the company's developments in relation to Fisher's points, and act accordingly. They should also keep in mind that Fisher's 15 points screen for long-term (often decades) growth potential, and effectively ignore many short-term matters such as relative valuation. Adobe's forward P/E of 25 is a premium to the overall market, but may also be justified because of the company's past growth and potential. Over the long-term, absent of any unpredictably catastrophic events, Adobe should be able to deliver substantial growth and shareholder value."
3935276,98236,2016-02-26T14:33:23-05:00,"Adobe shares have seen significant valuation compression over the last year and last few months.The company's transition to a subscription-based revenue model is mainly complete and earnings levels are starting to rise rapidly now.Adobe already generates substantial free cash flow that is 3.7% of the company's enterprise value.The company is the dominant player in what it calls its Creative Cloud, which creates digital content for both commercial enterprises and hobbyists.The company's marketing Cloud is probably the leading player in its space and is seeing 30% annual bookings growth in what remains a hot space.","Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a company that is very well-known to many consumers in terms of some of the applications it sells and perhaps a bit less well-known to many investors as a business juggernaut in some rapidly growing spaces. Most computer users are familiar with some of the offerings in the Adobe Document cloud that include Acrobat PDF services and eSign Services. Photoshop is one of the most widely-used and widely-known consumer applications in the world.Adobe began its transition to a vendor relying on a cloud-based delivery platforms and a subscription-based revenue model several years ago. During the course of the transition, headline numbers were hobbled significantly as might be anticipated. While Adobe still gets a significant amount of its business from traditional license engagements, the benefits of the subscription model have become increasingly evident in the company's financial statements with EPS forecast to rise 33% this current fiscal year (ends 11/30/16) and 34% the following year.I don't think anyone describes Adobe as undiscovered. It is a company that has a revenue run rate of significantly greater than $5 billion, growing at 20% on the top line with rising margins and cash flow. The company's well-advertised transition is in its final innings, but that still means 26% of the company's revenues came from traditional software sales last year.While the headline numbers for fiscal 2015 might sound impressive, as is the case with most cloud vendors, they tend to obscure the company's business value. The company's business backlog increased more than 50% last year to just shy of $4.4 billion.Like many momentum growth stories, the question of finding the right entry point is crucial for investors. Adobe shares have declined by 13% since the end of last year. While over any extended period of time the shares have seen significant appreciation, over the past year they are up by less than 9%, suggesting that there has been a significant valuation compression with non-GAAP earnings rising by over 60% and sales rising by more than 16%. That said, there is no way anyone would classify this as anything other than a momentum growth story. The company has a P/E of greater than 30X for the year to November of 2016. In addition, it has an EV/S of just less than 7X. To some extent, those valuations will be significantly reduced by continuing rapid top line and EPS growth. EPS for fiscal '17 are forecast to rise by no less than 34%, which reduces the P/E to 23X for that period. Sales are expected to grow 21%, which would put the EV/S ratio down to 5.7X. The rapid growth in forecast earnings for the 2017 period is a function of the subscription model, which at maturity puts lots of very high gross margin revenues on the income statement. Adobe will be the first of the larger companies that has transitioned to primarily subscription revenues to demonstrate the potential profitability of the subscription model.I can't remember the number of conversations with friends and fellow investors I have had in which the discussion was about the right price and right time to enter a name. There are going to be readers who take a look at this article and say to themselves, ""I will buy Adobe shares at $70 or at $60."" The problem is that much of the time, the prospective investor never gets the chance to buy the shares at the price he wants to pay. Sort of like bemoaning that you didn't buy that Co-Op in Manhattan for $1 million when it sold at that price, but you may not have had either the million dollars or the disposition to take the risk. If Adobe can achieve the goals I describe below, the shares are a decent value today.If the market implodes for whatever reason or if the global economy enters a significant recession, Adobe won't achieve it financial targets and this would prove to be a bad entry point. I am not going to try to handicap the odds of black swans or any other kind of swans come to that. Many, many people write about the global economy and my poor tongue would simply waste electrons were I to attempt to add to the babble. But if plodding US growth continues and the world economy does not implode, Adobe shares are worth a serious look. I will go through the company's strategy and product offerings at a very gross level of detail to try to make the point.Background And A Very Shallow Dive Into AdobeAdobe was founded in California in 1982. Its name is based on a creek that ran behind the houses of the founders. The founders had a vision of creating what became the desktop publishing revolution after working at Xerox (NYSE:XRX) for many years. Adobe has been active in M&A and was able to buy its principle competitor, , than a decade ago. The founders have been gone for almost 10 years. The current CEO, Shantanu Narayen, has been in his post since December 2007. His background is in Engineering and he joined Adobe in 1998 as a VP for product research. He is, perhaps, less colorful and a bit more analytical than many other Silicon Valley CEO's and is not addicted to a high-profile sales culture. The company bought Omniture, which has been a key foundation of its marketing cloud technology in 2009.Currently and for the foreseeable future, Adobe operates in three discrete areas of operation: Adobe ""Creative Cloud,"" Adobe ""Document Cloud"" and Adobe's ""Marketing Cloud."" They have one thing in common in that they all started on their transformation to a subscription revenue model with the services hosted in the cloud during 2012. And they feature one overarching growth concept which is average revenue per unit (ARPU). Simply put, Adobe is the exemplar of ""land and expand"" strategy where the consumer starts buying a solution with a very small dollar commitment and winds up spending much more over time. This strategy, which is the basis for the company's growth, is supported by frequent delivery of new features and capabilities for all of the company's solutions.Adobe's Creative Cloud - The Company's Heartland That Has Seen A Significant Recrudescence Of Growth In The Last Quarter!The creative cloud these days includes Photoshop, Illustrator and InDesign. The newest offering is something called Adobe Stock, through which a user can access 45 million free photos, graphics and videos that can be pasted inside an app. This latest capability is based on the recent Adobe acquisition of Fotiola. The creative cloud has mobile apps and can be synched to all the devices in a network. Adobe is the 800-pound gorilla in the creative space. One magazine called ""Creative Bloq"" has descried the Creative Cloud as ""the cornerstone of our lives. It's played an overwhelming part in creating this market and has owned it ever since."" There are all kinds of alternative tools in the market, many free and many for sale rather than only available on a subscription basis. But the overwhelming preponderance of opinion is that Adobe dominates the space currently and that it is likely to continue to dominate the space into the future because it has such a vast array of products and is willing to make huge development investments in absolute and relative dollars to preserve its market position.The great proportion of Adobe's revenues in the creative space are now recurring and the company has crossed over the transition in the model from perpetual to subscription. That being said, there are still apparently eight million live users of the Adobe legacy product called Creative Suite and one of the bigger questions is how fast the company can migrate legacy users to the new subscription platform.The quarter that ended November 30, 2015 was a very strong quarter for Creative Cloud. Obviously there are still millions of users of the older technology, Creative Suite, and that will be the case for years. Even after last quarter there remain 8 million Creative Suite customers who are clearly a target for migration to the company's new cloud based offerings. In all, the company added 833k new subscribers in just the past quarter bringing total Creative Cloud subscribers to over 6 million. In aggregate, during the quarter, Creative Cloud revenues grew by 35% year on year to $875 million and are a bit less than 60% of the corporate total. Of the 6 million users, more than half pay more than $50/month. Unknowable at this point include churn rates-no one really knows if the 20% churn assumption that Adobe uses in its assumption table is going to be validated over the long term. There are clearly lots of hobbyists and part time creative users of Creative Cloud. Will some of them decide that they want to move on to some other hobby or pastimes? And of equal interest will be the potential to increase the ARPU. The ARPU was flat last quarter despite strong growth in Commercial sales of the product. This suggests that there were lots of new hobbyist customers. One of the key sales mantras at this company is the need to grow ARPU and to emphasize selling new functionality such as Adobe Stock. My guess is that this is more of an upside potential to the model that has yet to be acknowledged by many investors and analystsI don't imagine there is anyone who thinks that Adobe can continue to sell 833k/new subscriptions per quarter-the numbers would just be too staggering for anyone to responsibly forecast that level of demand, but it does suggest that the current growth forecasts for the company are biased to the upside, in my opinion. On the other hand, I think it ought to be noted that much of what Adobe sells, is sold to consumer/hobbyists these days. If there is a recession, and consumers pull back, I would have to imagine that something like ""Creative Cloud"" is going to be pressured. The basic price for ""Creative Cloud"" is several hundred dollars for a one-year subscription although the photography plan, which includes Photoshop can be had for about $100. In a recession, I imagine that consumers would find expenditures such as those to be items that could be postponed-they are truly consumer discretionary.Document Cloud-Adobe's Entree into the world of Document ManagementAdobe's has a significant group of products in what it describes as its document cloud. I am sure most readers use PDF's every day and the use of E-sign has increased exponentially over the years. Actual reported revenues for the document cloud business have been pretty stable for several years masking the rapid growth in annual recurring revenues. Recurring revenues now make up 50% of the total in this sector. Document cloud is not the exciting growth market nor does it have some gigantic addressable TAM as does the Creative Cloud or Marketing Cloud. There are a fair number of alternatives to the document cloud. Most of these competitors are small and have point solutions that are far less all-encompassing than what Adobe offers. The Document Cloud subscription is $15/month except it can be bundled with either a Creative Cloud or an Acrobat subscription. Basically the solutions within Document Cloud allow users to turn documents into a PDF, and to edit, to export, to comment and to E-sign documents. Industry analysts seem to believe that the product, of which the current packaging and platform was just launched this past spring, ""has revolutionized document management software again. There are some limitations to Document Cloud but you won't be disappointed.""The Document Cloud is the smallest piece of Adobe with about 17% of total revenues and its reported revenues grew by just 6% year on year during the company's fiscal Q4. That being said, the combination of new products and the switch to a subscription model has driven Annual Recurring Revenue up by more than 45% to $385 million in the past year.Adobe Marketing Cloud - An Integrated Suite Of Solutions In One Of The More Touted Segments Of The IT World!Adobe, as much as any other company, has emphasized solutions in the digital marketing space over the past several years. I confess to having a fascination with the technology of predictive analytics. Somehow the idea that software solutions can predict human behavior and adopt strategies that might alter that behavior is just something that I find tremendously intriguing. I guess some folks play baseball and others play hockey or strike a little white ball around a park or ski down steep mountains. I like to deal with regression analysis or the results one can develop using that technology.Why did I write that-well if you want to understand what the Adobe Marketing Cloud is all about in a few words, it is about using predictive analytics profitably. It is also about customizing customer experiences, as the jargon goes these days, by which is meant that consumers are fed advertisements and offers that are tailored to their personal preferences. It is the kind of thing that drives privacy advocates crazy but it is happening and Adobe is a leader in it.The Marketing Cloud is built on some relatively high profile acquisitions most notably including Omniture back in 2009, a company that pioneered something in those distant times was called web analytics. It was amongst the more controversial mergers I have seen and I confess to having my own doubts as to how it might work out. It is one of the credits to the current CEO that he took Omniture from the pig it most certainly had been to something at least as valuable as a silk purse. Much of what Adobe Marketing Cloud does these days are solutions that were pioneered by Omniture and refined and packaged appropriately by Adobe. Another important acquisition made by the company, at least in terms of what it offers these days in marketing cloud was Neotane. To a certain extent, Neotane might be thought of a company similar to ExactTarget, the heart of the Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) marketing cloud but without the E-Mail foundation. Although Adobe paid a huge multiple of trailing sales to buy Neotane, it is one of the cornerstones of the company's overall offering in marketing cloud.In addition to ExactTarget/CRM, the other major competitor in the digital marketing space is Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Oracle bought two digital marketing/E-mail marketing vendors, Responsys and Eloqua and put them together to build the Oracle marketing cloud. All of the competitors offer pretty advanced analytics that run on their cloud-there are some observers who feel that Adobe's analytics have superior functionality and better intuitive query capabilities. I expect that offerings, such as the Adobe Media Optimizer and Adobe Analytics, which are ultimately descendants of Omniture technology, have given Adobe a head start in the space. Adobe tries to use its strength in content creation (""Creative Cloud"") as a tool in appealing to marketers. The concept is that if a user is engaged with Adobe in creating content, it ought to use Adobe to insure that the content goes to the fight audience and has a measurable and positive impact. Not too surprisingly, and unlike the CRM Marketing Cloud, Adobe has no current link to any CRM platform.According to some market research organizations, Adobe is probably the overall leading vendor in the space currently and it would seem to be focused on the specific areas in marketing automation that is considered crucial by researchers such as Gartner which is content marketing.Adobe's marketing Cloud has been growing revenues at a bit more than 25% compounded the last several years with bookings growth closer to 30%. Expectations are that total digital marketing and connectivity revenues will reach about $1.7 billion this year which would be 15% growth, retarded by the transition to a totally subscription based model. Subscription revenues are growing 33%, while the balance of the business is shrinking by about 15%. Last quarter, Digital Marketing revenues of $352 million were a bit light, with year on year reported growth of just 7% but the under attainment was mainly because of a shift to more ratable bookings. Bookings growth of 28% for the period was in line with expectations. Overall, Digital marketing revenues are about 30% of the corporate total.Although Digital Marketing may not seem as sexy as the market served by Creative Suite, the TAM's for both business segments are comparable and researchers such as Gartner have proclaimed that one day-they put it in 2018, digital marketing would be larger than any other single category in the software world. That seems hard to believe at the moment but there is a consistently strong and positive buzz around the space and it seems self-evident that the big three in the space are maintaining their relative positions.Valuation Metrics and the Investment Case for Adobe SharesI think that every time I write about cloud software vendors I have to start out by acknowledging that they are not and are not likely to become particularly cheap if looked at using classical valuation metrics. No one has called Adobe a deep value story or even much of a GARP story. And frankly, the Adobe story, like those of some of the other large vendors who have subscription revenue models, is not unknown. The company is followed by 23 analysts and it has a rating of 1.9 from the Thomson/First Call average. The company's beta is 1.19X compared to CRM's beta of 1.38X. Given the nature of what it sells, particularly in the Creative Cloud, it is hard for the company to produce huge upside surprises although sub adds last quarter are as close as this company comes to real excitement.The company has an EV/S of about 6.85X based on the current year consensus forecast. That metric is 7.7X based on the forecast for the following year. The company's non-GAAP P/E is 31X for the current fiscal year and just above 23X based on earnings estimates for fiscal '17.Most observers, and certainly this writer, think that Adobe can grow its revenues in excess of 20% for some years to come. The fact is that it has been growing faster than that but much of its growth has been masked by its transition to a subscription revenue model. That model transition is mainly completed now But as the transition ends, and growth becomes almost entirely a function of bookings, and as subscription revenues continue to increase as a proportion of the revenue mix, inevitably operating margins will rise and EPS growth will exceed revenue growth for several years to come. The company is forecasting EPS growth for the next several years of about 30% and growth in operating cash flows in the 25% range while forecasting revenue growth of about 20%.Adobe has a far smaller percentage of its net income derived from stock based comp. when compared to some other companies who offer software on a subscription basis, perhaps because it continues to have some residual of on premise license revenues that buoy reported current period earnings. In any event, stock based comp is about 25% of non-GAAP net income and the percentage has been falling gradually and did so again in the prior fiscal year. Stock based comp was 43% of operating cash flow last year. The company's non-GAAP cash flow of $1.47 billion substantially exceeds it non-GAAP net income of $1.054 billion.The company is the undisputed king of its Creative Cloud business and is probably the leader in the marketing cloud segment as well. It is hard to imagine 2 more likely growth areas in the enterprise software business over the coming years. The company's transition to a subscription model has entered the late stages. If the company can achieve its goals, and I have every reason to believe that it can, based both on its historical track record and some cursory analysis of the spaces in which it is a leader, EPS 5 years from now will be above $10/share and the company should still be sustaining growth above the average for the software industry. This is one of those cases in which the investment case is based on no more than consensus expectations. Anything more than that would be lagniappe.SummaryLike many cloud software vendors, Adobe shares have been weak, although less weak to open up 2016 than many other so-called cloud software vendors. No one believes that Adobe shares are cheap. On the other hand, the company should readily be able to sustain top line growth of greater than 20% for several years to come-it dominates the business of creating content for both businesses and consumers and has little effective competition to impact its growth. Its last quarter showed a very impressive total of new subscribers additions, substantially greater than expectations. While its results in its Marketing Cloud business were less spectacular, it achieved solid bookings growth of about 30%.I do think that Adobe is a cyclically sensitive company. Its Creative Cloud is clearly Consumer Discretionary and no one who has been through a business cycle focused on watching some software marketing automation vendors would ever believe that Marketing Cloud is anything but highly cyclically sensitive.I cannot suggest that this or any other time is a perfect entry time into the shares. A lot of that is a function of how the market performs in general and how well high multiple growth stocks perform specifically. But I believe that this is an excellent holding with about as many defensive properties as there are possible to have in the enterprise IT space for rapidly growing names. I think that rewards far outweigh risk for commitments in Adobe shares at these levels."
3521706,58641,2015-09-20T00:12:00-04:00,"Serif’s $50 Affinity Designer is a competent alternative to Adobe’s vector illustrator software.
        Affinity Designer is very lightweight and it does perform faster than Illustrator CC.
        Affinity Designer is Mac-only but many digital illustrators are Mac addicts. There is nothing preventing Serif from porting it to Windows soon.","I previously dismissed Affinity Photo as an unworthy alternative for Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Photoshop professionals. However, I cannot say the same thing about Serif's other $50 Mac-only program, Affinity Designer. After two days of testing the trial version, I decided to get the full Affinity Designer program.I am convinced this cheap graphic illustration software is a worthy replacement for Adobe's flagship $19.99/month Illustrator CC vector illustration software. Even professional digital illustrators will agree with my assessment that Affinity Designer is great for heavy-duty print and web graphic/User Interface design.Affinity Designer offers the same advanced features of Illustrator CC. It has a comprehensive set of tools, complex layer effects, Boolean object operations, support for 5K Retina displays, easy-to-use path drawing and freehand drawing, smart shapes, gradients, and GPU acceleration.The thing that really sold me on Affinity Designer is that it can now do text-on-a-path, which is an absolute necessity for creating logos. I made 400 pesos ($8.60) creating the simple logo for a walk-in client using Affinity Designer.(Source: Alcaraz Research)It took me less than 20 minutes to create the said logo (and two variations of it), thanks to the Cog Shape tool of Affinity Designer. Affinity Designer also has little learning curve for artists already accustomed to Illustrator CC. Serif gave it the same keyboard shortcuts that are almost similar to that of Illustrator.Like Affinity Photo, Affinity Designer does not have the same third-party plugins support of Illustrator CC. However, Serif's software touts faster performance while being much cheaper. Even on an ancient 2009 MacBook with only 2GB of RAM, Affinity Designer can be comfortably used while Adobe Photoshop CC 2014 and 12 tabs of the Firefox browser are running in the background.I cannot run Illustrator CC and Photoshop CC at the same time without noticeably degraded performance. I can now confirm Serif's claim that Affinity Designer is faster than Illustrator CC. It uses less CPU/RAM resources than Adobe's vector illustration program.Enabling OpenGL GPU acceleration on Macs with discreet 1GB or higher GPU cards makes Affinity Designer even faster. The latest Illustrator CC 2015 from Adobe has GPU acceleration that has messed up previews so I do not use it.On the other hand, Serif's implementation of GPU acceleration on Affinity Designer has no such preview problems.(Source: Alcaraz Research)This cheap $50 program even renders Illustrator files better than Illustrator CC 2015. Budget-constrained freelance graphic designers may also find that owning both Affinity Photo and Affinity Designer is also ideal. Affinity Photo and Designer can open (not just import) and manipulate the native files created by each other.As you can see from the screenshot below, I'm able to directly edit the text-on-a-path object of the Affinity Designer file of the logo I created inside Affinity Photo.(Source: Alcaraz Research)Affinity Designer also imports and exports Adobe proprietary formats like PDF and PSD. Photoshop CC 2014 can correctly open up multi-layered PSD files created by Affinity Designer. The multi-layed CMYK mode PSD file (10 cm x 9.9cm size, 300dpi resolution) logo I created on Affinity designer was only 1.5MB - a lot smaller than I expected.(Source: Alcaraz Research)Why It MattersMany logo artists, web designers, and UI/UX designers may decide to go Adobe Photoshop CC+Affinity Designer, instead of Photoshop CC+Illustrator CC. Photoshop CC at $9.99 a month is reasonable. However, the $19.99/month subscription fee of Illustrator CC is unattractive compared to the one-time $49.99 payment needed to get the Photoshop-compatible Affinity Designer.Even without extensive native third-party plugins available, Affinity Designer already offers what Illustrator CC can do for digital illustrators. Making Affinity Designer-created PSD files perfectly compatible with Photoshop's vast library of third-party plugins, gives graphic designers access to almost-unlimited specials effects.The obvious risk now is that Adobe's subscriptions on Illustrator CC might eventually decline on the Mac platform once more graphic artists learns about the low learning curve to master Affinity Designer.The Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Mac OS X platform dominates the all-important creative industry. There is also the obvious reality that Serif might port Affinity Designer to the Linux and Windows platforms in the future.Affinity Designer, unlike Affinity Photo, has proven itself worthy of professional usage. Serif's vector illustration software has consistently remain among the top-grossing software on the Mac platform since it was released last year. This should indicate that many people are buying it instead of them subscribing to the $19.99/month Illustrator CC product of Adobe.My TakeawayI do not plan to subscribe to Adobe Illustrator CC though. I'm sticking with my $50 Affinity Designer+Photoshop CC combo for now. Illustrator CC is just a small part of Adobe's revenue stream. However, retaining the loyalty of Mac-based addicts is important toward the future of Adobe.The real danger now is that Serif would eventually be able to upgrade Affinity Photo with better RAW image processing and third-party plug-ins compatibility so it could complement the impressive professional quality of Affinity Designer.The subscription-only Photoshop CC+Illustrator CC tandem that currently rules the professional mobile/ web/print graphic design industry might suffer from a Affinity Photo+Affinity Designer (which costs only $100 to permanently own both) tag team.Rather than only suggesting Adobe lower the monthly fee of Illustrator CC to $9.99, I would prefer that Adobe buys out Serif and kill its products before its too late. Adobe previously bought out Macromedia and then killed its Freehand vector illustration program. Some artists still consider 2004-era Freehand as superior to much newer Adobe's Illustrator CS4.My point is that it is better to eliminate the threat before it becomes too successful. Yes, it will take some time before book writers and tutorial creators to teach millions of Mac-based artists to really learn the one-year-old-only Affinity Designer.There are few online tutorials to learn the advanced features of Affinity designer and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) still doesn't sell any print/digital training book for Serif's amazing vector illustration program. I am therefore still endorsing a Buy for ADBE.The majority of PC and Mac-based artists will remain dependent on Illustrator CC for a few more years because it is what they have learned and used for decades now."

        Subscriber growth accelerated from last quarter.
        The company for all intents and purposes seems to be successfully making the transition to the cloud.","A large portion of IT companies have been scrambling to make the transition to the cloud over the last few years, as legacy software products are increasingly replaced by this relatively new way of distributing services. Some have been more successful than others. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) continues to see its revenue from the cloud increase, and recurring revenue is now good for the lion share of the company's sales. Although guidance for the most recent quarter was a bit soft, accelerating growth in recurring revenue bodes well for the company's future.Creative cloudMost of Adobe's revenue these days comes from something called the Creative Cloud. Aside from a nice name, the service offers users access to a wide range of Adobe's graphic design, video editing and web development software products. Rather than selling perpetual licenses, as was the generally accepted way of doing things only a few years ago, Adobe sells subscriptions to the service.Launched in 2011 and hosted on AWS, the Creative Cloud has been experiencing impressive growth over the last few years. This subscription-based model offers users several advantages, mainly the ability to customize software packages and install products on the fly. For Adobe, it has a huge advantage: it converts perpetual license sales into renewable revenue streams, which are generally more reliable. Let's see how this translates into top and bottom line growth.By the numbersThese days, analysts generally look for one number in Adobe's earnings reports, seemingly outweighing any of the other metrics: subscribers. For the most recent quarter, this metric again showed healthy growth. For the period, the service added 684,000 subscribers, bringing the total to around 5.33 million. Analysts on the whole were expecting to company to add 640,000 subscribers, so this is a pretty big beat on that crucial metric.Growth in the segment is accelerating. Last quarter, Adobe added 639,000 subscribers for its Creative Cloud service, with double-digit subscriber growth having become the norm. Recurring revenues now account for around 73% of revenue, which is an enviable contribution number for a service launched only four years ago. Growth in the Creative Cloud segment largely fueled the overall top line of expansion of 21%, the total of $1.22 billion coming in just above analyst consensus estimates.The bottom line doesn't look at all bad either. In fact, it looks excellent. Adjusted net income rose 96%, with adjusted EPS of $0.54 beating the consensus by 4 cents.All the metrics, with the exception of Q4 guidance which came in showing strong growth but below the analyst consensus, looked good. However, what really struck me was the percentage of overall revenue derived from recurring sources, which puts Adobe ahead of many of the other companies operating in the cloud industry.This is especially encouraging considering the fact that software firms are generally seeing a decline in traditional licenses, and Adobe has so far been very successful in making the transition to the new order. In fact, the contribution of recurring revenue isn't far behind Red Hat's 87%. All in all, I wouldn't be surprised to see Adobe beat estimates again in the fourth quarter, and the stock in general looks like it could go higher.ConclusionRed Hat's performance in its Creative Cloud is impressive, to say the least. Subscriber growth accelerated quarter-on-quarter, and recurring revenue is now good for nearly three quarters of the company's overall top line. One could quite easily argue that subscription revenue is the future of software, and for Adobe, it is increasingly becoming the present. As such, I believe the company has a bright future ahead of it, and the stock has room to trade higher in the coming years."
3487526,48411,2015-09-03T09:34:42-04:00,Adobe is out with news that it will integrate Analytics and Target.This is on the heels of a Microsoft announcement that Power BI has launched a content pack for Analytics.I love this move and think it has several distinct benefits to a company looking at moving its value prop forward.,"After some apparent under the radar testing it looks like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is ready to combine its Adobe Analytics and Adobe Target platforms into one integrated solution. Frankly, I'm not sure how these two were ever stand-alone products (most likely a pricing/ARPU reach) within the Adobe Marketing Cloud but I think the combination is a good thing. This announcement, which was first reported by Venture Beat, comes on the heels of an announcement by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) that it has launched a tailored content pack for Adobe Analytics as well. The combination should make Microsoft's Power BI platform even more useful in helping Adobe Analytics users (now Adobe Target as well) better understand the full data sets being recorded by the Adobe platforms. In total, the ""coupled"" announcements move the value line for the Adobe Marketing Cloud and the integrated solution forward. That's not a bad thing, by the way.Overall, I'm actually really bullish this move for Adobe which has worked hard recently to clean up what was becoming a loose platform as whole. A simple shift like integrating closely held solutions, such as that announced today, should go a long way. Adobe being able to drive the efficacy of its overall platform stand-alone products by making them better as a whole will only help further total engagement and total use case deployment. I think it's a fairly accepted concept that when something is serving its intended purpose well that it will continue to be used. That's a simple concept Adobe was reaching for here.But what this also does is bring Adobe further into the ""data"" value arena - something that rightly or wrongly it doesn't get associated with very often. I'm not writing this article to say that this is something, in general, that Adobe does on a ""best of breed"" basis (I'm not sure what would compel somebody to use the Adobe Marketing Cloud in general but that's subject matter for a different article) but it does have some tech and for the right SMB's I think it doesn't get the respect it deserves. Maybe, I think largely, this is because Adobe hasn't worked hard enough to keep its non-core vertical entries well-defined enough. This is again pointing to the description of Adobes overall platform as ""loose"". I think in today's tech world, where everybody wants to be everything to everybody, actually defining non-core vertical leaps is huge. Otherwise, you end up with an unaware, confused customer base. Again, today's obvious combination helps with that.So what does this mean for Adobe in the bigger picture? I think it will mean higher retention for the integrated solution. More capacity, more use, more clear value - that all adds up. Especially if Adobe does what it should do and promotes the content pack within Power BI. I get that Microsoft is a competitor for certain areas of overlap but for the most part I think Microsoft's Power BI unlocks a huge amount of value for the integrated Adobe solution. I also think this could mean a more focused marketing spend as the total solution can likely trim marketing budget into what should be a more focused message. That's a good thing for the Adobe income statement. Finally, I think this means less confusion. Less confusion for Adobe, less confusion for Adobe customers, and less confusion for the market. If the market can pick up on a trimmer, more focused, more vertical specialized Adobe that likely will mean a more appreciated equity.Adobe has seen some volatility as of late with the macro markets causing some indiscriminate selling. Before this it looked like Adobe was headed into blue skies as it was putting in new 52-week highs. I don't currently have an Adobe position on so I'm going to wait to see what else the company has in mind hopefully regarding trimming and simplifying its product portfolio. That said, if you're already long Adobe this doesn't look like a bad spot to add with shares coming off a recent support level that shows to be held from Q1/15. My guess is that Adobe will see some strong technical support on a second test should the macro markets decide to take another trip lower.Good luck everybody."
3279255,78265,2015-06-24T18:44:04-04:00,"We believe shares of Adobe Systems Inc. are overpriced and will, at some point, fall dramatically.The company earns a very moderate after tax operating income relative to the capital employed here.While the company does not generate much of an operating yield, the shares are priced for perfection. This is a very dangerous combination in our view.","It's plain (to us) that an investor's return is a function of the price they pay for the cash flow generating capacity of a particular investment. This is such a tautology that we're almost embarrassed to write it down. An investment is worth no more and no less than the cash generated over its lifetime. ""Risk,"" in the context of investing, therefore comes down to the risk of overpaying for a future cash flow stream. At some price an excellent business, with excellent operational cash flows, is a terrible investment. At the same time, at some other price, the same company is an excellent investment. Risk is driven by price. The more you pay, the lower your subsequent returns. Technological innovation (like when Class I railroads began double-stacking rolling stock, for instance) deserves a premium for a time, but over time that premium is usually washed away.One of the advantages of linking investment value to cash flows is the fact that it allows investors to make relativistic comparisons between investments. Should they buy a rental property or buy a government bond or a particular stock? It's with all this in mind that we're going to look at Adobe Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). We're going to look at its net operating profit after tax relative to the capital invested and then compare the resulting operational yield to the risk free rate. Our view is that businesses must offer a higher operating yield than a risk free investment, otherwise, what's the point? If an investment doesn't offer a sufficient yield over and above the risk free rate it should be avoided. For those who can't stand the suspense, our view is that Adobe's operating profit after taxes is inadequate to compensate for the risks involved here and for that reason the shares should be avoided in favor of higher yielding names.We'll walk through our logic below by first digging into the financial statements at Adobe and then by reverse engineering the assumptions embedded in price at the moment. Our view is that the market is too optimistic about the future of this company (especially in light of its spotty operational history). Optimism has a nasty tendency to be disappointed with predictable results to share prices.Most of this analysis is obviously more financially based, but we must counter some of the claims about Adobe moving to a ""cloud"" business model. This is hype in our view as users must still download large programs to run on their local machine. Photoshop, for instance, can't be run from the cloud. It's closer to a client/server model than a cloud model. We need to point this out in order to dispel some of the mythology about the company and its business.Net Operating Profit After TaxOver the past four quarters the company has generated operating cash after tax of ~$348 million. This compares to the approximately $7.5 billion invested at the firm. In other words, over the past four quarters, the company has generated an operating yield of about 4.6%.Source: Company filingsIn fairness, we should point out that the effective tax rate for the company in the most recent quarter was an extraordinary 48%. That's almost as bad as the top marginal personal tax rate suffered by us Canadians! The reason for this rate relates to certain licenses of acquired company assets. If we were to normalize this rate and return the effective tax rate to the more typical 26%, we would find that the operating yield would jump from 4.6% to 5.2%. Even with a more forgiving tax rate, therefore, the earnings yield is still insufficient to compensate for the risks involved here. To put this in some kind of context, the current 10-year US Government Bond is offering a yield of 2.425%, an ""uptick"" over it of only 2.2% (or 2.8% if you normalize the effective tax rate) is inadequate.Reverse Engineering Future Assumptions About PriceAt the same time that the company is generating mediocre operating results relative to the capital entrusted to management by owners and creditors, the shares are quite optimistically priced. What we mean by this specifically is that the current PE is approximately 136 and the forward PE is a much more reasonable 26.3. When we challenge the level of optimism embedded in prices, we ask by what amount must earnings grow for a PE of 136 to change into a PE of 26.3.The answer is ~417%. The market is forecasting earnings growth from Abode over the next 12 months of 417%. When we review the long-run earnings history at Adobe, we see that they've managed to grow earnings over the past 15 years at a (volatile) CAGR of ~2%. There have been times of super-normal growth, but those times have inevitably been followed by super-nomal collapse. Given what's gone on here, the market is being very optimistic in our view. Optimism leads to capital loss.Source: GurufocusConclusionIt may be that technology companies are special (in the way that railroads are special or utilities are special or any number of other businesses are special). Technology innovators offer interesting products that can capture markets that didn't even exist at the time investing principles were established. These companies are interesting and do innovative, world altering things, but they aren't immune to the laws of economic gravity. At some point, investors must realize that all businesses have risk from competition (Class I railroads may be an exception to this rule, but probably not), obsolescence, other disruptive innovations etc., are specters that haunt every business. For that reason, investors must demand a combination of high return on assets and a low entry price. Unfortunately, with Adobe Systems Inc., they get neither and for that reason we must continue to recommend that investors avoid this name."
3268755,73185,2015-06-18T16:41:46-04:00,Adobe guided for Digital Media ARR of $2.925 billion exiting this fiscal year.We believe that this is low due to the ARR boost from Adobe Stock subs.We are modeling for Digital Media ARR of $3.175 billion exiting this fiscal year.,"As Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) transitions to a subscription-based revenue model, one of the more important metrics in the growth and future topline health of the business is ARR, or annualized recurring revenue. Adobe grew Digital Media ARR (the sum of Creative Cloud ARR and Document Cloud ARR) nearly 10x to $2.35 billion. Management is guiding for Adobe to exit this fiscal year with Digital Media ARR of $2.925 billion.We feel, however, that Adobe is likely to outperform this guidance given the addition of Adobe Stock to the Creative Cloud portfolio.Adobe reported Creative Cloud ARR of $2.02 billion in Q2 on 2.61 million subscriptions. This equates to roughly $400 per subscription for Adobe, meaning that subscribers to the Creative Cloud pay, on average, $440 per year for the cloud-hosted services.Adobe Stock was launched as an add-on feature to Adobe's Creative Cloud in mid-June, and according to the company's website, the new add-on feature costs roughly $30 per month. This means that subscribers who purchase the add-on Adobe Stock feature will be paying an additional $360 per year. Therefore, we model going forward two types of subscribers: those without stock ($440 per year) and those with stock ($440 + $360 = $800 per year).Management expects many Creative Cloud subscribes to readily adopt the Adobe Stock feature, estimating that 85% of Creative subscribers who buy stock content use Adobe tools and 90% of stock content sellers use Adobe software in the preparation of their photos and images.Given these estimates, we conservatively assume about 10% of subscribers adopt Adobe Stock by the end of this fiscal year. If we use management's guided 6 million Creative Cloud subscribers by the end of this fiscal year, that equates to roughly 5.4 million subscribers without Adobe Stock and 600,000 subscribers with Adobe Stock. Our model, then, calls for roughly $2.37 billion in non-Stock Creative Cloud ARR and $400 million in Stock Creative Cloud ARR. We thus believe Adobe can exit this fiscal year with $2.85 billion in Creative Cloud ARR.If simply assuming Document Cloud ARR remains flat sequentially (although it should increase due to subs growth), then that gives us about $3.17 billion in Digital Media ARR exiting this fiscal year, about 9% higher than what management is currently guiding for.Our model is subject to the number of describers that adopt Adobe Stock. While we believe 10% is a fair fraction of subscribers who adopt Stock, we do affirm that this percentage could be lower given how expensive ($3 per image per month) Adobe Stock is. We also affirm that Adobe may be forced to lower the subs price of Adobe Stock, which would cause ARR to fall.Based on the current uptick in Adobe's cloud business, though, we believe Adobe stock will be readily adopted and that 10% is a conservative percentage to apply to total subs by year end. Exceeding ARR guidance is a bullish long-term indicator for the company, due to a majority of business revenues coming from ARR subs. While Adobe stock is currently expensive (44x trailing EBITDA and 24x forward earnings), we believe a higher-than-expected FY16 ARR might make these multiples look cheaper due to ARR's long-term benefits."
3443906,58641,2015-08-17T06:04:51-04:00,"Serif's Affinity Photo is a professional image editing software that is substantially cheaper than Adobe Photoshop.
        Affinity Photo is compatible with Adobe’s PSD and PDF file format. But it still has poor support for third-party plug-ins.
        Professionals will still be slow to adopt Affinity Photo because it lacks important features for high-volume, fast-paced image editing.","Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) investors deserves to know about the emerging threat of Serif's Affinity Photo image editing software. Released only last month, Affinity Photo is now deemed as the best alternative to Adobe Photoshop. Serif spent five years to develop Affinity. And yet it is selling Affinity Photo for just $49.99 one-time payment with free updates.Serif created Affinity Photo as a real professional alternative for Photoshop users who are not happy with Adobe's Creative Cloud subscription-only service. Since 60-70% of professional designers also use Mac, Serif also decided to make Affinity Photo a Mac OS-only software.Serif believes that competing against Adobe is easier done by using the old non-subscription method of software distribution. The $49.99 price tag of Affinity Photo is certainly much cheaper than the perpetual $9.99/month subscription fee that Adobe now charges for Photoshop CC.The low price tag has helped Affinity Photo become one of the top grossing software on the Mac Store. As of yesterday, Affinity Photo is the No.4 overall top-grossing software.(Source: App Annie)Since its release last month, Affinity Photo has been among the top five highest-grossing software in the United States, Great Britain, France, and Germany.This new challenger to Photoshop CC has and still is generating more sales than Adobe's consumer-centric $149.99 Photoshop Elements/Premiere Elements bundle for Mac.Mac users also like the User Interface design and feel of Affinity Photo because it is quite similar to Photoshop CC's. This program only touts a more liberal use of colorful icons for its tools, panels, and menu tabs.Affinity Photo(Source: Serif/Alcaraz Research)The superior features and the cheaper price tag of Affinity Photo means Mac sales of the consumer-level Photoshop Elements will definitely suffer.On the other hand, I do not think professional Mac-using Photoshop CC subscribers will flock to Affinity Photo. In spite of the best efforts of Affinity Photo, it still lacks some very important features that will make it a real Photoshop-killer.Serif Forgot Some Vital FeaturesThere are several reasons why Affinity Photo will not appeal to majority of professional designers/photo editors. Serif forgot to implement the following standard essential features to an image editing program:While Affinity Photo can load multi-layer .PSD files faster than Photoshop CC does, the lack of a method to record editing steps on an image is a real deal-breaker for professionals. After five years of developing Affinity Photo, Serif still has not implemented a feature similar to Photoshop's Actions.The workflow of design professionals includes the ability to record and save a set of performed actions. Applying the same editing steps on thousands of pictures is very tedious without this feature. The tight deadline common to design/photography slaves requires them to always favor the software that lets them do batch editing of images.Take for example the workflow I use to beautify hundreds of pre-nuptial or wedding photos. I remain loyal to Photoshop CC because of its Actions feature. It allows me to quickly create and save pseudo-Instagram effects. After saving a steps of action, I just open 20-25 pictures at one time and apply the recorded Instagram/vintage-effect on all of them.(Source: Alcaraz Reseach)Unlike Affinity Photo, Adobe's Camera RAW 9.1 feature also tout a Dehaze effect, Merge to Panorama, and HDR Merge commands. I love the new Dehaze effect of Photoshop CC because it lets me to create a 3-steps-only ethereal/dreamy effect. More importantly, special filter effects on RAW pictures could also be recorded through Photoshop's Actions panel.Another thing that photographers and designers will love about the latest version of Photoshop CC 2015 is the new control sliders for Blacks and Whites levels for a more flexible editing of RAW images.(Source: Alcaraz Research)Affinity Photo only allows control of the Shadows and Highlights levels of a RAW image. Another thing that also prevents me from buying Affinity Photo right now is that it doesn't allow for custom keyboard shortcuts. High-volume image editing is done faster when users are allowed to use their own unique custom keyboard shortcuts.The lack of universal compatibility with third-party plug-ins also makes Affinity Photo unattractive to graphics designers who love buying and using commercial Photoshop plug-ins which further speeds up their workflow.In the creative industry, time is money. Fortunately for Adobe, Affinity Photo is still not ideal for the manic work rate of creative industry professionals.My Recommendation.The Mac platform is very important market for Adobe software that deserves serious attention. Serif's Affinity Photo product is definitely the strongest challenger to Photoshop CC on the Mac right now. However, only the consumer-level Photoshop Elements 13 is currently vulnerable to the robust sales of Affinity Photo.Yes, sir, the current version of Affinity Photo does not yet present a near-term danger to Adobe's premier image editing product. On the other hand, it might still be prudent for Adobe to buy out Serif and then kill further development of Affinity Photo.Adobe doesn't have a monopoly on talents. There will come a time when Serif will have the money to hire developers who can implement Actions, custom keyboard shortcuts, and better RAW image processing features for Affinity Photo. Adobe has a super-healthy balance sheet with a 9-figure cash hoard.Buying out and killing a rising competitor is easy insurance toward preserving Photoshop's dominance as the industry standard for image editing/compositing. Furthermore, Affinity Photo is not the only product of Serif that is undermining Adobe's sales from Mac users.Affinity Designer is also threatening the leadership of Adobe's graphic vector design software, Illustrator CC 2015. Buying the competition is familiar to Adobe. It bought out rival Macromedia for $3.4 billion ten years ago. Macromedia's FreeHand, Dreamweaver, Flash, and Director software previously presented stiff competition.Buying Macromedia helped Adobe insure that Illustrator and After Effects no longer have any serious competition. I do not think Serif is as expensive as Macromedia.ADBE is a reasonable Buy. I Know First Research also has a moderate 12-month Buy recommendation for Adobe."
3262415,73185,2015-06-16T12:49:16-04:00,"Adobe is set to report earnings today, June 16, after market closes.
        The Street is looking for $0.45 EPS on revenues just over $1.16 billion.
        Historical performance versus estimates dictates Adobe should beat on top and bottom line estimates.
        We believe significant subs growth and margin expansion poise the company for an earnings beat today.
        We are expecting, on a GAAP basis, net income of roughly $92 million on revenues just over $1.2 billion.","Diversified software giant Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) is set to report Q2FY15 earnings today, June 16, after the close. The Street is looking for EPS of $0.45 on revenues just over $1.16 billion for the quarter.ADBE has beaten on revenues 3 times in the past 4 quarters, and has beat revenue estimates by an average of 1.18% over the past 4 quarters. Extrapolating that beat rate to Q2FY15's revenue estimate, and we see that ADBE is likely to report revenues of$1.17 billion.ADBE has beaten on earnings every time in the past 4 quarters, and has beaten earnings estimates by just under 16% over the past 4 quarters. Extrapolating that beat rate to Q2FY15's earnings estimate, and we see that ADBE is likely to report EPS of $0.52.Thus, based on historical performance compared to estimates, ADBE is primed to beat on both the top and bottom-line this afternoon.Our qualitative observations of Adobe's growth support this thesis as well.Adobe, like many other software giants, is transitioning to a higher-margin, subscription-based business model. Adobe features multiple cloud-based subscription plans that provide the consumer with apps focused on different areas. For example, Adobe offers the Creative Cloud for photography and design and the Marketing Cloud for business ventures. Customers can also purchase subscriptions for individual programs that charge monthly.This tiered charging system isn't unique to Adobe; however, Adobe's segmentation of cloud service by utility is a differentiating quality of Adobe's cloud that has boded well with consumers despite initial resistance as Adobe's subscription numbers have grown exponentially over the past few years.MRQ, subs revenue grew 68.44% YoY, while Products and Services revenues decreased 39.1% and 1.02%, respectively. Per the chart above, we can see that one can reasonably assume Adobe's subs revenue increase in excess of 68.44% YoY in Q2FY16. We, however, assume Q2FY15 subs revenue grow a consistent 68% YoY, giving us roughly $804.85 million in subs revenue in Q2FY15.Extrapolating MRQ figures and applying them to this quickly transitioning business, we believe Products revenue decrease 40% YoY to $287.55 million in Q2 and Services revenue decrease 2% YoY to $100.02 million. Summing all these up, we get $1.2 billion in net revenues in Q2FY15.MRQ, subs had a gross margin of 86%, products had a gross margin of 93%, and services had a gross margin of 51%. Applying these gross margins to our revenues, we get a gross profit of roughly $1.01 billion in Q2FY15.MRQ, total opex was roughly 73% of topline. Assuming opex is flat sequentially, that equates to roughly $875 million in opex in Q2FY15. Operating income then is about $135 million.We take out about $13 million of that due to other income less interest expense, and that gives us a pre-tax income of roughly $122 million. Applying a management-guided GAAP tax rate of roughly 24%, and we get about $92 million in net income for Q2FY15.Al in all, we feel fairly comfortable that, given Adobe's historical performance versus the Street and the company's successful transition to subscription services, ADBE is poised to report a strong quarter on both the top and bottom line after hours today.Moreover, Adobe initiated a $2 billion stock repurchase program in 2012, and has since repurchased approximately 44,000 shares, which has had positive effects on both divided payout and EPS."
3255655,89576,2015-06-12T15:25:55-04:00,"Our analysis shows that Adobe shares are significantly overpriced both on a relative and absolute basis.To sustain these valuations, the company will have to see their cash flows accelerate even more than projected by bullish analysts.Quarterly earnings will be announced on Tuesday and may reveal the initial results of their fast growing cloud business.","IntroductionAdobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) is well known for their industry leading Photoshop and Acrobat software packages. More recently, Adobe has been investing heavily in their cloud services, which they anticipate will be the fastest-growing segment over the medium term. Adobe will be announcing their quarterly results Tuesday, which will provide some clues on how their plans are playing out in this space so far.To understand Adobe Systems' prospects as a long-term investment, we take a step back and estimate the intrinsic value of the stock based on their ability to generate cash flows. To complement the analysis, we will also asses the relative richness/cheapness of Adobe Systems' ordinary stock compared to their peers.ValuationOur valuation model for Adobe Systems is based on their ability to generate cash. The key measure of cash flows that we use is free cash flow, which is the total cash inflow from operations minus the dividends and capital expenditure outlays. This is effectively the amount of ""excess"" cash that the company is making and therefore accruing to its lenders and shareholders.While we do look at historic cash flows, cash flows projections are of crucial importance because markets are forward looking. We start with the analyst consensus free cash flow projections. For our own projection, we assume that the analyst consensus is correct for the next two fiscal years. After that, we assume that the growth rate of cash flows falls back to its previous trend and remains like this for the next eight years, after which it normalizes toward the sustainable rate of 3.95% per annum, based on the average real GDP growth over the last 15 years and the average inflation rate of 2%. The chart below shows the historic (blue line) and projected free cash flows (red line).To calculate the total value of the firm, we discount the projected cash flows and the company's terminal value by its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). Our estimate of Adobe Systems' cost of debt is 3.94%, based on their interest expense and amount of debt outstanding in the last fiscal year. The cost of equity is calculated using the 10-year treasury yield as the ""risk-free"" proxy plus the implied equity risk premium of 11.25% times the historic beta of 1.5278 for the stock. Some of the other key metrics summarized below:•Beta = 1.53•ERP = 6.00%•Cost of Debt = 3.94%•Cost of equity = 11.25%•Debt to Assets = 14.04%•WACC = 10.99%•Current Price = $79.65•Fair Price = $35.38 (-55.59% return)After discounting the projected free cash flows and the company's terminal value in 10 years' time, we subtract the current value of debt and arrive at the total equity value of 17,697,043, which equates to $35.38 per share. With today's share price at $79.65, re-pricing toward the estimated fair value would require a return of -55.59%. The green line in the below chart represents the estimated ""fair value"" per share, with the dashed lines showing the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval based on the stock's volatility.Our conclusion is that Adobe will need to achieve better than projected cash flow growth in order to justify the current pricing.Relative ValuationAutodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS), Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN), Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) are Adobe Systems' closest S&P 500 peers. The table below can help us understand Adobe Systems' valuation in relative terms.Relative Valuation TablePrice to earnings, price to cash flow and price to book for Adobe Systems are all above the upper quartile for the industry. This is quite unfavorable, especially when assessed in the context of their negative earnings growth over the past five years. The stock beta at 1.53 also is above the upper quartile, implying insufficient compensation for the risk taken.The below charts illustrate that price to book of 5.88 is not too high relative to the return on equity of 16.54x, but price to earnings of 132.1x looks very rich given the negative earnings growth.ConclusionFor high-growth tech companies it is not unusual to see high valuation multiples as they can often be justified by bright growth prospects. However, the bar has been set very high for Adobe, as even quite bullish analyst projections of their cash flow generating ability justify a share price as much as 50% below the market. Furthermore, Adobe looks expensive relative to their peers as well on measures such as ROE and EPS growth. The best course of action for most investors is to avoid this stock unless they have a significant edge in this sector."

Investors have given a thumbs up to this transition as indicated in the stock’s performance over the past few years. While the rise in stock price has been meteoric over the past two years, when it rallied from $38 in 2013 to over $80, most of its future depends on increasing adoption of its Creative Cloud and marketing cloud solutions. In part one of the note, we explore the base case for the company. In Part two, we explore the bull and bear cases. All three scenarios explore the impact on Adobe’s topline due to the adoption rate of its services. A summary of this is as follows:Base Case ScenarioThe base case scenario justifies the current estimate of Trefis’s stock price. We currently estimate that the stock is fairly priced at $70.22. The explanation of this is as follows:The Creative cloud division: – The Creative Cloud (CC) division makes up 63.5% of Adobe’s estimated value. The key drivers for this division are the average revenue per subscriber and total creative software market. While Creative products (Creative Suite and Creative Cloud) contributed nearly 45% to Adobe’s revenue in 2014, the total number of licensees for Adobe’s creative products stood at 14.7 million, according to our estimates. In 2014, Adobe added 3.45 million subscribers to its CC services, which translates into a growth rate of 140% over 2013’s 1.43 million. The company added 517,000 Creative Cloud (CC) subscriptions in Q1 FY15, a 28% increase over the prior year, achieving a total of 3.971 million. We estimate that the subscriber base will continue to grow at a robust 75% in 2015 and add over 2.55 million subscribers during the year. We also believe that the company is on track to add 16.39 million paying subscribers by the end of 2021. This figure represents 63.5% of the 25.8 million point and suite licensees, which we estimate will grow at a CAGR of 8.6%.Average revenue per subscriber (ARPS) for the company consists of a blend of subscribers that have enrolled into different levels of cloud services. While access to the complete Creative Cloud suite costs $74.99 per month, access to standalone Photoshop is priced at $9.99 per month. We estimate that the blended ARPS for the company was $31.74 in 2014. The recent trend in subscriptions indicates that users are subscribing to the annual full version of Creative Cloud. The company has also reported good growth in its enterprise term licensing agreement (ETLA), which have tenure of three years. This leads us to believe that the ARPS will increase in the coming years as it converges towards the sticker price of $74.99. However, since the company is adding products at lower price points, it will lower the blended ARPS for the company. We estimate that the ARPS will grow to $37.00 by the end of our forecast period.Marketing Cloud Division: - Adobe’s cloud marketing division is the second biggest division and makes up 17.7% of its value. Over the past few years, Adobe has built a comprehensive digital marketing platform that addresses most of the needs in digital marketing. This build-up started in 2009 with the acquisition of Ominiture. Since then, the company has scaled up the functionality and product offering of its marketing platform through organic and inorganic growth. Currently, Adobe offers six products under its marketing cloud solution. The Adobe marketing cloud includes a complete set of analytics, social media optimization, consumer targeting, web experience management and cross-channel campaign management solutions. It generated around $1.2 billion in annual revenues in 2014. Having been built from the acquisition, the business has had a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 83% over last five years. Well positioned in a growing market, this division is expected to witness robust growth in the coming years. Adobe is aiming to increase its revenues from cloud-based marketing solutions by expanding in new geographies and verticals. Recently, the company introduced two new Adobe Marketing Cloud solutions, Adobe Primetime, a multi-screen TV platform, and Audience Manager, a data management platform, thus supplementing its marketing cloud capabilities. According to the company, the marketing cloud is easily a $10 billion opportunity. [1] Currently, we project revenues from its digital marketing division to reach $3.1 billion by the end of our forecast period.Acrobat Family Revenue: – Acrobat family is the third largest division and makes up ~11% of Adobe’s estimated value. In the past few quarters, revenues from this division have been on a decline, primarily due to launch of document cloud services that have subscription fee spread over the period of usage. The company has amassed over 2.3 million subscribers for document cloud service. We expect this trend to continue and forecast the subscriber base to grow to 8.83 million by the end of our forecast period. Furthermore, as this service gains momentum, we expect the ARPS to increase from $8.00 in 2014 to $12.70 by the end of our forecast period.Life Cycle And Print & Publishing:- Smaller divisions of Adobe, which include Adobe packaged software, LiveCyle software and Print & Publishing, makeup 6% of its estimated value. The adoption of Creative Cloud will negatively impact Adobe’s packaged software, while up-selling to Adobe marketing cloud will pressure LiveCyle & Connect pro revenues. We expect revenues from these divisions to decline in the future. We estimate average selling price of packaged software and LiveCycle software will decline in the future to $165 and $85,160 respectively. We also expect the number of licenses sold for both the divisions to decline. Even if these metrics were to improve for both the division, it will have little impact on our stock price valuation, since the contribution from these divisions is small.Disclosure: None"
3259105,89326,2015-06-15T11:30:36-04:00,"Adobe Systems' upcoming 2QFY15 earnings release motivated me to take a look into company financials.The company has an impressive record of outperforming the broader market by more than two fold in the past two years.However, the FCFF modeling hints toward a mispricing in the stock value which might conclude with meaningful losses for investors.","Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) is scheduled to report its second quarter fiscal 2015 (2QFY15) earnings after the market close on Tuesday, June 16. The company has set an exemplary benchmark for its peers and others facing organic growth challenges of transforming from a perpetual licensing business to a cloud-based subscription model enterprise.The market also has a great sense of picking successful stories and rewarding them accordingly. As a consequence, the share price has more than doubled from the $37ish levels of early 2013. During the same time period, the S&P 500 Index has soared 49% - less than half of Adobe Systems' return on investment. Correspondingly, it makes justifiable sense that the stock is currently trading at a 12-month forward price to earnings (P/E) multiple of 39x on fiscal 2015 (FY15) non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) guidance of $2.05. In comparison, the S&P 500 is presently trading at a P/E multiple of 17.84x.As a habit of exploring a stock's intrinsic value close to its earnings announcement, I felt excited about performing a valuation exercise on ""the transformed"" Adobe Systems. I have no doubt that the company will report a beat on its top and bottom-line consensus estimates, which calls for $1.16 billion in quarterly revenue (2QFY15) and 45.3 cents in non-GAAP EPS vs. the guidance of $1.13-1.18 billion and 41-47 cents, respectively.However, apart from the earnings, I wanted to know the fair value of this gem, which might led me to take a long position for several months. The Street analysts endorse a bullish viewpoint on Adobe Systems prospects with an average target price of $86.37 achieving in one year.Since the company has been focusing on its top line growth in every presentation, guidance and earnings press release, I tried to find a relationship between revenue and free cash flow to firm (FCFF) over the past four years. Key data is presented (with every operating metric is in billions of dollars):Source: Company 10-KsExcluding 12.911x as an outlier, the revenue to FCFF ratio comes out 4.2 times on an average. For the following two years, I accepted company guidance as a true case, i.e. it expects to gross $4.85 billion in annual revenue during FY15, and achieve 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in revenue between FY14 and FY16. Why I believe on the company's top line growth forecast is because Adobe Systems never failed to achieve its publicized financial goals during the preceding 21 quarters.After achieving such gigantic revenue expansion, I assume 10% annual growth for FY17 and FY18, 8% for each of the following three years, and an annual 6% for the next four years until 2025. Then projecting a terminal growth of 2.5% in synchronization with the OECD's long-term global economic expansion concludes the assumptions.Other relevant tables are summarized below.Running the classic discounted cash flow (NYSE:DCF) valuation model leads to an enterprise value (EV) of $33.7 billion. After deducting the long-term debt (LTD) of 911 million, the equity value arrives at $32.8 billion. With 500.27 million shares outstanding, the fair value of the stock comes in at $65.54.What? Even after being so lenient in my model assumptions, the resulting answer tells me that Adobe's stock is 18% overpriced. I then double checked my calculation and assumptions, only to be found again the mispricing of the entity. The market often takes time to correct its mispricing, but my best advice to investors on this forum is to avoid investing in Adobe Systems with the current scenario.Adobe Systems is definitely a great corporate success story to be inspired with. However, profit-seeking investors should wait for a good time and buy the stock on a dip. May be the Fed's impending interest rate hike decision be a good time. Who knows?"
3106186,28141,2015-04-27T14:13:44-04:00,"At $76, Adobe is priced to perfection.Margins are under pressure for the foreseeable future.Trading at investment value premium rather than traditional metrics.","By Ted Rasa and John ZurzAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) recently released a free app for the iPad, Adobe Slate, which is designed to make the creation of parallax-scrolling websites - though not very complex ones as the templates and fonts are very limited at the moment, and videos cannot be added yet either - as simple as tapping the screen.It's not Adobe's first free app, they also put out Adobe Voice, which was released last year, as an easy way to make explainer videos, but the influx of these free apps, designed to make complex tasks simple, is surprising. Adobe has always been the company behind complex, professional programs, like Photoshop and Illustrator, which required yearly subscriptions instead of an upfront cost.Adobe's success can be attributed to the fact that their programs and products are always among the best, easily justifying the continuous price tag. Combined with the fact that they operate in a niche market, it's no surprise that the company is doing so well. Their stock price is way up over the last few years and those who got in early are finding they've made a pretty penny.Adobe's success isn't just due to their dominance of the market, but also to their track record of acquisitions. Their largest acquisition in recent years was of Omniture in 2009 for $1.8 billion, while their largest was of Macromedia back in 2005 for $3.4 billion. Adobe's Omniture acquisition brought them analytic capabilities and is helping to fuel their Marketing Cloud platform. Acquiring Macromedia brought Adobe a number of design tools for the web, notably Flash and Dreamweaver. Flash was perhaps the largest part of that acquisition, everyone's had to update at an awkward moment at least once, but since the emergence of smart phones and tablets Flash has just about been replaced by HTML5/CSS3.Despite Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Steve Jobs unceremoniously killing Flash, Adobe responded effectively - they didn't fight it, at least not publicly. Seeing the writing on the wall Adobe moved into the future and developed tools Apple users could use.Before Apple became the juggernaut they are today, before they killed Flash without a second thought, they had a loyal army of artists and developers using the Adobe Creative Suite products on their platform, helping to drive sales. It was an early sign that Apple could still shape industries. Despite the death of Flash, and the figurative spit in the face of a host of artists and developers, the adoption of HTML5/CSS3 was for the best.As Adobe shifts into the cloud, we find that they have little competition in terms of product breadth and reach. Adobe's product line is also incredibly sticky as users often don't want to learn new applications. For professionals this only increases with the use of multiple applications: Photoshop into Illustrator into Flash into Dreamweaver. Microsoft should probably take a page from their book in this case.Despite this, SAAS companies tend to sport much lower profit margins than traditional software companies like Microsoft and Oracle. The cost of constructing data centers or leasing capacity to deliver software over the internet, rather than just shipping it out over a compact disk, has been a drag on short-term profitability.Adobe has a good opportunity for growing it's average revenue per user if they can monetize complimentary apps used on mobile devices, like watered down version of Photoshop and Illustrator for the iPhone and iPad - Draw, Shape and PS Express - as well as their newer apps like Voice and Slate, which hit on a different demographic.With the recent acquisitions of Behance and Fotofolio we see an attempt by Adobe to grow a professional social and content network. These addition add depth to Adobe's brand and culture, though whether they can bring profits remains to be seen.Then there's the Adobe Marketing Cloud, which is another growth engine, and if executed correctly activist investors - if they still exist - will be calling for a spin-off in the next five years.ValuationRecurring Revenue Investment PriceWe have seen 2 major technology companies bought under the 7x Recurring Revenue price in the past year, TIBCO and Informatica. Based on growth prospects and dominant market position, Adobe could be worth as much as 11x Recurring Revenues or $ 78 per share, or Enterprise Value of ~$37.4 billion.This leaves the investor with very little margin-of-safety. Based on the sheer size of Adobe, the playing field for suitors is quite small and might be unrealistic. We thought this was a creative way to justify its current valuation, but we warn you that the market tends to change its valuation philosophy on a whim and the stock price could suffer greatly if the market sours or Adobe does not meet their high expectations.Stock Splits & AcquisitionsAdobe has a history of splitting especially on its way to triple digits: It split 5 times since they went public and twice in the 2000's. We could see a split coming soon.Adobe has over $3.9 billion in Treasury Stock and could use it to make an accretive acquisition. Our guess would be an acquisition to bolster its Marketing Cloud offering. The last time Adobe used its stock to acquire something was in its $3.4 billion buyout of Macromedia."
3021816,73565,2015-03-23T14:45:51-04:00,,"In 2.5 years, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has transformed its business from a software license business into a SaaS business. It has been a remarkable transition, and one not talked about very much in the SaaS world. Transitions from licensed software to SaaS are rare. The travel and expense management behemoth, Concur, recently acquired by SAP (NYSE:SAP) for $8.3B, is another great example that made the transition first from CD-ROM packaged software then to enterprise license software and then to SaaS.Above, the line chart shows the astounding growth in the number of Adobe Creative Suite subscribers from the launch of CreativeSuite 6 in mid-2012 through March 2014, growing at 31% per quarter to 3.97M in their last quarter.Generating about $4B annually, Adobe is worth $38B and employs more than 12,500 people. And in 2012, the company decided to disrupt its own businesses. The licensed software business, a cash cow, generated more than $3.4B in revenue in 2011 at 97% gross margin. As the plot above shows, the shift to SaaS was immediate in 2012. The company transitioned from packaged software to SaaS for Creative Suite 6, which Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign, Premier and other content creation software.Only 30 months after launch, subscription revenues have outpaced license revenue at $2.1B and $1.6B, respectively. The new SaaS business operates at 93% gross margins.As the number of subscribers has swelled, Adobe has been able to maintain a relatively high average revenue per user (ARPU) of $451 per year or $37 per month in the last quarter. The figure has fallen from the initial price points of $530, likely from volume discounts and greater penetration in education.The combination of subscriber growth and high ARPU has created a business that has grown from $0.1 to $1.8B in ARR in 11 quarters, implying a 30% compound quarterly growth rate over those 33 months. Adobe's transition to SaaS is enabled by the company's dominant product line for creative professionals.However, the transition hasn't produced a meaningful increase in total revenue yet. As the chart above shows, the Digital Media business, the vast majority of which is CS6, has been flat to down for five years. Adobe's future growth may lie more in its marketing software division which has doubled in the same time period and is itself a series of SaaS products.Nevertheless, in just about five years, Adobe's transition from license software to SaaS will be complete, and Adobe will have been one of the few SaaS companies to manage to disrupt itself successfully."

In the earnings announcement, the company once again reported faster-than-expected adoption of subscription licenses for its Creative Cloud (NYSE:CC) business, as more of its clients chose annual subscription plans. The company reported over 3.454 million paid subscribers for the CC services, a sizable increase of 644,000 over the previous quarter. This generated over $1.5 billion in annualized recurring revenue (ARR) in the quarter. Adobe also witnessed growth in its marketing cloud initiatives during the quarter as revenues grew by 4.5% year over year to $330 million. Its LiveCycle software revenues declined by 9% while print and publishing business (all relatively small) grew by 5.4%.The company reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.14 on a GAAP basis and $0.36 on a non-GAAP basis. The revenues grew by 3% year on year to $1.07 billion, which is at the high end of its targeted range of $1.0 billion to $1.075 billion. During the earnings announcement, the company said that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire privately held Fotolia, a leading marketplace for stock content. Fotolia will be integrated into Adobe Creative Cloud. Furthermore, it also provided guidance for the coming fiscal year. We examine some of Adobe's key drivers below and its outlook for 2015.Outlook For 2015 And Q1Adoption of cloud services continues to remain strong and the company expects to have nearly 5.9 million paid CC individual and team subscriptions by the end of fiscal 2015. (Fiscal year ends with November). According to our calculations, this means it will need to add over 47,030 paid users per week in FY 2015 to meet its objective. The company has also disclosed that it expects to end FY 2015 with over $2.9 billion of digital media annualized recurring revenue at a growth rate of 20% year over year. Furthermore, Adobe expects revenues from its digital marketing cloud to grow by a 25% rate for the year. However, it expects the LiveCycle and Connect business to decline further, while the print and publishing business is expected to remain flat in 2015. The revenue guidance for FY 2015 is $4.85 billion while GAAP EPS and non-GAAP EPS are expected to be $1.2 and $2.05 respectively.Adobe has guided for revenues of $1.05 billion to $1.10 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2015. It indicated GAAP EPS would be in the range of $0.14 to $0.20, and non-GAAP EPS between $0.34 and $0.40.Strong CC Subscription Buoys Revenues, But CS6 Phase Out Impacts GrowthAccording to our estimates, the Creative Cloud division is the biggest of Adobe's operating segments and makes up approximately 66% of its value. During the quarter, the company added 644,000 new subscribers, and 96% of the Creative Cloud subscribers have signed up for annual contracts. The growth in licensing continued to stem from individual, team and enterprise term licensing agreements (ETLAs), which usually have a tenure of three years. This indicates that CC will continue to drive revenue over the near foreseeable future as adoption across all offering remains strong. The revenue from CC increased by over 20% sequentially to $1.676 billion in ARR, and subscriber base grew to 3.454 million. The company added 49,538 new subscribers per week in Q4. We expect the company to maintain this subscription rate for 2015 and add 2.5 million more CC subscribers to the existing tally to reach over 6 million subscribers by the end of 2015.Strong Adoption Of Marketing Platform Boosts Revenues And OrdersAdobe's Cloud Marketing division is the second biggest division and makes up 14% of its value. Over the past few years, Adobe has built a comprehensive digital marketing platform that addresses most of the needs in digital marketing. This build up started in 2009 with the acquisition of Omniture. Since then, the company has scaled up the functionality and product offering of its marketing platform through organic and inorganic growth.During the quarter, Adobe witnessed strong growth in its marketing cloud services. In Q4, this division reported a 118% year-over-year increase in revenue to $330 million. Furthermore, the company achieved record Adobe Marketing Cloud bookings in Q4 and was well ahead of its 30% annual growth target, primarily due to big deals in Q4. These deals were signed with companies that include Ford (NYSE:F), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), MasterCard (NYSE:MA), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), QVC, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and US Department of Veterans Affairs. We expect that as big data analytics, mobility, social media and cloud computing gain more traction across industries, this division will report incremental growth in revenues as it has a portfolio of analytical tools that deal with marketing on social media and mobile devices. Adobe expects new bookings to grow at a 30% CAGR and revenues to grow at a 25% in 2015.Adoption of EchoSign And Document Cloud Services Buoys Revenues At Acrobat Family DivisionAdobe Acrobat family is the third largest division at Adobe and makes up 8.5% of its value. In the past few quarters, revenues from this division have been on a decline, primarily due to the launch of document cloud services that have subscription fee spread over the period of usage. However, due to strong adoption of online document services, EchoSign (an electronic content management system) and growth in enterprise term licensing agreements for Acrobat, the company witnessed 25% sequential and 89% year-over-year growth in Acrobat ARR. We expect document services' ARR to drive revenue growth in the Acrobat family division in the future.We have updated our Adobe price estimate to $58.49, which is around 23% below the current market price.Disclosure: No positions"

Investors have given a thumbs up to this transition as indicated in the stock’s performance over the past few years. While the rise in stock price has been meteoric over the past two years, when it rallied from $38 in 2013 to over $70, its performance has faltered over the past few months. However, the stock has rallied from $70 in January to its current market price of over $77. This translates into a return of over 10% in the last month alone. While we have recently revised our price target from $62 to $70, we believe that the current market valuation of Adobe is stretched, even though the company has significantly improved its Creative Cloud (CC) offering by extending functionality to mobile developers and strengthening its digital marketing portfolio through timely launches. In this note, we will discuss the factors that justify our price estimate of Adobe.Growth of Addressable Market for Creative Cloud Supports Our ValuationThe Creative Cloud (NYSE:CC) division together with Adobe’s packaged division makes up 62% of Adobe’s estimated value. The key drivers for this division are the average revenue per subscriber and total creative software market. While Creative products (Creative Suite and Creative Cloud) contributed nearly 45% to Adobe’s revenue in 2014, the total number of licensees for Adobe’s creative products stood at 14.7 million, according to our estimates. In 2014, Adobe added 3.45 million subscribers to its CC services, which translates into a growth rate of 140% over 2013’s 1.43 million. We estimate that the subscriber base will continue to grow at a robust 75% in 2015 and add over 2.55 million subscribers during the year. We also believe that the company is on track to add 16.39 million paying subscribers by the end of 2021. This figure represents 64% of the 25.8 million point and suite licensees, which we estimate will grow at a CAGR of 8.6%. However, to justify Adobe’s current market price, the number of subscribers will have to grow to over 18 million, which in turn will require a higher growth rate in the total addressable market (TAM).Average revenue per subscriber (ARPS) for the company consists of a blend of subscribers that have enrolled to different levels of cloud services. While access to the complete Creative Cloud suite costs $74.99 per month, access to standalone Photoshop is priced at $9.99 per month. We estimate that the blended ARPS for the company was $31.74 in 2014. The recent trend in subscriptions indicates that users are subscribing to the annual full version of Creative Cloud. The company also has reported good growth in its enterprise term licensing agreement (ETLA), which have tenure of three years. This leads us to believe that the ARPS will increase in the coming years as it converges to the sticker price of $74.99. However, since the company is adding products at lower price points, it will lower the blended ARPS for the company. We estimate that the ARPS will grow to $39 by the end of our forecast period. However, the market expects ARPS to grow at a much faster pace, which might be difficult to achieve if more products with lower price points are introduced within the cloud portfolio.Market Share in Online Marketing CloudAdobe’s cloud marketing division is the second biggest division and makes up 17.3% of its value. Over the past few years, Adobe has built a comprehensive digital marketing platform that addresses most of the needs in digital marketing.

Well positioned in a growing market, this division is expected to witness robust growth in the coming years. Adobe is aiming to increase its revenues from cloud-based marketing solutions by expanding in new geographies and verticals. Recently, the company launched new data-driven marketing capability that delivers personalized mobile experience, thus supplementing its marketing cloud capabilities. According to the CEO of Adobe, Shantanu Narayen, the marketing cloud is easily a $10 billion opportunity. [1] Currently, we project revenues from its digital marketing division to reach $3.3 billion by the end of our forecast period. However, to justify the current market price of Adobe, the company will have to rake in over $4.5 billion in revenue for marketing division. We believe that this would be a difficult feat considering the intense competition in this space from companies such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), Accenture (NYSE:ACN), Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).Acrobat Family Revenue To GrowAcrobat family is the third largest division and makes up ~11% of Adobe’s estimated value. In the past few quarters, revenues from this division have been on a decline primarily due to the launch of document cloud services that have subscription fees spread over the period of usage. The company has amassed over 2.17 million subscribers for document cloud service. We expect this trend to continue and forecast the subscriber base to grow to 8.83 million by the end of our forecast period. Furthermore, as this service gains momentum, we expect the ARPS to increase from $8 in 2014 to $12.7 by the end of our forecast period. Despite this growth rate, we expect revenue to grow from $768 million to $1.35 billion by 2021.Transition to Cloud Services to Negatively Impact Smaller DivisionsSmaller divisions of Adobe, which include Adobe packaged software, LiveCyle software and Print and Publishing, make up 6% of its estimated value. The adoption of Creative Cloud will negatively impact Adobe’s packaged software, while up-selling to Adobe marketing cloud will pressure LiveCyle and Connect pro revenues. We expect revenues from these divisions to decline in the future. We estimate the average selling price of packaged software and LiveCycle software will decline in the future to $165 and $85,160, respectively. We also expect the number of licenses sold for both the divisions to decline. Even if these metrics were to improve for both divisions, it will have little impact on our stock price valuation, since the contribution from these divisions is small.Changes To Discount Rate And Terminal Growth RateWe have increased the terminal growth rate for Adobe from 1.5% to 2.5% based on the improvement in the U.S. GDP and expected hike in interest rates in the coming quarters. Furthermore, we have lowered the discount rate from 11% to 9%. While the equity risk premium for the U.S. market has increased from 5.45% in 2013 to 5.75% in the beginning of 2015, the Fed continues to keep interest rates (and the risk free rate) at record lows. We have taken these factors into consideration to calculate the new discount rate. However, we believe that the market participants are factoring in an even lower discount rate to justify Adobe’s current market price.We currently have a $70.43 price estimate for Adobe, which is 10% below the current market price.Disclosure: No positions."
3246526,23479,2015-06-09T11:41:05-04:00,"In the first half of this two-part note, we explored the base case scenario for Adobe.In this article, we look at the bull and bear case for the company.In the bull case scenario, Trefis estimates that the Adobe’s stock is worth $101.In the bear case scenario, Trefis estimates that the Adobe’s stock is worth $42.64.","In the first half of this two-part note, we explored the base case scenario for Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). In this article, we look at the bull and bear case for the company. The common string running through the three cases is the lack of growth in smaller divisions—i.e., Adobe packaged software, LiveCyle software and Print & Publishing. Even if the metrics for these divisions were to improve, it would have little impact on our stock price valuation as the contribution from these divisions is small. Accordingly, in our bull and bear case scenarios, we will focus on the impact of Creative Cloud (CC) and Marketing Cloud business on the company’s valuation.Bull Case: Upside of 45%In the bull case scenario, Trefis estimates that the Adobe’s stock is worth $101. The expected change in key drivers is as follows.The Creative cloud division: – The key drivers for this division are the average revenue per subscriber and total creative software market. The total number of licensees for Adobe’s creative products stood at 14.7 million, according to our estimates. In 2014, Adobe added 3.45 million of these subscribers to its CC services, which translates into a growth rate of 140% over 2013’s 1.43 million. The company added 517,000 Creative Cloud (CC) subscriptions in Q1 FY15, a 28% increase over the prior year, achieving a total of 3.971 million. Considering the rapid adoption of Adobe CC among creative professionals (so-called creatives, or professionals requiring the software), coupled with increasing penetration of Internet, the total addressable market (NYSE:TAM) for creatives can expand to over 30 million by 2021. Its subscriber base can grow to over 21 million instead of 16.39 million paying subscribers by the end of 2021. This figure represents 70% of the 30 million point and suite licensees.Average revenue per subscriber (ARPS) for the company consists of a blend of subscribers that have subscribed to different levels of cloud services. While access to the complete Creative Cloud suite costs $74.99 per month, access to standalone Photoshop is priced at $9.99 per month. The recent trend in subscriptions indicates that users are subscribing to the annual full version of Creative Cloud. The company has also reported good growth in its enterprise term licensing agreement (ETLA), which has a tenure of three years. Additionally, the company continues to expand its portfolio by adding new services to it. This leads us to believe that the ARPS can grow at an increasing rate in the coming years. As the ARPS converge to the sticker price of $74.99, we estimate that it can grow to $49 by the end of our forecast period.Marketing Cloud Divisions: - Over the past few years, Adobe has built a comprehensive digital marketing platform that addresses most of the needs in digital marketing. Currently, Adobe offers six products under its marketing cloud solution. The Adobe marketing cloud includes a complete set of analytics, social media optimization, consumer targeting, web experience management and cross-channel campaign management solutions. It generated around $1.2 billion in annual revenues in 2014. Well positioned in a growing market, this division is expected to witness robust growth in the coming years. Considering that the marketing cloud is easily a $10 billion opportunity, the growth rate for this division can be higher. [1] In Bull case, we project revenues from its digital marketing division to reach $3.6 billion by the end of our forecast period.Bear Case: Downside of 40% In the bear case scenario, Trefis estimates that the Adobe’s stock is worth $42.64. The expected change in key drivers is as follows.The Creative Cloud division: – In bear case scenario, we estimate that the total creative software market will grow at a slower rate to 21 million, and Adobe’s subscriber base will grow at a slower rate to 10 million paying subscribers by the end of 2021. This figure represents 50% of the 21 million point and suite licensees.While access to the complete Creative Cloud suite costs $74.99 per month, access to standalone Photoshop is priced at $9.99 per month. However, since the company is adding products at lower price points, it will lower the blended average revenue per subscriber (ARPS) for the company. We estimate that the ARPS can decline to $24.50 by the end of our forecast period.Marketing Cloud Divisions: - Although, the marketing cloud is easily a $10 billion opportunity, it might be difficult for Adobe to become a leader considering the intense competition in this space from companies such as IBM, Accenture, Salesforce and Oracle . [1] Therefore, it is possible that revenues from its digital marketing division can grow at a slower rate to reach $2.41 billion by the end of our forecast period.Disclosure: None"
2935456,58641,2015-02-20T11:14:23-05:00,"After 25 years of existence, Adobe Photoshop is still the king of all graphic design software.Adobe’s decision to offer Photoshop CC under a very affordable monthly subscription scheme insures that creative professionals will continue to use Photoshop.The doomsday prediction that free or cheaper alternatives will kill Photoshop’s restrictive monthly subscription policy did not happen.","As someone still involved in photography and graphic design, I would like to share my appreciation of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Photoshop. This very popular and highly profitable software program just turned 25 years old. I opine that Adobe will continue to enjoy robust subscription sales from Photoshop for the next 25 years.In spite of the proliferation of free and much cheaper alternative, the professional creative industry is still addicted to Photoshop. No self-respecting ad agency will hire a graphic artist that is not proficient in Adobe Photoshop. No self-respecting design shop will use the free GIMP program to create advertising layouts, websites or product mock-ups for professional projects.Adobe's decision to reduce the monthly fee to $9.99 means the advertising/creative industry professionals will remain faithful to Photoshop. The initial angry reaction to Adobe's decision to switch to software-as-a-service model in 2013 has faded away. A Change.org petition against Adobe's Creative Cloud policy did not kill the golden goose that is Photoshop.Contrary to claims that creative professionals will switch to cheaper alternatives, Adobe's top and bottom lines are actually doing very well with its new subscription-only business model. According to Adobe's most recent earnings report, Adobe CC Suite (including Photoshop) subscription accounts reached 3.4 million. Just like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Adobe has a captured customer base that is still very much in love with Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, After Effects, and Dreamweaver.There Is No CompetitionIn feature-for-feature comparison, GIMP and other freeware image editing programs, are light-years behind what Adobe Photoshop CC offers right now. Freeware alternatives to Photoshop do not have important features that designers and photographers need for commercial work. RAW image manipulation, web image optimization, layers organization and accurate auto image enhancements, are vital features that most freeware programs do not have.Even though the supporters and developers of GIMP created a Photoshop-lookalike version (they copied the User Interface) called GIMPShop, graphic artists will still reject it as an alternative to Adobe's product. GIMP is for amateurs or aficionados, while Photoshop is for the 9-to-5 professional graphic artists who serve the daily global need for advertisements and entertainment.GIMP and other freeware programs lack these very important features:Alpha CompositingIn the hectic world of advertising designers, batch processing or scripting actions are necessary to speed up workflow. Photographers also require RAW image processing and editing. Those magazine covers and big-budget print ads are usually shot in RAW format. Unlike JPEG photographs, RAW images are uncompressed and easier to manipulate and correct.Even commercial rivals like Corel's $80 PaintShop Pro X7 has no Bitmap to Vector conversion, limited RAW editing, and no image slicing features. The same goes for Serif's $100 PhotoPlus X7 and $200 ACDSee Pro. These two wannabe Photoshop rivals lack important features necessary for daily professional design or image manipulation.Controversial Or Not, Photoshopping Is Already A Way of LifePhotoshop's almost-limitless power to alter images has provoked a lingering controversy. The advertising/publishing industry's habit of abusing Photoshop's ability to depict godly beauty has even prompted politicians to consider legislation against over-photoshopped images.Photoshop helped ad agencies and designers quickly abuse the adage that beauty sells. Photoshop helped me create beautiful and much younger versions of movie stars when I was still working as a graphic artist. The art director would have fired me if I made a magazine ad print layout that has a model full of wrinkles or acne scars.Photoshopping is a way of life for all people employed or engaged in creative design. These professionals make good money - more than enough to pay $9.99/month for Adobe Photoshop.Final ThoughtsI rate Adobe as a Buy. Adobe Photoshop and the rest of the Creative Cloud software product will remain deeply embedded inside the design-related industries. I am already retired from the daily grind of advertising, but I still subscribe to Photoshop CC.I now mostly use it to layout digital photo storybook albums. Free or cheaper alternatives like GIMP or PaintShop Pro lack the features I need. Paying $9.99 a month for Photoshop CC is very reasonable.I get paid 1,500 pesos ($33.93) per album layout (21 pages, 8"" x14""), which usually takes me around 4-8 hours to finish. Photoshop's Actions/batch processing feature, auto image correction, and template-based workflow help me make poorly taken pictures become wonderful magazine-style storybook albums.Source: Alcaraz ResearchI also get a photoshopping requests from fashion photographers. I charge 100 pesos ($2.32) per image manipulation. Below is my DramaticGothic Photoshop workflow that fashion photographers love.Before and After PhotoshoppingSource: Alcaraz ResearchEasy retouching jobs like this take me less than 15 minutes to finish. If client ask me to layout a calendar, giant billboard or print ad using the said manipulated image above, I will charge another $5-to-$10.The point is that hard-working creative professionals (employed or freelancers) makes a lot of easy money to comfortably afford Adobe's products. Taking freelance Photoshopping projects helped me build a nest egg, which allowed me to retire (before I was 40) from corporate slavery last January 2014."
3003386,72215,2015-03-16T08:53:38-04:00,"Diversified software company Adobe Systems Inc. (NYSE: ADBE) is set to report its financial results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2015 on March 17th.
        ADBE’s Cloud Marketing and Creative segments account for almost 70% of the company’s revenues and are expected to continue to be its core growth driver in the years to come.
        Acrobat Family is expected to fuel revenue growth for Adobe as it reports its financial results for the first quarter of FY 2015.
        The Acrobat Family segment is not expected to have any long term impact as cloud viewing platforms will continue to take over.
        I estimate an $85 target on the company’s stock thereby indicating a potential 10% upside. Going long in Adobe would definitely be a worthwhile proposition.","Diversified software company Adobe Systems Inc. (NYSE: ADBE) is set to report its financial results for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2015 on March 17th. The company has seen steady revenue growth over the course of the last couple of years; somewhat lower that before but will steady enough. The company's bottom lines have declined owing to expenditures on cloud adoption mainly and the slowing down of the company's print and publishing segments. Adobe has remained upbeat about its Q1 2015 performance and is expecting to see top lines and bottom line show growth. The company's cloud segments have been major revenues drivers for the past couple of years. Cloud adoption has proved to be a major success for Adobe as its Cloud segments now account for a majority of its revenues as well as share value. The global cloud market has grown tremendously over the last few years and is expected to continue to show tremendous growth in the next 5 years.Adobe can definitely look to its Cloud Creative and Marketing segments to drive revenue and earnings growth in FY 2015Investor sentiment regarding Adobe has been generally positive over the course of the past few months. The company's growth prospects are definitely looking up especially as a result of the success it has seen in cloud adoption. For the first quarter of its FY 2015, Adobe has projected earnings of $0.14 to $0.20 per share on revenues of $1.05 billion to $1.10 billion.Potential upsides for AdobeProwess in CloudAdobe has seen continued growth in its Cloud portfolio. The company's Cloud Marketing and Creative segments account for almost 70% of the company's revenues and are expected to continue to be its core growth driver in the years to come. The global cloud computing market is expected to grow at a CAGR of almost 30% over the course of the next 3 years and there continues to be massive growth potential beyond that time horizon as well, as cloud services take over conventional networking, computing and storage and the growth of cloud platforms continues. Adobe has thus ensured long term growth by incorporating its cloud based segments as the core elements of its portfolio. The company has seen improved product cycles amid enhanced operational efficiency which has boosted the company's top lines and stabilized its bottom lines. The company can expect higher operational expenditure in Q1 2015, but over the long term as its product cycles continue to stabilize and cloud platforms continue to grow.Taking into account the relevant revenue contribution and an estimated 20% growth, I estimate incremental revenues of almost $1 billion from cloud segments in FY 2015 and incremental revenues of $250 million as the company reports its earnings for the first quarter. The cloud segments are also a major source of value for Adobe's investors. The impressive growth prospects that lie in the global cloud market, coupled with the prowess Adobe has shown so far, will definitely drive investor confidence. The company is expected to see a growth in its cloud subscriber base along with revenues per user as its cloud services continue to penetrate the cloud market and gain further market share.Acrobat Family revenuesApart from Adobe's cloud-based segments, the Acrobat Family segment is the company's second largest accounting for almost 17% of the company's total revenues. Acrobat Family is expected to fuel revenue growth for Adobe as it reports its financial results for the first quarter of FY 2015. The segment has struggled lately in the wake of the emergence of cloud viewing platforms but improved software quality and customer use have allowed for the resurgence of the Acrobat Family.Taking into account the relevant revenue contribution and an estimated 5% growth, I calculate incremental revenues of up to $50 million in FY 2015 and up to $15 million in the first quarter. The Acrobat Family segment is not expected to have any long term impact as cloud viewing platforms will continue to take over but its growth despite operating in an unfavorable environment is a positive sign for investors in particular as it exhibits Adobe's robustness.ConclusionAdobe's cloud services will drive its revenues in the first quarter of 2015 and beyond. The company's cloud adoption has been impressive and highly as its cloud segments are now the main drivers of growth and the joint crown jewels of the company's overall portfolio. Adobe is expected to witness growth in its cloud subscriber base and fees for subscription as its revenues per user grow. There is definite upside potential for the company's stock as the cloud market continues to grow. I estimate an $85 target on the company's stock thereby indicating a potential 10% upside. Going long in Adobe would definitely be a worthwhile proposition."
2739605,23479,2014-12-08T14:27:38-05:00,"Adobe reports earnings this week.In Q3, Adobe’s core cloud business continued to deliver results as cloud adoption remained robust across both its Creative software and marketing solutions.We currently have a $57.70 price estimate for Adobe, which is 20% below the current market price.","Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is set to announce its fiscal Q4 2014 earnings on December 11th. (Fiscal year ends with November). While the company delivered non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.28 that exceeded both its guidance and market expectations in Q3, revenues of $1.005 billion came in $10 million below consensus. However, Adobe’s core cloud business continued to deliver results as cloud adoption remained robust across both its Creative software and marketing solutions. For Q4, we believe the growth trend in cloud adoption continued, which likely drove revenues for Creative cloud and marketing divisions. However, we believe revenues from the LiveCycle and Connect business declined as that of the Print and Publishing business remained flat during the quarter.Outlook For Q4Adobe has guided for revenues of $1.025 billion to $1.075 billion for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. It indicated GAAP EPS would be in the range of $0.05 to $0.11, and non-GAAP EPS between $0.26 and $0.32.Adoption of cloud services continued to remain strong and the company expects to have nearly 3.3 million paid CC individual and team subscriptions by the end of fiscal 2014. (Fiscal years end with November.) According to our calculations, this means it will need to add over 38,100 paid users per week in the final quarter of FY2014. The company has also disclosed that it expects to end the year with over $2.5 billion of digital media revenue at a growth rate of 20% year over year. Furthermore, Adobe expects revenues from its digital marketing cloud to grow by a 25% rate for the 2014 to 2016 period. However, it expects the LiveCycle and Connect business to decline further, while the print and publishing business is expected to remain flat in 2014.Growth In Cloud Services To ContinueAccording to our estimates, the Creative Cloud division is the biggest of Adobe’s operating segments and makes up approximately 59% of its value. We expect the company to report $1.35 billion in revenues for this product family in 2014, which is roughly more than double the prior year level.Offsetting this to some degree will be a corresponding decline in packaged software sales.Over the past year, Adobe’s cloud subscription service has witnessed robust growth as clients have increasingly adopted these services to drive collaborative development efforts across their companies. The primary reason for this has been new additions to its Creative cloud offering as the company added more features to it. While we expect that the share of revenue from Creative Cloud (NYSE:CC) will continue to grow in Q4 2014, its adoption will continue to negatively impact the revenues and profitability as use of subscription service is generally spread over the period of the software’s use. In Q3, the company added 500,000 new subscribers, and 96% of the creative cloud subscribers have signed up for annual contracts. Additionally, the growth in licensing came from enterprise term licensing agreements (ETLA), which usually have tenure of three years. This indicates that CC will continue to drive revenue over the next couple of years. The company reported over 2.81 million paid subscribers for the CC services at the end of third quarter. We expect growth trend to continue in Q4 and estimate that the company is well underway to add 3.3 million subscribers in 2014. We believe that the company will continue to report traction for its cloud services in this earnings announcement.Revenues From Marketing Cloud To GrowAdobe’s cloud marketing division is the second biggest division and makes up 21% of its value. Over the past few years, Adobe has built a comprehensive digital marketing platform that addresses most of the needs in digital marketing. The company has scaled up the functionality and product offering of its marketing platform through organic and inorganic growth. Furthermore, it has recently extended its marketing platform to mobile marketers. [1] We believe that this platform provides a cost effective digital marketing solution for companies that can manage marketing campaigns across different channels and devices. According to the CEO of Adobe, Shantanu Narayen, the marketing cloud is easily a $10 billion opportunity. [2] We expect Adobe’s marketing platform to continue to lead the digital marketing solutions market in the short term, as it enjoys strong brand recognition. Adobe is aiming to increase its revenues from cloud based marketing solutions by expanding in new geographies and verticals where it has a strong presence. Currently, we project revenues from its digital marketing division to reach $3.89 billion by the end of our forecast period in 2021. We expect that, as Adobe continues to develop its marketing solutions capabilities, this division will emerge as an important driver for revenue growth. In this earnings announcement, we expect the company to report growth in revenues from new vertical, especially from mobile. Additionally, since many of Adobe’s digital marketing solutions cater to the growing big data analytics, mobility and social media industries, we expect the company to post incremental revenues across these industries.Acrobat Family Revenue To GrowAcrobat family is the third largest division and makes up 9% of Adobe’s estimated value. In the past few quarters, revenues from this division have been on a decline, primarily due to launch of document cloud services that have subscription fee spread over the period of usage. The company has amassed over 2 million subscribers for document cloud service. We expect this trend to continue in Q4 as well, and forecast the subscriber base to grow to 8 million by the end of our forecast period. We expect revenue to grow from $768 million to $1.21 billion by 2021.We currently have a $57.70 price estimate for Adobe, which is 20% below the current market price.Disclosure: None"

2754475,39301,2014-12-15T21:09:30-05:00,"Adobe Systems merits a higher valuation as earnings growth and sales growth is expected to accelerate.Much of this is driven by falling costs and better-looking comps due to the sales mix transitioning from perpetual licensing to recurring subscription revenue.As such, my FY 2015 price target is $91.40 on 44.59 times earnings.","Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported another solid quarter, which led to a rally in the stock thanks to sales and earnings that beat analyst consensus, albeit on weak expectations. The company reported EPS of $0.36, topping the estimate of $0.30. Adobe bested analyst earnings estimates by 21.29%. The company reported revenue of $1.073 billion, which came in at the high-end of the outlook range, and beat the analyst consensus set of $1.062 billion.Earlier this year on SA, I called Adobe a compelling buy following a guidance miss:The stock reached my price target of $76 after reporting earnings. I'm not going to raise my price objective for FY2014 because the stock has already met it.FY 2015 will be a year where Adobe appreciates even more, as the mix-shit to subscription revenue smooths out annual comps. In FY Q4 2014, the company mentioned that 66% of revenue came from recurring sources (subscriptions, such as software-as-a-service). Over the course of the earnings conference call, management mentioned that total subscriptions will grow by 70% year-over-year, driven by faster adoption of the Adobe Creative Cloud, Marketing Cloud, and Document Services.Source: Adobe SystemsBased on management's outlook of non-GAAP EPS set at $2.05, I price the stock at 44.59 times earnings and offer a price objective of $91.40 for FY 2015. The stock has 20.18% upside from present levels, as the sales mix will compare better to prior fiscal years. The addition of new subscribers will help Adobe reach analyst consensus revenue set at $4.884 billion for FY 2015.Adobe's acquisition of Fotolia for $800 million sounds promising given the integration of Fotolia's library of 34 million images and videos into Adobe Creative Cloud. The monetization of professional pictures and videos gives Adobe another revenue stream on top of the subscription revenue it already generates from its 3.4 million subscribers.Currently, Adobe is ramping up the number of subscribers on its software portfolio. Adobe has some of the best photo editing, marketing and document solutions. This durable advantage seems relatively stable and will not be diminished by any significant amount in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the ramp up in revenue will look significantly better going forward as the annual subscription amount of Adobe's various services total to a much larger figure when compared to a perpetual licensing model.The company will grow revenue at a 20% CAGR over the next two years (based on outlook). Costs as a percentage of revenue is expected to become significantly smaller, which will result in margin expansion. When combined with rapid revenue growth, non-GAAP EPS growth is expected to rapidly accelerate from $1.29 to $2.05 (58.9% annualized growth) in FY 2015.The case for investing into Adobe remains relatively solid, therefore I continue to reiterate my buy recommendation."
2507885,54082,2014-09-19T13:41:22-04:00,"Adobe came up with better than expected earnings, which were is line with the company's estimates.The company's transition seems to be going smoothly as of now. It may face some trouble going forward.Adobe's valuation seems to be a bigger concern than anything else at the moment.","Adobe Systems' (NASDAQ: ADBE) has had a tremendous run in the last three years with share prices nearly tripling in that period. However, Mr. Market isn't reacting kindly to the company's recently reported fiscal third quarter results, as its shares fell nearly 5% during after-hours trading, but that doesn't mean that the numbers were bad.Churning the NumbersAdobe's revenue rose 1% year-over-year, to $1.005 billion, which is well within the company's expected range of $975 million to $1.25 billion. However, the sales figure fell marginally short of the consensus estimate of $1.02 billion.Adobe's adjusted earnings were reported at $0.28 per share, edging out the analysts' estimates of $0.26, well in line with the company's previous guidance of $0.22 to $0.28 per share. The increase in earnings was aided by the company's repurchase of another 1.9 million shares during the quarter for roughly $133 million.Breaking it DownThe performance of Adobe is pretty decent keeping in mind that it is in its transitional phase. The company is switching from the conventional one-time software license model to a monthly subscription-based model. Presently, if we bifurcate the company's revenue in the current quarter it can be broken down into the following:Year-over-year, Adobe's subscription revenue has increased by 83%, while its product sales have reduced by 40%. Going forward, as the company shifts to a subscription-only model, its revenue from subscriptions will increase and sales from product license will reduce further.The Model Seems To Be DeliveringIn the third quarter, Adobe added a notable 502,000 Creative Cloud subscriptions, nearly a 22% sequential increase, which adds to a total of 2.81 million subscriptions. Another encouraging thing is that it marks an 8% increase in Creative Cloud subscriptions compared to the 464,000 subscriptions Adobe added in Q2. Further, as Adobe transits into a subscription model, it will be benefited as it will not be required to convince customers to upgrade their software every few years.Currently, Adobe derived 63% of its third quarter revenue from recurring sources, compared to 52% last quarter. It sells Photoshop and Illustrator as part of its Creative Cloud subscription product and its digital marketing and analytics tools are sold as a part of its Marketing Cloud subscription product. On a positive note, as per the company's management, the retention of Creative Cloud subscriptions is better than expectations, which includes even the renewals after promotional price expiration.Things To Worry AboutIt is noteworthy that the revenue in the current quarter has declined compared to last quarter from $1.65 billion, as Q2 was the last quarter in which Adobe registered any meaningful perpetual CS6 revenue. Though the management is expecting that the revenue will gradually increase since it assumes that the customers are on board, there might be individuals and businesses that upgrade infrequently, so they might not be willing to pay a monthly subscription.Adobe is not the only company that has a subscription-based pricing model, but its strategy to completely do away without its product license model is a far leap. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is another company that has a subscription model, and it has attracted millions of users of Office 365 (a subscription version of Office). However, Microsoft still continues to offer ""MS-Office"" in one-time license, which will help it to combat the risk of pushing customers toward its competitors.On the other hand, Adobe's complete shift to one-time licensing fees is like forcing subscription plans over its customers and the same can backfire. The company's subscription plan can also be a reason for customers for shifting toward its competitors. Although none of the competitors offer versatile products like Adobe, the unwillingness to pay every month can be a factor of driving customers away to competitors.Corel, with its CorelDraw Graphics Suite, remains a major challenge for Adobe. Corel also offers subscription plans, but it expects that most of its customers chose perpetual licenses - this for a customer looking for such an option might head toward it. Moreover, Corel's products are well appreciated, though they might not be as well received as Adobe's products.A Valuation That ConcernsAnother factor that should concern investors is Abode's valuation. For the current fiscal year, analysts expect the earnings to be just $1.23 per share, placing the P/E ratio at a shocking 57.5 times. In 2015 the consensus expects earnings to rise to $2.10 a share, which is by far a very optimistic expectation considering Adobe's EPS before the transition to the cloud was just $1.66. Despite keeping these optimistic numbers as a base, the forward P/E ratio totals around 33 times earnings.Further, the PEG ratio of 3.35 times and Price to Sales ratio of 8.15 times indicates that the market has overestimated the company's capacity to deliver.Final WordsAdobe has an ubiquitous range of products and has plenty of scope to increase its bottom line if it can continue increasing its subscribers. However, on the valuation front, the company seems way too overvalued and hence a correction in the price will make the stock worthy of investors' portfolios."
2558775,24491,2014-10-13T20:12:00-04:00,Companies that throw off lots of free cash flow have tremendous financial flexibility.We think Adobe is a cash machine.Let's evaluate the company through the lens of a discounted cash-flow model.,"The intrinsic value of a company is based on its future free cash flow stream. After discounting a company's future free cash flow stream and summing each annual cash flow, one adds (or subtracts) the firm's net cash (or net debt) position to that sum. The result is equity value and compares directly to a firm's market capitalization (price). Dividing each of these measures by shares outstanding gets to intrinsic value per share and the company's share price, respectively. Comparing the company's intrinsic value to its share price determines whether a company is undervalued or overvalued. Let's do this process for Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE).Adobe Systems' Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Adobe Systems' business quality (an evaluation of our ValueCreation and ValueRisk ratings) ranks among the best of the firms in our coverage universe. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders with relatively stable operating results for the past few years, a combination we view very positively. Adobe has one of the highest rated Economic Castles in our coverage universe.• Adobe is one of the largest software companies in the world. The firm's flagship offering in its digital media business is Adobe Creative Cloud, which allows customers to download the latest version of Adobe Creative Suite products (like Photoshop). The firm also continues to focus on digital marketing solutions.• Adobe Systems has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 28.5% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 2 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 18.4%.• Adobe continues to gain significant traction with respect to Creative Cloud subscriptions. Growing from just 195k in the third quarter of 2012, Adobe anticipates exponential growth in coming quarters and will round out fiscal 2014 with 2.8 million-plus paying subscribers. We love this recurring, subscription-based model.• Adobe Marketing Cloud is quickly becoming a favorite of Chief Marketing Officers as digital marketing bookings continue to expand at a nice clip.• Adobe registers a Valuentum Buying Index rating of a 6.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Adobe Systems' 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 201.6%, which is significantly above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.6%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid gray line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Adobe Systems' free cash flow margin has averaged about 34.3% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Adobe Systems, cash flow from operations decreased about 52% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 10% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Adobe Systems' shares are worth between $52-$78 each. Shares are trading at roughly $63 each at the time of this writing.All value is based on the future free cash flow stream. The future will always be unpredictable to a degree. The larger the unpredictability of a company's future free cash flow stream, the bigger the margin of safety around a company's fair value. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's LOW ValueRisk rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers.The estimated fair value of $65 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 115.1 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 41.4 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 13.3% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 2.2%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 28.3%, which is above Adobe Systems' trailing 3-year average.Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 5.2% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Adobe Systems, we use a 10.6% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.We understand the critical importance of assessing firms on a relative value basis, versus both their industry and peers. Many institutional money managers - those who drive stock prices - pay attention to a company's price-to-earnings ratio and price-earnings-to-growth ratio in making buy/sell decisions. With this in mind, we have included a forward-looking relative value assessment in our process to further augment our rigorous discounted cash flow process. If a company is undervalued on both a price-to-earnings ratio and a price-earnings-to-growth ratio versus industry peers, we would consider the firm to be attractive from a relative value standpoint. For relative valuation purposes, we compare Adobe to peers Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $65 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Adobe Systems. We think the firm is attractive below $52 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $78 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Adobe Systems' fair value at this point in time to be about $65 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Adobe Systems' expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes also is subject to change over time should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $88 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $65 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsIn the spirit of transparency, we show the latest study of the Valuentum Buying Index here.

This will change.","In conventional terms, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) looks like one of the best shorts in the history of Earth.Investors have been paying almost nine times sales for a company that has had contracting sales and margins for almost two years, at a time when other technology companies are delivering stellar results.Adobe is Silicon Valley's great recycler. It exploits technologies until they run out, then runs down with them and picks up new ones. When I first joined the tech beat in the early 1980s, it was known for desktop publishing. Then, it became a video tech company with Macromedia, an essential add-in to every browser.Now that game looks to be ending. Hence the current drift.A few years ago, management, aware that the game was ending, went on another buying spree, picking up things like Auditude, a video advertising platform in 2011, and Neolane, a cross-channel campaign management outfit last year. The result is Adobe Marketing Cloud, a complete set of marketing solutions that are helping drive web ad rates through the floor.Forrester Research now lists Adobe as the marketing cloud leader, ahead of Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), IBM (NYSE:IBM), SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and others. This is a huge piece of a $1 trillion market, and Adobe is well ahead of the pack.In the past, the result would have been an almost seamless transition, with the company replacing one set of losers with a new set of winners and moving ahead at a comfortable pace. The problem is that the old products are collapsing, not going gently into that good night, and management seems unable or unwilling to deal effectively with the rot.The company's e-reader software is the subject of scandal, its management reaction to scandals like Gamergate has been embarrassing and it's been caught trying to monetize updates of things like Flash Player with what some call malware, software that loads unwanted programs or changes defaults on search engines.There is a disquieting lack of control at the top, a seeming inability to strategize and focus, that is killing the company's brand reputation in the consumer space, even as it moves more into a business-to-business mode.This should spell opportunity for a strategic buyer who can break the company up into pieces, dumping the garbage and focusing on what works. But not at current prices. Right now, the company looks like a short, as the cost of entry for an activist investor would be higher than any potential payoff.But if this does drift back to the mid-$60s, a level it held just last month, it starts to get more interesting. The co-founders of the company, John Warnock and Charles Geschke, are in their mid-70s, and their attention has moved on. It needs either a young entrepreneurial leader to replace CEO Shantanu Narayen, 50, who has been conspicuously cashing out stock options this year, or it needs an activist who will press for and get a breakup of the company, with the crown jewels sold to rivals and the rest properly managed, possibly by an executive who understands both mobile and open source and can fit the company's tools into a profitable niche within that space.So keep your eye on this one and look for an entry point. When you find one (and the current price is not one), your patience will be rewarded."
2751835,24276,2014-12-13T11:12:38-05:00,Adobe has a hit with its Creative Cloud.Shantanu Narayen has proven himself a top notch executive.I was wrong to dismiss the future of this Silicon Valley bellweather.,"Traders have the right to sneer at me today, as Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is on a tear following earnings.When I wrote about the company a month ago, the stock was trading at under $72 and essentially treading water. It's up 8.5%, as of late Friday morning, on a strong earnings release and the purchase of Fotolia, a source of royalty-free graphics, for $800 million.What's really driving optimism about the stock is its ""Creative Cloud,"" an offering of graphics software, in the form of a service, which added 644,000 customers during the quarter. It's a hit, and the Fotolia acquisition is a great bolt-on that will make it even more of a hit.I wrote that in conventional terms Adobe made a good short. I expected a bumpy transition to offerings like Creative Cloud. In that, I was completely wrong.What it turned out Adobe had, and which I discounted, was Shantanu Narayen, 50, an Indian-born executive who joined the company back in 1998 and has been acting as CEO since 2007. Narayen is a veteran of both Silicon Graphics and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), he co-founded an early picture-sharing site called Pictra and he has been engineering what looks now like a seamless transition from selling software to selling services.Adobe is, as I wrote a month ago, primarily a recycler of technologies that are often created elsewhere. Macromedia, a video editing company whose heritage includes Macromind, founded by a friend of mine named Marc Canter, is one of the companies that have been recycled. But all the recycling has always had a basic point - graphics - and Adobe has been willing to ride the waves of that technology, down as well as up.Right now graphics, in all its forms, is on an up swell. Global law enforcement has come down heavily on copyright violations - witness the closing of Pirate Bay - but more important the industry has come up with creative ways for people to actually buy copyrighted material, at an affordable price. With the need to hoard reduced, and with faster broadband speeds creating vast new markets for legal content, graphics software is taking off.Some of Adobe's older ways of doing business have been hurt. Its relations with other Silicon Valley players, like Apple, have not always been smooth. But engineering a successful transition of the company's tools to cloud is a win, and in the last quarter that win was proven.I was wrong.I wrote a month ago that you should ""look for an entry point"" on this stock, but I was wrong to think the $72 price was a poor one. With the U.S. and digital economies suddenly looking much stronger than before, it's not too late now to make money on Adobe."
2502335,39301,2014-09-17T15:15:48-04:00,"Adobe reported a top line miss, and guidance for next quarter wasn't that great.The investment thesis still holds, as the results didn't negate the long-term growth trajectory of earnings by much.Investors should be opportunistic buyers following the 4.64% pull-back in the after hours.","Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported earnings, and I guess the top line figure just barely missed by a narrow sliver of a margin. The company reported $1.005B versus the consensus analyst estimate of $1.02B. The difference in the actual figure from the consensus was a whopping $15 million for the quarter.Going into 2014, this was one of my better performing recommendations, and as you can tell from the below chart, it has had quite a bit of a ride.Source: FreeStockChartsAs you can tell, the stock has rallied for most of 2014. The stock started to decline in the middle of the year, but it eventually moved up into the $70-$73 range. However, the stock started to consolidate, as there weren't a whole lot of catalysts that could drive the stock much higher.Earlier in the year here's what I stated:I think the stock should be able to exhibit further appreciation as Adobe Creative Cloud becomes a bigger component of the sales mix. The software as a service model tends to deflate revenue in the near-term, but comes with the benefit of higher revenue recognition as the total sales per user figure becomes larger versus a perpetual licensing model. Furthermore, the operating margin should improve as buyers become more aware of the cloud based offering, which will diminish marketing spend, which will boost the earnings figure in future quarters.The guidance for the quarter wasn't that hot. According to SA, ""Guidance is on the light side, with FQ4 revenue expected at $1.025B-$1.075B vs. the Street outlook of $1.09B, and EPS of $0.26-$0.32 vs. the Street at $0.31.""Investors are very sensitive to earnings misses and beats on high growth names, as they're already trading at a premium. A slight miss will have a significant impact on sentiment. However, guidance for the next quarter doesn't negate the long-term investment thesis, and it's likely that financial performance will improve considerably going into fiscal year 2015. Therefore, I have no reason to believe the recent downward move in the stock price will be permanent, and I think investors can opportunistically buy on pull backs.According to Adobe's press release:The continued uptake in subscription-based revenue should be interpreted positively, and I also think that further migration to the cloud should be seen positively, and it will generate much better looking comps as the sales mix moves away from an up-front licensing model to a continuous subscription stream, which will drive 19.6% revenue growth in the next fiscal year. The trickle down of added revenue, paired with some efficiency gains should drive significant EPS growth of approximately 70% in the next fiscal year.I reiterate my $76 price target, and I think the investment is a long-term buy. I think investors can be opportunistic buyers at $67. The stock may exhibit a late year rally, which could drive the stock up by an additional 13.4%. Most of this move would be driven by earnings multiple expansion, which would be a function of improving market sentiment on aggregate. I don't think the stock will have any notable near-term catalysts, so I wouldn't anticipate much more upside beyond $76."
2500615,25120,2014-09-17T04:14:07-04:00,"Adobe Systems fails to meet high expectations for the quarter.As the transition into a subscription business model continues, with nearly two thirds of revenues being of a recurring nature at the moment.Even after accounting for a successful transition, and taking into account expected growth in the coming years, shares remain expensive.","Investors in Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) were not too pleased with the third quarter results, and notably the outlook for the final quarter which did not meet high expectations.I continue to avoid the shares given the already expensive valuation even if the company manages this transition model well, and after taking into account 20% revenue growth for the upcoming two years.Third Quarter HeadlinesAdobe Systems posted third quarter sales of $1.005 billion, a 1.0% increase versus last year. The modest increase in sales resulted in revenues coming in below consensus estimates at $1.02 billion.Despite the very modest growth in topline sales, earnings were under significant pressure. GAAP earnings of $44.7 million were down by nearly 46% versus last year with earnings coming in at $0.09 per share.Excluding adjustments related to stock-based compensation and amortization charges, non-GAAP earnings came in at $0.28 per share which was down four cents compared to last year and was two cents better than anticipated by analysts.In The Middle Of A TransitionThe 1% growth in sales seems negligible yet it should be noted that Adobe is making a shift in its business model, which implies that rather than recognizing big upfront revenues, it now records recurring sales under the cloud-driven business subscription model, which understates reported revenue growth. As a result the backlog of deferred revenues grew to $997 million, coming in just shy of the billion mark.The shift is apparent when looking at the revenue sources of the business with product sales being down 40% to $349.2 million as subscription revenues have been up by nearly 83% to $547.4 million. As a result roughly 63% of sales are now of a recurring nature.Important metrics at which investors and the investment community are focusing on recently are cloud subscription numbers. The company had 2.81 million Creative Cloud subscriptions, a 502,000 increase over the past three month alone.Gross margins came in at a very impressive 84.3% of sales which was actually down by 90 basis points versus last year. The problem was on the cost side with operating expenses being up in every category and especially in terms of sales & marketing as well as general & administrative costs.Consequently operating margins came in just 7.4% of sales which was down by 370 basis points versus last year. Net earning have furthermore been impacted by a higher and more normal effective tax rate of 29% which compared to just 11% as reported last year.Modest OutlookFor the current final quarter of the year, Adobe sees revenues coming in between $1.025 and $1.075 billion, which at the midpoint of the guidance represent again a roughly 1% increase in sales on an annual basis.Non-GAAP earnings are seen between $0.26 and $0.32 per share with GAAP earnings seen at $0.05 to $0.11 per share. The guidance falls short compared to consensus estimates calling for earnings of $0.31 per share on sales of $1.09 billion.Strong Balance Sheet, High ValuationAt the end of the quarter, Adobe had nearly 508 million shares outstanding which at $67 per share values equity in the business at some $34 billion. It should be noted that the business holds a sizable $3.5 billion in cash, equivalents and short term investments, while having $1.5 billion in debt and capital lease obligations outstanding. Consequently, operating assets are valued at around $32 billion.On a trailing basis, Adobe has now posted sales of $4.1 billion on which it has posted net earnings of just about $250 million. This values operations at roughly 8 times sales and over a 100 times GAAP earnings. Based on non-GAAP earnings metrics, shares still trade at a premium valuation.It should be noted that the current profitability is impacted by the transition into the subscription-based business model, with revenues being recognized along the way instead of upfront, as costs are incurred already.Steady Growth, But What About The Business Model Change?Over the past decade, Adobe has grown its sales from about $1.7 billion in 2004 towards $4.1 billion at the moment, growing sales at an average of 9% per year. This is only part of the story however, with sales being down from $4.4 billion being reported in 2012 to lower levels at the moment following the change in the business model, with revenues being largely stable at the moment.Earnings largely doubled from $450 million in 2004 to little over $800 million in 2011 and 2012, as GAAP earnings have plunged to just $250 million on a trailing basis by now. Despite continued share repurchases, the outstanding share base has actually increased slightly over the past decade on the back of the continued high stock-based compensation expenses.Final ThoughtsThe question is how can a business which posts just $250 million in GAAP earnings, support the current valuation at around $32 billion?For starters it is the change in business model which has huge implications on the bottom line given the fat profit margins. Deferred revenue balances have increased by $169 million in the first nine months of the year, increasing at roughly $225 million per annum. Given gross margins of +80%, gross profits could be $180 million higher if this situation will stabilize at some point in time, easily adding another $120-$130 million in GAAP after-tax earnings to the bottom line after accounting for statutory taxes.Adjusting for that earnings come much closer to the $400 million mark which already looks a bit nicer. The real growth in earnings has to result from the ¨catch-up¨ in revenues which translates big-time in reported earnings given the relatively fixed operating cost base amidst the very high gross margins. The company continues to anticipate these topline sales growth to come back, anticipating topline sales to grow by 20% on average over the period of 2014-2016. As such sales could approach the $6 billion mark in 2016.These optimistic targets have spurred the guidance of the company, calling for non-GAAP earnings of about $2 per share in 2015 and earnings greater than $3 in 2016. Note that the current discrepancy between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings runs at about $0.75 per share per annum. As such GAAP earnings of at least $2.00 might be in the works for 2016 which still results in a rather steep GAAP earnings multiple of roughly 30 times. That being said, the multiple is already a lot more acceptable.You get the point, the company still has to deliver, and even in such a scenario the valuation offers no compelling risk-reward potential in my eyes, especially as shares have already risen 50% over the past year. I remain on the sidelines."
2675425,20411,2014-11-12T17:00:12-05:00,ADBE has been experiencing EPS and revenue contraction.While the PE multiple went from 15x to 56x.There is a big problem with that.,"To most investors, valuation is extremely important, but thus far valuation is not nearly as important for investors in Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) as you might think. Eventually, stocks which are significantly undervalued or overvalued usually come back into parity with their fair valuation, so this observation serves as a guideline for the fair value of Adobe specifically.First of all, earnings at Adobe have been declining aggressively since the third quarter of 2012. The most recent result was lower than at any other point since 2009, and although revenues are still at 2011 levels they have also come down from their respective peak and revenue growth does not currently exist either. This brings our attention to earnings growth specifically.Our observations of earnings growth focuses on earnings from operations and discounts one-time events to better define actual growth, and then we compile trailing 12 month data and compare that on a yearly basis to develop our yearly growth rate chart. Our observations suggest that Adobe, although still experiencing a contraction in EPS of about 8.6%, is not deteriorating as fast as it was about a year ago.However, and most interestingly, the PE multiple for Adobe is really what tells the story. At the same time earnings began to decline significantly, which was the third quarter of 2012, the multiple began to expand. The PE multiple for Adobe went from near 15 times earnings to 56 times earnings, an almost fourfold increase, while both earnings and revenue experienced contraction.Technical take:According to our real time trading report for Adobe the stock tested longer term support when the market fell hard about a month ago, and it has been increasing toward longer term resistance ever since. The stock has not tested longer-term resistance but it appears to be in the process of increasing toward that resistance level. On a technical basis, we would not be buyers of Adobe, but instead look to sell or short the stock when resistance is tested.Summary:Adobe is extremely overvalued, the PE multiple of 56 times earnings levied on the stock at this time is not supported by either earnings growth or revenue growth, and eventually we believe multiple contraction could hit this stock and cause it to come into parity with its actual growth rate. We would not be buyers of Adobe but instead look to sell or short the stock when triggers surface."

(NASDAQ: ADBE) reported 3Q FY 2014 net income of $44.69 million ($0.09 per share, $0.28 non-GAAP) on sales of $1.005 billion compared to net income of $83 million ($0.16 per share) on sales of $995.1 million in the same quarter in the prior year. These results matched Estimize-reported consensus earnings estimates of $0.28 per share (non-GAAP), but were below sales estimates of $1.025 billion. These numbers are based on a fully-diluted share count of 507.8 million in 2014 and 514.1 million in 2013.Adobe Systems, Inc. is a diversified software developer. It develops and publishes digital media and marketing software, and print/publishing software. Its signature brands include Adobe Creative Cloud, Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Photoshop, Dreamweaver, and Adobe Illustrator. The company was founded in 1982 and currently employs 12,368 people.Its main competitors include Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).Key PointsGuidanceWhat to look for in Q4Continued share repurchasesThe company returned about $133 million to shareholders through buybacks. If management does not have any substantial projects that it is willing to work on, look for continued buybacks into the fourth quarter. The company currently has a share repurchase authorization of $2 billion.Continued transition towards cloud-computing modelManagement has emphasized that the company is transitioning towards a subscription-based, cloud business model. Part of this transformation is explained by the company's revenue sources, of which 63% was from ""recurring sources"" indicating substantial growth in the subscription market.Product expansionDuring the call, management stated that they were expanding Adobe's portfolio of Creative Cloud products to go after additional markets, such as photographers. The company is a well established player in the publishing and digital media segment, and its brand equity may help it expand into untapped markets.Quick TakeManagement reported underwhelming guidance, which is disappointing and gives the impression that the company's growth may be getting stagnant. In addition to the company's lackluster guidance, I was disappointed that they did not offer any explanation as to why revenue growth slowed so much year-over-year.Beyond the financials, management did give some color on the company's future plans. It's clear that as the industry leader in publishing software, they want to transition to the cloud computing environment and take advantage of opportunities there.Management went into a lot of detail about its Creative Cloud product which they claim to be ""aggressively converting"" their customer base over to from Creative Suite, which is a standalone studio product. It's clear that they are trying positioning the company to be a leader in cloud-based publishing technology and grow earnings through subscription-based services, which they referred to as Annualized Recurring Revenue.They seemed proud of the fact that ""63% of Adobe's Revenue was from recurring sources,"" but this tells me is that they are depending a lot on subscription-based models to pick up the lost sales from customers that have moved on from Creative Suite. Management did not address the issue of product cannibalization, as it seems that most customers would not purchase both Creative Suite and Creative Cloud products.Adobe has a fantastic product and is the go-to company for publishing and editing software. The company is fully embracing the transition to cloud computing, and is expanding its product offerings for new types of customers. Additionally, it has a solid balance sheet with minimal debt and strong cash flow. While the company has a fantastic brand and financials, I am concerned about the deceleration in revenue growth that Adobe has experienced - it has such a solid position on the market that it may not have much room for the quick expansion that is expected from a company that has been trading at a P/E over 100.Conference call transcript available from Seeking Alpha here. 8-K with financial filings available here."
2506635,61863,2014-09-19T04:53:47-04:00,"As a technology growth company, ""soft growth"" could be the kiss of death for Adobe Systems Inc.Deceleration has negatively impacted Adobe's bottom line.Since shifting its operations to Cloud-based subscriptions, Adobe's SG&A costs have increased while gross profits have declined, suggesting an increase in competition.","Adobe Systems Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported soft growth in Q3 which caused a recent drop in the stock price. Some have argued that the market overreacted. I contend the opposite.Adobe's ""soft growth"" was mostly supported by the 83% increase in subscribers y/y. This should have made a larger impact on the top line. However, it was offset by the -40% drop in product sales y/y. There was also a slight drop of -4% in revenues from services and support. And as a result of the shift, the company's bottom line was negatively impacted.Vanishing Bottom LineAdobe's bottom line has been in decline since the beginning of 2013. From 2012 Q4 to 2013 Q1, the company saw a sharp -68% cut in operating income. Any dramatic drop in income would be excusable if the company was in some sort of transition period, and Adobe was. However, the more recent y/y -33% decline of operating income suggests that 2013 Q1 was not a fluke but a warning. Adobe has been in a slump since 2013 and it looks like things are getting worse.The decline in operating income can be attributed in part to the steady increase in the company's OPEX and decrease in gross margins. The company's product sales deliver an impressively high gross margin of over 94%. However, the company's transition towards subscription service has led to a decline in sales and therefore an overall thinner margin.This decline becomes amplified when we look at the five year quarterly chart for the company's net income.Despite the deep cut into Adobe's bottom line since the end of 2012, the stock price has continued to rise.ADBE data by YChartsAdobe investors apparently did not think twice about the vanishing bottom line. The stock rallied in 2013 as though the company was reporting record returns. To be fair, the company's non-GAAP reporting softened these numbers. It includes adjusting for amortization of purchased intangibles and technology license arrangements and stock based and deferred compensation expense. Although it has its merits, this clever accounting tactic in this case seems to be more about minimizing the declining performance than owning up to the fact that the company faces continual headwinds as it moves into the cloud-based market.Investors Have Their Heads in the CloudsInvestors are gluttons for companies utilizing cloud technology. Companies like Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), Athenahealth (NASDAQ:ATHN), and Salesforce.com Inc (NYSE:CRM) have all continued to rally beyond rationality because they are involved in ""the cloud.""WDAY data by YCharts ATHN data by YChartsCRM data by YChartsThere are a dozen other cloud companies with similar financials. Even though these companies operate on a thin margin or a loss and deliver lackluster revenues, investors are bullish because of the historical rate of growth and that they are utilizing ""sexy"" technology.Although I can imagine that down the road these companies may end up delivering impressive returns, the problem is that they currently are not. Even with growth rates between 25%-48%, it will take at least 5 years before the current valuation is justified. Between now and then, a lot could happen that may undermine this growth thereby making these companies vulnerable to deep corrections.Adobe's transition into a cloud-based platform sounds sexy but it isn't paying off. This is forgivable if there is accelerated growth. Although there is growth, competition is ultimately hurting the bottom line.Losing Ground in the CloudThe ""soft growth"" and the decline in margins should be a concern for investors. As Adobe transitions towards cloud technology, it faces tough competition from companies like:Last year, Adobe faced negative backlash from its subscribers over its ""shift from selling Creative Suite perpetual licenses to Creative Cloud subscriptions."" Adobe's competitors smelled blood and took their opportunity. Despite Adobe customers' initial dissatisfaction with the move towards cloud-based subscriptions, the company has reported an increase of 173% in active subscriptions, from 1.031M to 2.81M.So it seems that the company still has a strong grasp over the market. But if subscribers have increased 173% y/y why did subscription revenues only increased 83%? Similarly, there was a 22% increase in cloud subscriptions yet revenue subscriptions increased 14%. Something isn't adding up.Despite, its best efforts, it looks like competitive pressures are driving up Adobe's costs. If the SG&A is less 30% of a company's gross revenue, that is great for the company; if it is 100%, that suggests it is in a highly competitive industry.This past quarter the SG/A was 64.6% of the gross profit. Ever since Adobe shifted its emphasis to the cloud, competition has driven up Adobe's costs and is ultimately hurting the company's bottom line. The fact that this number keeps rising suggests that it is costing Adobe more to maintain its market share.If investors can stomach watching the margins decrease and hope that others won't jump ship, you could argue this is a hold. The fact that subscriptions rates keep increasing suggests that its strategy is effective. At the same time, holding in the hopes that performance improves leaves the investor exposed. There presents little margin of safety when the valuation is in the clouds.ConclusionsAdobe's products are still superior to its competitors. However, it is my assessment that the valuation got way ahead of itself. The enthusiasm for the company's change in product platform drove the share price up as though the shift will lead to an overall growth. Instead, the shift merely supplanted one primary source of revenue for another. With soft growth, declining margins, and increasing costs, investors might be best to get their hopes out of the clouds."

2455565,23479,2014-08-27T18:02:59-04:00,"Adobe has rallied from $31 in August 2012 to its current market price of over $71.The rally coincides with the launch of Adobe's Creative Cloud and its rapid adoption among creative professionals.We believe the current market valuation of Adobe is stretched, even as the company has entered the digital marketing market to diversify its product portfolio.","Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock has rallied from $31 in August 2012 to its current market price of over $71. This translates into a return of over 135% in the last two years. Furthermore, this rally coincides with the launch of Adobe's Creative Cloud (CC), which contributes 57% to our estimated price of Adobe, and its rapid adoption amongst creative professionals. However, we believe that the current market valuation of Adobe is stretched, even as the company has entered the digital marketing market to diversify its product portfolio. In this note, we will discuss the factors that we believe will limit Adobe's valuation in the short term. Limited Total Addressable Market for Creative CloudThe Creative Cloud (CC) division together with Adobe's packaged division makes up 60% of Adobe's estimated value. The key drivers for this division are total creative software market and the average revenue per subscriber. While Creative products (Creative Suite and Creative Cloud) contributed nearly 50% to Adobe's revenue in 2013, the total number of licensees for Adobe's creative products stood at 12.8 million. Currently we estimate that the company is well underway to add over 3.4 million subscribers in 2014, and on track to add 10.8 million subscribers by the end of 2020. This figure represents 80% of the current 12.8 million point in suite licensees. However, to justify Adobe's current market price the number of subscribers will have to grow to over 13.8 million, which in turn will require a higher growth rate in the total addressable market (TAM).Average revenue per subscriber (ARPS) for the company consists of a blend of subscribers that have enrolled to different levels of cloud services. While access to the complete Creative Cloud suite costs $74.99 per month, access to standalone Photoshop is priced at $9.99 per month. We estimate that the blended ARPS for the company was $27.5 in 2013. The recent trend in subscriptions indicates that users are subscribing to the annual full version of Creative Cloud. The company has also reported good growth in its enterprise term licensing agreements (ETLA), which have a tenure of three years. This leads us to believe that the ARPS will increase in the coming years as it converges to the sticker price of $74.99. We estimate that the ARPS will grow to $51 by the end of our forecast period. However, the market expects ARPS to grow at a much faster pace, which might be difficult to achieve if more products with lower price points are introduced within the cloud portfolio.Market Share in Online Marketing CloudAdobe's cloud marketing division is the second-biggest division and makes up 20% of its value. Over the past few years, Adobe has built a comprehensive digital marketing platform that addresses most of the needs in digital marketing. This build up started in 2009 with the acquisition of Ominiture. Since then, the company has scaled up the functionality and product offering of its marketing platform through organic and inorganic growth. Currently, Adobe offers six products under its marketing cloud solution. The Adobe marketing cloud includes a complete set of analytics, social media optimization, consumer targeting, web experience management and cross-channel campaign management solutions. It generated around $1 billion in annual revenues in 2013. Having been built from the acquisition, the business has had a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 106% over last four years. Well positioned in a growing market, this division is expected to witness robust growth in the coming years. Adobe is aiming to increase its revenues from cloud based marketing solutions by expanding in new geographies and verticals. According to the CEO of Adobe, Shantanu Narayen, the marketing cloud is easily a $10 billion opportunity. [1] Currently, we project revenues from its digital marketing division to reach $3.4 billion by the end of our forecast period. However, to justify the current market price of Adobe, the company will have to rake in over $4.8 billion in revenue for marketing division. We believe that this would be a difficult feat considering the intense competition in this space from companies such as IBM (NYSE:IBM), Accenture (NYSE:ACN), Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).Acrobat Family Revenue To GrowAcrobat family is the third-largest division and makes up 10% of Adobe's estimated value. In the past few quarters, revenue from this division has been on a decline, primarily due to the launch of document cloud services that have subscription fee spread over the period of usage. The company has amassed over 1.9 million subscribers for the document cloud service. We expect this trend to continue and forecast the subscriber base to grow to 8 million by the end of our forecast period. Furthermore, as this service gains momentum, we expect the ARPS to increase from $5.91 to $10 by the end of our forecast period. Despite this growth rate, we expect revenue to grow from $768 million to $1 billion by 2020.Transition to Cloud Services to Negatively Impact Smaller DivisionsSmaller divisions of Adobe, which include Adobe packaged software, LiveCycle software and Print & Publishing, make up 6% of its estimated value. The adoption of Creative Cloud will negatively impact Adobe's packaged software, while up-selling to Adobe marketing cloud will impact LiveCyle and Connect pro revenues. We expect revenues from these divisions to decline in the future. We also expect the number of licenses sold for both the divisions to decline. Even if these metrics were to improve for both the divisions, it will have little impact on our stock price valuation, since contribution from these divisions is small.We currently have a $58.14 price estimate for Adobe, which is 20% below the current market price.Disclosure: No positions."

(NASDAQ:ADBE) is slated to report 3Q 2014 earnings after the close on Tuesday, September 16th. The earnings release is expected at approximately 4:05 p.m. EST with a 5:00 p.m. conference call webcast at Adobe Investor Relations. Adobe operates in three segments: Digital Media, Digital Marketing, and Print Publishing. The company is a component of the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 indexes.Outliers & StrategyKey measures:Recent NewsTechnical ReviewAdobe is close to the new all-time high that followed last quarter's report and upside potential after over a decade of being flat is often under estimated. The stock has recently been unable to remain above $73 for more than a brief test, so it makes for a curious position ahead of the earnings release. One worry is that AutoDesk has tended to lead Adobe shares recently and isn't showing any of the bounce that Adobe has had the last month. That being said, the company's shares show positive seasonality in the latter part of the last few years. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryAdobe's new user growth and moves into new areas that lack credible alternatives excite analysts. New user growth is supported by their cloud subscription service and digital marketing platform. Even moves into hardware sound exciting. Over the last four quarters, the stock price reaction to the earnings releases suggests traders are focused more on these underlying measures and guidance rather than headline numbers. The company reporting earnings of at least $0.28 on revenue of $1.022 bln would allow traders to then focus around measures for new business, such as Creative Cloud subscriptions.DISCLAIMER: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

2275833,25120,2014-06-18T18:39:15-04:00,"Investors send shares to fresh all-time highs on the back of strong subscriber numbers for creative cloud.Second quarter results are strong, accompanied by a soft third quarter financial outlook.Strong earnings growth is anticipated in 2015 and 2016. Still shares are rather pricey.","Shares of Adobe Systems set fresh all time highs in the wake of its second quarter results as the transition into a SAAS business model is progressing well.Despite the very strong guided earnings growth in the coming years, I remain cautious as shares trade at premium multiples even based on 2016's expected earnings.Second Quarter HighlightsOn Tuesday, Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported a strong set of second quarter results. Reported revenues were up by 5.7% to $1.07 billion. Note that analysts were looking for revenues of $1.03 billion.Reported net earnings were up by 15.6% to $88.5 million. Earnings per diluted share were up two pennies to $0.17 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings came in at $0.37 per share, seven cents ahead of consensus estimates.Looking Into The ResultsTopline revenue growth was very strong, given that the company is transitioning its business model, moving toward a subscriber based business billing model. Revenues came in comfortably ahead of the company's own guidance for revenues of $1.00 to $1.05 billion.The company ended the quarter with 2.31 million paid Creative Cloud subscriptions, 464,000 more than the first quarter. Growth is spectacular and drives the momentum in the stock.Little over half of total revenues, some 53% of revenues are derived from recurring revenue sources like Creative Cloud and Adobe Marketing Cloud at the moment. This marks huge progress in the transition.Looking Into The YearThird quarter revenues are foreseen between $975 million and $1.025 billion. On a GAAP basis earnings are seen between $0.02 and $0.08 per share, while the non-GAAP guidance is 20 cents higher. The guidance looks a bit soft compared to consensus estimates for revenues at $1.02 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $0.27 per share.For the third and fourth quarter combined, Adobe anticipates to gain another 1 million Creative Cloud subscribers. This should result in $1.925 billion in Digital Media revenues at an annual recurring rate.Valuing AdobeThe company ended the quarter with a comfortable war chest containing $3.33 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments. Total debt, including capital lease obligations, stands at $1.51 billion, resulting in a comfortable net cash position of $1.7 billion.On a trailing basis, Adobe has posted revenues of $4.11 billion on which it net earned $383 million.Trading at $73 per share, the company is valued at $36 billion which values operating assets just north of $34 billion. This values operating assets of the firm at 8.3 times annual revenues and nearly 90 times GAAP earnings.Adobe does not pay a dividend at the moment.Focused On Long-Term GrowthBack in December of last year, Adobe already provided a road map for growth, providing the market with guidance throughout the business model transition.Total revenues were expected to grow at a 20% compounded annual growth rate between 2014 and 2016. This should result in non-GAAP earnings of about $2.00 per share in 2015, and earnings north of $3.00 in 2016.Takeaway For InvestorsInvestors are cheerful, especially given the subscriber numbers for Creative Cloud which includes Photoshop and Adobe's Flash software. As such it now sees 3.3 million subscribers by the end of the year, up from a previous guidance of 3.0 million subscribers.The move from expensive one-time license revenues to subscriptions should not only generate more recurring revenues, it should also boost revenues as piracy should be declining. Supplying software from the cloud instead off from a physical source allows Adobe to better control the usage of its software.Investors are very much pleased about the talk and forward guidance of Adobe. CEO Narayen is excited about the product line and expects a strong second half of the year.Assuming a constant gap between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings, GAAP earnings could improve to a billion by 2016. While this would be up substantially from current earnings, shares would still trade at 34 times earnings seen two years ahead in time. This seems rather steep to me.As such, I remain on the sidelines after shares have seen a huge run, having shown gains of nearly 70% over the past year. This and the high valuation are my main reasons to be cautious despite the successful transition.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

While CS was Adobe’s flagship product for over a decade, and offered to a user as packaged software with one-time perpetual license fee, CC is a subscription service that requires a user to pay a fixed monthly fee along with free upgrades to its latest version. The company reported faster-than-expected adoption of subscription licenses for its Creative Cloud (CC) business, as more of its clients chose to subscribe to it. The company reported over 2.3 million paid subscribers for the CC services at the end of second quarter. To ensure that the growth in this vertical continues unabated, the company recently announced 14 new versions of CC desktop applications, including essential tools such as Adobe Photoshop CC, Adobe Illustrator CC, Adobe Dreamweaver CC and Adobe Premiere Pro CC. In this note, we will look at the new CC offerings and how they can translate into higher revenues in the future.Creative Cloud Bolsters its Portfolio According to our estimate, the Creative Cloud (CC) division is the biggest of Adobe’s operating segment and makes up approximately 57% of the company’s value. Creative professionals such as design engineers, graphic designers, etc., believe that this field is evolving at a fast rate since new channels such as mobile, etc., are emerging that are driven by new technologies. Furthermore, the world is now more connected than before, and this trend is expected to continue in the future, as Internet penetration in countries with limited access grows. In light of this trend, Adobe has extended its CC portfolio to the mobile vertical with three new mobile apps for iPad – Adobe Sketch, Adobe Line, and Adobe Photoshop Mix. These new apps add significant mobile capabilities to CC, integrate workflows with the CC desktop apps, and bring tablets into creative workflows for the first time. Additionally, all of the latest desktop apps, mobile apps and creative hardware are tightly integrated through CC services. This will enable creative professionals to work across multiple devices that have different form factor.Hardware Sales To Supplement CCAdobe has also released new creative hardware called Adobe Ink, a new digital pen, and Adobe Slide, a new digital ruler. This will enable creative professionals to use CC services on mobile devices, primarily tablets. We believe that hardware sales have opened a new stream of revenue for Adobe, and continue to monitor the revenues generated through these sales to ascertain the market size of such devices.CC To Drive Revenue In The FutureApart from extending CC to mobile devices, Adobe has also released an improved version of CC and the 14 apps under its umbrella. Currently we estimate that the company is well underway to add over 3.4 million subscribers in 2014, and on track to add 10.8 million subscribers by the end of 2020. This figure represents 80% of the current 12.8 million point and suite licensees. We believe that the new feature rich version will entice trial users and existing point and suite licensees to adopt CC. If this were to happen the total addressable market size for CC will increase and so will the number of users. If subscription were to grow at a slower rate to 13 million, our stock price estimate can increase by 10%.We currently have a stock price estimate of $58.14 for Adobe, which is 19% below the market price.Disclosure: No positions."

The slump in Adobe's earnings comes as the company is undergoing a transition from traditional perpetual software licenses to a subscription based business model.Abode ended last quarter with 1.8 million subscribers and management expects to add another 1.2 million by the end of calendar 2014. Last quarter Adobe added 405,000 subscribers, so management's goal is aggressive, but not outside the realm of possibility. Wall Street is looking for 29 cents per share in earnings and revenue of $1.025B. The Street is hoping that for the first time in seven quarters Adobe will report year-over-year revenue growth on Tuesday. Here's what investors are expecting after the close.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.(Click Here to see Estimates and Interactive Features for Adobe)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Adobe to report 29 cents EPS and $1.025B revenue while the current Estimize.com consensus from 11 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 31 cents EPS and $1.035B in revenue. This quarter the buy side as represented by the Estimize.com community is expecting Adobe to beat the Wall Street consensus on both the top and bottom line by a thin margin.Over the previous six quarters the consensus from Estimize.com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Adobe's EPS and revenue 5 and 3 times, respectively. By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students and non-professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69.5% of the time.The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. Here we are seeing a larger than usual differential between the two groups' expectations.The distribution of earnings estimates published by analysts on the Estimize.com platform range from 30 cents to 32 cents per share and from $1.029B to $1.050B in revenues. This quarter we're seeing a narrow range of estimates on Adobe's earnings.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A narrow range of estimates signals more agreement in the market, which could mean less volatility post earnings.Over the past three months Wall Street increased its EPS consensus from 26 cents to 29 cents while the Estimize consensus edged higher from 30 cents to 31 cents . Meanwhile the Wall Street revenue forecast rose from $988.03M to $1.025B while the Estimize sales consensus began the period at $1.034B and rose going into the report from a low before reaching $1.035B. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and upward analyst revisions going into an earnings report are often a bullish indicator.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is turbinecity who projects 30 cents EPS and $1.029B in revenue. turbinecity was our Winter 2014 season winner and is ranked second overall among more than 4,500 contributing analysts. This season turbinecity has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 60% and 50% of the time respectively throughout a massive 1,153 estimates.Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. In this case turbinecity is expecting Adobe to edge past the Wall Street consensus, but come up short of the forecast from Estimize.Adobe is still going through growing pains associated with its transition to a subscription based business model, but contributing analysts on the Estimize.com platform are anticipating that Adobe will add subs faster than the Street is predicting. The Estimize community is forecasting that on Tuesday afternoon Adobe will beat the Wall Street earnings consensus by 2 cents per share and outperform the Street's revenue projection by $10 million.Disclosure: None."

We love this recurring, subscription-based model.Though we like Adobe, we prefer companies that register a higher rating on the Valuentum Buying Index. Adobe registers a 3.","Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) is an attractively-positioned firm. Though most investors know that software companies have little capital requirements, and by extension, that their business models throw off gobs of free cash flow and high returns on invested capital, there's no better way of showing this dynamic than through a discounted cash-flow model. Let's showcase Adobe's business model through the DCF and apply the Valuentum methodology to the company in this article.But first, a little background to help with the understanding of some of the terminology in this piece. At our boutique research firm, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. We think stocks that are cheap (undervalued) and just starting to go up (momentum) are some of the best ones to evaluate for addition to the portfolios. These stocks have both strong valuation and pricing support. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.Most stocks that are cheap and just starting to go up are also adored by value, growth, GARP, and momentum investors, all the same and across the board. Though we are purely fundamentally-based investors, we find that the stocks we like (underpriced stocks with strong momentum) are the ones that are soon to be liked by a large variety of money managers. We think this characteristic is partly responsible for the outperformance of our ideas -- as they are soon to experience heavy buying interest. Regardless of a money manager's focus, the Valuentum process covers the bases.We liken stock selection to a modern-day beauty contest. In order to pick the winner of a beauty contest, one must know the preferences of the judges of a beauty contest. The contestant that is liked by the most judges will win, and in a similar respect, the stock that is liked by the most money managers will win. We may have our own views on which companies we like or which contestant we like, but it doesn't matter much if the money managers or judges disagree. That's why we focus on the DCF -- that's why we focus on relative value -- and that's why we use technical and momentum indicators. We think a comprehensive and systematic analysis applied across a coverage universe is the key to outperformance. We are tuned into what drives stocks higher and lower. Some investors know no other way to invest than the Valuentum process. They call this way of thinking common sense.At the methodology's core, if a company is undervalued both on a discounted cash flow basis and on a relative valuation basis, and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Adobe Systems posts a Valuentum Buying Index score of 3, reflecting our ""fairly valued"" DCF assessment of the firm, its unattractive relative valuation versus peers, and bearish technicals. Though it doesn't score great on the Valuentum Buying Index, which focuses on valuation and timeliness, the score doesn't mean that Adobe isn't a fantastic company from a fundamental basis. Let's dig into its report to see what we mean.Adobe Systems' Investment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsBusiness QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Adobe Systems' 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 201.6%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.6%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead, based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Adobe Systems' free cash flow margin has averaged about 34.3% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Adobe Systems, cash flow from operations decreased about 52% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 10% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Adobe Systems shares are worth between $51-$77 each. The estimated fair value of $64 per share represents the midpoint of the fair value range. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's LOW ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 13% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 2.2%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 28.1%, which is above Adobe Systems' trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 5.6% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Adobe Systems, we use a 10.6% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Our discounted cash flow process allows us to arrive at an absolute view of the firm's intrinsic value. However, we also understand the critical importance of assessing firms on a relative value basis versus both their industry and peers. Many institutional money-managers -- those that drive stock prices -- pay attention to a company's price-to-earnings ratio and price-earning-to-growth ratio in making buy/sell decisions. With this in mind, we have included a forward-looking relative value assessment in our process to further augment our rigorous discounted cash-flow process. If a company is undervalued on both a price-to-earnings ratio and a price-earnings-to-growth ratio versus industry peers, we would consider the firm to be attractive from a relative value standpoint. We understand the critical importance of assessing firms on a relative value basis, versus both their industry and peers.

If a company is undervalued on both a price-to-earnings ratio and a price-earnings-to-growth ratio versus industry peers, we would consider the firm to be attractive from a relative value standpoint. For relative valuation purposes, we compare Adobe Systems to peers Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). The latter is one of our very favorite ideas.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $64 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets, as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety, or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Adobe Systems. We think the firm is attractive below $51 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $77 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Adobe Systems' fair value at this point in time to be about $64 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Adobe Systems' expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $87 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $64 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsIn the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of the Valuentum Buying Index has stacked up per underlying score as it relates to firms in the Best Ideas portfolio.

In the recently reported results, Adobe has demonstrated how to successfully migrate from a software sales model to a cloud-based subscription service model.Adobe’s FinancialsAdobe’s first quarter revenues fell 4% over the year to $1 billion, ahead of the market’s projections of $0.97 billion. EPS of $0.16 was significantly ahead of the Street’s estimated $0.04 per share.Adobe’s revenue from products fell 30% over the year to contribute to 47.1% of the quarter’s revenues. Subscription revenues grew 89% to bring in 42.4%, while Services & Support fell 2.5% over the year.By segment, Digital Media Systems grew 1.6% over the quarter to $641 million as the Creative Cloud subscriptions continued to grow. The Digital Marketing segment brought in 31.3% of the quarter’s revenues as their Digital Marketing Suite saw revenues climb 24% over the year to $267 million. Mobile transactions were a big driver in the segment and grew to 36% from 33% a quarter ago. Adobe’s Print and Publishing revenues came in at $45 million for the quarter.For the current quarter, Adobe expects to earn revenues of $1.00 billion-$1.05 billion with an EPS of $0.26-$0.32. The market was looking for revenues of $0.99 billion and EPS of $0.25. Adobe expects to end the year with revenues of $4.06 billion and EPS of $1.10. The Street was modeling revenues of $4.07 billion and EPS of $1.12.Adobe’s Subscription Services GrowAdobe’s initial move to switch to a subscription-based model had irked their customers. But it appears that the shift has now been accepted. Adobe plans to continue to push their customers to a subscription-based model by releasing product upgrades only for these cloud-based services. Their Creative Suite products were last updated in 2012 and since then, they have been deploying all upgrade related efforts on the Creative Cloud offering instead. In the recently ended quarter, Adobe added 405,000 subscribers to their Creative Cloud, ending the quarter with 1.8 million paid subscriptions. In addition to that, nearly 96% of their subscribers are on annual plans and more than 70% have subscribed to the entire Suite instead of individual applications. Adobe hopes to be able to convince the remaining population to sign up for their subscriptions after the next release.Adobe Diversifying into HardwareIn a surprising move though, Adobe is also looking at creating hardware. Later this year, Adobe is expected to release a digital pen and ruler set designed for iOS devices. The products, code-named Mighty and Napoleon, respectively, will work together with an iPad App that they are also developing and will help architects and design engineers with the process of drafting. The app and the hardware put together are expected to bring to the digital world the drafting tools most needed by designers. Adobe has yet to announce the timeline and price range of these products.Their stock is trading at $67.63 with a market capitalization of $33.6 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $71.11 late last month."

Knowing how likely a stock's price will move following an earnings report can help you determine the best action to take (long or short). In other words, we analyze what happens when the company beats or misses the whisper number expectation.The table below indicates the average post earnings price movement within a one and thirty trading day timeframe:The strongest price movement of +3.2% comes within thirty trading days when the company reports earnings that beat the whisper number, and -3.7% within five trading days when the company reports earnings that miss the whisper number. While the strongest price move is as expected, the overall average price move is 'positive' (beat the whisper number and see strength, miss and see strength) when the company reports earnings.The table below indicates the most recent earnings reports and short-term price reaction:The company has reported earnings ahead of the whisper number in two of the past three quarters with a whisper number. In the comparable quarter last year, the company reported earnings two cents ahead of the whisper number. Following that report, the stock realized a 1.7% loss in five trading days. Last quarter, the company did not have a whisper number.

The market reacted positively to the results as the company delivered $1.68 billion in revenue, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.37, both exceeding the high end of its targeted ranges. The company once again reported faster-than-expected adoption of subscription licenses for its Creative Cloud (NYSE:CC) business, as more of its clients chose annual subscription plans. The company reported over 2.3 million paid subscribers for the CC services, a sizable increase of 464,000 over the previous quarter. This generated nearly $1.2 billion in Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) in the quarter. The company also announced that it is now solely focusing on licensing CC, and Q2 marked the end of sales of the perpetual Creative Suite 6 license. Adobe also witnessed significant growth in its marketing cloud initiatives during the quarter, as revenues grew by 23% year over year to $282.9 million. However, its LiveCycle software and print and publishing businesses (all relatively small) declined by 10% and 14%, respectively. We examine some of Adobe’s key drivers below and its outlook for 2014.Outlook For Q3 FY14 And BeyondAdobe has guided for revenues of $975 million to $1.25 billion for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. It indicated GAAP EPS would be in the range of $0.02 to $0.8, and non-GAAP EPS between $0.22 and $0.28.Due to excellent adoption of cloud services, Adobe now expects to have nearly 3.3 million paid CC individual and team subscriptions by the end of fiscal 2014. According to our calculations, this means it will need to add over 38,100 paid users per week in the second half of FY2014, 80% more than the 2013 weekly subscription rate of 21,000. The company has also disclosed that it expects to end the year with over $2.5 billion of digital media revenue at a growth rate of 20% year-over-year. Furthermore, Adobe expects revenues from its digital marketing cloud to grow by 25% in 2014. However, it expects the LiveCycle and Connect business to decline further, while the print and publishing business is expected to remain flat in 2014.Strong Subscription Buoys Creative Cloud DivisionAccording to our estimates, the Creative Cloud division is the biggest of Adobe’s operating segments and makes up approximately 55% of its value. During the quarter, the company added 464,000 new subscribers and 97% of the creative cloud subscribers have signed up for annual contracts. Additionally, the growth in licensing came from enterprise term licensing agreements (ETLA), which usually have a tenure of three years. This indicates that CC will continue to drive revenue over the next couple of years. The revenue from CC increased by over 21% sequentially to $1.2 billion in ARR (resolved above) and the subscriber base grew to 2.308 million. The company added 35,700 new subscribers per week in Q2. Considering the pace of CC adoption, we now expect the company to add over 3.3 million CC subscribers by the end of 2014.Strong Adoption of Marketing Platform Boosts RevenuesAdobe’s cloud marketing division is the second biggest division and makes up 21% of its value. Over the past few years, Adobe has built a comprehensive digital marketing platform that addresses most of the needs in digital marketing. Adobe continued to witness strong growth in its marketing cloud services and revenues grew by 23% year-over-year to $283 million. Additionally, the revenue run rate exceeded $1 billion in annual revenue. We expect that as big data analytics, mobility, social media and cloud computing gain more traction across industries, this division will report incremental growth in revenues, as it has a portfolio of analytical tools that deal with marketing on social media and mobile devices. Adobe expects new bookings to grow at a 30% CAGR, and revenues to grow at a 20% CAGR by 2016. While this division contributed 20% to Adobe’s total revenues in 2013, we expect it to increase to 24% by 2020.Adoption of EchoSign and Document Cloud Services Buoys Revenues At Acrobat Family DivisionAdobe Acrobat family is the third largest division at Adobe and makes up 11% of its value. In the past few quarters, revenues from this division have been on a decline, primarily due to launch of document cloud services that have subscription fee spread over the period of usage. However, due to strong adoption of online document services, EchoSign (an electronic content management system) and growth in Enterprise Term Licensing Agreements (ETLAs) for Acrobat, the company witnessed 14% growth in Acrobat ARR. Total document services subscriptions spanning EchoSign, Create PDF Online and related services grew to 1.9 million at the end of Q2. We expect document services’ ARR to drive revenue growth in the Acrobat family division in the future.We are in the process of updating our Adobe model.

New user growth is supported by their cloud subscription service and digital marketing platform. Even moves into hardware sound exciting. Over the last four quarters, the stock price reaction to the earnings releases suggests traders are focused more on these underlying measures and guidance rather than headline numbers.

2093983,23625,2014-03-17T21:32:54-04:00,,"Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings after the market closes on Tuesday, March 18th. Adobe is an American multinational software company known for its multimedia and creative software products. Adobe’s earnings have stalled over the past year as the company has not posted year-over-year earnings growth in any of the past 5 quarters. However, analysts from UBS, Jefferies, and Susquehanna have all issued bullish price targets on Adobe ahead of the company’s FQ1 earnings release. This quarter, Wall Street is estimating that Adobe’s sales will fall nearly 2% compared to FQ1 last year. On the positive side, Creative Cloud subscriber sales are expected to continually increase and hit a tipping point sometime in mid-2014, which is when professional analysts are expecting Adobe to resume year-over-year revenue growth. Here’s what investors are expecting from Adobe on Tuesday.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.(Click Here to see Estimates and Interactive Features for Adobe)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Adobe to report 25c EPS and $970.93M revenue, while the current Estimize.com consensus from 14 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 26c EPS and $927.29M in revenue. This quarter, the buy-side as represented by the Estimize.com community is expecting Adobe to beat the Wall Street consensus on both EPS and revenue by a small margin.Over the past 4 quarters, the consensus from Estimize.com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Adobe’s EPS and revenue 4 and 3 times, respectively. By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students, and non-professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69.5% of the time, but more importantly, it does a better job of representing the market’s actual expectations. It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus.The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case, we are seeing a smaller than usual difference between the 2 groups’ expectations.The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize.com platform range from 25c to 27c EPS and from $960.93M to $974.93M in revenues. This quarter, we’re seeing a narrower than usual distribution of estimates on Adobe.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A narrower distribution of estimates signaling more agreement in the market, which could mean less volatility post earnings. Over the past 4 months, the Wall Street EPS consensus fell from 33c to 25c, while the Estimize consensus inched higher from 25c to 26c. Meanwhile, the Wall Street revenue forecast dropped from $1.012B to $970.93M, while the Estimize forecast increased late in the period from $968.64M to $972.29M. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and rising Estimize analyst revisions at the end of the quarter are often a bullish indicator.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is TheEmulator23, who projects 26c EPS and $973.23M in revenue. In the Winter 2014 season, TheEmulator23 is rated as the 11th best analyst and is ranked 22nd overall among over 3,950 contributing analysts. This season, TheEmulator23 has been more accurate than the Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 61% and 55% of the time, respectively. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research, which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. In this case, TheEmulator23 is making a bullish call expecting Adobe to report in-line with the Estimize community’s expectations on EPS while beating forecasts on revenue.This quarter, contributing analysts on the Estimize.com platform are expecting Adobe to beat Wall Street’s expectations on both the top and bottom line by a thin margin. Adobe hasn’t reported year-over-year EPS or revenue growth in any of the past 5 quarters. While Adobe is not expected to report yoy growth this quarter either, analysts believe by mid-2014 Adobe’s fundamentals should be moving in the right direction again.Disclosure: None"

Consolidation over the last month has been mainly confined to $67-$69. February saw a sharp move up from $60, so that spike could be given back on negative news. Upside potential after so many long, dull years gives increased legitimacy to any move above $69. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryAdobe's new user growth and moves into new areas that lack of credible alternatives have excited analysts. New user growth has been boosted by its cloud subscription service and digital marketing platform. Even moves into hardware sound exciting. Reduced expectations for earnings suggest the company would provide an upside surprise by reporting on the high side of company guidance, or around $0.28. The real surprise would be a less-than-expected revenue decline. Analyst expectations go as high as $986 mln, and the company's range is up to $1 bln. The stock price is currently rising on excitement around new business and a long-term technical breakout.DISCLAIMER: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

2087233,23479,2014-03-13T14:49:52-04:00,,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is set to announce its Q1 2014 earnings on March 17. In 2013, even as its cloud subscription services gained traction, its revenues and profits fell due to the shift in focus from a perpetual licensing model to subscription service licensing. The company reported 7.9% decline in revenues to $4.05 billion and 65% decline in net income to $289.98 million for the fiscal year ended November 30th, 2013. In this earnings announcement, we expect the growth trend in cloud adoption to continue, which will drive revenues for Creative cloud and Acrobat family divisions. Furthermore, we expect Adobe’s marketing cloud division to report yet another quarter of growth, buoyed by adoption of its marketing platform. However, we expect the revenues from LiveCycle and Connect business to decline, and the Print and Publishing business to remain flat during the quarter.Outlook For Q1FY14 And BeyondAdobe has guided for revenues of $950 million to $1 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. They indicated GAAP EPS would be in the range of $0.02 to $0.08, and non-GAAP EPS to be between $0.22 and $0.38.Adobe expects to have nearly 3 million paid Creative Cloud (NYSE:CC) individual and team subscriptions by the end of fiscal 2014. According to our calculations, this means it will need to add over 30,000 paid users per week in 2014, 40% more than the 2013 weekly subscription rate of 21,000. This would give the company total annual recurring revenue of approximately $1.6 billion from CC. The company has also disclosed that it expects to end the year with over $2.5 billion of Digital Media revenue at a growth rate of 20% year over year. Furthermore, Adobe expects revenues from its digital marketing cloud to grow by 20% year over year. However, it expects the LiveCycle and Connect business to decline further, while the Print and Publishing business is expected to remain flat in 2014.Growth In Cloud Services To ContinueAccording to our estimates, the Creative Cloud division is the biggest of Adobe’s operating segments and makes up approximately 55% of its value. While this segment generated only $480 million in revenues in 2013, we expect the company to report $1.17 billion in revenues for 2014, which roughly translates into annual recurring revenues of approximately $1.65 billion.Over the past year, Adobe’s cloud subscription service has witnessed robust growth as clients have increasingly adopted these services to drive collaborative development efforts across their companies. While we expect that the share of revenue from Creative Cloud (CC) will continue to grow in Q1 2014, the adoption of CC will continue to negatively impact the revenues and profitability as subscription service use is generally spread over the period of the software’s use. Adobe reported that it has over 12.8 million point and suite software licenses, and we estimate that the company is well underway to add 3 million subscribers in 2014. Therefore, we believe that the company will continue to report traction for its cloud services in this earnings announcement.Revenues From Marketing Cloud To GrowAdobe’s cloud marketing division is the second biggest division and makes up 21% of its value. Over the past few years, Adobe has built a comprehensive digital marketing platform that addresses most of the needs in digital marketing. This build up started in 2009 with the acquisition of Ominiture. Since then, the company has scaled up the functionality and product offering of its marketing platform through organic and inorganic growth. We believe that this platform provides a cost effective digital marketing solution for companies that can manage marketing campaigns across different channels and devices.Adobe is aiming to increase its revenues from cloud based marketing solutions by expanding in new geographies and verticals. As Adobe continues to develop its marketing solutions capabilities, we expect this division to emerge as an important driver for revenue growth. In this earnings announcement, we expect the company to report growth in revenues from new geographies. Additionally, since many of Adobe’s digital marketing solutions cater to the growing big data analytics, mobility and social media industries, we expect the company to post incremental revenues across these industries. Currently, we project revenues from its digital marketing division to reach $3 billion by 2020.Revenues To Decline At Acrobat Family DivisionAdobe Acrobat family is the third largest division at Adobe and makes up 11% of its value. In the past few quarters, revenues from this division have been on a decline, primarily due to launch of document cloud services that have subscription fee spread over the period of usage. The company has amassed over 1.6 million subscribers for document cloud service. We expect this trend to continue in Q1, and forecast the subscriber base to grow to 2.2 million in 2014. Additionally, we continue to closely monitor the growth in Enterprise Term Licensing Agreements (ETLAs) that are instrumental in bringing new business to this division.We currently have a $51 price estimate for Adobe, which is around 25% below the current market price.Disclosure: No positions"
1936031,23479,2014-01-09T07:06:00-05:00,,"Quick TakeWe have upgraded our price estimate for Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) from $41.12 to $50.78, based on the strong adoption of its cloud offering across its Creative, Marketing and Acrobat divisions. In our model update, we have introduced two new segments, namely the Creative Cloud and Acrobat Cloud. We expect that the growth momentum for its cloud offering will continue to drive the company’s revenues in the near future. Furthermore, we have also increased the profit margin estimates as cloud delivery of software entails lower costs. Despite the price revision, our stock price estimate is 15% below the current market price. In this article, we will discuss the drivers for our new price estimate.Drivers For Price RevisionCreative Cloud To Drive GrowthSubscription At Creative Cloud To Grow: According to our estimate, the Creative Cloud (CC) division is the biggest of Adobe’s operating segment and makes up approximately 55% of the company’s value. Adobe launched creative cloud services during Q4 2012. Furthermore, in May this year, the company moved away from Creative Suite (CS) entirely to focus its efforts on developing Creative Cloud (CC). These moves have resulted in robust adoption of CC subscription. While the company has added 1.4 million subscribers to its CC services in 2013, we expect rapid adoption of this service to continue in the near term. We estimate that the company is well underway to add 3 million subscribers in 2014, and on track to add 9.3 million subscribers by the end of our forecast period. This figure represent 70% of the current 12.8 million point and suite licensees, and 85% of the projected trial users of CC. However, if subscription were to grow at a slower rate to 7.5 million, our stock price estimate can decline by 15%.Average Revenue Per Subscriber To Grow: Average revenue per subscriber (ARPS) for the company consists of a blend of subscribers that have enrolled to different levels of cloud services. While access to the complete Creative Cloud suite costs $74.99 per month, access to standalone Photoshop is priced at $9.99 per month. We estimate that the blended ARPS for the company was $27 in 2013. The recent trend in subscriptions indicates that users are subscribing to the annual full version of Creative Cloud. The company has also reported good growth in its enterprise term licensing agreement (ETLA), which have tenure of three year. This leads us to believe that the ARPS will increase in the coming years as it converges to the sticker price of $74.99. We estimate that the ARPS will grow to $51 by the end of our forecast period. However, if ARPS were to grow at a slower rate to $40 per month, our stock price estimate can decline by 10%. Adobe Marketing CloudRevenues From Marketing Cloud To Grow: Adobe’s cloud marketing division is the second biggest division and makes up 20% of its value. Over the past few years, Adobe has built a comprehensive digital marketing platform that addresses most of the needs in digital marketing. This build up started in 2009 with the acquisition of Ominiture. Since then, the company has scaled up the functionality and product offering of its marketing platform through organic and inorganic growth. For example, the company recently acquired Neolane to boost its market share in digital marketing. [1] As a result, Adobe’s digital marketing platform currently leads the race to become the enterprise digital marketing platform provider of choice for professional marketers. [2]We believe that this platform provides a cost effective digital marketing solution for companies that can manage marketing campaigns across different channels and devices. Adobe is aiming to increase its revenues from cloud based marketing solutions by expanding in new geographies and verticals. Currently, we project revenues from its digital marketing division to reach $3 billion by the end of our forecast period. However, if the revenues grew to $4 billion by the end of our forecast period there can be 10% upside to our price estimate.Acrobat Family DivisionAcrobat Family Revenues To Recover: Acrobat family is the third largest division, and makes up 10% of Adobe’s estimated value. In the past few quarters, revenues from this division have been on a decline, primarily due to launch of document cloud services that have subscription fee spread over the period of usage. The company has amassed over 1.6 million subscribers for document cloud service. We expect this trend to continue, and forecast the subscriber base to grow to 8 million by the end of our forecast period. Furthermore as this service gains momentum, we expect the ARPS to increase from $5.91 to $10 by the end of our forecast period. However, if subscriber base were to grow at a slow rate to 3.5 million, and ARPS were to remain flat there can be a 5% downside to our price estimate.Transition To Cloud Services To Negatively Impact Smaller Divisions Smaller divisions of Adobe, which include Adobe packaged software, LiveCyle software and Print & Publishing, makeup 6% of its estimated value. The adoption of Creative Cloud will negatively impact Adobe’s packaged software, while up-selling to Adobe marketing cloud will cause LiveCyle & Connect pro revenues. We expect revenues from these divisions to decline in the future. We estimate that average selling price of packaged software and LiveCycle software to decline in the future to $200 and$ 85,200, respectively. We also expect the number of licenses sold for both the divisions to decline. Even if these metrics were to improve for both the division, it will have little impact on our stock price valuation, since contribution from these divisions is small.We have revised our stock price estimate to $50.78.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
2066303,23469,2014-03-04T11:56:56-05:00,,"Today, we will discuss our 2014 model for Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE). In our previous article, Sell Adobe: Potential 25% Downside, written in June 2013, we put a sell rating on the stock. Our opinion, at the time, was that the company's cloud push was not strong, margins would compress, and the company was overvalued. Yet, the company outperformed our expectations, and it has kept moving higher.We have adjusted our model to a Hold with a $71 price target. The main catalyst we focused on for our article is its Creative Cloud, along with the secondary catalyst of EchoSign project. We will investigate these catalysts, project the financials for these projects, and do our long-term price analysis for the company. Yet, we still are wondering about the company's operating margin potential with these new plans as they have dropped off significantly.Business OverviewAdobe has three business segments: Digital Media, Digital Marketing and Print and Publishing. In 2013, Digital Media reached $2625.9 million in revenue, which accounts for 65% of the total revenue. Digital Marketing ranked second with $1228.8 million revenue, 30% of total revenue. The last one is print and publishing segment, which is around $200.5 million, 5% of the total portfolio.Industry TrendsThe application software industry is one of the fastest growing sectors in the world economy with the continued growth of technology. The main portion of the market is software applications, which account for around 50% of the total market share. The rest of the market share belongs to development tools and infrastructure software, such as operating system, security software or network management system.Application software is undergoing a major transition due to the growth of mobile as well as cloud software. The traditional way of developing products in one geographic area and distribute to resellers or independent vendors has been changed. With the help of the recent tech revolution, software can work and be accessed more efficiently through mobile, internet, and cloud functions.Luckily, Adobe is on the bus for this transformation. Adobe has developed several web-based products, such as Creative Cloud or EchoSign system, which have been the major driving force of the company's recent growth. The company is pushing what used to be traditional products through the channels of cloud and the Internet. With that shift, the company has also focused more on subscriptions and recurring payments over one-time payments that could mean larger revenue gains for each product. Yet, it also means competition will stiffen as access to products is easier than ever before.Main CatalystWe believe that the main catalyst for ADBE the company and stock moving forward has to be the growth and financial potential for the company's Creative Cloud. The product is a cloud-based service that allow members to get access into all the latest version of Adobe's creative desktop apps like Photoshop, Illustrator, and so on. The new features will be updated automatically whenever it's possible. Because it's a cloud-based service, customers will be able to build and publish apps, websites or news on any device.Creative Cloud has strong growth potential moving forward. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2013, Adobe targeted its Creative Cloud members to be 1.25 million. The actual number came in at 1.4 million, positively surprising analysts and investors. One of the biggest benefits that Creative Cloud members can have is the constant update or new features of their apps, products and service. The Cloud is only $50/month, which is a much more attractive number than the $1300 upfront cost of the same products. Yet, in 26 months, the cost is no longer beneficial. The plus - the new features and software mean that upgrading is not needed.In some ways, the change was a forced change due to the transition of the industry. Yet, at the same time, the company can likely create a much larger user base. The lower cost structure is enticing to individuals, and it will get more users into the product and make more long-term clients.The development of Creative Cloud is not just for individuals, but it also covers larger teams and enterprise. In the latest quarter, the company commented:Due to the strong demand from the corporate side customers, Creative Cloud had 402K growth of subscribers in the Q4, compared to 331K growth in the third quarter. The growth of subscribers has been part of the reason for such strong growth for the company. This has been the main focus of investors.""Investors are giving Adobe's management team credit for its progress despite the light profit to this point, and will likely continue to do so, as long as the number of new cloud subscribers continue to outpace expectations,"" said Josh Olson, Edward Jones' technology analyst.The question, though, for Adobe moving forward is what kind of revenue can they make, and can they return the type of margins the company used to operate within the low-30% area. The company since has seen a huge drop off to the mid-teens. The company has had to increase R&D as well as SG&A to invest in this major change, and while revenue has grown, margins have shrunk. We continue to believe that there is a ton of potential for Creative Cloud, but the company will definitely struggle to create strong margins off the name for the time being. We will discuss more of our projections in the price target analysis.Secondary CatalystWe believe that Adobe's secondary catalyst is the EchoSign project. EchoSign is an e-signature and enterprise document management system. Some of the features that EchoSign has include document signing, tracking and filing. Like we noted in Industry Trends, the movement of the market is to the web, cloud, and mobile. Every common everyday task is being digitized, and one of the common tasks still being pushed into the web is signing papers. A very typical task, but until now, it has had a limited scope in the tech revolution.According to Forrester Research, most of e-signature transactions will happen via mobile device by 2020. Another industry report conducted by Gartner, predicts that the e-signature market is ""poised to take off."" E-signing uses the touch of the finger on the digital screen to allow clients, customers, businesses, etc. to sign receipts, documents, and more with the swipe of the finger.Users can process legal transactions through EchoSign in three simple steps: send documents, receive and sign, file documents. Firstly, users can send the documents they want to transact through email, and once recipients receive the document, read it and sign, documents will be filed and saved in users' account automatically for future need.With the contribution of EchoSign, the company expects its Document Service division to see flat growth overall, putting the potential revenue around $700M for 2014. Beyond 2014, though, we could start to see this be a much larger contributor. For now, though, the product is more speculative and unknown.Pricing/ValuationRevenueIn order to gain a right sense of how ADBE's overall revenue will go, let's break down the revenue into three segments and take a close look at each of them.For the digital media segment, the company expected its 2014 revenue to be $2.5 billion. And its year-over year growth rate of 20% through 2014 to 2016. From 2017 to 2018, we expect its growth to be lower, falling back to 5-10%.The Digital Marketing segment has two components: Adobe Marketing Cloud and LiveCycle and Connect businesses. Its 2013 Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue was around $1 billion, with expected growth of 20% in 2014. After that, we expect its revenue growth to reach 25% year-over-year. While the LiveCycle and Connect component is expected to be decline by 25% year-over-year.We expect the Print and Publishing segment to be flat around $210 million year-over-year. Overall, we project 2014 revenue at $4.1B followed by $5B in 2015. From there, we are expecting 8-10% CAGR.Operating MarginWe expect that the company's operating margin is going to bounce back, but the question is when and how high? Even though the company expected its operating margin to bounce back to mid-30s in 2016, there is still a question mark due to the heavy investment of product development and its transformation into a web-based software company.So this time, we want to split our analysis into three cases scenarios based on different forecasts of operating margins. As we know, the company expected its operating margin to be around mid-30s, so our best-case scenario is that ADBE do reach its margin goal in 2016, and will be flat after that. Our worst-case scenario is that ADBE will maintain its low margin around 10%, and start to bounce back in 2016, reaching 25% in 2018. The middle case scenario is what we believe will most likely happen: operating will keep being at a low level around 10%, and start to bounce back in 2015. But it doesn't reach the 35% goal in year 2016 but in year 2018.Based on the above assumptions, we give three operating margin scenarios:CapexADBE doesn't have big project expected in the next several years that will require a large expenditures. By looking at its historical data, its capex as percentage of revenue is very stable. We would forecast its capex as percentage of revenue to be continue stable around 4.86%, which is its past 5 year historical average.TaxIn Q4, Adobe's effective tax rate was 26%, and its non-GAAP rate was 21%. The company is targeting Q1 tax rate the same as Q4. We use the effective rate in our model. The company should maintain average levels here.Target PriceBased on the three operating margin scenarios, we give three different target prices. The best-case scenario is $73.32, the worst-case scenario price is $49.09 and the middle-case scenario is what we believe will most like happen. That number comes in at $70.61.Risk/VarianceThe risk that Adobe has is the security of customers' information. In late 2013, Adobe revealed that the company's information system was hacked, with 2.9 million of customers' sensitive information exposed. Customers' credit card numbers was accessed after the attack, even though the card information was encrypted later on. We believe this is a very serious problem, because security will greatly affect company's reputation and customers' confidence to use Adobe's system. Further, margins continue to be a major question mark. ADBE is being more valued like a spec name that has its focus on client growth rather than actual results. When does the company start to perform? If they don't start to show better margins, investors will start to leave the name, so that remains a major risk.ConclusionIn conclusion, we think that Adobe made the necessary shift to the cloud that will likely pay off in the long run, but the question is can the company improve margins. Due to this uncertainty, we can only forecast a Hold rating with a $70 price tag. We will be more interested in shares below $55.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

This is best done by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries. What follows is a specific look at how Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.ADBE data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 3/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - 11/29/2013Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamConclusion: Adobe Systems is not suitable for the Defensive Investor due to the lack of a dividend payment, insufficient earnings growth over the 10-year period and high PEmg and PB ratios. The Enterprising Investor is not quite as picky, though, and the company passes all of the requirements for the investor type other than the dividend payment. As a result, Enterprising Investors following the ModernGraham approach based on Benjamin Graham's methods should feel comfortable proceeding with further research, including a review of ModernGraham's valuation of Microsoft and a review of 5 Undervalued Companies for the Enterprising Investor. From a valuation standpoint, the company does not appear to be a good value at this time. The company's EPSmg (normalized earnings) have only grown from $1.10 in 2009 to $1.20 for 2013, a very low level of growth that does not support the market's implied estimate of 24.01% earnings growth. Accordingly, the ModernGraham valuation model returns an estimate of intrinsic value that falls well below the market price.Disclaimer: The author did not hold a position in Adobe Systems Inc.

1901531,20521,2013-12-16T17:05:01-05:00,,"In a survey of 253 marketers for U.S.-based companies earning more than $500 million in annual revenues, Gartner found that digital marketing budgets accounted for 2.5% of their revenues. These marketers were looking to increase their digital marketing budgets for this year to 9% of revenues. Digital publishing company Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is focusing on this digital marketing growth.Adobe’s FinancialsAdobe’s Q4 revenues fell 10% over the year to $1.04 billion, ahead of the market’s projections of $1.03 billion. EPS of $0.32 was in line with the market’s projected earnings for the quarter.Adobe’s subscription-based revenue grew 85% to $359.7 million as they added 402,000 paid creative cloud subscriptions over the quarter to 1.4 million. Product sales fell 33% to $567.2 million.The company ended the year with revenues of $4.06 billion compared with $4.40 billion a year ago. EPS of $0.56 also fell from $1.66 a year ago.For the current quarter, Adobe expects to earn revenues of $0.95-$1.00 billion with an EPS of $0.22-$0.28.

For fiscal 2015, Adobe projected earnings of $2.00-$3.00 per share compared with analyst forecasts of $2.30-$3.48 per share.Adobe’s Marketing Offerings GrowAdobe continued its digital marketing expansion through acquisitions. It recently announced the acquisition of Atlanta-based Search Discovery’s tag management software business, Satellite. Satellite’s tag management software enables organizations to track and manage their website thus helping marketers to install third-party software to personalize websites, analyze traffic and take steps needed to improve sales and traffic. Through the acquisition, Adobe will be able to extend the tag management solution to its suite of marketing software including analytics and content management systems. Analysts believe that the addition of Satellite is also helping Adobe expand their marketing services offerings. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.Recently, Adobe also released additional capabilities for Adobe Analytics to expand the Adobe Marketing Cloud’s offerings. The upgrades will help marketers and data analysts to better understand data and thus take measures to improve business results. The upgrades include features like the predictive analytics which helps marketers and data analysts to uncover critical insights by detection of anomalies, advanced real-time reporting to help marketers visualize data at a granular level on a real-time basis, Data Visualization Upgrades that enables marketers to filter streams of data to isolate key metrics and mobile analytics to analyze mobile device–based marketing offerings.Overall, the market is pleased with Adobe’s continued adoption of the cloud. It is always tricky to go from a licensed revenue business model to a subscription-based cloud services model. Adobe is doing a reasonable job with this transition. The stock is trading near 52-week high levels of $60.89, with a market capitalization of $30.55 billion."
1903561,23479,2013-12-17T15:18:43-05:00,,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) posted its Q3 earnings on September 17, and the market reacted positively to the results as the stock traded 8% higher in after market hours. With the release of fourth-quarter results yesterday, the company once again reported faster-than-expected adoption of subscription licenses for its Creative Cloud (CC) business, as more of its clients chose enterprise term licensing agreements (ETLA). (Fiscal years end with November.) The company reported over 1.4 million paid subscribers for the CC services, a sizable increase of 402 thousand over the prior quarter. This generated $768 million annualized recurring revenue (ARR) in the quarter, nearly 75% of total revenues. Adobe also saw significant growth in its marketing cloud initiatives. In Q4, digital marketing revenues grew by 20% year over year to $365 million. However, its LiveCycle software, document services and print and publishing businesses (all relatively small) declined by 30%, 5% and 11% respectively.The company reported diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $0.13 on a GAAP-basis and $0.32 on a non-GAAP basis. Due to a change in its licensing model from perpetual to subscription, the company reported 10% year-over-year decline in revenues to $1.04 billion, and 60% year-over-year decline in net income to $65 million. This, however, is transient as the company encourages users to adopt the Creative Cloud. Additionally, the unearned revenue grew to $775.54 million due to change in the licensing policy. We examine some of Adobe’s key drivers below and its outlook for 2014. [1]Outlook For Q1FY14 And BeyondAdobe has guided for revenues of $950 million to $1 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2014. They indicated GAAP EPS would be in the range of $0.02 to $0.08, and non-GAAP EPS between $0.22 to $0.38.Adobe expects to have nearly 3 million paid CC individual and team subscriptions by the end of fiscal 2014. According to our calculations, this means it will need to add over 30,000 paid users per week in 2014, 40% more than the 2013 weekly subscription rate of 21,000. This would give the company total annual recurring revenue of approximately $1.6 billion from CC. The company has also disclosed that it expects to end the year with over $2.5 billion of Digital Media revenue at a growth rate of 20% year over year. Furthermore, Adobe expects revenues from its digital marketing cloud to grow by 20% year over year. However, it expects the LiveCycle and Connect business to decline further, while the Print and Publishing business is expected to remain flat in 2014.Creative Cloud Buoys Creative Software DivisionAccording to our estimates, the Photoshop and Creative Software division is the biggest of Adobe’s operating segments and make up approximately 55% of the company’s value. While this segment generated $630 million in revenues in Q4, it reported $2.62 billion revenues in 2013.The division results were buoyed by the robust adoption of creative cloud subscription. During the quarter, the company added 402,000 new subscribers, up from 331,000 last quarter. Furthermore, 96% of the creative cloud subscribers have signed up for annual contracts, and 76% have subscribed to full creative cloud services. Most of the growth in licensing came from enterprise term licensing agreements, which usually have tenure of three years. This indicates that CC will continue to drive revenue over the next couple of years. The revenue from CC increased by over 40% sequentially to $768 million ARR, and subscriber base grew to 1.439 million. The company added 30,000 new subscriber per week in Q4, which is 10% higher than weekly subscription rate of 27,000 in Q3. However, we expect that this subscription rate to remain flat for 2014, based on the 3 million subscribers that the company expects to have by the end of 2014.Revenues Continue To Shrink At Acrobat Family DivisionAdobe Acrobat family is the second largest division at Adobe and makes up 11% of its value. Acrobat family division reported 5% year-over-year decline in revenues to $198.4 million. The primary reason for this decline was lower sales of point product document services. However, an increase in revenue from Acrobat cloud services stemmed further decline in revenues.During the quarter, company’s online document services surpassed 1.6 million subscriptions. ARR from Acrobat Cloud services grew 30% sequentially to $143 million, primarily due to increase in ETLAs. We expect document services’ ARR to drive revenue growth in the Acrobat family division in the future.Adoption Of Digital Platform Lifts Digital Marketing RevenuesOmniture is Adobe’s third largest division and makes up 10% of its value by our estimates. Adobe acquired Omniture in 2009 and since then has included all of Omniture’s products under its digital marketing cloud division. During the quarter, Adobe witnessed strong growth in its marketing cloud services. In Q4, this division reported a 20% year-over-year increase in revenue to $365 million, and the revenue run rate exceeded $1 billion in annual revenue. We expect that as big data analytics, mobility, social media and cloud computing gain more traction across industries, this division will report incremental growth in revenues as it has a portfolio of analytical tools that deal with marketing on social media and mobile devices. Adobe expects new booking to grow at a 30% CAGR, and revenues to grow at a 20% CAGR by 2016. While this division contributed 12.5% to Adobe’s total revenues in 2012, we expect it to increase to 16% by the end of our forecast period.We are in the process of updating our Adobe model. At present, we have a $41.12 Trefis price estimate for Adobe, which is 30% below its market price.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"

The company does not qualify for the Defensive Investor by not having a strong dividend history, and trading at very high PEmg and PB ratios. The company does pass the requirements for the Enterprising Investor, but disappoints from a valuation perspective. Adobe's EPSmg (normalized earnings) have failed to substantially grow during the recent historical period, and in fact have dropped from $1.24 in 2008 to an estimated $1.22 for 2013.Compared to similar companies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), and especially Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), it is surprising Adobe has not been able to achieve at least some growth. This failure to grow earnings negatively affects the ModernGraham valuation model's results for Adobe, and the company appears to be overvalued at the current time. The market's implied growth rate of 18.35% is in no way supported by the historical data, and Enterprising Investors should be very careful when considering this company for their individual portfolios.Disclosure: The author did not hold a position in Adobe Systems Inc. at the time of publication and had no intention of entering into a position within the next 72 hours."

The American multinational software company known for its Photoshop and Acrobat divisions has recently made the transition from selling its software with a perpetual license to a subscription-based model. By making the switch Adobe is trying to tap into the recurring revenue model that competitors Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SalesForce (NYSE:CRM) have been enjoying for years.Adobe is expected to report FQ4’ 2013 earnings on Thursday, December 12th. The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.(Click to enlarge)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Adobe to report 32c EPS and $1.031B revenue while the current Estimize consensus from Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 32c EPS and $1.028B revenue. The Estimize consensus is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69.5% of the time because it represents unbiased market expectations. By tapping into a wider distribution of over 3,300 contributors including buy side and independent analysts, industry experts, students, and non professionals Estimize is better able to capture the true market outlook. The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case, we’re seeing a smaller differential between the Estimize and Wall Street numbers compared to previous quarters.Over the past four months the Wall Street consensus trend for EPS has fallen from 41c to 32c while the revenue expectations have also dropped from $1.085B to $1.032B. The Estimize EPS consensuses both began and ended the period at 32c. The community’s revenue consensus has increased from a lower than Wall Street starting point of $1.024B to $1.031B. (Click to enlarge)Over the previous 7 quarters, ADBE has beaten the Wall Street consensus for EPS and revenue 5 times each. Over the same time period the software company has beaten the Estimize EPS and revenue consensuses 4 times each.(Click to enlarge)The distribution of estimates published by analysts on Estimize range from 31c to 34c EPS and $1.020B to $1.040B in revenues. We’re seeing a smaller distribution of estimates this quarter for ADBE compared to previous quarters. The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A narrower distribution signaling the potential for less volatility post earnings, a greater vice versa.(Click to enlarge)The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is krampi who projects 32c EPS and $1.030B in revenue. Estimize confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by our deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. krampi who is ranked 252 overall among 3,328 contributing analysts is making a call in-line with the Wall Street and Estimize EPS consensus but he is slightly more bearish on revenue.In agreement with krampi the Estimize community is forecasting an earnings report that is marginally worse than Wall Street expects. The consensus from Estimize is expecting Adobe to report in agreement with Wall Street expectations for EPS but to come up slightly short on revenue."
1903151,39301,2013-12-17T12:55:44-05:00,,"Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) is on track with its transition to cloud services. Subscription based services are nice because they offer recurring revenue. Selling individual software licenses has lost its effectiveness over the past five-years.The transition to the cloud will benefit major software players like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), SAP, and etc. On the downside, the potential from SaaS isn't very well understood, because it generates below average earnings performance over the near term. Given enough time, the subscription revenue should be able to drive meaningful performance on the bottom line. Which is why I think investors will be able to outperform the broader market by investing into Adobe Systems.What is SaaS? What makes the new model revolutionary?In the past, software code was written for specific platforms. Disks would carry data that could only be compatible to a specific product ecosystem like Mac, Windows, or Linux. Linux was primarily used in server applications, so you never really saw a whole lot of Linux boxes.Starting from around 2008 we hit what I sort of like to call the ""device revolution."" Computing could be literally taken anywhere and in any form factor. Pretty soon consumer preference started to change, some wanted to go Android for smart phone, iOS for tablet, and Windows for desktop. We saw this continue to emerge as a trend. Consumers wanted different operating systems for different form factors. At the same time, consumers wanted applications to be seamlessly integrated with all the different devices that were sold by all the different ecosystems.To address this change, technology companies started to move software to the cloud. Hence, we call it software as a service. Sounds pretty rhetorical, but trust me it's a ""revolutionary business model"" because it was the first time the OEMs kind of got together with the software developers and realized that the business model for software would have to transition to something else. So instead, applications are now meant to work across all computers and sold on a subscription that can earn marginally higher profit.By selling software on a subscription and giving consumers access to the software via the internet, software companies can tackle the challenge of keeping consumers up to date on the latest features, monetize them to the hilt, and offer them a seamless software experience across all form factors. This in a nut shell is why the SaaS market is expected to grow at a significant pace.What is Adobe's upside potential?Below is a graphic illustration of the various cloud categories set to explode over the next five years. The forecast is likely to be a little conservative, and while there may be more upside potential than what is illustrated in the below graphic, I haven't come up with a quantitative method that could offer better guidance than what analytics firms currently offer on the subject.Source: GartnerCurrently, cloud application services (NASDAQ:SAAS) is set to grow at a 19.5% CAGR between 2011 and 2016.This seems to be a pretty reasonable growth rate.Source: Adobe SystemsLooking specifically at subscription revenue, the value has increased from $194 million to $359 million year-over-year in the November 29, 2013 quarter. The cloud subscription business has been able to grow by around 85% year-over-year. For the time being, subscription growth did not generate year-over-year revenue growth on a consolidated basis for the full fiscal year. Year end results declined by around $350 million for total revenue, and cost of revenue has gone up year-over-year as well, by an additional $100 million. On a consolidated basis the non-GAAP earnings declined from $2.35 in 2012 to $1.34 in 2013 for the full year.Source: Adobe SystemsI'm going to focus on the non-GAAP earnings of the business. The diluted net income per share figure falls short of representing the true impact from earnings because there are certain technicalities in GAAP that make it difficult for technology business to accurately represent accounting data. Stock based compensation isn't a real expense that affects cash flow (Adobe factors back in stock compensation as a non-expense); as such the same could be said for the amortization of previously acquired patents. The company factors back in the amortization because it doesn't believe that the intangibles should be written off as an expense quite yet as previously acquired license arrangements may have more value than what is being quantified with GAAP accounting.Also since we're already on the discussion of GAAP accounting I want to include some discussion on the subscription aspect of Adobe's business. GAAP does not recognize income until it is earned. The downside with subscriptions is that previous earnings from non-subscription revenues were immediately realized upon the sale of the license whereas subscription revenue has to be gradually realized on the income statement. So as more consumers who have software licenses migrate to subscription based licenses it would take at least a year or two before the net revenue from subscriptions become greater than a software license. Part of the reason subscriptions are popular is that they're an initial loss-leader, as they're priced cheaper than a full license by around two years. But following a two-year period, subscription costs add up to more than the cost of an individual software license that may be updated in three to six year cycles.This is why Adobe System's management has pretty compelling guidance going further out. The guidance was based on non-GAAP earnings. Hence, I discussed the accounting reconciliations for Non-GAAP earnings.Currently, Adobe Systems earns $1.34 in Non-GAAP earnings per share. Adobe' most recent guidance indicates that the company will generate $1.10 EPS (Non-GAAP) for 2014, $2.00 EPS (Non-GAAP) for 2015, and $3.00 EPS (Non-GAAP) for 2016. The compound annual earnings growth between fiscal year 2014 and 2016 is estimated to be around 39.71% (based on corporate guidance).For calendar year 2014, I offer a $76.01 price target at 69.1 P/E (high valuations are likely to persist). My 2015 price target is $89.18 at 44.59 P/E, and my 2016 price target is $133.69 at 44.59 P/E. The stock has 120% upside from its current price of $60.89.ConclusionThe software aspect of the cloud should not be underestimated. Adobe expects significant expansion of bottom line going forward. The same type of variable costing should apply to other companies that are transitioning their software business to the cloud. Adobe's recent earnings report is indicative of further earnings potential for other SaaS players like Microsoft and Salesforce.com.I believe that there's a great risk to reward here with Adobe Systems. It's clearly apparent that the bottom line will expand significantly as subscriptions generate higher margins further out into the future. Adobe Systems is a high growth name still trading at attractive valuations. Therefore, I believe that Adobe System merits a buy from long-term investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1889851,23479,2013-12-10T16:04:22-05:00,,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is set to announce its Q4 2013 earnings on December 12. While the company continues to post excellent growth in its cloud subscription business, its revenues and profits have fallen significantly in the recent quarter due to the shift in focus from a perpetual licensing model to subscription services. In Q3, the company reported 8% y-o-y decline in revenues to $995.1 million, while its net income declined by 60% y-o-y to $83 million. In this earnings announcement, we expect the growth trend in cloud adoption to continue, which will drive revenues for Creative solutions and Acrobat family divisions. However, we expect the revenues from LiveCycle and Connect business to decline, and the Print and Publishing business to remain flat during the quarter.Outlook for Q4 CY13For Q4 CY13, Adobe expects revenue in the $1 billion-$1.05 billion range and non-GAAP earnings per share between 28-34 cents. Additionally, the company has projected that its subscriber base for Creative Cloud services will increase to 1.35 million by the end of this year. According to our calculations, the subscriber base target means that Adobe needs to add over 27,000 paid users per week for Q4 2013, 10% more than its past weekly subscription rate of 24,000. This translates into total annual recurring revenue (NYSE:ARR) of approximately $685 million by the end of fourth quarter. Additionally, we expect the company to report 25% y-o-y growth in its digital media ARR to $875 million, and 20% growth in document services ARR to $115 million in FY 2013. Adobe expects 2013 revenue of $4.05 billion and EPS of $0.56 on a GAAP basis and $1.34 on a non-GAAP basis.Growth In Cloud Services To ContinueAccording to our estimates, the Photoshop and Creative Software division is the biggest of Adobe's operating segments and makes up approximately 55% of the its value. During Q3 2013, this segment generated approximately $637 million in revenues.In the past few quarters, Adobe's cloud subscription service has witnessed robust growth as clients have increasingly adopted these services to drive collaborative development efforts across their companies. While we expect that the share of revenue from Creative Cloud (NYSE:CC) will continue to grow in Q4, the adoption of CC will lower the revenues and profitability as subscription services spread these over the period of the software's use. Adobe has over 12.8 million point and suite software licenses in Q3, and we expect many of these licensees to adopt CC in the coming quarters. Therefore, we believe that the company will continue to report traction for its cloud services in this earnings announcement.Revenues To Decline At Acrobat Family DivisionAdobe Acrobat family is the second largest division at Adobe and makes up 12% of its value. The Acrobat family division reported a 2% y-o-y decline in revenues to $182 million in Q3. We expect this trend to continue in Q4 as its point product document services continue to decline. However, we expect the company to report incremental revenues from Acrobat document cloud services, which will stem the decline in Acrobat family division to some extent. Additionally, we continue to closely monitor the growth in Enterprise Term Licensing Agreements (ETLAs) that are instrumental in bringing new business to this division.Adoption Of Adobe Marketing Solutions in FocusOmniture is Adobe's third largest division and makes up 10% of its value by our estimates. Adobe acquired Omniture in 2011, and since has included all of Omniture's products under its digital marketing cloud division.Adobe is aiming to increase its revenues from cloud based marketing solutions by expanding in new geographies and verticals. As Adobe continues to develop its marketing solutions capabilities, we expect this division to emerge as an important driver for revenue growth. In this earnings announcement, we expect the company to report growth in revenues from new geographies. Additionally, since many of Adobe's digital marketing solutions cater to the growing big data analytics, mobility and social media industries, we expect the company to post incremental revenues across these industries.We currently have a $41.16 price estimate for Adobe, which is around 25% below the current market price."

Mark Garrett and Shantanu Narayen sold shares pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan.SEC Rule 10b5-1 is a regulation enacted by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2000. The SEC states that Rule 10b5-1 was enacted in order to resolve an unsettled issue over the definition of insider trading, which is prohibited by SEC Rule 10b-5. After Rule 10b5-1 was enacted, the SEC staff publicly took the position that canceling a planned trade made under the safe harbor does not constitute insider trading, even if the person was aware of the inside information when canceling the trade. This staff interpretation raises the possibility that executives can exploit this safe harbor by entering into 10b5-1 trading plans before they have inside information while retaining the option to later cancel those plans based on inside information.For example, a CEO of a company could call a broker on January 1 and enter into a plan to sell a particular quantity of shares of his company's stock on March 1, find out terrible news about his company on February 1 that will not become public until April 1, and then go forward with the March 1 sale anyway, saving himself from losing money when the bad news becomes public. Under the terms of Rule 10b5-1(b) this is insider trading because the CEO ""was aware"" of the inside information when he made the trade. But he can assert an affirmative defense under Rule 10b5-1(c), because he planned the trade before he learned the inside information.In general, it is a safer way for an insider to sell shares pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan than without it.Insider selling by calendar monthHere is a table of Adobe's insider-trading activity by calendar month.There have been 9,051,964 shares sold, and there have been 5,000 shares purchased by insiders since January 2013.FinancialsAdobe reported the fiscal 2013 full-year, which ended November 29, financial results on December 12 with the following highlights:OutlookAdobe's guidance is as follows:(Source: Earnings presentation)CompetitionAdobe's competitors include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Avid Technology (NASDAQ:AVID).

1719782,24491,2013-09-30T03:36:02-04:00,,"By RJ TownerSoftware maker Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) announced fiscal third quarter results Tuesday afternoon. Results were a tad shy of expectations on both the top and bottom lines, as revenue declined 8% year-over-year to $995 million and earnings per share slipped 45% year-over-year to $0.32 as the firm moves to a subscription-based business model. Free cash flow remained strong during the third quarter at $169 million, equal to 17% of total revenue.Creative Cloud SuccessImage Source: ADBE Q3 FY13 SlidesThe story of Adobe's third quarter was the continued success of the Creative Cloud product suite. Paid subscriptions surpassed the 1 million mark driving Digital Media 'Annualized Recurring Revenue' (ARR) to $655 million. ARR is a wonderful business model for any company that can implement it, as the associated cash flow stream requires little incremental work beyond the initial investment at the firm. The switch from a licensing model to an annual recurring subscription platform has impacted reported revenue for fiscal year 2013 (explaining the negative year-over-year comparisons), but we expect the move to improve profitability over the long-haul.Marketing Performance Wasn't Too ShabbyIn addition to the Creative Cloud product suite, Adobe's Marketing Cloud achieved robust expansion, with revenue up 28% year-over-year, giving the product a $1 billion annualized run-rate. Adobe's previous glaring weakness, social media, was addressed by the company in July with its acquisition of Neolane. Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen added some color on the acquisition, saying on the conference call:""Neolane integrates online and offline marketing data from across an enterprise, performing robust audience segmentation and delivering marketing messages across channels including web, email, social, mobile, call center, direct mail and point of sale.""Put simply, the product runs the gauntlet of marketing dissemination mediums.Capital AllocationUnlike its larger tech peers such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Adobe doesn't pay a dividend. Still, the firm returned cash to shareholders by repurchasing 7 million shares for $326 million. Since the average price (roughly $46.57) falls within our fair value range, the purchases are value-neutral.As we mentioned earlier, the firm generated $169 million in free cash flow. It also used $600 million to acquire Neolane, putting its current cash balance at a healthy $3.16 billion.GuidanceAdobe provides investors with a useful guidance file (click here). For the fiscal fourth quarter, the company anticipates revenue of $1-$1.05 billion driving non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.28-$0.34. The high-end of both estimates were in-line with consensus expectations.Valuentum's TakeAdobe's Creative Cloud is adding recurring revenue at a fantastic clip, setting the firm up for several profitable years to come. Nevertheless, we think shares look fairly valued at this time, and we think there are better opportunities in the technology space, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft, Intel, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)-all members of our actively managed portfolios.Disclosure: I am long AAPL.

1724242,54812,2013-10-01T18:52:06-04:00,,"Adobe Systems Inc. (NYSE:ADBE), which offers a broad range of software and services (including the renowned Photoshop) used by professionals, released its Q3 earnings after markets closed Tuesday. Its total revenue earnings of $995.1 million missed the consensus estimate of $1.10 billion, and its EPS of $0.32 was below the industry estimate of $0.34. Adobe had expected its EPS to come in between $0.28 and $0.34, below the consensus estimate of $0.41. The company expects Q4 revenue to be in the range of $1.00-$1.05 billion, again below the consensus estimate of $1.08 billion.Share prices fell about 5% following the news, but then recovered - rising 13% - as the market chose to ignore the missed targets and instead focused on Adobe's cloud subscriptions.Adobe Sailing High on the CloudAdobe succeeded in expanding its cloud subscriptions in Q3 by 331,000 Q/Q to 1.03 million, compared to expectations of an expansion in the range of 262,000. This is significant since the decision by Adobe in May 2013 to shift from perpetual licensing to periodical subscriptions was deemed to be highly risky by market experts. A subscription system - under which users purchase time-limited subscriptions of the latest versions of the products - along with a shift to the Cloud, meant that Adobe could now force those customers who wished to stick to its products to update regularly. At the same time, it could bundle in less popular products with the more popular ones.This was highly beneficial for Adobe since, under perpetual licensing, many users who did not want the new features simply did not bother to upgrade. On the other hand, the system resulted in a considerable cost increase for Adobe loyalists and led to a considerable stir among Adobe's customer base. However, after seeing the markets cheer the higher-than-expected rise in Cloud subscriptions, there is a chance that the user complaints may turn out to be nothing more than white noise. Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen appeared to have this in mind when he said, ""We exceeded 1 million subscriptions during Q3, demonstrating that the transition to Creative Cloud is happening sooner than expected.""Insiders Selling Adobe StockMarkets turned a little jittery following news that James E. Daley, an Adobe director, sold 25,000 Adobe shares at $52.70 per share for a total of $1,317,500. This pulled down share prices by 0.74% to $52.31.Adobe's FutureWith the company's stock rising to unbelievable highs, there is a growing belief that Adobe has hit the right note as far as shifting to a different business model is concerned. Many are now hoping that Adobe may become as successful as Salesforce.com (NYSE: CRM), whose stock sells at 8.6 times sales compared to Adobe's stock, which sells at 5.7 times sales. RBC Capital Markets (NYSE: RY) analyst Robert Breza raised his price target to $58 and rates the stock as ""outperform."" Regarding the future prospects of Adobe, he said, ""We continue to like the stock as the transition occurs and look for an eventual flow-through to substantial margin expansion and cash flow generation, which we expect to occur over the next several years.""It should be remembered that competitors may try to use the reservoir of resentment regarding the transition to wean customers off Adobe, although as of now such efforts don't seem to be bearing much fruit. This, along with the high projections from major analysts, indicate that the Adobe rally is likely to continue for the time being, and as such the best options are to ""hold"" the stock if one already has shares, or ""buy"" to some extent.Disclosure: I am long ADBE.

Essentially, we're looking for firms that overlap investment methodologies, thereby revealing the greatest interest by investors (we like firms that fall in the center of the diagram below):If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Adobe Systems posts a VBI score of 6 on our scale, reflecting our ""fairly valued"" DCF assessment of the firm, its neutral relative valuation versus peers, and very bullish technicals. We compare Adobe Systems to peers F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV), Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). In the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of our VBI has stacked up per underlying score:Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Adobe Systems earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 169.3% during the past three years.• Adobe is one of the largest software companies in the world. The firm's flagship offering in its digital media business is Adobe Creative Cloud, which allows customers to download the latest version of Adobe Creative Suite products (like Photoshop). The firm also continues to focus on digital marketing solutions.• Adobe Systems has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 23.4% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 1 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 18.5%.• Adobe continues to gain significant traction with respect to Creative Cloud subscriptions. Growing from just 195k in the third quarter of 2012, Adobe anticipates exponential growth in coming quarters to round out fiscal 2013 with 1,250k subscribers. We love this recurring, subscription-based model.• Adobe Marketing Cloud is quickly becoming a favorite of Chief Marketing Officers as digital marketing bookings continue to expand at a nice clip.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Adobe Systems' 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 169.3%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.4%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid gray line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Adobe Systems' free cash flow margin has averaged about 28.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Adobe Systems, cash flow from operations increased about 35% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 60% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Adobe Systems' shares are worth between $32.00 - $54.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $43 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 26 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 13.2 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 4.8% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 14.3%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 27.5%, which is above Adobe Systems' trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 4.6% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Adobe Systems, we use a 10.4% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $43 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Adobe Systems. We think the firm is attractive below $32 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $54 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Adobe Systems' fair value at this point in time to be about $43 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart to the right compares the firm's current share price with the path of Adobe Systems' expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $59 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $43 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Whispers range from a low of $0.32 to a high of $0.36. ADBE has an 86% positive surprise history (having topped the whisper in 42 of the 49 earnings reports for which we have data).Earnings history:- Beat whisper: 42 qtrs- Met whisper: 1 qtrs- Missed whisper: 6 qtrsOur primary focus is on post earnings price movement. Knowing how likely a stock's price will move following an earnings report can help you determine the best action to take (long or short). In other words, we look at what happens when the company beats or misses the whisper number expectation.The table below indicates the average post earnings price movement within a one and thirty trading day time frame:(Click to enlarge)The strongest price movement of +3.1% comes within thirty trading days when the company reports earnings that beat the whisper number, and -5.3% within five trading days when the company reports earnings that miss the whisper number. The overall average price move is as expected (beat the whisper and see strength, miss and see weakness) when the company reports earnings.The table below indicates the most recent earnings reports and short-term price reaction:(Click to enlarge)In the comparable quarter last year the company reported earnings two cents ahead of the whisper number. Following that report the stock realized a 4.3% gain in one trading day. Last quarter the company reported earnings four cents ahead of the whisper number. Following that report the stock realized a 5.7% gain in twenty trading days.

1701022,25120,2013-09-18T11:19:40-04:00,,"Shares of Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) spiked upwards in after-hours trading on Tuesday. The market continues to applaud the company's bold move to change its subscription-based model which leads to short-term pain but should result in more stable operational returns in the long run.Even when factoring in a solid transition, I think shares are valued a bit too high based on my estimates for two or three year's time.I remain on the sidelines with a slightly bearish stance.Third Quarter ResultsAdobe generated third quarter revenues of $995.1 million, down 7.9% compared to a year earlier. Reported revenues came within Adobe's guided $975 to $1.025 billion in revenues, but fell short of consensus estimates of $1.01 billion.Net earnings fell by 59% to $83.0 million as diluted earnings per share fell from $0.40 per share to $0.16 per share.Non-GAAP earnings came in at $164.4 million, or $0.32 per share, missing consensus estimates of $0.34 per share.Looking Into The ResultsAdobe's revenues just missed the $1 billion mark for the quarter during which the acquisition of Neolane added $6 million in revenues.As is well known, Adobe is transforming its business model toward a subscription-based revenue model.Subscription revenues rose by 73.1% to $299.3 million, now making up 30% of total revenues. Product revenues fell by 27.2% to $582.2 million. Services and support revenues were up by 16.9% to $113.6 million.Gross margins fell by 370 basis points to 85.2% of total revenues, while operating expenses increased by almost a full ten percent points to 74.1% of total revenues. All in all, this severely impacted operating earnings which fell from $278.3 million to $110.4 million.And The OutlookAdobe sees first quarter revenues coming in between $1.00 and $1.05 billion, which includes a $20 million contribution from Neolane. This implies that revenues are set to fall by 11.1% at the midpoint of the range compared to a year ago.Fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings are seen between $0.28 and $0.34 per share, while GAAP earnings are expected to come in between $0.09 and $0.15 per share.The full-year guidance will be released at the presentation of fourth quarter results.On average, analysts were looking for fourth quarter non-GAAP earnings of $0.41 per share on revenues of $1.08 billion.ValuationAdobe ended the third quarter with $3.16 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments. The company operates with $1.52 billion in total debt and capital lease obligations for a net cash position of $1.64 billion.For the first nine months of the year, Adobe generated revenues of $3.01 billion, down 7.3% on the year before. Net earnings fell by 63% to $224.7 million. Given the fourth quarter guidance, annual revenues should come in just above $4.0 billion, while earnings are expected to fall below $300 million this year.Factoring in gains of 5% in after-hours trading, with shares exchanging hands at $50 per share, the market values Adobe at some $25.3 billion. This values operating assets of the firm at $23.7 billion. Based on 2013's expected results, assets are valued at 5.9 times annual revenues and roughly 80 times GAAP earnings.Adobe does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveShares of Adobe have risen from levels around $20 in 2003 to their mid forties by 2007. Shares have fallen back to lows of $20 in 2009, but have recovered to fresh highs around $50 per share at the moment.In recent years, Adobe has seen strong revenue growth. Annual revenues have increased by some 50% in the three years leading up to 2012. Net earnings doubled to $833 million in the meantime. Given the results so far this year, and the outlook for the final quarter, both revenues and earnings are set to decline markedly in 2013 on the back of the changed business model.Investment ThesisIt has taken some courage, not to mention short-term pain, but the change in the business model which Adobe is undergoing at the moment seems to pay off.The shift to a subscription-based model is ahead of schedule, as deferred revenues keep increasing, making the company's operations much easier to predict going forward.The vast majority of Adobe's customers are moving toward term-based licenses, demonstrating the success of the new offerings. The company now has 1.03 million Creative Cloud users which includes Photoshop, Illustrator and Dreamweaver, marking net additions of 331,000 customers over the quarter. As such, the full-year target of 1.25 million should be easily attainable. Note that Adobe has ""millions"" more in the pipeline which are currently on trial versions. Other good news is that Adobe sees comparatively low churn rates when trial versions run out, as many users switch to paid versions.The company remains committed to its long-term targets. For 2015, the company targets 4 million subscribers for Creative solutions, and it sees compounded annual growth rates of 15% from 2014 to 2016.Back in June, I last took a look at Adobe's prospects. I concluded that the valuation remains an issue with the business model in transition.Adobe is confident, and the current results seem to indicate that the subscription model will smoothen results. This is already witnessed in lower seasonality between the third and fourth quarter. Better insight into future smoothened revenue and earnings streams should create more value for shareholders. The pace of user additions for creative solutions increased from 221,000 net additions in the second quarter to 331,000 over the past quarter.For now, the prospects into 2014 look solid as more and more users will move from trial versions to actual product licenses which will boost the user base as well as average revenues per user.Projecting recent growth, with exception of the past transition year, should create a steadily growing software company with large assets in the cloud. Adobe should be able to generate $5 billion in annual revenues on which it should be able to earn $1 billion going forward, let's say in two year's time, or so.Yet there is still some work ahead, as the market sends shares to fresh highs which values the company at around 5 times revenues and 25 times earnings. While the strategic move is right, and should be applauded, I think the current valuation is a bit high.To reiterate my stance, I remain on the sidelines, with a slight bearish stance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1527632,25120,2013-06-29T05:52:40-04:00,,"On Thursday, after the markets' close, Adobe (ADBE) announced its intention to acquire Neolane in an attempt to boost its online marketing-tailored service offerings.While the deal is strategically sensible I remain on the sidelines. The valuation multiples for the company are way too high and price in a perfect transition of a business model geared towards online cloud subscription services.The DealAdobe announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement under which it will acquire privately held Neolane. Adobe will pay $600 million in cash for the French-based leader in cross-technology campaign management technology.Neolane integrates marketing data both online and offline and performs audience segmentation and marketing messages across channels. Its services enable companies to boost customer experiences and personalize campaigns which ultimately increase return on investment on their marketing budgets.Senior Vice President of the Digital Marketing unit Brad Rencher commented on the rationale behind the deal:Neolane will become the sixth solution within Adobe's marketing cloud offerings, operating next to Analytics, Target, Social, Experience Manager and Media Optimizer offerings. Adobe has invested heavily in its digital marketing offerings already in recent years. Over the past few years, it acquired Omniture, Day Software, Demdex, Auditude and Efficient Frontier, among others.The deal is expected to close as early as July and is subject to normal closing conditions. The transaction is not expected to materially impact the full year revenue and earnings forecast for the fiscal year of 2013.ValuationAdobe ended the second quarter of its fiscal year of 2013 with $3.86 billion in cash, equivalents and short term investments, giving it plenty of financial flexibility to finance the deal. The company operates with $1.53 billion in debt and capital lease obligations, for a net cash position of roughly $2.3 billion.Revenues for the first six months of the fiscal year fell 7.0% to $2.02 billion. Net income fell by 65% to $141.7 million, or $0.28 per share. Based on Adobe's full year outlook, revenues could come in around $4.1 billion. Non-GAAP earnings could come in around $1.45 per share while net earnings could approach $300 million.Trading around $46 per share, the market values Adobe at $23 billion, or its operating assets around $20.7 billion. All this values Adobe at 5.0 times annual revenues and almost 70 times annual GAAP earnings.Despite the solid financial position, Adobe does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveOver the past decade, shares of Adobe have risen from $20 back in 2003 to highs in their mid-forties by 2007. Shares fell back towards the $20 mark during the financial crisis of 2009 but have steadily recovered to the mid-forties at the moment, with shares trading close to all time highs.Between 2009 and 2012, Adobe has increased its annual revenues by 50% to $4.40 billion. Net earnings more than doubled to $833 million in the meantime. Full year results for 2013 will come in markedly below these levels as a result of the transformation in Adobe's business model.Investment ThesisInvestors continue to applaud Adobe's efforts to change its business model. While the strategy to focus on recurring license stream via the cloud results in short term pressure on revenues and earnings, Adobe is confident that it will smoothen out future growth in revenues and earnings. This should ultimately create more value for shareholders.This will result in a modest decline in revenues for 2013, while earnings will take a much larger plunge. Adobe's Create Cloud software plays a key role in this transition process, now having 700,000 users after adding 221,000 users over the past quarter who use popular products like Photoshop and Dreamweaver.On top of that, Adobe sees greater customer satisfaction as creative users can now access their entire product portfolio online and have no hassles of product upgrades, but simply pay an affordable monthly fee while subscribing for automatic updates. At this rate, Adobe is on track to have 1.25 million subscribers by November of this year, marking a successful transition in its business model.Yet the transition is putting short term pressure on the financial performance. Average revenues per user are under pressure, mainly attributable to promotion efforts to increase adoption of cloud-based solutions. ARPU from Creative Cloud users came in at just $37 per month, which compared to full list prices of $50 per month.While the user base seems keen to adopt the online version of Adobe's products, it does have a short-term financial impact. Adobe and the market seem to conclude that this is still worth it, in an effort to reduce future revenue volatility related to major product releases and upgrades. The lack of large up-front investments should also widen Adobe's potential market base, thereby growing the community of users.Consequently, product revenues for the second quarter fell by 26% to $645 million. Subscription revenues based on the online model rose by 60% to $255 million while service and support revenues rose by 18% to $111 million. The combination of a total 10.1% decline in revenues, combined with an 11.1% increase in operating expenses was deadly for earnings, with second quarter GAAP earnings coming in at just $0.15 per share.Overall I am not convinced as the company is valued too high on both GAAP and non-GAAP earnings metrics. Even if I account for accelerating revenue and earnings growth in the coming years, based on the sensible cloud-based subscription business model, I think the current valuation is too high.I remain on the sidelines, with a slight bearish stance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1485131,47721,2013-06-06T11:48:00-04:00,,"The software systems segment is amongst the more maturing sections of the overall technology industry. In the past, the growth of the software industry used to depend upon new and innovative ideas which would be converted into useful software products by companies. Over time, this emphasis on innovation has faded as the overall industry turned to more conventional techniques, such as M&A activity, in order to pursue growth. In this situation, it is important for companies to consider long term aspects in their evaluation of strategic interests. In recent quarters, the M&A activity has also shown a sluggish trend. For most companies in the overall industry, cloud technology appears to be the way forward as technology companies are aiming to utilize it and benefit from the new trend. A few players from the maturing software industry have also shown interest in pursuing cloud based models in their operations. Adobe Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is one of these companies which have recently employed a cloud based subscription model in order to ensure a predictable stream of revenues.Industry Analysis and Stock PerformanceA number of key drivers of the software industry can be considered in order to evaluate the industry position. The rapid growth in emerging markets has always been a strong source of spending for the more advanced industries.Source: BerkeryNoyesThe above chart shows the overall M&A dynamics of the software industry in recent quarters. The chart clearly shows that in the first quarter of FY13, there has been a mild decline in transaction volume but the overall value has substantially decreased to less than half as compared to the previous quarter. In this situation, emerging markets should be the key growth drivers for the industry. Research by Gartner suggests that enterprise resource planning (ERP) and database management systems (DBMS) will be the key sources of growth. At the same time, the overall growth in these economies will support the usage of internet in a holistic perspective. In this context, global players like Adobe stand to benefit from the future outlook.Data Source: Adobe Investor Relations Data SheetThe above chart shows the revenue profile of the company in which the sources of revenues have been identified in terms of region and segments. The regional diversification shows a decent exposure to Asia and EMEA which aligns with the strategic growth interests of the company.Source: YChartsThe above chart shows the performance of Adobe against the Dow Jones US Software index and the S&P 500 index over the past year. The chart shows that firstly the software industry has shown a slower growth as compared to the overall industry in terms of stock prices. On the other hand, Adobe has managed to outperform its sub-industry and the overall S&P 500 by posting a stock price appreciation of 42.8%.Creative CloudAs the revenue profile of the company suggests, the emphasis of the company is to pursue a stronger interest in the digital media market. The company's new product, Creative Cloud, is a step forward in this direction as the product is a membership service which allows the customers to download and install the latest versions of the company's Creative Suite software.Source: Adobe Systems Investor Handout, May 2013The above chart shows the division of Creative Cloud revenues into a variety of customers. The chart shows that the new product mainly targets the creative professionals and at work creative individuals as these two segments contribute towards 65% of the products revenues. Creative Cloud is a very important stepping stone for the company as it will revitalize the going forward outlook of the company.Later this month, the upgrades for the company's software products will also be available through online subscriptions. The customers will be offered a Creative Cloud subscription of $75 on monthly basis and $50 per month for annual subscriptions. Going forward,the company has also stated that the focus of the company will be on this new product.Comparative AnalysisThe company's future outlook should also be supported by its valuation metrics as the prospects of stock price appreciation become limited if the market has already priced the company's future growth. Therefore, the comparative analysis will include key valuation indicators to support the analysis from a fundamental perspective.Data Source: MorningstarThe above table shows four valuation metrics for Adobe, Symantec Corp. (SYMC), Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), Salesforce.com Inc. (NYSE:CRM) and Red Hat Inc. (NYSE:RHT). The table also shows a comparison with the average of price multiples of these players and the overall industry. It is evident that the company is underpriced with respect to all indicators except sales. This provides a substantial upside potential for the company's stock price in the coming years.ConclusionA few of the players in the software industry appear to be very attractive investments due to their attractive valuation or their exposure to the growing trends in the industry. Adobe possesses both of these features as the company is substantially undervalued across key valuation indicators and its new product, Creative Cloud, is a very important stepping stone for future growth of the company. Therefore, I propose a buy recommendation on Adobe as the stock price of the company is likely to continue its upswing in the long run.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1432311,49121,2013-05-14T03:54:36-04:00,,"Executive SummaryAdobe, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) specializes in the design and distribution of desktop publishing software--primarily under the ""Creative Suite"" or ""CS"" branding--to companies and individuals seeking such products (Source: Adobe, Inc.). The company's revenues continue to show consistent long-term growth, with minimal debt-related liability, thus demonstrating the company's ability to be virtually ""self-sufficient"" in regards to obtaining financial assistance for future endeavors. Though company operations are costly and, inevitably, have required debt-related financing activity, the company gains significant returns on sales, and therefore remains financially stable. Likewise, the company's demonstrated ability to repay financial obligations resulting from debt financing proves Adobe's returns on its projects funded by this method of financing greatly surpass the initial debt encountered.The company continues to perform frequent acquisitions in order to acquire talent and other assets, in addition to that which Adobe produces itself. One of the most prominent of these acquisitions is the purchase of Macromedia in April 2005, which led to positive returns recorded on the 2006 financial statements. Likewise, Adobe continues to acquire talent, intellectual property, and other resources from various related firms in recent years, with multiple acquisitions documented in the 2012 annual report. As the company continues to develop new products, improve its existing offerings, and acquire complementary companies, the long-term success of the company is reinvigorated.Certainly, investors' opinions of the stock are based, at least in large part, on the company's ability to continually demonstrate revenue growth. However, other factors affecting this outlook could include, hypothetically, stock sales by employees. As Adobe employees represent a significant portion of the company's shareholders, investors would likely become worried, should a large-scale selloff by either multiple employees, or a single influential employee with substantial holdings (such as the CEO or other executive) ignite investor unrest. Fortunately, this does not seem to be the current trend as of the time of writing. Likewise, future acquisitions could cause a similar effect. Though these acquisitions would, ideally, lead to future revenue increases in addition to those currently witnessed, Adobe would initially experience increased expenses in order to acquire the entity. As a result, investors could either take favorably or unfavorably to such news, and would certainly trade accordingly.Similarly, the support and resistance levels, often acting as psychological barriers influencing investors to trade, could affect the market price of the stock. For instance, as of the time of writing, the Adobe stock price of approximately $45.00 currently contests that of the previous high in mid-2008 in the spectrum of the past five years. Effectively, Adobe is approaching the psychological resistance level, which may encourage some investors to sell their holdings in the company. Contrastingly, the support level-the level below which the stock rarely, if ever, falls-appears substantially lower: the lowest point the stock reached over the past five years remained slightly above $16.00 in early 2009.Ultimately, though the stock is currently approaching a high point relative to the past five years, the projections contained herein suggest that the price per share should justifiably continue rising in the near future. Thus, the recommendation to buy the currently undervalued Adobe shares stands-though investors taking this approach may experience minor short-term fluctuations, the long-term horizon warrants a rise in the market price of ADBE.Valuations, Ratios, and MeasurementsEmploying the company's financial statements for years 2008-2012, the following valuations and ratios were developed. Industry averages listed for price-earnings, price-to-book, price-to-sale, and price-to-cash flow ratios were each determined utilizing averages of individual company data obtained from SmartMoney for competitors in the same industry as Adobe.In each of the price-related ratios (price-earnings, price-to-book, et cetera), Adobe, on average, consistently performs near the industry averages. This indicates that, though the price of the individual common shares and company performance may fluctuate, Adobe consistently avoids consideration as ""excessively overvalued,"" instead retaining a market per-share price that fairly accurately reflects the company's performance, directly correlating with company performance.Additionally, the company's long-term debt per share, though increasing year-over-year, increases (relatively) proportionately with the company's sales per share. This indicates that, though the company certainly possesses debt--as do most companies in similar positions--Adobe is capable of fulfilling and, long-term, overcoming the debt it acquires through continued sales momentum.Average GrowthThe following table exhibits the average growth rates for Adobe between 2008 and 2012, derived from the previously mentioned financial statements. Values represent year-over-year percentage growth (e.g. 4.45% revenue growth from year 2011 to year 2012).Though the company encountered turmoil during the recent financial crisis--as exhibited by the negative values (decreases) in all metrics based on the 2009 financial statements--the performance of the company in later years greatly surpassed these decreases. As a result of recent acquisitions, purchases, and expansion, the company reported slightly negative net income and cash flow growth, though the dollar amounts of these changes continue to surpass the respective 2009 declines. Namely, revenue, earnings per share, and gross margin continue to demonstrate growth year-over-year.Revenue GrowthThe following table exhibits the yearly revenue growth over a ten-year period, separated by financial quarters. Revenues were obtained from the company's yearly Income Statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, then divided by the revenues stated for the same quarter during the previous year (e.g. 2012 first-quarter revenue grew at a rate of 1.70% over first-quarter revenue of 2011).The growth rates for all four quarters in each year were averaged to generate an average growth rate for the year (e.g. an average revenue growth rate of 16.39% in 2012 over 2011). Next, these yearly average growth rates were utilized to generate an average yearly growth rate of 63.74%.In an attempt to objectively classify individual years as ""good"" or ""bad"" in regards to performance, years significantly surpassing the 63.74% average were labeled ""good,"" those at or very near the average labeled ""average,"" and, finally, those performing substantially below the benchmark average were considered ""bad,"" having demonstrated poor performance relative to the other years. The quarterly growth rates were divided by the size of the respective sample to determine the average growth during that type of year (e.g. ""good"" years-a total of 16 quarters-demonstrated an average revenue growth of 28.16%). These average growth rates were incorporated into the following pro forma financial statements to determine projections based on anticipated revenue changes.Fundamental AnalysisPro Forma Income StatementPro Forma Balance SheetPro Forma Statement of Cash FlowsProjectionsGiven the information from the above pro forma financial statements for each considered scenario of revenue growth, the following metrics were projected.As displayed in the above table, should Adobe's sales revenue increase by 28.16% (assuming 2013 would be considered ""good"" year based on the aforementioned criteria), the company would experience significant corresponding increases in operating margin, as well as returns on both assets and equity. As such, the company's potential increase in sales would generate a substantial amount of excess net income, which the company could utilize to fund additional projects, investments, acquisitions, or begin paying as dividends to shareholders.The above table exhibits per-share price estimates based on three criteria and the expected sales revenue growth rates, in an attempt to estimate the value of the stock. The data indicates that, given a forecasted sales revenue increase of 28.16% (recall, a ""good"" year for Adobe) would warrant a market price of between $52.79 and $65.93. Thus, in this scenario, if the stock currently trades for approximately $45.00 per share, the stock is undervalued, and the investor should purchase shares in the company. However, if the stock were instead selling upwards of $66.00, the investor should close his or her position in Adobe, as the stock is overvalued by the market.The expected return column acts as a weighted average of the other three applicable columns for this set of data. As mentioned previously, the 28.16%, 14.80%, and -6.81% revenue growth estimates are not assured-any of the three scenarios could occur in the current year. Thus, if an investor believes Adobe will reach one of these estimates, he or she may assume the corresponding scenarios. Contrastingly, the expected return accounts for the relative likelihoods of each of the three revenue growth scenarios, providing an estimate of the stock price accounting for historical trends in yearly performance as to the likelihood the current year will exhibit a particular trend.SourcesRelevant supporting financial documentation, such as year-end income statements, balance sheets, and statements of cash flows published by Adobe with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the years 2008-2012, may be obtained from the Adobe, Inc.

1518402,23469,2013-06-24T15:22:13-04:00,,"Recent Developments/CatalystAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported quarterly earnings on Wednesday, July 19. We wanted to take some time to update our model with the given changes in earnings. Going into the report, we had a $33 price target with Sell rating. Today, we want to breakdown those earnings and update our price model. After the report and update to our models, we maintain a Sell rating with $32 target now.The company reported $1.01B of revenue along with 0.36 EPS. The company was expecting to see $975M-$1.02B in revenue for the quarter. The company reported $247M in operating income. These statistics compared to $1.12B in revenue in 2012, $305M in operating income, and 0.45 in EPS. These levels showed a lack of growth year/year, but we did some positive results in the company's Creative Cloud subscriptions. The company saw 221K added subscriptions from Q1 of FY13, and the Creative Cloud is a big growth market for the company. Growth in the Marketing Cloud grew by 25%.The issue for ADBE has been how can they invigorate a growth model that is non-cyclical and non-stagnant. They are the obvious leader in content creation and publishing, but the company has seen mixed growth year/year that was mostly based on model cycles. In Q3, the company expects EPS of 0.29-0.35 along with revenue around the same level. The company expects FY13 revenue to get to $4.1B and EPS to 1.45. 2012 EPS was 1.66. The switch to Creative Cloud is still ongoing, but these original results are encouraging.What can investors expect in the long-term for ADBE?The future for the company is in the cloud. The company can push updates more quickly, provide service more easily, and have fewer overheads. For users, the experience is better as well as they can use their subscription from multiple places and can be customized to users. The Cloud is where ADBE is moving. They announced at their MAX conference in May that all new innovation would go through Creative Cloud.What's great for ADBE is that a subscription model is much better for the company than a one-time payment. The subscription keeps payments coming every month, allows the company better understanding of client trends, and keeps margins up.Coming next is Enterprise Creative Cloud offering that will allow ADBE to get its enterprise partners in with the new offering, which is another big win for Adobe as these early results are just individual subscribers. The monthly payments for enterprise will also provide consistent revenue and earnings that will also produce strong margins and better returns. The decision completely streamlines the application development process. Once you buy in, you get most options, but you need to buy in to get the offerings.Adobe has done great to continue to move to digital with Document Services and Digital Marketing. With the company's EchoSign project, the company is at the cutting-edge of e-signatures, which will continue to be a growing business.All this seems pretty great, and we agree that the future looks strong for Adobe, but when we start to look at the company in a model to price, the upside potential looks limited and the valuations show that. Right now, ADBE holds a PE at 31.5 and future PE at 25.5. Price/sales are over 5, and even the PEG ratio is at 3. PEG is usually a great way to value growth names since it looks at future earnings growth. Even on that model, ADBE appears overvalued. An overvalued decent growth name with no dividend and high valuations is not attractive to us.In our model, we priced in 20% operating income growth next year along with 15% and over 7% for the following tow ears. ADBE is a cyclical name, and we should see two solid years of growth before things trail off again as comps become higher. There is potential for some higher growth in 2016 and 2017, but it's hard to imagine more than 8-10%. Even with those rates, this stock looks like it has priced in all growth potential and then some. We have capital expenditures coming own in 2015 - 2017 as we expect the cycle will lead to lower expenses for the company.Even with such solid growth priced in, we can only get to a fair valuation of $32 for ADBE. Therefore, we believe that ADBE may be ready for a correction on any disappointments. The stock is pricing in best case, so if there are any issues, there will be a major correction. What is the catalyst as well for more upside? Price Target AnalysisStep 1.Project operating income, taxes, depreciation, capex, and working capital for five years. Calculate cash flow available by taking operating income - taxes + depreciation - capital expenditures - working capital.Step 2.Calculate present value of available cash flow (PV factor of WACC * available cash flow). You can calculate WACC, but we have given this number to you. The PV factor of WACC is calculated by taking 1 / [(1 + WACC)^# of FY years away from current]. For example, 2016 would be 1 / [(1 + WACC)^4 (2016-2012). WACC for ADBE: 9.4%Step 3.For the fifth year, we calculate a residual calculation. Taking the fifth year available cash flow and dividing by the cap rate, which is calculated by WACC subtracting out residual growth rate, calculate this number. Companies with high levels of growth have higher residual growth, while companies with lower growth levels have lower residual growth. Cap Rate for ADBE: 4.4%Step 4.Calculate Equity Value - add PV of residual value, available cash flow PVs, current cash, and subtract debt:Step 5.Divide equity value by shares outstanding:Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The Oxen Group is a team of analysts.

1513002,23479,2013-06-20T13:36:28-04:00,,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) posted its Q2 earnings on June 18, and showed that its Creative Cloud offering is gaining traction among users. Additionally, the company saw significant growth in its Marketing Cloud initiatives. According to the company, it has over 700k paid subscribers for the Creative Cloud services that generated $356 million annualized recurring revenue [ARR] in Q2.Additionally, Adobe’s Marketing Cloud division’s Q2 revenues grew 17% y-o-y to $230 million. The only significant drop in revenue was reported in LiveCycle and Connect business, which reported $56 million revenues this quarter, down from $61 million last year. The company witnessed good adoption of subscription licenses and increased its end-user subscriptions for enterprise term licenses (ETLA) during the period.The company reported a diluted earnings per share [EPS] of $0.15 on a GAAP-basis and $0.36 on a non-GAAP basis. While the company reported 10% y-o-y decline in revenues to $1.01 billion, its net income declined by 66% y-o-y to $77 million. Due to change in licensing model from perpetual to subscription, Adobe reported an increase in unearned revenue to $691.3 million. We examine some of Adobe’s key drivers below and its outlook for 2013 [Adobe SEC Filings, www.sec.gov, June 18, 2013]. Outlook for Q3 2013 and FY 2013Adobe has guided for revenues of $0.975-$1.025 billion for Q3 2013. This would lead to Q3 GAAP EPS in the range of $0.10 to $0.16 and Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.29 to $0.35.Adobe expects to have over 1.25 million paid Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions by the end of 2013, and according to our calculations, it means it will need to add over 21.15K paid users per week for the rest of 2013, 50% more than its current weekly subscription rate of 14.4k. This would give the company total annual recurring revenue of approximately $685 million. Additionally, we expect the company to end the year with approximately $800 million of Digital Media ARR at a revenue growth rate of 20% y-o-y, and we expect that its document services ARR will increase to $115 million by the end of 2013.The company also expects the LiveCycle and Connect business to decline further while the Print and Publishing business is expected to remain flat this year. LiveCycle and Connect business will contribute approximately $200 million to revenues in 2013. Adobe expects 2013 revenue of $4.1 billion and EPS of $0.62 on a GAAP basis and $1.45 on a non-GAAP basis.Cloud Subscription Services To Bolster Revenue Of Photoshop and Creative Software DivisionAccording to our estimates, the Photoshop and Creative Software division is the biggest of Adobe’s operating segments and makes up approximately 54% of the company’s value. During Q2 2013, this segment generated approximately $670 million in revenues. Recently Adobe abandoned its Creative Suite [CS] entirely to focus its efforts on developing Creative Cloud [CC], which will replace the CS. The company has stated that revenues from its perpetual licensing software will decrease by 2015 and it will continues to sell CS6 to ease the transition to CC.During the past quarter, Adobe reported an increase in adoption of enterprise CC offering through ETLAs and 46% sequential growth in CC’s subscriber base. Creative Cloud added 221k net new subscribers in Q2 2013, up from 153k last quarter. As a result revenue from CC increased by 50% sequentially to $356 million. Additionally, CC now contributes 81% to total revenues of Creative Software division.Acrobat Family DivisionAdobe Acrobat family is the second largest division at Adobe and makes up 13% of its value. Acrobat family division reported 3% y-o-y decline in revenues to $199.3 million. However, the decline in point product document services revenue was offset by increase in revenue from Acrobat cloud services. During the quarter, revenue from Acrobat Cloud services grew 31% sequentially to $84 million primarily due to increase in ETLAs. Going ahead, we expect document services’ ARR will drive revenue growth in the Acrobat family division.Digital Marketing DivisionOmniture is Adobe’s third-largest division and makes up 10% of its value by our estimates. Adobe acquired Omniture in 2011 and since then has included all of Omniture’s products under its digital marketing cloud division. As a result, Adobe witnessed strong growth in its marketing cloud services in previous years, and this division has emerged as an important driver for revenue growth at Adobe.In Q2 CY13, this division reported a 20% y-o-y increase in revenue to $230 million. Additionally, Adobe Marketing Cloud achieved 25% y-o-y bookings growth in the quarter and the company has guided $1 billion in annual revenue. We expect that as big data analytics, mobility, social media and cloud computing gain more traction across industries, this division will report incremental growth in revenues as it has a portfolio of analytical tools that deal with marketing on social media and mobile. While this division contributed 12.5% to Adobe’s total revenues in 2012, we expect it to increase to 16% by the end of our forecast period.We currently have a $37.50 Trefis price estimate for Adobe, which is 20% below its market price.Disclaimer: No positions"
1497282,44141,2013-06-12T12:59:50-04:00,,"Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) is scheduled to release its second-quarter 2013 earnings on Tuesday, June 18. Below I have highlighted this quarter's earnings expectations as well as provided a fundamental look at the company's financial position and valuation.Profile and EstimatesAdobe is a digital marketing and digital media solutions company that has a market cap of $22.1 billion and had annual sales last year of $4.4 billion. Shares currently trade for $44.12 and are up 17.09% YTD, 49.46% above their 52-week low of $29.52. Analysts have a mean price target of $44.81 and a median price target of $46.00 on the shares.Twenty-six analysts have an EPS estimate for this quarter of $0.34, 43% lower year over year; the EPS estimate for FY 2013 is currently $1.44 per share. Last quarter, the company's EPS of $0.35 came in $0.04 above the average analyst's estimate, which was the third time in the last four quarters that the company beat the Street's expectations. As you can see below, Adobe has outperformed the S&P 500 by 15.43% over the past 52 weeks.Analysis Source: Data from MorningStar.com.From the above DuPont analysis, we can see that financial leverage has slowly come down over the last five quarters and the last five years. That is favorable because the company's ROE has held up despite a higher reliance on internally generated profits, as opposed to increased debt/leverage. Asset efficiency has slowly declined as sales growth has lagged the growth of assets, but the highest correlation to ROE appears to be Adobe's operating efficiency, which has come down significantly due to a change in the company's sales strategy.Previously, Adobe relied on traditional retail sales of Creative Suites (Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Dreamweaver, Flash Pro, Fireworks, Acrobat, Bridge, Media Encoder, etc.), but recently the company changed to a subscription based model where access to the products can only be granted through a monthly cloud-based subscription. This switch is a large contributor to the lower margin and return achieved in the first quarter of 2013 and is ultimately the biggest challenge that the company faces. By moving to cloud subscriptions, the company hopes to generate more revenues from long-term customers, entice new customers with its lower-priced subscription ($20-$40 a month as opposed to an initial investment of ~$150-$1,200), save on the tangible costs of goods sold that are eliminated by switching to the cloud, and hook customers on products that they previously did not have access to.Bottom LineBased on the price performance of Adobe so far this year, it appears as if, initially, investors are behind Adobe's subscription-based change. And more importantly, over the next few quarters we should get a better indication of how the change is being received by its customers. More information on the Creative Cloud desktop applications can be found here. Creative Cloud apps are scheduled to be available on the Creative Cloud site on June 17.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1409891,23038,2013-05-07T14:39:30-04:00,,"You knew it was coming, didn't you?Note that ""Creative Cloud"" isn't actually a ""cloud"" service -- that is, the software downloads to your machine.  Only the licensing is cloud-based.The problem with this is that while it looks like a good deal if you need the whole suite ($50/month .vs. $2,500 for the ""Master Collection"") in point of fact most users don't run the full suite of apps. Updates  from one version to the next, typically issued on two-year time-frames,  were typically around $400 for something like Web Premium.  This means that the cost of ownership is more than double on the cloud service.  In fact it's worse than that, because Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) permitted ""version changes"" during upgrades.For  example, you could buy the upgrade to Web Premium 5.5 and then when CS6  came out buy Production.  You still had the 5.5 Web Premium apps but  now had the CS6 apps too, so you wound up with nearly everything but in staggered versions, with some overlap.The cost of ownership for Adobe users who went this route (that includes me, incidentally) has just gone up a lot.I've  been an Adobe licensee for a long time.  My kid has a student  subscription to CC, which is a good deal for her, because it's $20/month.   At $30/month I'd call it a reasonable deal compared against upgrade costs but  at $50, or $600/year?  Eh, that's a tougher sell if I am currently a  web or production premium customer, and what's worse is that if I happen  to be somewhere offsite with my laptop when it wants to do a license  check and it can't get to the Internet.... now what?For those who  were Master Collection licensees this change in model will decrease  their costs materially.  But for those of us who were buying something  less this is a fairly significant increase in the total cost of ownership.I'm sure Adobe likes this model as it gets to recognize monthly revenue.   I'm not so sure it works for the customer, especially the customer who  doesn't need or want the latest version of everything, every minute.  And  that can be a virtue in many cases -- especially when there are bugs in  the code that a company releases.  Being able to roll back locally is a  big deal and can be an utterly-necessary capability in a production environment.Today  I have both Premiere and Sony Vegas for video production, for example.  Sony still issues software releases and updates.  Therefore, I can load a  new version at my leisure and if it sucks for some reason (and that has happened where some version release has crashed on me) I can re-load the old copy in a couple of minutes.""Cloud-based"" subscription models make this impossible,  leaving you with the very real potential of an update being taken that  completely screws you in the middle of a project with utterly no means  of recovery.  Even a system restore may not save you if the cloud  ""management"" software ""decides"" to push-upgrade you, never mind that  system restores for this sort of reason are extraordinarily destructive to your workflow.I have no objection to the choice to buy cloud-subscription service, but to be forced and  further to make me accept the risk of a bad update bricking my  application suite in a production environment makes me seriously  reconsider my desire to own and use Adobe products."
1294241,24491,2013-03-21T19:20:10-04:00,,"Software developer Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) kicked off its 2013 fiscal year with solid first quarter results driven by strong Creative Cloud membership growth. Revenue declined 4% year-over-year to $1 billion, which was expected as the company transitions to a subscription model. Revenue marginally exceeded consensus estimates. Earnings per share fell nearly 40% to $0.35 on a non-GAAP basis, a few cents above consensus expectations. Like revenue, net income was expected to fall, but we are a bit disappointed by $0.17 per share in stock-based compensation.More important for tech companies like Adobe, is free cash flow, which was strong at $261 million and essentially equal to the year ago period. We remain impressed by the company's ability to transition to its subscription cloud service, as subscribers increased 47% sequentially to 479 thousand paid members. Recurring revenue jumped 52% sequentially to $233 million. Consequently, deferred revenue jumped $80.5 million to $700 million. In the first quarter alone, Adobe rolled out several new updates for Creative Cloud, stating on the conference call:""Product updates for Creative Cloud members during Q1 included: a new Photoshop release, which includes enhancements such as Smart Object support, new 3D features, improved CSS support, workflow improvements and support for the Apple Retina display; and innovations in our HTML tooling, which includes updates to our Edge products and services and updates to Muse that allow its users to create websites tailored for mobile and tablet experiences.""The updates highlight what we really like about the new cloud experience; easier real-time updates, support across multiple platforms, and (possibly) a stickier product. This is similar to the strategy we're seeing at Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), as it transitions Office to a subscriber-based model. Not only will it likely lead to higher overall revenue, but it could help prevent counterfeiting.On the cost side, research & development jumped 18% year-over-year to $209 million, while marketing spending increased 11% year-over-year to $398 million. We didn't hear much of an explanation about, but we believe it was related to the firm developing new products on the mobile end, while spending more to create awareness around the Creative Cloud product suite.Going forward, the firm anticipates fiscal year earnings per share of $1.45 on revenue of $4.1 billion, both relatively close to consensus estimates. We're impressed by the fantastic growth in the Creative Cloud, and we are excited about Adobe's new revenue model. Still, we aren't interested in shares at this time.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1316411,24757,2013-04-02T22:09:01-04:00,,"Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) has been adopting a new, subscription model for its  software, which results in a delay in recognition of revenue. Is that  really the reason for its less-than-stellar revenue growth during 2012,  or is the company perhaps using this story to cover other trends?  On March 19, Adobe reported revenue for the quarter ending March 1 at   $1.008 billion, down 13% sequentially from $1.153 billion, and down 5%  from $1.045 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Declining revenue  usually results in low P/E ratios, but as I write, at a price of $43.57  per share, ADBE's trailing PE is 30.68, which is very high for a  technology stock in this market.  Perhaps earnings are improving despite the revenue downtrend? No, GAAP  earnings per share (EPS) were $0.13,   down 70% sequentially from $0.44  and down 65% from $0.37 year-earlier. Nor were the poor earnings from  strange GAAP rules; non-GAAP EPS was $0.35, down from $0.57  year-earlier.   Surely there must be some new source of revenue and profits that has  impressed sell-side analysts that must be factored into future  earnings. While Adobe's Digital Marketing segment had 20% y/y revenue  growth, there are no known new initiatives that account for the  optimism.  So it would seem to come down to the subscription model. In the past,  Adobe sold its array of software products as versions available on disk.  Photoshop is its best known product, but as the Internet has become the  greatest driving force in our economy, a variety of products to help  with Web site content production and management were introduced.  Software products could be bought separately, but most designers needed  multiple products, and they were packaged together in Creative Suite.  Despite being sold in high volumes, Creative Suite (CS) has never been  cheap. The cost of buying a full license for CS depended on the exact  options chosen, but let's just ballpark it at $2000.   Over time CS improved, partly just to keep up with changes in the  Internet. New versions of CS were introduced about every 2 years. If you  already had a full copy of CS, you could buy an upgrade for, ballpark,  $1000.  With the vast majority of Web designers dependent on CS, charging them  $1000 every two years for upgrades was a nice source of recurring  revenue. Only many designers found they could skip upgrades at least  some of the time. If they had CS 3, they might skip CS 4 and buy the CS 5  upgrade. Wait too long (typically 2 full versions), and the ability to  buy at the upgrade price went away.  Meanwhile, for many customers, the set of DVDs used to install CS receded  into history, as the software package was downloaded from the Internet  instead.  In 2012, Adobe decided to push a subscription model to replace the old  system. Customers can pay a monthly fee and get upgrades automatically.  Better still, instead of having to wait for 6.0 to replace 4.0, the  upgrades come as they are available.  However, note the impact on cash flows. Someone who was going to buy CS  6.0 for hundreds or thousands of dollars instead starts a subscription  at (rates vary) $49.99 per month.  At the end of a year, the subscription client will have paid  $600 to  Adobe. In two years, they will have paid $1200, more than the cost of an  upgrade. If customers stop skipping versions, in effect the subscription  systems become a major price increase. You see other companies doing  the same thing, for instance, Microsoft with Office 365. The subscription service also cuts down on pirated software.   So the theory of bullish ADBE investors is that once we go through a  full subscription cycle, revenue will ramp. There might even be some cost  of goods sold decrease from the elimination of physical media  (management says that would be quite minor).  The problem with betting on this outcome is that you are also betting on  the continued dominance of Adobe in making software for Web design.  A year to two years ago, investors were not so confident in Adobe, and we  should recall why. Apple, a long-time Adobe ally, had refused to allow  Adobe's Flash product to be used on its smartphones and tablets. In  addition, the industry was (and still is) making a transition to a new  standard, HTML5. Since then, the emergence of other mobile  hardware/software platforms has Balkanized the app world, meaning just  creating Web pages is not longer the prime goal of developers for the  Internet.   Adobe has responded well to this challenge. The new CS, at least in  theory, can create Web pages and applications that work reasonably well  on multiple device form factors. Being able to design once in CS and  export to multiple formats (or to include code that senses the form  factor and presents the page accordingly) is a big help to Web  designers.  I would still be cautious about projecting out too much. Adobe is not  the only company addressing the new Internet Tower of Babel that Apple  created. Just for instance, Akamai  provides data center software that can distinguish between requests from  cellphones and computers and message the outgoing data automatically.  Open source software that has many of the capabilities of Adobe products  is available for free. While most designers, from freelancers to large  enterprise design departments, find Adobe is worth the price because of  its functionality, free could become more competitive in the future. In  addition, several proprietary competitors exist in the Web design  segment.   It is hard to imagine an Internet without Adobe, but there is danger as  well as opportunity in the subscription model. Adobe management is  confident that adoption will go well, and that assumption seems to  already be built into today's stock price.

1111451,30811,2013-01-14T19:37:25-05:00,,"Shares of Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) have returned 30.4% over the past 12 months. At $38.09 per share, the stock is now trading very close to its 52-week high at $38.78 attained just recently. Will the current uptrend continue? In this article, I will walk you through my valuation analysis which may assist in formulating your investment decisions.Sell-side analysts on average predict Adobe's revenue, EBITDA and EPS to rise by 2-year CAGRs of 12.8%, 20.5% and 35.2%, respectively, over the next 2 fiscal years (see comparable analysis chart below). Those consensus growth estimates are substantially above the averages of 6.4%, 8.2%, and 12.0%, respectively, for a group consisting of Adobe's peers in the software sector. Similarly, the company's EBITDA margin is forecasted to expand by 4.2% over the same period, compared to an average estimate of just 1.5% for the peers. On the profit side, most of Adobe's margin metrics are below the par, but the difference is not significant. The company's leverage level is fairly in line with the peer group as reflected by its higher debt to capitalization ratio, but lower debt to EBITDA rate. In terms of liquidity, Adobe's trailing free cash flow margin is very comparable to the peer average. Although the firm's interest coverage ratio is below the average, the metric remains at a healthy level on an absolute basis. Both Adobe's current and quick ratios are above the par, reflecting a very solid balance sheet performance.To summarize the financial comparisons, Adobe's superior growth potential would likely be the primary support for the stock's valuation. The stock is currently trading at 14.0x forward EV/EBITDA and 27.1x forward P/E, representing a large premium over the peer-average EV/EBITDA and P/E multiples of 8.2x and 12.2x, respectively. Given the company's solid profitability, cash flow and balance sheet performance, I believe Adobe's valuation premium can be justified.From a historical valuation standpoint, Adobe's current valuation appears to be fair. The stock's trailing EV/EBITDA and P/E multiples at 11.4x and 23.0x, respectively, are now trading at discounts of 29.1% and 26.0% to their 10-year historical averages (see chart below). The valuation discount appears to be reasonable provided that 1) Adobe's various profitability margins have remained fairly stable over the past 10 years and 2) the company's estimated revenue, EBITDA and EPS growth rates for the next few fiscal years are moderately below their historical level, and this appears to be the primary cause for the downtrend of the valuation multiples (see charts below).To support my view, I also performed a DCF analysis which incorporates the market's consensus revenue and EBITDA estimates from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2018 (see DCF chart below). Other cash flow related items in the model including depreciation, tax expense, capital expenditure, and net working capital investment are projected based on their historical figures relative to the revenue as those ratios have been trending steadily over time. The terminal revenue growth rate is set to be 3.5% and the terminal EBITDA margin is assumed to be the same as the estimated margin in fiscal 2018.A company-specific risk premium of 3.0% is used in the cost of equity calculation to account for the projection risk of the market's consensus estimates. Instead of using the currently depressed 10-year US Treasury Bond yield, a normalized 10-year risk-free rate is applied. I also added a size premium to account for Adobe's smaller size relatively to the selected peers in the group. As such, based on a WACC of 10.8%, a terminal growth rate of 3.5%, and an implied EBITDA multiple of 9.3x (currently at 14.0x as mentioned earlier), the DCF model yields a stock value of $40.11, which is 5.3% above the current share price at $38.09 and thus suggests a fair valuation given that the assumptions used in the model are quite reasonable. According to the sensitivity tables, the somewhat extreme scenarios such as a mix of 2.5% terminal growth rate and 12.3% WACC or 2.5% terminal growth rate and 26.5% terminal EBITDA margin would only result in an average price decline of 14.3% from the current $38.09 level.Adobe's medium-term price catalyst appears to be the firm's current transition to a subscription-based business model. According to Jay Vleeschhouwer, a research analyst at Griffin Securities (sourced from Thomson One, Equity Research):Bottom line, after the recent price appreciation, Adobe's valuation remains reasonable as it is supported by the firm's relatively strong growth potential. In addition, Adobe's business transition would likely position the stock for a further upside. Therefore, Adobe remains a buy at the current price level. To limit the investment risk, investors may also consider selling out-of-money put options to either collect a premium upfront or take a potential opportunity to acquire the shares at a lower price.The comparable analysis and DCF charts are created by the author, all other charts are sourced from Capital IQ, and all historical and consensus estimated financial data is sourced from Capital IQ.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in ADBE over the next 72 hours.

1412811,22110,2013-05-08T04:07:41-04:00,,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) announced Monday that it was moving all its professional graphics arts users from a package software purchase model to a subscription model. This is certainly a bold - if not risky - move, but so far I can't tell if it's a sign of strength or weakness.Package software is how Adobe was started - as was true for nearly all 20th century software companies. The company would develop a major new release, sell it as a product, provide free bug fixes for a while and then start over. Adobe was unusual - or perhaps a trend-setter - in that it never tended to give much of a discount for previous owners to buy the new copy. Adobe also got in the habit of bundling packages in ""suites"": for example, I once was a Dreamweaver user, but the suite pricing forced me to find another alternative (currently the open source SeaMonkey) when an OS upgrade rendered my 8-year-old copy of Dreamweaver obsolete.Under the new plan, the flagship ""Creative Suite"" will become ""Creative Cloud."" Fortunately for users, the ""cloud"" term is somewhat misleading: it's not a Cloud in the sense of Google Docs or webmail - with all the apps running in the cloud - because the latency of such interactions would make Photoshop or Illustrator unusable. Instead, Creative Cloud is more like the Apple model with apps on the PC and document synchronization between a PC (or other device) and Adobe's servers. In the 1990s, we called this groupware, although obviously things have gotten better since then.The big difference is that instead of paying for releases, Adobe wants users to pay for subscriptions. The migration will be enforced by orphaning the old products, which gradually will become obsolete and irrelevant.Usually when you make such a dramatic transition, you run the two business models in parallel. In Monday's presentation, Adobe's CFO Mark Garrett said that the subscriptions have topped 500,000. At $50/month, that's $300 million a year; with annual revenues of $4.5 billion, that's meaningful but not overwhelming. Their 2012 10-K stated:So the ability to make this shift suggests strong pricing power by Adobe. As Garrett said:Garrett said that beyond the core audience or beyond full-time ""creative professionals,"" it's targeting three other groups: marketing staff at small/medium businesses, SOHO photographers/hobbyists, and education.All of these are problematic. When I ran a small business, we wouldn't spend $600/year/seat for anything, nor would I as an individual. Even at a reduced pricing of $360/year, the price seems too rich for the education market (""one of our most important vertical markets"" according to Garrett).Various commentators have questioned this pricing model, including Karl Denninger on Seeking Alpha and Lori Grunin of CNET. People are grumbling, but of course nobody likes a price increase - so the real question of pricing power is whether customers have any realistic alternative. (Adobe's 89% gross margins suggests most of their customers are stuck).On the other hand, the shift to seek revenue growth through a new business model - rather than creating new products - could be seen as a sign of weakness. It takes me back to my second software more than 30 years ago, developing minicomputer simulation tools. In our case, we used a monthly (or annual) service contracts when we were unable to provide meaningful upgrades that people would pay for.The new pricing model does not appear (yet) to cover low-end consumer products such as Photoshop Elements. My guess (just a guess) is that if the professionals cooperate with the subscription model, Adobe will attempt to shift consumers to the subscription model within 3 years.One thing going for Adobe is that most of its rivals among professional software companies have pulled back or (as with Aldus and Altsys) been bought up. Open source alternatives are not viable competitors to the Creative Suite apps. However, Adobe faces challenges in the low-end consumer market from App Store apps that sell for $30 or less as new customers seek convenient, affordable alternatives."
1274421,40621,2013-03-14T13:51:33-04:00,,"On Tuesday, Adobe Systems Inc (NASDAQ:ADBE) will announce their fiscal Q1 earnings. With the acquisition of Behance for $150 Million as the major news item this quarter, ADBE is betting big on building a community, something that it has basically no experience doing. While I don't like that acquisition, at less than 1% of its market cap, maybe ADBE can afford to take the risk. But I don't see the strategy, and I think the stock is a sell.PastOver the last 6 quarters, ADBE has stagnant earnings growth, though they have managed expectations well. Below are historical results (all data from thestreet.com:ADBE has a mature product set: forward sales are visible and they collect huge margins as products aren't under much further development. However, there hasn't been a growth story here for a long time: there isn't much upside from organic growth. The company has basically been treading water for the last few years.This obviously sets the stage for acquisitions like Behance. Adobe actually is credited with 5 acquisitions in 2011 and I would imagine a few tiny, non-material ones have happened of late as well. To me, this bodes very poorly: a mature company like Adobe with little growth should be returning money to shareholders, not chasing down growth by buying at the top of the market.PresentAdobe is a tough company to find true comps for. Most sites use Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the best comps, but realistically Adobe doesn't have nearly the moat that those companies have with their entrenched software associations. Regardless, Adobe trades at a higher multiple than either one (data from Yahoo):At 25x earnings, Adobe seems really rich for a company with no growth.FutureI think Adobe is ripe for disruption and is a sell, if not a short candidate. While the company has been trying to adapt to HTML 5 and new developments on the web, it's going up against hostile companies like AAPL that are looking to kill it. The company makes decent tools, but isn't really producing any category changers, and it shows.The one risk to a short, and my main hesitation, is a potential dividend. Other SeekingAlpha commentators have been pushing for Adobe to start paying out cash, and they are right: the company has the profile of a utility, not a hot internet startup. If ADBE does that or increases their buyback program, the stock could get a kick. But if the company continues to throw money into acquisitions outside their core competency, I don't think it will end well. Buying companies at a 50x+ multiple while (generously) valued at 25x is not.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1274491,41921,2013-03-14T14:06:12-04:00,,"Insider trading can be a powerful indicator of future stock performance if interpreted correctly. However, it often seems more predictive on the buy side when a company executive purchases its company shares on the open market. Trying to determine if insider selling is sending a warning signal is much harder to decipher. The level of stock compensation many insiders at large corporations receive today naturally leads to more selling than buying. Consider an example where 75% of an insider's compensation is stock based. In this case they are simply exercising a prudent strategy to liquidate a portion of that compensation from time to time.The amount of insider selling at Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) over the past 3 and 12 month periods should raise a red flag. This becomes more prevalent in the context of the trend of short selling seen over the past few years. This uptick in selling is conveniently timed with a company defining strategic transition currently ongoing at Adobe.Reviewing Recent Company PerformanceThe chart below shows the historical stock price of Adobe from 2006 until March 2013:The stock peaked at about $48 a share in 2007, bottomed at about $16 a share in the crisis of 2009, and recovered all the way to about $42 a share as of March 2013.The next table shows a summary of financial results for a portion of that period just discussed. Coming out of the market crash in 2009 the company saw over 100% EPS growth from 2009 to 2010. After that the earnings story takes a significant slowdown as EPS growth in 2011 was only 12% and in 2012 was only 1%. The outlook for 2013 presents an entirely different view of the company discussed later in the article.(Source: Adobe Systems Inc. December 2012 10-K, p. 54)What Do Insiders Know And Why Are They Now Selling?The chart below shows the relative level of insider sales from 2006 to 2012:At the insider selling peak back in 2007 close to 4M shares were sold. That same year an all time high in the stock price was reached at $48 a share. As the market tumbled in 2008 and 2009 Adobe's stock price was not immune, and insider sales also fell along with the stock price. In 2010 when Adobe had over 100% growth in EPS YoY less than .4M Insider shares were sold. In 2011, as growth was stalling at 12%, less than .3M Insider shares were sold. Then 2012 arrives and EPS growth slows to 1% YoY and all of a sudden insider selling triples from the prior year to over 1.2M shares. About 50% of that selling took place in the last 90 days of 2012 when the stock reached its highest level in 3 years. The question becomes, is this simply a case of insiders making prudent capital planning decisions with their own money? The alternative may be that they are telegraphing their belief that the stock price has surpassed a reasonable valuation based on what they know.Adobe Business TransitionAs chronicled in detail in this Fortune article from late 2012, Adobe has embarked on a massive shift in its business model. In the past, the company sold flagship products such as Photoshop and Acrobat as part of a suite of services. This package could be licensed for around $2,500 and upgrades typically cost about $1,500 and saw releases about every 18 months. In an effort to stay relevant with the changes in the marketplace, the company has totally discarded their old business model. Just yesterday the company announced they will no longer sell the boxed version of their software. Adobe has thoroughly embraced the ""cloud"" so to speak. Their new business model, much like that of others in the SaaS field, is now a subscription based model with access to the product offerings online through the cloud. They now offer the same suite of products through their offering called the ""Creative Cloud"" for a monthly subscription that ranges from $20 to $50 a month. They also have moved into the digital marketing and analytic field over the last few years with some of the acquisitions they have made. Adobe has pushed all their chips into the middle of the table and bet the future of the company on this shift in their business model. Arguably this was a necessary move to make. But at the same time they now compete directly against such large players as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and others. These companies are significantly larger with more cash to fund R&D as well as the ability to undercut Adobe in pricing if they desire. This creates added pressure for Adobe to offer a service that is differentiated enough that consumers and businesses feel it is a must have. However, the Adobe Flash product should serve as a warning to how quickly a flagship product can be put in the trashcan if not adopted by influential companies. When Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), specifically Steve Jobs, refused to adopt Flash it was only a matter of time before Adobe lost that battle and moved on from continuing to support and develop that product.Financial OutlookThe consensus financial estimates for 2013 are for revenue of $4.1B and EPS of 1.41. This is down from revenue of $4.4B in 2012 and EPS of 1.66. The YoY revenue and EPS declines are 7% and 15% respectively. At a stock price of over $41 today, the company trades for close to 30x their forward earnings expectations. The bull camp would argue that the company has significant runway for growth ahead of it with their business model transition. However, what seems odd is that typically even outstanding companies that choose to redefine their business find themselves in the penalty box from a valuation perspective until they prove their success. Adobe has seen no such impact to its valuation and on the contrary the company has seen its valuation and PE multiple increase significantly.Returning To The Original Question: Why Are Insiders Selling If Success Is Likely?It sends a warning signal to see insider selling reach its highest point in 3 years given the company defining business transition currently underway. In the near term, Adobe is not a bankruptcy risk due to a decent balance sheet. However, they do face a significant risk that if growth does not materialize as both the company and the market anticipates that the stock will fall drastically. If this does not turn into a growth story, even if Adobe meets their 2013 earnings estimates, the stock has an extremely large downward move to make as expectations are reset. If company management truly believes in the long term success of their business transition, it is difficult to understand why the pace of their stock disposition ramped up so quickly this past year. It would be a good time to leave this high flying stock just like the company insiders are.Disclosure: I am short ADBE. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1283771,24706,2013-03-18T14:43:27-04:00,,"By: Brendan Gilmartin, VP Content And ResearchOverviewAdobe Systems (ADBE) is scheduled to report 1Q 2013 earnings after the close of trading on Tuesday, March 19. The results are typically available between 4:00 and 4:05 p.m. Eastern and will follow with a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Adobe's latest earnings release will garner close scrutiny given the recent appreciation in the share price to the highest level since August 2008. The recent advance comes as the provider of PDF-reader and photo-editing software shifts its strategy toward cloud computing with enhancements to its ""Creative Cloud"" suite of products and push into Digital Media and Digital Marketing.Outliers & StrategyKey Measures:Recent NewsTechincal ReviewAdobe shares are at multi-year highs ahead of 1Q 2013 earnings, following a surge of nearly 30% since mid-November. In recent weeks, the shares have meandered in a narrow range between $41.00 and $42.00, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) sitting on the overbought 70-level - indications the shares may be due for a near-term pullback. Should earnings prove disappointing, look for support near the 50-day SMA close to $39.00, with further downside risk to $38.00. There is no near-term resistance, given the jump in the shares toward multi-year highs. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryAdobe shares recently broke out to the highest level in 5 ½ years, as the company successfully transitions from a purely desktop software play into a cloud-based solutions provider with an enhanced subscription model. Adobe is also developing more products and updating existing ones to cater to the mobile market, with Flash and other applications becoming more common in smartphones and tablets. Against this positive backdrop, Adobe is seen posting stellar results and upbeat guidance for 2Q 2013. Anything less would be seen as a disappointment.Disclaimer: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

1068541,40011,2012-12-17T12:08:07-05:00,,"Software manufacturer Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), best known for its industry-standard Creative Suite software, rallied last week after the company reported fourth quarter earnings which topped analysts' estimates on both top and bottom lines. Adobe reported earnings of 44 cents per share, or $222.3 million, on revenue of $1.15 billion. This constituted a 28% increase in EPS and 0.1% rise in revenue from the prior year quarter. Excluding one-time charges from stock-based compensation and restructuring charges, Adobe earned 61 cents per share, a 10% decrease from the previous year's 67 cents on the same basis.Both Adobe's earnings and revenue topped its own prior estimate of 53 cents to 58 cents per share, on revenue between $1.08 billion and $1.13 billion. Adobe attributed its robust earnings to a successful transition to cloud-based software suites, increased demand for its digital marketing software, as well as a 6.8% decrease in overhead expenses.The Creative CloudAdobe began transitioning its traditional packaged Creative Suite software - which includes its flagship Photoshop and Illustrator software - into a cloud-based subscription service last year, after the company reported several sequential quarters of lower revenue and earnings growth. The costly initiative, which caused a $94 million restructuring charge last quarter, has been decidedly successful, adding an average of 10,000 new subscribers weekly throughout the fourth quarter - a 25% improvement over the third quarter. Adobe managed to attract many new users with a free trial period for its Creative Suite products. 325,000 of these trial users converted to paid subscriptions, most of which are annual contracts.During a conference call, CEO Shantanu Narayen was upbeat regarding the progress of moving Adobe's software to the cloud. ""I think people are really seeing the benefits of always having access to the latest applications,"" he stated. ""The new products we're delivering as part of the cloud are seeing significant adoption, which I think bodes well for us.""While offering its Creative Suite software ""as a service"" over the cloud presents casual and professional users with more flexible pricing options and instant updates, it runs a slight risk of cannibalization. Analysts have noted that a license for Adobe's traditional packaged Creative Suite software costs $780, while an annual cloud-based license costs $480. Adobe must keep cloud-based customers for two years or more to achieve higher profitability than its original product. Adobe's CFO Mark Garrett has accounted for this initial dip, lowering the company's fiscal 2013 guidance from $4.4 billion to $4.1 billion. However, he assured investors that this initiatives, though costly at first and slow to become earnings accretive, will be strongly profitable in the long run. ""We get through that in 2013 and 2014 and beyond,"" stated Garrett, ""the build-up in subscriptions will offset the decline in license revenue.""The Marketing CloudIn addition to its cloud-based Creative Suite software, Adobe recently introduced digital marketing services, which offer data mining services to help businesses measure purchases, page views and traffic from social media sites. In the past year, these services - which Adobe calls the Marketing Cloud - have risen in popularity, helping businesses streamline marketing initiatives and alter their products for targeted demographics. Narayen noted that ""there's no question that we're seeing quite a bit of synergy between the Creative Cloud and the Marketing Cloud,"" and has told investors that customers from one segment are likely to purchase products and licenses from the other one, which boost Adobe's revenue growth on both fronts.Shares of Adobe have risen 40% over the past twelve months, outperforming the tech sector by a wide margin. The stock trades at 15.8 times forward earnings with a 5-year PEG ratio of 1.46, and does not pay a dividend.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1115341,24491,2013-01-16T13:27:45-05:00,,"Price is what you pay for a company and value is what you get. Intrinsic value is based on the discounted future free cash flows of the company. Let's walk through how we arrive at Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) fair value estimate. And, as we do so, we'll reiterate why we still like Adobe's free cash flow.We think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation and relative valuation versus industry peers is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. Essentially, we're looking for firms that overlap investment methodologies, thereby revealing the greatest interest by investors (we like firms with qualities that fall in the center of the diagram below). More interest = more buying = higher stock price.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis, it scores high on our scale. Adobe Systems posts a VBI score of 3 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the firm and its neutral relative valuation versus peers. We compare Adobe Systems to peers F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).Our Report on Adobe SystemsInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Adobe Systems earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 155% during the past three years.• Adobe Systems has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average a whopping 26% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 1 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 20.8%.• Although we think there may be a better time to dabble in the firm's shares based on our DCF process, the firm's stock has outperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter, indicating increased investor interest in the company.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (NASDAQ:ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Adobe Systems' 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 155%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.2%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Adobe Systems' free cash flow margin has averaged about 30.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Adobe Systems, cash flow from operations increased about 38% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 76% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisThe estimated fair value of $33 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 20 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 10.3 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 3.6% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 5.6%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 34.8%, which is above Adobe Systems' trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.1% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Adobe Systems, we use a 10.2% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $33 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Adobe Systems. We think the firm is attractive below $25 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $41 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Adobe Systems' fair value at this point in time to be about $33 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Adobe Systems' expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $45 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $33 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Generally, this free cash flow is what remains after deducting what is strictly needed for survival from all the cash produced by a company in one year. From the point of view of an investor, this free cash flow is what really matters, as it's the real added value that may be entirely distributed to the stakeholders without compromising a company's existence.By projecting the free cash flow to the future and discounting it back (employing the so-called weighted average cost of capital, after having performed some other technical steps), it's possible to reach the fair value of stock compared with its market price. However, the big issue is to choose an appropriate free cash flow future growth rate. This task can be accomplished by looking back into the financial reports of the target company to see how it performed in the past.Based on this methodology, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is now overvalued: The operating cash flow for the last 12 months stands at $1.5bn and capital expenditures totaling $271m, so the free cash flow is $1.229bn with the weighted average cost of capital computed at 10.3%. Using data from the most recent 10-K form, the estimated impact of operating leases and outstanding stock options combined is $546m. A reasonable free cash flow growth rate for the short/medium term (up to 10 years) could be estimated at 0.8%, considering the last 5-year operating cash flow at a Compound Annual Growth Rate. While in the long term (over ten years), this rate is estimated at a stable 2.75% which is equal to growth rate projections for the overall world economy. Given all the above-mentioned assumptions, the final calculation gives a value per ordinary share equal to $32.11, which is about 15.8% lower than the closing price of $38.14 on the 8 Jan 2013Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1060211,23479,2012-12-12T12:35:21-05:00,,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) will report its Q4 FY 2012 earnings on Dec. 13. We  examine a few key drivers that we think will drive its earnings going  forward.Adobe has restructured its business to a subscription-based model and  has been targeting two high-growth businesses -- digital media and  digital marketing. It released products such as Adobe Social with an eye  on the booming cloud and social analytics market. Its subscription  model on the cloud is becoming quite popular, and we expect growth  through its Adobe Creative Cloud. In this earnings release, we will look  primarily at how Adobe is doing in the digital media and marketing  space.The company has also released a one-stop shop for ad management and  analytics by integrating Adobe AdLens with Adobe SiteCatalyst. Unlike  most other ad campaign management tools, which focus on a particular  platform, the Adobe AdLens is a unified ad management system, which  allows users to manage digital marketing efforts across search, display,  and social media.The company also made a foray into the online video ad market with  Adobe MediaWeaver, its ad-insertion service. This service is integrated  with Project Primetime, a video technology platform that publishes and  monetizes TV content across web-connected devices. It also introduced  the Primetime Media Player, which allows TV content owners and  distributors to reach audiences across web-devices. This ensures that  content is immediately monetizable through ad insertion and analytics.The company also recently announced the release of a new suite of tools for game development.  It released Adobe Scout, Adobe Gaming SDK, and Flash C++ Compiler in a  bid to promote flash games. This suite is available as part of the  Creative Cloud subscription. Flash games already rule the PC world, but  they are losing out on tablet and mobile phone market share. Therefore, by  introducing these tools as part of the creative cloud, Adobe can provide  a single platform to build games and will be easier to publish across  formats. The casual gaming market is currently worth $5 billion to $6 billion and  is poised to grow to nearly $9 billion by 2014, according to the Casual Games Association. This division is however not going to feature significantly in the current quarter.Creative Cloud Growth Is KeyAdobe has guided that for Q4 2012 it expects revenue of $1.07 billion to $1.12  billion, and diluted EPS in the range of $0.34-$0.39 on a GAAP basis and  $0.53-$0.58 on a non-GAAP basis.  Adobe has a majority market share in the creative software space  thanks to the continued success of its Creative Suite line of products.  The majority of its revenues are driven by Creative software products  like Photoshop, which is why Creative Cloud is expected to be one of its  most important releases to date.The subscription-based model was made available on May 11, 2012, to  users at $49.99 a month and will allow them access to the entire CS6  suite as well as exclusive online content. Considering that the entire  package is currently available for $2,600, the subscription model will  attract and encourage part-time and casual users. The subscription model  can make it cheaper for users to access the software, but there is an  added advantage for the providers as they can exercise better control  over software maintenance and updates.There is, however, a chance that revenues may suffer in the short term  as users migrate to the cloud-based offering. The company expects to add  nearly 125,000 members to the Creative Cloud subscription list this  quarter, which will give it an additional annual revenue of $94 million.We currently have a $34 Trefis price estimate for Adobe, which stands just above its market price. Creative Software accounts for nearly 50% of its total value.Disclosure: No positions."
884801,25651,2012-09-24T12:32:56-04:00,,"Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported its third quarter fiscal year 2012 last week. It reported revenues of $1.081 billion for the period, within its revenue guidance of $1.075 billion to $1.125 billion. This translates to year-on-year growth of 6.7% but a decline of 3.8% on a quarter-on-quarter basis. The sequential decline in revenues is attributed to the adoption of new and lower priced subscription-based models from its clients. This translates to quarterly net income of $201.4 million, or equivalent to $0.40 per share for the period. This is higher than the previous year's net income of $195.1 million, or earnings per share of $0.39. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, this is also lower than the previous quarter's net income of $223.9 million, or earnings per share of $0.45.Its digital media solutions segment generated 71.2% of revenue for the quarter. Segment revenue amounted to $769.1 million, down by 8.9% year-on-year but showed an increase of 3.1% year-on-year. Its sub-segment Document services performed a record quarter from continued Acrobat adoption from enterprise clients, as well as robust growth in other Acrobat related cloud services. It has added more than 100,000 net new subscriptions for the quarter, bringing the total paid subscriptions of 200,000 for the Creative Cloud software suite.Meanwhile, its digital marketing accounted for 23.8% of the total third quarter revenue for the period. Revenues for the segment amounted to $257.1 million. This is up by 2.5% from the previous quarter but down by 18.5% compared to the same period last year.Creative + Cloud Is Adobe's Formula for Future GrowthLooking at the recent quarter gives me an overview of Adobe's future growth. It seems that the bread and butter segment will still be Digital Media. As the company moves to subscription-based model, Creative Suite will provide a steady stream of monthly subscription revenues. This will even out the gyrations of software upgrade cycle. It must be noted that its creative software revenues slowed down in the prior quarter as customers hold off purchases from the launch of Creative Suite 6. The major updates included Photoshop, Premiere Pro, After Effects, In Design, Illustrator and Dreamweaver. Furthermore, it has recently launched Adobe Captivate 6, an upgraded version of the company's e-learning authoring software for creating interactive e-learning and HTML5-based mobile learning. It provides the users the ability to design interactive e-learning content. The strong competitive position of Adobe is the wide acceptance of most of its product in the market place. This easily keeps current and potential competitors at bay.Adobe is following the lines of other companies such as SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Oracle has also launched its New Application Software called Fusion Apps, recently. It has experienced strong gains from this segment, generating $2.7 billion for Oracle last year. It also currently added strong products to its current portfolio. It has acquired companies such as Peoplesoft, JD Edwards and Siebel Systems to beef up its future offerings to its clients.On the other hand, SAP has also increased its focus on the mobile, cloud services and HANA businesses. The company is targeting revenues of $422 million from HANA and mobile revenues of $290 million. Moving forward, it plans to split its reporting its revenues from its cloud services. This implies that it will have significant contribution of its businesses in the future.Adobe is also looking to launch several tablet apps for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS and Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android. This would likely lead to higher sales as the tablet industry will continue to post solid gains in the future. Meanwhile, its digital marketing will also be another focus for Adobe. For instance, it has acquired Efficient Frontier, a leader in the ad buying and optimization platform for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google Adwords. Going forward, analysts expect this segment to contribute almost 25% of the company's revenues.Adobe Competitive Advantage Evident in Its FinancialsFor the last 5 years, its revenues have grown by 13.11% a year. This translates to operating margins increasing from 24.6% in 2002 to 26.1% in 2011. This implies that the company's product suite has superiority over its competitors. Also, it commands pricing power allowing the company to maintain its margins. Its free cash flow has also increased from $298 million in 2002 to $1.33 billion in 2011. This translates to growth of 38.47% for the last 9 years.Management sees revenues of $1.075 billion to $1.125 billion for the fourth quarter of this year. It sees lower digital media revenues from the integration of Creative Cloud. Its Digital Marketing is expected to grow sequentially. For the current fiscal year, Adobe is expected to earn $2.35 per share, flat from the previous year's figure. For the next 5 years, it is expected to grow by 10.67% a year.Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported a 10% revenue growth for the same period. But, its operating margins have declined from 41.1% in 2003 to 29.5% in 2012. The decline in operating margin is due to the decline in the company's core products as it faces headwinds from the rise of mobile phones and tablets. Despite these negative headwinds, its free cash flow has increased from $14.90 billion in 2003 to $29.3 billion in 2011.Another competitor SAP posted lower revenue growth. SAP has revenue growth of 6.85% for the last 10 years. This translates to operating loss of 78.1% in 2002 to 34.3% in 2011. Its free cash flow has also increased from $1.15 billion in 2002 to $3.4 billion. This yields to 28% growth for the period.Adobe Should Be Valued As a Cloud Computing StockThe stock trades at 13 times earnings and 2.7 times book. This is lower than its 5-year average earnings multiple of 27.1 times. It has a price to growth ratio (NYSE:PEG) at 2.6 times.At these levels, Adobe does not look cheap. Its competitors have lower valuations. Oracle is valued at 10.7 times earnings and has a PEG ratio of 1.2 times. Microsoft is valued at 9 times earnings and 3.9 times book. It also has a PEG ratio of 5.8 times. But, I believe that Adobe should be valued more as a cloud computing stock rather than a traditional technology company. Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is valued at 90 times earnings. The market is overly optimistic about the role of cloud computing in the future. This results in double digit earnings multiples moving forward.I believe that Adobe is undervalued. Its board has approved buying back up to $2 billion by the end of 2015. I would recommend buying on dips. The market hates bad news. Disappointing earnings is an example. Investors can easily pick up Adobe shares every time it announces lower than expected financial results.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1058681,24706,2012-12-11T17:47:54-05:00,,"By Brendan GilmartinAdobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) is scheduled to report Q4 2012 earnings after the close of trading on Thursday, Dec. 13. The results are typically available between 4:00 p.m. and 4:05 p.m. ET and will follow with a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Adobe shares have been rallying in advance of the earnings release, climbing more than 10% since mid-November, pushing the shares to a 52-week high.We're watching the following items:1. Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share. Adobe indicated back in September that it was targeting Q4 2012 non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.53 to $0.58. The current Street estimate is toward the high end of the guidance range at $0.57 (source: Yahoo Finance). Note that the November quarter is typically a strong period for Adobe and, based on recent price action, the Street may be looking for a number closer to $0.60 in order to sustain the recent momentum.2. Revenues. Adobe previously said it sees revenues in the range of $1.075 billion to $1.125 billion. The consensus is $1.1 billion. This quarter, revenues are seen benefiting from improved currency tailwinds.3. Earnings Per Share Guidance (Q1 2013). With the market having priced in a solid Q4, investors will pay close attention to the outlook for the upcoming quarter. The current consensus is $0.56.4. Revenue Guidance (Q1 2013). The estimate for revenues in the Q1 2013 period is $1.07 billion.Last quarter, Adobe shares rose more than 4% in response to a solid earnings release, stemming from stronger-than-expected Creative Cloud subscriptions and gains in the Digital Marketing Suite.Recent NewsOn Dec. 5, Adobe announced the addition of a new board member, Kelly J. Barlow, a partner with ValueAct Capital. ""It's an exciting time for Adobe as the company positions itself for long-term growth and leadership in digital media and digital marketing,"" Barlow commented in the release accompanying the announcement.On Nov. 16, JMP Securities reiterated an Underperform rating on Adobe Systems and a $26 price target, according to JagsReport.com.Technical ReviewAdobe Systems recently broke out to a fresh multi-year high ahead of its Q4 2012 earnings release and added more than 10% since mid-November. In the wake of the advance, the Relative Strength Index hurdled above the 70-level -- an area generally consistent with overbought conditions -- while the MACD is also extended. Against this backdrop, the market is pricing in a strong quarter and positive guidance for the balance of the year. Should earnings disappoint, there is downside support to $34.50 (September/November high), followed by the 50-day SMA near $33.50. Click to enlarge image.Source: StockCharts.com.SummaryAdobe Systems shares have been breaking out over the past several weeks, hitting multiyear highs, thanks to evidence of strength in Creative Cloud subscriptions and gains in the Digital Marketing Suite. Many on the sell side also believe the company is ultimately poised to benefit from its recent strategic shift toward a subscription-based revenue model, while currency tailwinds and takeover chatter support the shares. The only caveat to this positive story ahead of earnings would be the recent run-up in the shares to a 52-week high, implying a positive report may be priced in at these levels.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1078051,22762,2012-12-21T15:34:41-05:00,,"By Frederic LardinoisAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) just announced that it has acquired Behance,  a New York-based online platform where creative professionals can  showcase their portfolios and where businesses can find talent. The site  currently has about 1 million members and hosts over 3 million  projects. Adobe plans to integrate Behance’s community and portfolio  capabilities with its recently launched Creative Cloud  service, “allowing members to seamlessly create content, seek feedback,  showcase their work and distribute it across devices.” The financial  details of the transaction were not disclosed.As Scott Morris, Adobe’s senior marketing director for the Creative  Pro product line, told me earlier today, the acquisition itself “came  together quickly.” The Behance team was already using Adobe’s Typekit (a  product the company acquired last year) and, as Morris said, were  “friends of [Adobe] for a while.” Morris argues that the vast majority  of Behance’s users are already using Adobe’s products anyway, so the  acquisition should be a good fit.All of Behance’s 32 employees will move over to Adobe and stay in New  York. Behance CEO Scott Belsky will become Adobe’s vice president of  community.Behance was founded in 2006 and was bootstrapped by its founders. This May, however, the service raised a $6.5 million Series A  round led by Union Square Ventures and individual investors like Amazon  CEO Jeff Bezos (through Bezos Expeditions), Dave Morin, Yves Behar,  Chris Dixon, Dave Tisch, Dave McClure, Alexis Ohanian and Garrett Camp.  At the time, Behance said that its users were adding about 20,000 new  projects to the site every week and that its network had doubled over  the last month.It’s worth noting that Behance also powers the portfolio features for  thousands of other sites, including AdWeek,the Rhode Island School of  Design and The Smithsonian National Design Awards. For the time being,  Morris said, Adobe has no plans to retire the Behance brand or make any  changes to the product. He says that the acquisition will likely play  out similar to the Typekit  purchase. Typekit continues to be a standalone product, but it is also  deeply integrated into the rest of Adobe’s Creative Suite.When Adobe first announced its Creative Cloud initiative,  the company already talked about how it planned to add a strong  community aspect to the service. Creative Cloud, Adobe said at the time,  was meant to be a “hub for making, sharing and delivering creative  work.” As Morris told me, Adobe was already working on its community  features and building them from scratch, but decided that it could  accelerate this process through this acquisition.In many ways, the community aspect of the Creative Cloud is the last  missing piece for the service. It already offers creative professionals  the tools, services, syncing, storage and private sharing features they  need, but the addition of Behance will now also bring public sharing and  communications features to it. While Adobe isn’t quite ready to talk in  detail about what the Behance/Creative Cloud integration will look  like, chances are that it will include most of the standard social  networking features already available on Behance.More details on the acquisition in Behance’s blog post this afternoon here.Original Post"
885671,24491,2012-09-24T16:31:46-04:00,,"Software maker Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported decent third-quarter results Wednesday afternoon. Revenue grew 7% year-over-year to $1.1 billion, roughly in-line with consensus estimates. Earnings increased just 5% year-over-year, to $0.58 per share (non-GAAP), and came in just a penny shy of consensus expectations. Going forward, the firm issued a disappointing outlook, guiding to earnings per share of $0.53-$0.58 during the fourth quarter, short of the consensus estimate of $0.67 per share. Revenue guidance was also a bit light, as the firm expects revenue of $1.075 billion-$1.125 billion, below the consensus expectation calling for $1.2 billion. For an in-depth analysis of Adobe's intrinsic value based on a robust DCF process, please click here.The firm is in the midst of transforming its business model from selling large software packages to its Creative Cloud and Digital Marketing Suite subscription model. Still, gross margins fell 70 basis points year-over-year, to 88.9%, which is still a robust figure but will likely continue to trend lower (as free and lower cost competitors emerge). We're more worried about SG&A expenses, which increased 60 basis points to 61.8% of revenue, as the firm ramped up its marketing spending. We expect marketing costs to continue to increase as the firm focuses on communicating its new products to customers.Overall, we liked Adobe's quarter, but its outlook was a bit weak. The company reported some nice wins with its Digital Marketing Suite product, which is on pace to exceed $750 million in sales this year. Creative Cloud usage is also growing at a healthy clip, adding 8,000 subscribers weekly during the third quarter--ahead of the firm's internal expectation of 5,000 subscribers. The company also generated over $144 million in free cash flow during the period, and Adobe has plenty of cash on hand to invest in new products. Though the firm scores a 7 on the Valuentum Buying Index (our stock-selection methodology), they are fairly valued.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

878331,24805,2012-09-20T10:28:12-04:00,,"Let's hear it from the experts first.With more focus toward digital media and digital marketing, Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) might become a direct competitor with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Adobe's Creative Cloud doesn't seem to be in danger from any big firm at the moment. When it comes to Adobe's Digital Marketing Suite and Digital Publishing Suite, it can become a face-off with IBM, who is in the same digital marketing niche with its Smarter Planet campaign including Smarter Commerce initiative and Customer Experience Suite.It must be understandable that these industry stalwarts have already had a head start, and Adobe, the late bloomer, might face an impediment while shifting to the more business-oriented, subscription-based, cloud services business model. Remember, Adobe's revenue is derived primarily from the licensing of software products, associated software maintenance and support plans, custom software development, non-software related hosting services, consulting services, training, and technical support. Adobe has to leverage the strategic acquisitions (Omniture Inc. in 2009, Day Software in 2010 and Efficient Frontier in 2012), broader channel coverage and business-oriented marketing approach to have a smooth and successful transition.Well, everything sounds good when you have money in your pocket. How is Adobe doing financially?Digging Deeper into the Company FinancialsTo start with, the acquisitions of Day Software and Omniture resulted in about 23% increase in revenue from Enterprise (which also includes LiveCycle) and in 2011, over that in 2010. It must be noted that the printing and publishing segmented revenue decreased 3% in 2011 compared to 2010 due to lower Shockwave revenue and bad timing of ColdFusion product releases.It must be noted that product-categorized revenue still accounted for 83% of Adobe's total revenues. In addition to that, the cost of revenue increased in the subscription, services and support segments due to the acquisitions of Day Software and Omniture, accompanied with surge in overheads. If Adobe doesn't transition fast, the increasing costs in these segments might offset the income gained from the product-based operations.Total revenue increased to $4.2 billion in 2011, compared to $3.8 billion in 2010, with the basic net income per share rising to $1.67 per share in 2011 from $1.49 per share in 2010, and diluted net income per share rising to $1.65 per share in 2011 over $1.47 per share in 2010. With significant increase in the cash assets along with accrued expenses and deferred revenues, the company seems to be doing a fine job with garnering working capital for the transition.Total stockholder's equity increased by $590 million, even after the stock repurchase worth $695 million. On a second thought, it is wiser not to look at return on equity metric as of now, but the increase in revenue does give us a positive signal.What about the third quarter results this year?Adobe achieved revenue in Q3 2012 of $1.081 billion, within its targeted range of $1.075-1.125 billion. With faster adoption of Creative Cloud, subscriptions during the third quarter effectively transitioned approximately $29 million more perpetual revenue than expected to Creative Cloud. Ah! Talk about transition and it's already happening it seems.Operating income was $278.3 million and net income was $201.4 million on a GAAP-basis. Operating income was $391.8 million and net income was $291.2 million on a non-GAAP basis.Even the Digital Marketing Suite achieved record quarterly revenue with 40% YoY growth.Around 125,000 new Creative Cloud subscriptions in the next fourth quarter, which represents approximately $94 million, will probably shift from the perpetual product section to the subscription section, according to the management outlook.Although Adobe seems to be performing well at the moment, with the operating margin lingering around 26% in comparison to Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) 29.92%, Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) 36.92%, Apple's 31.22% and IBM's (NYSE:IBM) 19.64%, I will still say that Adobe might have to go through tough time transitioning. Needless to say, the operating margin might tank for some time ahead. Remember, Adobe's current return on average assets, which certainly includes the newest acquisitions, stands at 9.72%, which is much lower than that of the above mentioned companies. So evidently, the company needs to figure out how to capitalize on the newly gained assets.But you definitely cannot reject Adobe's presence altogether, to be honest.Okay, what about the price - overpriced or underpriced?Take a look at the graph below.(Click to enlarge)The MACD curve is quite below the signal line and lower high's does signal an upcoming downward trend, which is further confirmed the RSI signal of over 50 (at the time of writing this article).In the candlesticks, the presence of doji in the recent trading session, along with the longer downward shadows, show strong selling pressure, might move the stock price down. In fact, the stock price is already testing the resistance of the lower Bollinger band.So, in support of these evidences, along with the fact that Adobe is trading at PE ratio of 21.26, compared to the average of 15 (of the above mentioned companies), the stock price might go down in the coming few weeks.Alpha ConclusionFor my alpha readers, it is always better to be safe than sorry. You might want to wait a few weeks before you think of investing in the stock. It might turn out to be more profitable in course of time.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The stock has seen more aggressive next-day percentage closing levels following 20 of its last 34 after-hours, earnings-driven moves.

875541,24706,2012-09-19T08:24:07-04:00,,"By: Brendan GilmartinOverviewAdobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) is slated to release 3Q 2012 earnings after the close of trading on Wednesday, September 19. The results are typically released 4:05pm EST with a conference call to follow at 5:00pm EST.Outliers & StrategyKey Measures:Recent News•09/18: According to Schaeffer's Investment Research, put volume in Adobe options is more than 4x the daily average ahead of the upcoming earnings release, while sentiment indicators are painting a cautious picture.•08/24: Adobe Systems shares sunk nearly 4% after rival Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) slashed its 2013 revenue forecast, based on internal execution challenges, coupled with an ""uneven global economy.""Technical ReviewAdobe Systems slipped toward the 20-Day SMA of $32.50 on Tuesday (9/18) - a technical level that goes back to late April. The downward move headed into the earnings release, coupled with increased Put volume in the options markets are signals the Street may be biased toward a weak report. If the results conclusively disappoint, there is downside risk to the 50-Day SMA near $32.00, with downside risk to the YTD lows near $30.00. Conversely, a surprise to the upside could lift the shares through resistance near $34.00. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.comSummaryAdobe Systems shares retreated in the session leading up to the 3Q 2012 earnings release amid concerns over the macro outlook, coupled with reports of heavy promotional pricing for the new Creative Suite product line. Last quarter's cautious outlook, weakness in many of its peers, and reports of increased put buying in the options market have many investors on edge headed into the release. Given that Adobe typically telegraphs its forward earnings expectations, the outlook for the 4Q period and balance of the year are seen influencing the direction of the shares in after-hours trading.DISCLAIMER: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

877411,25120,2012-09-20T02:18:25-04:00,,"Shares of Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) fell by 1% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. The software company, offering products for marketers, application developers and enterprises, reported its third quarter results after the close.Third Quarter ResultsAdobe reported third quarter revenues of $1.08 billion, up 6.6% from last year's $1.01 billion. Revenues came in at the low end of the previously guided range of $1.075-$1.125 billion. Analysts expected Adobe to report revenues of $1.11 billion.Revenues were impacted by the adverse effects of a strong dollar. Furthermore, Creative Cloud subscriptions will spread out revenues in the future. At the moment, it recognizes revenues as a lump-sum up front.Adobe reported a net income of $201.4 million during the quarter. GAAP earnings per share came in at $0.40, up a penny from last year when the company earned $195.1 million. On average, analysts expected Adobe to earn $0.47 per share. Earnings came in at $0.58 per share on a non-GAAP basis. The number of Creative Cloud subscriptions grew to 200,000.CEO Shantanu Narayen commented on the results: OutlookFor the final quarter of 2012, Adobe anticipates revenues of $1.075-$1.125 billion. The company anticipates to earn $0.34-$0.39 per share on a GAAP basis, and $0.53-$0.58 on a non-GAAP basis. The company anticipates to add 125,000 new Creative Cloud subscriptions, which will generate $94 million in perpetual revenues.The final quarter outlook implies full year revenues of around $4.35 billion. The company is expected to earn $1.56-$1.61 per diluted share.ValuationAdobe Systems ended its third quarter with $3.25 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments. Adobe operates with $1.5 billion in short- and long-term debt, for a net cash position of $1.75 billion. For the first nine months of 2012, Adobe generated revenues of $3.25 billion. The company net earned $610 million, or $1.22 per diluted share.Adobe is currently valued at around $16 billion. Excluding the net cash position, operating assets are valued around $14 billion. Based on the full year outlook, Adobe is valued at 4.3 times annual revenues and 18 times annual earnings.Currently, Adobe does not pay a dividend.Investment ThesisYear to date, shares of Adobe have gained some 17%. Shares rallied in January from levels around $28, to trade within a $30-$34 trading range for most of the rest of the year.Over the past five years, shares have lost roughly a quarter of their value. Shares fell from levels around $45 in 2008 to lows of $15 in 2009. From that point in time, shares have traded within a $20-$35 trading range.In the meantime, Adobe expanded its revenues from $3.6 billion in 2008 to an expected $4.3 billion in 2012. Net income fell from $870 million in 2008, to an expected $800 million this year. Earnings per share remained unchanged around $1.60 per share, as Adobe retired 10% of its shares outstanding.Despite the fact that Adobe missed on both earnings and revenues, investors are not punishing the company. Revenues are depressed as a result of the success of the Creative Cloud subscriptions, which bring in revenues on a monthly basis, instead of a lump-sum at the start.Despite the strong financial condition and future improved earnings visibility as a result of Creative Cloud, shares offer little appeal. Low growth and the fact that the company does not pay a dividend, makes me hesitant to pick up some shares.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

681931,24491,2012-06-25T11:21:11-04:00,,"Software giant Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), best known for hit products like Photoshop, reported its fiscal year 2012 second quarter results on Tuesday. Earnings came in at $0.60, a penny north of consensus, while the top-line grew to $1.12 billion, $10 million above consensus. For the quarter, the company's products segment grew 5% to $871 million, while subscriptions grew 45% to $159.5 million and service revenues grew 12% to $93 million. The firm attributed the strong results to success with the launch of its Creative Cloud and Creative Suite 6. The company also noted robust growth in its Digital Marketing Suite, which ticked up 35% compared to the same period a year ago.The firm also pointed out that, though Creative Cloud wasn't launched long ago, it has signed up 90,000 subscribers, of which 65% have opted for the full-range of services offered within the product. The current weekly run-rate for the product is about 5,000 net-new subscribers. Adobe hopes to have 800,000 Creative Cloud subscribers by 2015. However, management also noted that this may be a result of promotional pricing for existing customers.After reviewing the conference call, akin to what we've been seeing from other firms lately, we think some of the weakness in guidance is due to soft demand in Europe and the negative effects of exchange rates. Adobe expects earnings of $0.56-$0.61 for its fiscal third quarter relative to the $0.61 the Street was looking for on revenue of $1.075-$1.125 billion, just shy of the consensus estimate of $1.13 billion. We aren't overly concerned, given that we think this conservative guidance is a result of European head winds. The firm still hasn't rolled out Creative Cloud to the enterprise market, and we think there is room for upside in the Creative Suite refresh cycle. The firm also narrowed its guidance range for revenue (up 6-7%) and non-GAAP earnings per share ($2.40-$2.46) for fiscal year 2012. This implies strong growth for the fourth quarter and suggests that spending on its products will actually accelerate near the end of the fiscal year.Though Adobe looks attractive on a relative-value basis versus its peers, we believe its shares are fairly valued based on our discounted cash-flow assessment (click here for our DCF valuation model template). Simply put, we aren't very interested in Adobe at this time based on the firm's score on our Buying Index (click here for more info on how to understand our VBI). We have long preferred Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the software space and continue to do so, which registers a higher score on our stock-selection scale.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: MSFT is included in the portfolio of our Dividend Growth Newsletter."

An Adobe employee working for Apache has ignored Microsoft's Do Not Track headers in the Apache server. The company is in a huge flame with Microsoft over the security of Windows 8, which could be vulnerable to an unpatched Flash flaw. (Microsoft hasn't updated its Flash support in Internet Explorer since July.)The Flash Player has been pulled from Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) online store.What's going on is that Adobe has moved on while the industry hasn't. Adobe is now more about things like ""TV Everywhere"" and social-mobile advertising than it is about mere video or video editing support. Developers, meanwhile, continue to support Flash - Apple didn't kill it.Cris Frangold calls Adobe ""a smart play on streaming video"" and he's right. More vital than its support of video is its support of existing TV content and Pay TV business models.There is more than one way to play the video game. You can play it either through technology, or through the business models of rights-holders.

670111,21445,2012-06-19T15:03:01-04:00,,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is expected to report Q2 earnings after the market close on Tuesday, June 19, with a conference call scheduled for 5:00 pm ET. The consensus estimate is 59c for EPS and $1.11B for revenue, according to First Call. The whisper number is 58c, 1c behind the consensus estimate. Last quarter the company reported earnings that matched the whisper number. Management guidance for Q2 calls for non-GAAP EPS of 57c-61c and revenue of around $1.09B-$1.14B. For FY12, Adobe expects non-GAAP EPS of $2.38-$2.48, based on a share count of 502M-504M shares. On April 12, the company approved a $2B repurchase program. Most of the analysts believe that with the release of CS6, Creative Cloud product cycle and the Efficient Frontier acquisition, EPS and revenue will likely come in at the high end of the management guidance range. However, they believe that negative foreign currency movement will act as a headwind. The analysts believe that CS6 is off to a strong start, driven by an enhanced feature set, pent-up demand, newer cloud features and subscription pricing. Analysts do not expect strong operating margin expansion due to the company's huge growth investments and continued hiring. Strong competition from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains a matter of concern."
694662,22762,2012-07-01T06:18:04-04:00,,"By Ryan LawlerLate Thursday, an extraordinary thing happened: Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) announced in a blog post that it would not provide Flash Player support for devices running Android 4.1, and that it would pull the plugin from the Google Play store on August 15. The retreat comes five years after the introduction of the iPhone, the device which thwarted Flash's mobile ambitions, almost even before they began.That Adobe would make such an announcement nearly five years to the day that the first iPhone was sold is kind of funny. I'd like to think that the Flash team has a sense of humor and was well aware of the timing when it posted the blog entry, but I could also see the entry as unintentionally ironic. Either way, it caps off a five-year battle to win the mobile landscape - a war which for Adobe ended in defeat.At the time the iPhone was announced, lack of support for Adobe Flash seemed like a glaring omission, for a platform that was so hell-bent on being a portable computing device. But it wasn't until the iPad came out, two-and-a-half years later, that the battle between Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Adobe, Flash vs. HTML5, and ""open"" vs. ""proprietary"" reached a fever pitch.The iPad was announced in January at WWDC, but wasn't available until March. And when it did finally become available, people began to notice that the lack of Flash, which then was the de facto standard for video playback and interactivity on the web, was missing. For the iPhone, not having Flash was a minor annoyance - after all, few other smartphones had very good Flash support at the time… But for the iPad, which in many cases was being used as a laptop replacement, at least for consumption of media, that was a big deal.It wasn't long before Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) latched onto this and began promising an alternative to the ""broken"" Apple devices which wouldn't give users access to the full web, as publishers intended them to view it. It's tough to believe now, but at one point, Flash on mobile devices was actually considered a feature. There was Google's Andy Rubin in April 2010, announcing that Android would have full Flash support in Froyo, the next version of the operating system to be released.Battle lines were drawn, and just a few days later, Steve Jobs issued his epic missive ""Thoughts on Flash,"" which sought to explain, once and for all, why Apple didn't - and wouldn't ever - integrate Flash into its mobile and tablet devices. There were numerous reasons, and Jobs debunked the trope of Flash being ""open,"" as well as its ability to access the full web. He also brought up security, reliability, performance, and battery life issues that plagued devices using the plugin.Most importantly, though, Apple didn't want Adobe developers to create cross-platform apps which didn't take advantage of the latest features, development libraries and tools. Jobs wrote:It turns out Jobs was right. When Flash finally did ship on Android devices, it didn't provide users with the full web, as was promised. Android users who wished to watch videos on Hulu through the Flash browser, for instance, were met with a message saying that the content wasn't available on the mobile web. Same thing for users who tried to access most premium video sites on Google TV, which also supported Flash. More importantly, even when those videos or interactive Flash elements did appear on Android devices, they were often wonky or didn't perform well, even on high-powered phones.The end result was that users stopped seeing Flash on mobile devices as a good thing, and developers quit trying to support the framework on those devices.But the impact of that battle goes beyond just how people view content on mobile phones. While pretty much all developers have settled on building native apps or coding for the mobile web when trying to reach those users, the battle has also had an impact on the way that developers think about multi platform web development. Even when not building for 4-inch screen, they're increasingly turning to HTML5 to build new user experiences or render interactive applications, rather than writing to be seen in the Flash player.Video might be the last industry where the Adobe Flash Player continues to have a hold on how content is displayed, but even then, a growing number of sites are moving to HTML5-based video players for delivery. YouTube and Vimeo are leading that charge, displaying their videos in a HTML5 player first, when available, and only falling back to Flash when the player isn't supported. And many others are following that lead.Frankly, Flash had never been a huge business for Adobe, even when development for interactive websites using the plugin were in high demand. As time goes on, it will become an even less important part, as its development tools - where Adobe makes the bulk of its revenue - focus on catering to a developer base that is increasingly interested in building HTML5-based web applications. As more can be accomplished in-browser without a plugin, that's good news for users and developers alike.Original post"

The results are typically released 4:05pm EST with a conference call to follow at 5:00pm EST.Outliers & StrategyKey Measures:According to Bloomberg.com, the implied stock-price move (via option pricing) for ADBE's earnings is 3.90%.Keep a close eye on Adobe's earnings for clues ahead of Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) upcoming earnings release on June 21, 2012.Recent NewsTechnical ReviewAdobe shares are down almost 10% from the high of $34.78 set on April 2nd. Since bottoming out at support near $30 (just above the 200-day SMA), shares have shown signs of strength headed into the 2Q2012 earnings release. More recently, Adobe has fluctuated in a narrow trading range, setting up for a potential breakout. Should earnings disappoint, look for strong support at the aforementioned $30 level. Conversely, if there is an upside surprise, look for resistance at $34, followed by the 52-week high of $34.78. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryAdobe shares are slipping ahead of 1Q 2012 earnings, amid concerns over the macro outlook, coupled with reports of heavy promotional pricing for the new Creative Suite product line. Skepticism over other recent product launches has also contributed to the recent pullback, prompting analysts to adjust top-line figures to reflect a more cautious view. Against this backdrop, Adobe could break out of this narrow trading channel, so long as Non-GAAP EPS, revenues and the next quarter's guidance are at or above expectations. Alternatively, a tepid outlook for the third quarter in combination with mixed results for the recent second quarter could trigger a move downward and potential retest of the lows near $30.DISCLAIMER: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

845871,29161,2012-09-04T17:21:33-04:00,,"Even though it has had a rough year, Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) still seems to have some momentum. Its shares recently took over the 197 slot on the S&P 500 from Loews. More importantly, the company has displayed some impressive new capabilities, particularly in the growing streaming video field.Adobe is trying to develop a major new revenue stream through streaming video, even though it is trying to scrap its older video app Adobe Flash. The company has brought out a new video app that might become the industry standard. The software has apparently been widely adopted by users in the entertainment and cable industries.Adobe's Plan Is TV EverywhereAdobe's new video streaming app, Adobe Pass Version Two, is now supporting more than 150 pay TV operators in the United States. This represents 98% of all American households with access to pay TV, Todd Greenbaum, the senior product manager for Adobe Pass, said in a company video. The new Adobe Pass also supports 40 different apps from 25 different content providers.Major entertainment providers using Adobe Pass to drive their apps include Disney (NYSE:DIS), NBC, and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX). Major cable companies that use Adobe Pass include Cablevision Systems (NYSE:CVC) and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA). The app also had some success during the Summer Olympics when it sent out 88 million streaming videos of NBC's Olympic coverage. Greenbaum said the content was accessed from 10 million different devices. Around 70% of the viewers watched the Olympics from old-fashioned desktops, but 30% accessed it through mobile devices.Adobe is also planning to roll out what it calls Project Primetime this fall. That's an improvement to Pass that will let users access it from a wide variety of platforms, including iOS, Android, Mac and Windows. That is supposed to let viewers watch video on Adobe through all these platforms. Project Primetime's goal is to make Adobe's TV Everywhere plan a reality. Greenbaum said if all goes as planned, users will be able to access cable content seamlessly through mobile devices with Adobe Pass.So has Adobe's effort to reposition itself as a leader in the streaming video field paid off in the market? Not according to the latest charts.Adobe shares have fallen from around $34 on August 13th to $31.27 at the closing bell on August 31st. The company may have convinced cable operators and TV channels that Adobe Pass Version 2 is great, but it hasn't convinced the market yet.Part of the reason for this might be the confusion surrounding Adobe's older video app, the venerable Flash Player. The Flash Player app was taken out of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Play (the former Google marketplace) on August 15th. That means you can no longer install Flash on Android devices; you have to use Adobe Pass. Adobe stopped developing Flash Player last year after a change in strategy. Adobe apparently was never able to get Flash working properly on Android.But, the BBC is now reporting that the Flash Player is now available in Google Play again, but only for users in the United Kingdom. The BBC was among a number of British content providers that asked Adobe to put Flash back up. The reason for this is that BBC's iPlayer App apparently still runs on Flash. To make matters worse, Flash apparently doesn't work with the latest version of Google's Android, 4.1, or Jelly Bean.Interestingly enough, the BBC is still one of Adobe's customers. The British TV network is reportedly working with Adobe to develop a new video player.So it's easy to see why a lot of investors are skeptical of Adobe. It keeps changing its strategy, and its relationship with some of its customers is shaky. The company has not been able to convert its recent success with Adobe Pass into increased profits.Adobe's net income for the second quarter of 2012 was lower than its net income for the same period in 2011. Adobe reported a net income of $223.88 million for the second quarter of 2012, which was down from $229.44 million for the same period in 2011. Yet at the same time, the company's revenues were actually higher. The revenue for the second quarter was $1.12 billion, which was a $10 million increase over the second quarter of 2011. This meant Adobe's revenue increased by 10% in the past year.Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen attributed the strong results to the launch of two new products, Creative Cloud and Creative Suite Suite Six. He also stated that there had been a 35% growth in revenue from the company's Digital Marketing Suite in the past year.Despite the roller coaster ride it has been on in the past year, Adobe still has impressive technological capabilities. More importantly, it has shown that it can still create widely adopted products that can generate revenue. Despite the confusion surrounding Flash, Adobe looks like a value play in tech because of its video streaming technology.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

671261,27861,2012-06-20T03:56:20-04:00,,"Over-used buzz words can fool some into thinking they are in with the latest concepts, but unless a company is involved in food production, using the word ecosystem is simply pretentious. Unfortunately, we find more and more people throwing this term around. To some investors, this term is the new ""bling"". What they really mean is the availability of choices, and integration across devices.Obviously, these are important aspects of any technology company selling to consumers, but there is rarely the uniqueness that ""ecosystem"" seems to imply. We are unlikely to find a tech company ""ecosystem"" profiled on National Geographic or the Discovery Channel. However, despite this seemingly over-used buzzword, product reviewer Joshua Topolsky of The Verge now has an ""ecosystem"" scale for tablets and smartphones. So for now, let's go with the flow, and see what drives content creation, and enables growing those ""ecosystems"".While individual smartphone vendors do have their own native Software Developer Kits, or SDKs,and there are advantages to creating native apps, the need for larger development groups, or the need for programmers over designers, limits the accessibility of these tools. The internet began with programmers who could code HTML, then experienced subsequent shifts towards packaged solutions creative professionals could use, even though we still see some specialist web coding experts still generating revenues.So as programming needs shifted towards creative emphasis, that shift enabled any company to launch websites. As we watched this shift happen in web content creation and deployment, I think we will see a similar shift in app creation and deployment. One of the worst trends now is the idea that everyone needs to learn how to write code, including Mayor Bloomberg. This is getting away from wider content development capability, unless you are already a programmer.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has an iOS Developer Program, which it pushes forward as ""the fastest path from code to customer"". The emphasis is still on code, much like the early days of HTML. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) launched its developer program late 2011 with the idea of ""People vs. Icons"" to showcase the change in Windows Phone. While Microsoft does have its own native Developer Tools, prominent Windows Phone vendor Nokia (NYSE:NOK) adds to that with its own Developer Tools.Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) provide a wealth of resources for Android Developers, though the emphasis is still on coding. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) offers separate developer tools for Android, and for its own Bada Operating System. While Samsung emphasizes the developer tools, and technical assistance, it also offers business services geared towards larger developers.Many other Android vendors offer similar developer programs to emphasize the customization of their individual platforms above the basic Android offering. Research In Motion (RIMM) offer native developer tools or HTML5 for building apps, but also inform content developers of a range of development platforms for BlackBerry BB10. Arguably, Research In Motion needs to offer developers more choices than other platforms to entice content developers, though the $10000 incentive to create certified apps might also draw in smaller content developers. While individuals do use these development tools, the process is more like Windows or Mac OS X software development, with coding and programming the primary focus.Click to enlargePrivately held Distimo is one of the companies that enables publishers and content developers to launch apps across multiple platforms. It also provides market insight, like the chart above, to show app trends. While some developers choose to stick with one or two platforms, there is an increasing trend towards optimizing for multiple App Stores across platforms. Despite increasing HTML5 usage, the trend for the next year or two will continue to be app development, and distribution remains platform specific for now.Google Play and Android still lead in free to download apps, which makes Apple iOS the dominant platform for developers to monetize their efforts. Unfortunately, many app developers struggle to get a return on investment. I think this points out a need for easier app creation. If the tools remained accessible only to coding experts and programmers, the future of apps would eventually be left to only the largest companies.Trends would follow what we have already seen on the desktop with application development for Windows and Mac OS X. Small companies like Mippin address the early stages of this need to move away from a programming centric environment, towards a more free flow creative design environment, by providing easy to use HTML5 centric tools.We saw this trend with the internet, as early coding centric companies gave way towards software tools that enabled more individuals to develop and launch content. The coding and programmers were not eliminated, but they no longer were the bulk of the workforce.This is not without some precedence. Originally publishing was the reserve of skilled operators of machinery. Apple helped launch a change in the industry with a graphic user interface computer. The first great revolution with the development of the Mac was from a company called Aldus, who developed a product called PageMaker. This was later bought by Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), who further developed the product until releasing its own desktop publishing application, called InDesign. What was once the domain of layout artists and highly skilled press operators, become accessible to a wide range of creative individuals. The printing presses are still running, and they do need skilled operators, but the primary labor force has shifted away from the printing presses.Printing is still important, and we are a long way from a paperless world, but the fastest growing segment of content consumption is now the internet. Increasingly that is moving towards mobile internet. In the early days of the internet, Adobe bought a company called Seneca, who produced one of the first What You See Is What You Get, or WYSIWYG, editors for HTML, called PageMill.It only took a few years for competitors to enter that market, with one of the better offerings being CyberStudio, from a company called GoLive. Adobe eventually bought GoLive Systems in 1999, then re-branded the product simply as GoLive. Around that time a competing company called Macromedia produced a WYSIWYG web editing software package called Dreamweaver. Macromedia also produced software capable of animating the internet, called Flash, while Adobe tried to push Scalable Vector Graphics, or SVG, as a standard.Originally, SVG technology was developed in cooperation with Microsoft, though it failed to gain as much traction in the market as more proprietary Macromedia Flash, which was arguably easier to work with and more accessible to content developers. In late 2005, Adobe completed its purchase of Macromedia, and not long afterwards discontinued development of Adobe GoLive. What Adobe had become to print publishing, with few rivals, it was now on its way to becoming with internet publishing.Adobe is all about content development, distribution, and management. Its software products aim to make these processes as seamless as possible, and strive to do the heavy lifting in the background. While Dreamweaver was a success for a while, and it seemed Flash usage was expanding, the introduction of the Apple iPhone and iPad, and negative comments from Steve Jobs, sent Adobe Flash technology into a downward spin. The new push for content developers became HTML5 and related technologies. The term HTML5 has become another overused buzzword, which refers to several related technologies, and not just one specific thing. The emphasis is now towards HTML5 capabilities, and away from Flash.One interesting Adobe offering that leverages Flash technology, yet allows content creation without Flash in the final output, is the Adobe AIR environment. This is still somewhat coding and programmer centric, but content developers familiar with content creation using Flash can make use of Adobe AIR to move their content onto most mobile platforms. This makes use of open source Flex technology, supporting Google Android, BlackBerry BB10, and Apple iOS. So far, support for Windows 8 content development has not been announced. One prominent company making use of these tools is SAP (NYSE:SAP), through its Crystal Solutions business intelligence tools.To address the growing demand for more mobile content, Adobe recently purchased Nitobi Software and Typekit. Typekit allows great text, or font, control of HTML content. Nitobi developed an interesting technology called PhoneGap, which allows creation of device native mobile applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Adobe is making PhoneGap available as an open source project, so the real reasoning behind the Nitobi acquisition is to integrate PhoneGap within Dreamweaver.Rather than let the technology fall into the hands of any competitor, Adobe is moving to make this technology more standard, which should help sales of Dreamweaver. Content developers can build apps without the need of platform specific Software Development Kits, or SDKs. Adobe will be launching PhoneGap Build as a Cloud based subscriber service, which will allow content developers to get ready-to-launch native apps by leveraging HTML5.Another recent HTML5 tool that is launching as a subscriber Cloud service is Adobe Muse. Content developers familiar with Adobe InDesign for creating printed pieces, may find it easy to use. Adobe have a few examples, which have been created with Adobe Muse, though to me it seems a bit like a variation on WordPress, which is a free and open source competitor. WordPress offers up content management, while Adobe Muse is more of a controlled environment for content development. Ease of use does not seem like much of a draw for content developers.Just over a month ago, Adobe rolled out its Creative Cloud. While it still offers a package deal with a non-ending license, the main idea of the Creative Cloud is using the various software offerings on a subscriber basis. If you look at the history behind Adobe, and its enabling of independent content developers, then Creative Cloud seems like a U-turn.Creative Cloud subscribers get up-to-date applications, but must download them as needed. There is also a security issue, in that Adobe will be handling content created by independent developers. Historically, many users of Adobe software do not update with each version, and when they do it is often less than on an annual basis. There may be some backlash from longtime users not willing to be forced into an upgrade cycle.While Creative Cloud addresses some piracy issues for Adobe, it creates new headaches for end users, who must now be connected to the internet to update their software each month. Given that Adobe has a history of bugs in their various software packages, it may seem to be an advantage to get more regular updates, but one downside may be that end users are forced by subscription to deal with issues and bugs until Adobe is ready to release an update. An informal poll held at GraphicDesign.com found that around two-thirds of current Adobe software users would consider Creative Cloud, though over half felt the pricing structure was expensive.Adobe Photoshop is so well known it is even used as a verb, as in someone photoshopping an image. The newest version, also part of the Creative Cloud, is CS6. This will become one of the biggest tests of Adobe's Creative Cloud, since Photoshop is often the application that creates the largest files. Users wanting to transfer content across devices may find serious bandwidth limitations to be a major issue. If the subscription model works, we may see the indications first with Photoshop.Subscriber based software is not a new idea, and one of Adobe's competitors, Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) makes use of it for its high end content creation software. The main difference is that Autodesk markets more to content development businesses, and not independent creative professionals. The high-end software that Autodesk produces is less price sensitive than Adobe software, though it is also more of a niche market amongst a limited user base.I am certainly not the only one unconvinced by Adobe's move to the Creative Cloud, as indicated by a recent downgrade from Jeffries Ross MacMillan. Early indications suggested that users were not upgrading at a rate seen in past Adobe Creative Suite launches.Adobe does offer some Touch Apps, including Photoshop Touch, optimized for Android and iOS tablets. So far there are only a few tablet software products from Adobe. The main idea behind this is further integration with its Creative Cloud, allowing the ability to pull up content files on tablets, and transfer files between desktop, laptop, and tablet while working through various Adobe software applications.Adobe enables content developers to create, distribute, or launch publications, websites, and apps, without knowing how to write code. The problem is not the software tools, which make content creators more efficient with each new version. What really is at stake is the pricing model, upgrade structure, and change in direction ushered in by the Creative Cloud. The discounts offered now are an indication that Adobe is not selling upgrades, nor new products, at a pace enjoyed with previous major product launches. Adobe still offer stand-alone versions of its software, but it is now up to end users to decide whether an upgrade is a good value. Low introductory Cloud pricing for existing users may lure some, though the downside for Adobe is reduced revenues early in this product cycle.I have been investigating the latest changes at Adobe for a while, and I held off this article until the 19 June earnings report. My feeling was that the changes to a subscription model may cause growing pains at Adobe. Previous major product revisions came in around every 18 months, and many long-term users would skip every other version in the upgrade cycle. Those ready for an upgrade may pause a bit at a continual payment system, no break for bug fixes, and being locked in to future updates. Often, the changes in various software packages require learning new ways to use them, which actually hinders productivity.The revenue and earnings reported 19 June 2012 by Adobe were close to analysts estimates. Adobe provided forward looking guidance for lower revenues, earnings, and growth in the future. Its aggressive early pricing may have earned it some converters to the subscription model, but it is now seen holding them back. Eventually, users of various Adobe software packages will want to upgrade, and they may find their only choice being a subscription model.Adobe is in the driver's seat with some of its software offerings, due to a lack of competing companies for some of its products. This does give it some advantage, but I think eventually it will need to remodel the subscription Creative Cloud, or it may find competitors moving into segments Adobe previously dominated. At this point, I am cautiously optimistic that Adobe can figure this out, though I expect it to struggle a bit over the next few quarters to find the right balance.Disclosure: I am long RIMM.Additional disclosure: I previously held shares in ADBE and may initiate a new long position within the next six months."

But I have reason to suspect that its luck will soon change.Proving its ValueThe biggest challenge for Adobe at the moment is trying to convince investors that it is still relevant and can regain its dominant brand. But for investors to be convinced, the company has to be able to demonstrate sufficiently that it can produce the very thing that all investors crave, which is growth. What makes this a bit more puzzling is that Adobe is still dominant in its core popular Creative Suite of programs - titles which include Photoshop, Pagemaker as well as the web design software of choice for developers, Dreamweaver. And of course who can forget Acrobat Reader and its flagship Flash plug-in.So with such industry standard acceptance of its products one would imagine that Adobe is doing pretty well. So what is the problem? That question is a bit more complicated, but one does not have to look too far to see that Apple (AAPL) has yet to adopt to its products in neither iPhones or iPads - and all of this while PC sales are slowing down. And then there is Google (GOOG) which offers several Adobe-type products for free through its Google Apps and Docs platform.So what can the company do to sustain growth outside of giving away its products? Will it partner with another software giant such as Microsoft (MSFT) to leverage its existing PC advantage since they both have a common enemy in Apple? This is one possible solution and it can get creative? After all it has built its brand around creativity.The Quarter That WasIn its most recent quarter the company showed that it is not doing as badly as some might think. The company reported revenue that increased 2% from the previous year - numbers that, (for the most part) arrived as expected. It did however report declines in both its digital marketing revenue as well as digital media - down 4% and 12% respectively on a sequential basis. I suppose one way to look at this is that it is improving and struggling in these areas as one (marketing) performed much better than expected, while its media products went the other way. It showed a drop of 4% in operating income from the same period a year ago - which was a slight concern. But this number also represented an increase of 17% from the previous quarter.So I have to say that the company is certainly showing signs of improvement. And depending on the type of investor that you are - whether glass-half-full vs. half-empty - there is a multitude of ways to look at its report. Its earnings were fair - at least to me. But does it inspire growth? And more than anything this is the question that I was hoping it would help answer. From an investment standpoint there are indeed some possible catalysts to send its shares moderately higher than where they are today.One possible cause for excitement is its soon to be released sixth iteration of its popular Creative Suite or CS6. This is in addition to the fact that the company is in the process of adjusting its business model from the conventional software box sale to a subscription model, a transition similar to what Microsoft has recently adopted with Office 365. It is still too early to see how this transition will unfold and what benefits (if any) are presented. One thing for certain is that Adobe will do what it can to get new customers to adopt the subscription platform by possibly lowering its prices.But while it may secure a few more customers, its impact on margins can't go ignored. Plus it runs the risk of enticing its existing customers to migrate over to the less expensive option. But then again, I'm certain that it has evaluated all of these risks. But as its recent earnings demonstrated, the company still has plenty of opportunities to grow if it can focus on what is working - it's digital marketing business.SummaryFor Adobe, growth in any aspect of its business won't be as easy as just focusing on which areas it wants to grow - particularly in its digital marketing as competition in this space is already crowded. Firms such as Oracle (ORCL) and the aforementioned Microsoft and Google are also doing their best to secure ad dollars that are left from companies looking to get their brand out in front of potential customers. But it is hard not to like Adobe at this level because the downside is pretty limited at this point - even though it is now at its 52 week high. A P/E of 22 is a little concerning, but for a tech company its size a high P/E has rare (if ever) mattered.Disclosure: I am long AAPL, MSFT, ORCL."

Rather than signal long-term trust and pay more generous long-term oriented dividends, many of them have adopted share repurchases to buy back their own stock. Investors welcome these announcements as they boost earnings per share and provide a lot of support for the share price during the repurchase periods.Adobe Systems (ADBE) the largest producer of graphic-design software, plans to buy back $2 billion of its own shares through the end of 2015. The plan is sufficient to retire about 12.1% of shares outstanding based on Adobe's current valuation of $16.5 billion. The announcement is welcomed by investors who currently receive no dividends. The timing of the repurchase is a little dubious as shares have already returned 17% this year, but still trade 30% below their all time highs of $48 in 2007. Since 2008, the company has already repurchased some 9% of its outstanding shares.During the last week, there was only one repurchase announcement made by Adobe totaled $2 billion, which makes this week a really quiet week in terms of buyback activity.Cash-rich companies still refuse to significantly raise long-term dividends. Rather, they use one-time repurchase agreements with far less signaling power as a dispersion tool of excess cash to their shareholders.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The company earned 57 cents per share, which was in line with estimates. The revenue came in at $1.045 billion, which was below expectations of 1.053 billion.For the current quarter, Adobe expects to earn 59 cents a share on sales of $1.115 billion, which is the midpoint of its guidance. Analysts are looking for Adobe to earn 60 cents a share on sales of $1.102 billion.Adobe CEO said that digital media and digital marketing will see tremendous growth ahead. While this may be true, it still does not take away from the fact that revenue growth has been pretty flat.The company also maintains a sizable amount of cash relative to debt. They have $2.5 billion in cash and $1.5 billion in debt. CEO Shantanu Narayen and the board need to understand that Adobe has become a fairly mature company. It needs to start reinstituting a dividend. The last time Adobe paid a dividend was in 2005.Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is seeing much more rapid growth than Adobe, has opted to pay out a dividend of 1.8% annually. To see a company like Apple paying out a decent dividend, when it is experiencing rapid growth shows the level of commitment it has to shareholders. Adobe, on the other hand, has not showed investors any sign of returning capital back to shareholders.I think Adobe could easily afford to pay 70 cents per share annually in dividends. This would put the yield a little over 2% and the payout ratio would still be under 50%.I believe Adobe should follow Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) strategy. Last March, Cisco declared it would officially began to start paying a dividend. This is because the company had realized that growth was slowing and that they would be better off returning capital to shareholders. Cisco currently yields 1.6%.Mr. Narayen needs to understand that Adobe has limited growth due to its size and market share. I hope he and the board seriously consider a reinstatement of the dividend.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

In Adobe Systems' (NASDAQ:ADBE) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $36 per share, slightly higher than where it is currently trading. Our report on Adobe Systems and hundreds of other companies can be found here.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index (click here for an in-depth presentation on our methodology), which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Adobe Systems posts a VBI score of 7 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the company, its attractive relative valuation versus peers, and bullish technicals. Though imperfect, we use Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Oracle (ORCL).Our Report on Adobe Systems  (Click to enlarge)Investment Considerations (Click to enlarge)Investment HighlightsAdobe Systems earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. We expect the firm's return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) to expand to 189% from 183.4% during the next two years.The firm is trading at attractive valuation multiples relative to peers, but our DCF process indicates a less compelling opportunity. We'd wait for a clearer signal on valuation before jumping into the firm's shares.Adobe Systems has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 26.7% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 1 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 20.8%.Although we think there may be a better time to dabble in the firm's shares based on our DCF process, the firm's stock has outperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter, indicating increased investor interest in the company. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. However, if the firm's share price fell below $27, we'd take a closer look at adding it to the market-beating portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter. In the spirit of transparency, we disclose the performance of the portfolio in our newsletter below: (Click to enlarge)The firm experienced a net income CAGR of about -1.5% during the past 3 years. However, we expect its net income growth to be better than its peer median during the next five years. (Click to enlarge)Most Recent Quarterly ResultsAdobe reported poor fiscal first-quarter 2012 results that disappointed most investors. Though we plan to update our valuation model on the firm, we don't expect to make a material change to Adobe's fair value at this time.The company's revenue advanced a modest 1.7% in its fiscal first quarter as subscription and services-and-support sales expansion offset weakness in its products segment, which fell over 4% from the same period a year ago. Adobe's gross margin, however, improved to 89.6% from 89.5% in last year's quarter. Operating income fell 4.4% from the year-ago quarter, as sales and marketing expenses surged. There was nothing concerning in the firm's below-the-line items, though the company did suffer from a higher tax rate in the quarter (31.5% versus 18% in last year's period). Diluted net income per share fell to $0.37 from $0.46 in the same period a year ago, capping off what we'd describe to be a disappointing quarter overall, in our opinion. On a non-GAAP basis net earnings per share came in at $0.57 (matching consensus estimates), cash flow from operations was $314.4 million in the quarter, and free cash flow was a solid $263.3 million, or 1.42 times net income (representing excellent cash-flow conversion). Free cash flow as a percentage of sales was a whopping 25%+ in the quarter, among the best free-cash-flow margin we've seen from any company.Looking ahead, the Photoshop and Acrobat developer is targeting revenue in the range of $1.09 billion to $1.14 billion for the second quarter of its fiscal 2012. On a GAAP basis, the company is looking for first-quarter net earnings to come in the range of $0.37 to $0.43 and the range of $0.57 to $0.61 on a non-GAAP basis (the midpoint slightly below consensus, which was at $0.60 per share). On a full-year basis, Adobe is targeting revenue growth of 6% to 8% (up from 4% to 6% previously) and adjusted diluted earnings per share to come in the range of $1.63 to $1.73 on a GAAP basis and $2.38 to $2.48 per share on a non-GAAP basis. We are optimistic that the company's upcoming release of its Creative Suite and Creative Cloud offerings will drive top-line expansion and are very impressed with Adobe's continued free-cash-flow generating prowess. However, we remain on the sidelines based on valuation.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (NASDAQ:ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Adobe Systems' 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 155%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.3%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate. (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge)Cash Flow Analysis (Click to enlarge)Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Adobe Systems' free cash flow margin has averaged about 30.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. We are the only firm that makes available fully-populated discounted cash flow models available to our financial-advisor clients here. At Adobe Systems, cash flow from operations increased about 38% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 76% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Adobe Systems' shares are worth between $27 and $45 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $36 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 21.8 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 11.6 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 5.8% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 5.6%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 35.7%, which is above Adobe Systems' trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.1% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Adobe Systems, we use a 10.3% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows. (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge)Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $36 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Adobe Systems. We think the firm is attractive below $27 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $45 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion. (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge)Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Adobe Systems' fair value at this point in time to be about $36 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Adobe Systems' expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $49 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $36 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.

455961,24866,2012-03-25T09:45:49-04:00,,"As investors, we are at a critical juncture. One path will lead us down the road of investing in mature firms that the efficient market has already fully appreciated. Another path takes us down the road of investing in smaller underfollowed companies that will potentially receive the Street's attention. With the Fed printing money like there is no tomorrow, the government spending beyond its means, and the lack of a gold standard, it's time for us to recognize that we are living in a Platonic world. Our economy has functioned through a currency that has deluded investors into the housing bubble and the internet bubble.Perhaps the best way to act now is to invest in companies within the social media sector. There is plenty of room to penetrate and significantly greater upside than downside. Again, smaller companies are likely to generate the highest returns. BroadVision (NASDAQ:BVSN) and Omtool (OTCPK:OMTL) are two meaningfully undervalued companies that are well positioned to outperform broader indexes. Since I first pitched Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) here and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) here, the stocks have taken off like a rocket, gaining 18.4% and 27.7%, respectively. At this point, however, these larger companies have closed their discounts, hence my optimism about BroadVision and Omtool from a fundamental standpoint.Towards proving my point of how social media and software businesses exploring ""the cloud"" have become less discounted than their smaller peers, I will run you through my DCF analysis on Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and will then triangulate the result with an exit multiple calculation and a review of the fundamentals compared to Google and Microsoft. I find that the company is actually overvalued.First, let's begin with an assumption about revenues. Adobe finished FY2011 with $4.2B in revenue, which represented a 11% gain off of the preceding year - deceleration. Analysts model a 9.3% per annum growth rate over the next half decade, and I find that this is reasonable in light of it being in-line with what is expected for the S&P 500.Moving onto the cost-side of the equation, there are several items to consider: operating expenses, capital expenditures, and taxes. I expect cost of goods sold to eat 10.5% of revenue versus 43% for SG&A, 18.5% for R&D, and 4.5% for capex.We then need to subtract out net increases in working capital. I estimate that this will hover around 3% of revenue. Taxes are estimated to trend around 20% - 25% of adjusted EBIT (accounting for non-cash depreciation charges).Taking a perpetual growth rate of 2.5% and discounting backwards by a, frankly, generous WACC of 9.5% yields a fair value figure of $29.70, implying 12.2% downside.All of this falls within the context of weak performance on the cloud:From a multiples perspective, Adobe trades at a respective 20.5x and 12.7x past and forward earnings versus 11.6x and 10.6x for Microsoft and 21.6x and 13x for Google. It should be noted that Adobe gained 26.1% since I first promoted it here. While I like the management, I don't think there is that much upside left.Microsoft and Google are both more attractive. Google is attractive due to the combination of its undervalued Google+ offering and meaningful penetration in the mobile landscape. Being that the company manages the largest search engine, it has significant synergistic value. But, again, the nature of it being heavily covered on the Street has since, relatively, closed much of the value gap compared to underfollowed companies. Assuming a multiple of 15x for Google and a conservative 2013 EPS of $46.50, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $697.50.Microsoft's attraction stems from its Windows 8 catalyst, leading brand, and strong position in cloud services. Windows 8 offers an innovative user interface that provides an appropriate answer to taking away share from Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) ""artsy"" market. Assuming a multiple of 13x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $2.90, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $37.70.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Disclaimer: We seek IR business from all of the firms in our coverage, but research covered in this note is independent.

445191,26031,2012-03-20T08:39:14-04:00,,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported first quarter net income of $185.2 million (37 cents a share), and non-GAAP net income of $1.045 billion (57 cents a share), just hitting analysts' estimates of 57 cents a share. ""We delivered solid earnings in Q1, achieved revenue within our targeted range, and began to build excitement for our upcoming creative product release,"" said Mark Garrett, executive vice president and chief financial officer, Adobe. Although still recommended as a 'buy' by most analysts (51.9%), many still are reluctant about Adobe's new Software as a Service (SAAS) subscription model, and are waiting to see if it is as profitable as Adobe predicted. Analyst ratings with regard to Adobe's ten nearest competitors are more optimistic (73.9% average 'buy' ratings), but I believe Adobe will continue to grow in the coming 18 months, as it begins to capitalize on some of the emerging new areas in which it has heavily invested. I also believe this trend is likely to continue in the future.Diversified across many platforms, products and services, Adobe became a bureaucratic nightmare over the last few years, and despite reasonable growth, seemed to be lacking a grasp on market currents and had endless unrecognized synergies. The HTML5 fiasco is a great example of Adobe's slow thinking. When Apple first released the iPhone, many were initially surprised that it lacked compatibility with the most dominant method, then, as well as now, to deliver rich media content to end users, i.e. Flash. However, Apple had no intention of supporting Flash, and instead invested heavily, through their relationship with the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), in HTML5, which would bridge the void. It was clear that Apple would not budge on this matter, and while the entire developer community was embracing HTML5 with an extra, borrowed hand, Adobe was waging their own little war with Apple, and tried to hold on for dear life to Flash as a dominant platform. Adobe failed, of course, at shunning HTML5, and recently began developing tools for HTML5 developers, although years late.Adobe has seen an incredible decade of growth as a result of constant innovation and embracing of new technologies, but it had become impossible to replicate past success without a major rethinking of future strategy. During the past year, Adobe has reorganized its profit units into two main categories: Digital Media and Digital Marketing. The Digital Media unit is responsible for tools and solutions for content creators, web application developers, and digital media professionals that enable them to create, promote, and monetize their content. In contrast, the Digital Marketing unit is responsible for solutions and services for digital marketers, advertisers, publishers, merchandisers, and web analysts, to allow multi-channel campaign execution, and delivery of personalized web experiences and media monetization. This type of focus is what Adobe really needed, and it is great to witness that it has a clear vision of how it will create value in the near future. Digital media creation and monetization are huge revenue sources, and although Adobe historically had a significant competitive advantage on the content creation side, it is only recently that it made a real push into the monetization and analytics space in which they are now a powerful player.Things have changed at Adobe, and it has successfully positioned itself to compete with new consumer demands. The new SaaS subscription model is not a new product, but rather a hint of things to come, and I believe that this is the reason Adobe has put so much emphasis on it in past presentations. The new SaaS model has been priced in a manner that would actually increase Adobe's overall sales (assuming the adoption rates predicted are, in fact, met), and looking forward I believe this is a more viable platform, as it will allow better integration with current Digital Marketing platforms and will most likely increase overall value to both the consumer and the company. Sales are, in fact, lower this quarter, but this is to be expected in anticipation of a new Creative Suite version, which will be released soon, and with subscription revenue up 38%, I wouldn't put too much emphasis on this fact. I am, however, concerned with the fact that, despite revenue from Digital Marketing increasing from 19% to 22%, cost of revenue has gone up from $254.9 million to $301.6 million, and has more than offset this growth. These costs are directly associated with the fact that Adobe has made many acquisitions is this space (including Efficient Frontier, Auditude, Typekit, Nitobi Software, IRIDAS, EchoSign and Demdex), and is working hard to integrate them into the Adobe product umbrella. ""We are raising our fiscal year revenue and non-GAAP earnings growth targets due to the addition of Efficient Frontier"" said CEO Garrett. I am optimistic, and while I would monitor these numbers closely, I expect them to decrease over the next 18 months, and expect significant growth from this sector.Given Adobe's dominant position and aggressive strategy, I believe that it is in a very strong position to exceed its new forecast guidance of $1.63 to $1.73 per share, and at current prices is undervalued.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in ADBE over the next 72 hours."

If compared with its competitors, the valuations of some companies like the coveted Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are better than Adobe, having a P/E of 15.52 and 11.63 respectively.However, the factor that argues in favor of the stock is its positive earnings growth over a sustained period of four quarters in the past year, surprising most of the analysts. Over the past three years the company has gradually increased its earnings per share from $0.80 to its current $1.65 due to its steady growth of earnings from $2,944 to $4,215. Further, there has also been a steady accumulation of its stocks by a few institutions who are finding the stock attractive at the current levels.Comparatively, in Apple, one finds that the stock has shown tremendous growth in its revenue and has a high EPS of $35.14 with a resultant P/E ratio of 15.52. This is one of the largest capitalized stocks listed in the exchanges with a total value of about $508 billion. It has also been highly stable with a beta close to 1 in comparison with Adobe's 1.61, resulting in providing a high degree of stability for its investors. But, the future of the company is still not clear since the earnings growth has remained steady last year as compared with earnings growth in the past three years resulting in low accumulation of financial institutions.The other stock that has been compared with Adobe in this industry is the global giant Microsoft. The company has a large market capitalization of $269 billion along with total revenue of about $72 billion. It also enjoys one of the highest operating margins of about 38% in its business compared with 28.4% of Adobe. It therefore has given a high EPS of $2.76 with a low P/E of only 11.63 against a high industry average of more than double of that figure. Since the company is also directing its efforts toward re-capturing its market share with new launches in the coming years, many analysts believe that these innovations will result in higher realization of income in the business. However, since the company's future growth plans are not very transparent, it is neither sold nor bought very heavily by the financial institutions.Apart from the competitors above, Adobe still enjoys a better realization than other high sales companies in this industry like the Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP AG (NYSE:SAP). Further, the technology being offered by Adobe is somewhat unique in this field and it is likely to remain so. The company did suffer in the past due to its non-compatibility of one of its product called ""Flash"" with that of iOS devices but with the launch of Android operating system by the Google )GOOG), it was able to bounce back. This has ensured favorable sales for quite some time in the near future. The analysts are therefore divided in their opinion with about two-third of them are bullish on this stock.Known for engaging in constant upgrading of its products resulting in creation of useful software for all operating systems, the organization's shift to a cloud based distribution of products is likely to provide a further fillip to its revenue. As per its own estimates, about 30 percent of its new clients had never used its product before, which suggests  that it is actually able to reach out to an untapped market. In my opinion this trend is likely to continue in the years to come.Having seen all the factors above, the company does have a case for good business going forward. Further, even with current earnings, the company is grossly undervalued vis-à-vis similar technology companies with immense potential for growth. In my opinion, the growth spectrum is expected to be almost 20% per annum post the economic recovery in Europe, which entails a similar increase in its net profits. Therefore, the stock is highly recommended for a ""buy on dips"" for medium- to long-term investors who are looking for a fairly high ROI and ROE.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
447241,24757,2012-03-20T19:31:34-04:00,,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) yesterday reported a Q1 2012 with only a slight increase  in revenue over Q1 2011, with a decline in earnings per share (EPS). I  use Adobe as a proxy for the computer software industry, but in this  case special factors may have contributed to the poor showing, so the  industry as a whole may do better in Q1. Adobe's fiscal Q1 2012 ended  March 2, 2012, so it is a frontrunner to firms that report on a regular  calendar basis (Q1's ending on March 31).GAAP revenue was $1.045  billion, down 10% sequentially from $1.152 billion but up 2% from  $1.027 billion year-earlier. Net income was $185.2 million, up 7%  sequentially from $173.7 million but down 21% from $234.6 million  year-earlier. Earnings per share were $0.37, up 6% sequentially  from $0.35 and down 20% from $0.46 year-earlier.At the analyst  conference call management claimed the poor showing was because of  customers beginning to anticipate the future release of Creative Suite 6  (CS6). Creative Suite comes in a variety of flavors incorporating a  number of Adobe software products such as the well-known Photoshop and  Acrobat. Because the web is transitioning to include mobile devices and a  new standard, HTML5, the products for web developers (including page layout, photo, animation, and video editing) are also changing rapidly.Because  of cost issues, developers sometimes do not upgrade to each new  version. This was particularly true during the recession. If is possible  that management is right in believing that the number of changes has  become so great that CS6 will be a must-do upgrade even for customers  that have CS5.5 or CS5, much less earlier versions.The problem  for web designers is that the design standards of 3 years ago, where  they could count on a (well-designed) site appearing the same to viewers  no matter which browser or operating system they used. Now every mobile  device has a different screen size and many device users prefer apps,  using a mobile web browser only as a last resort. What designers have  had to do since the iPhone introduction is either write multiple web  pages (one for desktop/notebook screens and one for each mobile device)  or include programming on a single page that reformats that page for  various screen configurations. Plus theyGiven the endless  complaining I have heard from fellow designers and programmers, I expect  CS6 will be a big hit if it actually delivers the ability to design  once and deploy, with minimal changes, to an assortment of devices. On  the other hand if they think CS6 fails in that regard, they will  probably cherry pick and only upgrade the Adobe software that work well  for them.The lower profits on flat revenues is attributable to up front investment in marketing and readying CS6 for deployment.A  number of pundits declared Adobe dead when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) refused to support  Flash animation on iPhones. So far Adobe is coping well with the new  environment. It is the nature of IT things to see rapid die-offs and new  growth.Another area Adobe seems to be doing well in is helping  its customers with dealing with another complex area, Internet  advertising. A well-designed web page that does not generate ad revenue  is not a good ROI. In January Adobe closed its acquisition of Efficient  Frontier, which should help keep Adobe in the forefront of this area.Today  Adobe closed down $1.35 to $33.16. Its price to earnings ration was  29.5, which is pretty steep even if you buy the back-with-CS6 story.  Adobe's lack of faith in its own future is shown by it's failure to pay a  dividend. On the other hand it generated $314 million in free cash flow  and ended with a cash balance of $2.8 billion.CS6 is scheduled  for release in late Q2, so probably in May. We will get a little bit of  revenue feedback when Q2 results are announced in June.Disclaimer:  I don't have a position in Adobe. I do use some Adobe software, and I  am long in a variety of technology stocks that might have relationships  with Adobe."

(NASDAQ:ADBE)  is scheduled to announce its fourth quarter fiscal 2011 results on  December 15, 2011 and we notice no movement in analyst estimates.Prior-Quarter SynopsisAdobe reported in line third quarter results, impacted by the weak  European market but supported by the cost control initiatives taken by  management.Adobe’s total revenue was $1.01 billion, down 1.0% sequentially, due to  a sluggish European market, which impacted both the key CS and the  Acrobat product lines.Margins increased sequentially on account of cost savings and a  favorable mix. The product gross margin, which is the primary reason for  Adobe’s high-margin profile, expanded 96 basis points sequentially.Fourth Quarter GuidanceAdobe expects revenue to come in at around $1.075 billion to $1.125  billion (up 6.1% to 11.0% sequentially). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is  pegged at $1.085 million.The company has projected GAAP operating margin of 26.5–29.5%, non  operating expense of $17–$21 million, a tax rate of 22% and share count  of 497– 499 million, yielding a GAAP EPS of 41–50 cents. The Zacks  Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 50 cents per share, up a  couple of cents since the company last reported. The surprise percentage  has been improving over the past three quarters, which could be the  reason for analysts raising estimates to the high end of the guided  rangeAgreement of AnalystsNone of the 10 analysts covering the stock revised their estimates in  the last 30 days. Even for fiscal 2011, there was no revision in the  last 30 days.Most of the analysts covering the stock expect revenue to come in line  with the Street consensus of $1.090 million. They expect EPS to come in  at $0.61, slightly ahead of the Street consensus of $0.60 on continued  cost control measures taken by management.However, the analysts are cautious about the foreign exchange headwinds  and the high exposure of the company in Europe, which is stricken by a  gloomy macroeconomic environment.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsFor the fourth quarter, there was no change to the Zacks Consensus  Estimate in the past 30 days. But it dropped a penny to 49 cents in the  past ninety days.For fiscal 2011, the Zacks Consensus Estimate dropped a penny to $1.84 in the past ninety days.RecommendationWe believe Adobe will come out with decent fourth quarter results owing  to its cost cutting efforts and improved execution. The company’s  compelling product lines, continued innovation and improving product  portfolio will provide a competitive edge.We believe that the ramp up of Creative Suite 6 and solid initial adoption of Creative Cloud could be potential catalysts.Recently, Adobe signed a definitive agreement to acquire Efficient  Frontier. The proposed acquisition will enhance the company’s Digital  Marketing suite by adding optimization capabilities for search and  display advertising while accelerating its entry into social  advertising.However, we believe that unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, European exposure and strong competition from Apple Inc.

306721,22762,2011-11-09T16:02:01-05:00,,"By John BiggsI can’t help chortling a little in Schadenfreude at Adobe’s (NASDAQ:ADBE) expected announcement that it is abandoning Flash for mobile devices. For most of the past two years, the anti-iPad contingent has cited flash incompatibility as the primary reason they weren’t going to give Apple their money yet the devices they did back – the Xoom, the Notion Ink Adam, the Playbook, and the like – all shipped with buggy or non-existent flash implementations. But I will not chortle, friends, because this is some serious stuff.First, I want to say Flash wasn’t a bad idea for mobile. It would have been amazing in the early years of the smartphone revolution. It was comfortable, familiar, and a great way to get app-like functionality onto phones that might not have been powerful or popular enough for a real development platform. However, it was never implemented in a way that added value and what value it had value really peaked a few years ago and has progressively dropped over the past few months. If I’m to pick nits, I’d like to show this video from Lee Owen.The native iOS application, as you see, worked smoothly and seamlessly. The Android/Flash implementation, on the other hand, exhibited lag, touch insensitivity, and a general “wrong-ness” that disturbs the purists out there. This is obviously evidence of Android’s “familiar lag” but it also part of Flash’s problem: all of the things people wanted to do in Flash, barring viewing web video (an activity that is better in dedicated apps anyway) – play Flash games, view flash animations (why?), and, I assume, see Flash advertisements – are poorly served by these laggy implementations. Flash made Flash look bad.Adobe never got mobile Flash right but even as they claimed injury at Steve Jobs’ mean comments, they were probably already moving past the issue internally. The depth of that move is now public. In their statement, it’s clear that they’d rather have Flash and Air exist as standalone apps rather than an add-on. They want center stage on your device, not playing second fiddle to someone else’s browser:You’ll also note that they want Flash to run high-end 3D games and other rich content, a possibility that is truncated by Flash in the browser. By going in this direction, they create two interconnected tracks – the direct to PC track and the direct to mobile track. Each track would presumably start at the same point and the differences in coding and development would be trivial, allowing an Adobe user to make a rich app on the desktop and the mobile device at the same time.Apple didn’t win this battle – if it even was a battle. Instead, Adobe ceded ground to the future in hopes of surviving another decade as the go-to tool maker for creative professionals. It’s fun to think that Steve Jobs had a hand in this, humiliating big bad Adobe with his Zen trickster techniques. However, it’s clear that Adobe is a business in crisis and that posturing doesn’t pay the bills.Original Post"
365531,24400,2012-02-14T15:15:42-05:00,,"Software giant Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has been struggling for quite some time now and it appears that its management does not know how to fix what hinders the company's progression beyond what it is known for. But that is not because they haven't put forth the effort as witnessed by the acquisition of Efficient Frontier a couple of months ago. This purchase arrived only a couple of weeks after it then scooped up Auditude, a firm with the technology to embed advertising within videos. But the questions that remain unanswered are how will these recent purchases bolster sales? And what will the company use to cure its many challenges and make this once dominant software player relevant again?Current ChallengesAdobe's once popular Creative Suite, which includes such popular titles as Pagemaker, Dreamweaver and the ever once dominant Photoshop, has seen steady declines in sales. When coupled with the slow demise of its flagship Flash Player, it forces investors to rethink the company's future - particularly one that suggests the continued dominance of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) - two of its biggest rivals.In its most recent quarter Adobe reported sales that improved 11% to $4.2 billion, exceeding the company's goal of 10% growth. Management cited ""strong performance in our digital media and digital marketing businesses."" In a recent investor presentation, Adobe estimated that the digital media opportunity, where it helps graphic and web designers develop digital content for games, publishing and mobile applications, is a $6 billion market opportunity. It also estimated that online video traffic will grow 51% annually between leading into 2014.Revenues increased slightly above goals. However, it was offset by declining product revenue. It is making headway in the subscription and services area where it showed some strength as both businesses grew modestly. During the announcement, the company revealed that one third of its new subscriber base was completely new to the Adobe brand and had no previous experience with the suite. This suggested that there are cloud opportunities that remain untapped in terms of its software distribution.By and large, it was a decent quarter, but nothing to write home about. The company's other challenge is in its shift from selling the conventional boxed software applications to a subscription model, where customer pay an annual or monthly fee for the software and related product support. But the company's main problem is the stiff competition from one of its top rivals, Apple. While we're at it, we can throw in Google as well as (to a lesser extent) Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).Microsoft - Aligning to Conquer TechsIt has been a little over a year now since rumors surfaced surrounding an acquisition of Adobe by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), ever since investors witnessed Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer enter Adobe headquarters to meet with Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen. It was a deal that (obviously) never transpired. However, I have often wondered where either company would be today if a transaction had actually taken place. I am certain that not only would the current status of both companies surely would have changed, but a deal would have likely altered the technological landscape of both Google and Apple.I think an Adobe and Microsoft union might actually be just enough to conquer the landscape of techs. If nothing else, it should work because they both have common enemies in Apple and Google. Of course a synergistic merger requires more than having similar adversaries, but marriages typically work better when both parties have at least one thing in common. But for Adobe and Microsoft, the great thing is that their similarities reach far beyond just their shared hatred for Apple and Google.First and foremost, they are both technology giants with a concentration in software applications that offer a wide array of desktop publishing and web-based applications. Secondly they are both now grossly irrelevant. Their irrelevance has had to do (in part) with the fact the that Google offers (for free) what both Microsoft and Adobe rely upon at the core of their sales - namely Google Docs.It offers users features that are similar to the experience of MS Office and it then allows the document to seamlessly convert into a PDF file. As Google increases its portfolio of free applications, there will be a point when users have to wonder why they are spending money on Microsoft and Adobe products. It will no longer make sense - that's assuming it ever did.As far as the hatred toward Apple is concerned, for Microsoft it goes without saying. It's the ""Mac vs. PC"" debate that has been around for years. There are some things that keep the earth on its axis and the dislike between the two companies serves that important purpose. If you value the sun coming up in the morning, then you should also hope that this hatred continues. But for Adobe, its dislike for Apple started upon the immediate success of the iPhone and subsequently the iPad due to their restriction on the use of Adobe's Flash player.SummaryThese are just a few examples in a long list of what has caused some of the battles between these companies over the years. While Google and Apple are doing exceptionally well in all areas of their businesses, I continue to wonder what an Adobe/Microsoft union would mean to the current technology landscape as well as its future as the cloud becomes more of a reality. Microsoft appears to be already embracing this future with its MS Office 365 strategy and as does Adobe to a lesser extent. But considering both Apple's and Google's early entry into the cloud space, it appears not much will change in terms of their dominant status except the year that it is.Disclosure: I am long MSFT, ORCL."

The product gross margin, which is the primary reason for  Adobe’s high-margin profile, shrunk 42 basis points sequentially, while  both subscription and services & support gross margin expanded  sequentially.Management GuidanceFor the first quarter, Adobe expects revenue to come in at around $1.025 billion to $1.075 billion.GAAP EPS is expected to be 37 cents to 43 cents, including stock-based  compensation of 13–14 cents, restructuring and other charges of 3 cents,  intangibles amortization charges of 5 cents and income tax adjustments  of 5 cents, excluding all of which, the non-GAAP EPS is expected to be  54–59 cents.

They  expect revenue growth to pick up from the second quarter following the  release of CS6 and the introduction of subscription pricing.The release of CS6 in April 2012 is expected to have long-term  beneficial effects in terms of growth, cash flow and profitability.  Additionally, Adobe’s plans to introduce a set of tablet-based and  cloud-connected apps should serve as an incremental revenue stream,  according to analysts.However, the analysts do not expect strong total operating margin  expansion due to the company’s huge growth investments and continued  hiring.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsIn the past 30 days, there was no change in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2012.Over the 90-day period, the Zacks Consensus Estimate dropped a penny to  46 cents for the first quarter and decreased by 2 cents to $1.98 for  fiscal 2012.Foreign exchange headwinds and the high European exposure could be the reason for the decrease in estimates.RecommendationWe believe that Adobe will come out with decent first quarter results  owing to its cost cutting efforts, improved execution, expanding  customer base and increasing revenue visibility. The company’s  compelling product lines (including the CS cloud initiative and digital  media products), continued innovation and strong balance sheet will  provide a competitive edge.Additionally, the ramp up of Creative Suite 6 and the solid initial  adoption of Creative Cloud should be potential catalysts.

Guidance will be especially critical during the 1Q 2012 released given the anticipated launch of CreativeSuite 6 during the May timeframe (2Q 2012).Keep a close eye on Adobe's earnings for clues ahead of Oracle's (ORCL) earnings release on March 20.Recent News03/06: UBS maintained a Buy rating on Adobe Systems and raised the price target from $34 to $37, according to StreetInsider.com.

(Chart courtesy of Stockcharts.com)SummaryAdobe shares are at a 10-month high ahead of the 1Q earnings release on Monday, March 19. The strength can be attributed to the strength in domestic and international sales, coupled with the anticipated launch of Creative Suite 6 and Creative Cloud. Historically, the Street has centered its focus on the upcoming quarterly guidance. That is no exception this time around, given these critical product launches slated for 2Q 2012. Against this backdrop, if the 2Q Adjusted EPS and Revenue guidance comes in at the low end or below consensus estimates, Adobe shares are vulnerable to significant downside. Conversely, if the outlook for the 2Q surpasses expectations, Adobe could make a run back toward the 52-week high established last May.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Disclaimer: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

However, there are times when a company is needlessly billed as ""losing to Apple,"" when in fact the whole issue is largely irrelevant.Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is one of the world's largest software firms, and its product line is an industry standard. Its Creative Suite line shows up in almost every facet of entertainment. Flash is an internet standard, and Adobe is ready to capitalize on HTML5, the most likely successor to Flash. Shares of Adobe have fallen by about 6% over the last year, and we think now is a good time to get into the stock, as Adobe is forecast to post record profits and revenues this quarter, and has a number of initiatives going for it.Adobe shares have been battered by concerns over the demise of Flash, around which its feud with Apple has centered. Investors have worried that a lack of a presence on iDevices would hurt Adobe, but we are not concerned with the past. We are looking towards the future, and think we Adobe will outperform going forward for the following reasons.Macroeconomic concerns have weighed on Adobe shares, but we think it is important not to let them muddy the bigger picture. On the call, multiple analysts asked about issues in Adobe's European division, and CFO Mark Garrett reminded them that:Too often, we lose sight of the bigger picture by obsessing over each quarter. Though Europe may have impacted the quarter, or the full year, Adobe does not see Europe as having a meaningful impact on its performance. It is important that investors do not lose sight of Adobe's long-term success in the midst of some short-term cloudiness.We think Adobe represents a great investment due to its leadership in HTML5 and its cloud initiatives.

It is a valuable company. Its graphic technology is essential. It is making the right moves here, moving toward HTML5, toward standards, and away from areas where it has no control over standards, like mobile.But for the next few weeks bears will rule the Adobe pit. As Dan Florio writes at Polygeek, “Adobe has lost so much credibility with the community that I’m hoping they are bought by someone else.” No one else is coming in for them. Even a company like Apple that may have $15 billion floating around in its seat cushions, just wouldn't have any use for the company. The current price still represents operating assets, over $1 billion coming in per quarter in sales, of which one dollar in five gets down to net income after taxes. There is a there, there. And that there is worth serious cash. At its present level Adobe is selling at about 15 times trailing earnings, a level similar to Apple. Get it down to 12 and it's a screaming buy.Like I said, look for an entry point and watch for news. Expect some takeover rumors. Don't bite on them. This is a decent company that can generate market-average earnings. Wait for a below market-average price, then pounce.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
294956,24491,2011-09-21T05:54:43-04:00,,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported weak third-quarter results Tuesday, but provided a range for its fiscal fourth-quarter results that topped consensus estimates, representing revenue growth of 10% and earnings growth of 20% at the high end of its guided range. We’re maintaining our fair value estimate of $35 per share and make available our 16-page equity research report here.The firm’s total revenue advanced a modest 2% in the period, as expansion from subscription and services and support sales offset declines in product revenue. The company noted record educational revenue, strong growth in its digital video products, and solid performance with Acrobat. Services and support revenue grew a whopping 39% during the period, and we expect continued rapid expansion from this revenue line in coming periods. Gross profit margin on this revenue stream is in excess of 35%, significantly greater than the paltry 3% gross margins on product sales, so this represents a nice mix shift. The firm’s operating margin, however, fell below 28% from over 30% in the prior-year period, as a result of lower profitability from subscription revenue and a ramp in sales and marketing and research and development costs. Net income fell 15% in the quarter, but cash from operations advanced over 10% -- a nice showing. We view Adobe as a cash cow, with its free cash flow (free cash flow divided by sales) in excess of 25% in the period. The firm’s significant cash-flow generation prowess is one major reason why we think using a DCF valuation model is the best way to value the firm. We make our DCF valuation model template available here.Adobe indicated that it expects sequential growth in all of its business lines (except Print and Publishing) and across all geographies. The company guided its fourth-quarter operating margin to 26.5% to 29% (on a GAAP) basis, a range we think is readily achievable, given higher-margin services/support revenue expansion and the flexibility provided by discretionary purchases in sales and marketing and research and development. The company guided its fourth-quarter earnings per share outlook to between $0.57 and $0.64 on a non-GAPP basis, a range that Adobe will hit on the high end, in our opinion. Adobe also noted that it will soon be introducing a broad set of tablet-based and cloud-connected apps and services, as well as Adobe Carousel, a new cloud-connected imaging app for Mac OS and iOS devices. All things considered, Adobe faces a number of challenges as its industry remains in transition (software is moving to the cloud, etc.), but we think the firm’s cash flow stream and new product offerings make it an attractive consideration for long-term investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

299817,24866,2011-10-16T05:47:21-04:00,,"Considering all of the talk about the shift towards cloud computing, one company, in my view, that has not received enough attention is content solutions provider Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE). Although Adobe does not offer a dividend yield, it is a safer investment than its beta of 1.51 would suggest. This is so because Adobe remains by far the leader in its field while having revenue diversified over key customer areas where demand is relatively protected from macro concerns. It offers business, mobile, and web solutions for content optimization and distributes products through value-added resellers, independent software vendors, and OEMs. Although the firm is likely experiencing price pressure in OEMs due to the revision in its ""Risks"" statement, top-line growth continues to remain strong.In particular, Omniture continues to grow subscription revenue while new areas are being explored through acquisitions. Adobe recently acquired Typekit and Nitobi for around $91M. While the purchase price is minimal, the two businesses provide a fair amount of revenue synergies and opportunities. To get an idea, consider what services the two offer. Typekit provides a cloud subscription plan for different fonts while Nitobi's PhoneGap allows user to develop mobile apps in either JavaScript or HTML5. Combined with Adobe's flagship content services, the whole is much bigger than the parts.At the same time, I am slightly concerned about Digital Media operations, which declined by 10% in terms of Photoshop sales in recent earnings. Digital Publishing should help make up some of the losses as it adds more than 500 products to its portfolio while expanding margins through outsourcing capabilities. According to the CEO:The upside here is thus huge in terms of scale expansion. Particularly, investors should carefully monitor the performance of Creative Cloud, since it is one of Adobe's more innovative solutions and provides an indicator of likely performance in cloud software. The program will offer several Touch apps and CS products, in the process aiding brand recognition.Digital marketing also is promising, as ad spending is expected to exceed $100B by 2013. And Adobe provides a vast amount solutions that channels through various platforms - mobile, search, email, web, display, and social - with the diversification establishing favorable asymmetric risk for investors. Its recent release of SocialAnalytics will help further its dominance in this area and will increase demand for other cloud products.Overall, given the above fundamentals, I find that analysts have been too pessimistic on top-line growth. I model revenue growing by 10.5% to $4.2B in 2011 and then by roughly 11.1% in the following year, approximately 300 basis points ahead of other estimates. Consensus estimates for EPS are that it will grow by 18.1% to $2.28 in 2011 and then by 11.8% and 7.8% in the next two years.Note that I believe that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) provides a more favorable risk/reward and upside from cloud computing.

292366,24852,2011-09-08T07:36:37-04:00,,"Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a computer software development company operating in five segments: Digital Media Solutions, Digital Enterprise Solutions, Creative and Interactive Solutions, Omniture, and Print and Publishing. While most people are familiar with Adobe through Adobe Reader and Adobe Flash Player, these include only a small fraction of the company’s revenue. The bulk (84%) is comprised of professional graphics and communication software. Adobe Flash and Photoshop are the industry leaders, well ahead of competitors and open source software. It is the most used software in universities, creating a loyal customer base that has been trained from youth to preform best when using Adobe’s software. Adobe ($24.40 as of 9/7/11) is selling at a PE of 13, well below its 31 median PE, and 11x net free cash. The company has an estimated $5.32 of cash and short term investments per share. Debt is 12% of cap, 60% of it long term, and no liabilities of a pension plan. Current ratio is a strong 3:1. Its margins are around the industry average, however it has a lower return on total capital of 13% vs. industry average of 23%. Adobe fell 32% since May. Competition fears from big companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) as well as overall market conditions have contributed to this decline. If Adobe cannot lead the innovative front it may lose market share. However, Adobe has carved a strong niche in graphic design and media software and it is not likely they will lose this position anytime soon. Software companies tend to get hurt in a recession when demand for software slides. Adobe’s strong financial strength adds safety to this otherwise risky industry. Solid revenues, cash flow, earnings, and intangible assets of brand loyalty make Adobe a serious consideration at this price. Disclosure: I am long MSFT, and may initiate a buy of ADBE within the next 72 hours."

The problem is that it's a move that seldom works for investors.The class market may pay more than the mass market. But it's so much smaller that you wind up, at best, treading water. Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) decade-long move into server software is one example. But there are many others, ranging from Computer Associates to Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ).The biggest money is in the biggest markets, and mass market players must focus on those markets to remain viable. The company's announcement of a workaround enabling Flash to play on iOS devices is a smart move, but only underscores the problem it has with growing elements in that mass market. If Apple hates you, you got trouble.Among large tech outfits only IBM (NYSE:IBM) has made it work by adding a huge services revenue stream to its hardware and software, selling solutions rather than just better gear. But they were always more of a business-to-business company anyway.Most analysis of Adobe has been technical in nature lately, or focused on the most recent results. It makes a lot more sense to focus on strategy, and the best way to find a company's strategy is to examine its press releases over time:None of these deals are bad in and of themselves. Right now Adobe's balance sheet still looks quite handsome. But revenue growth is slowing as it loses traction in the mass market, and these deals just look too small to compensate.Adobe began life as a PC software company. It is a mass market provider of graphic and video solutions. If it's not going to remain that, and if it's not focused on growing that business, but replacing it, investors would be wise to leave ADBE alone, no matter how many technical analysts call it a “bargain” after falling in value by “just” 25% over the last year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: Added the latest news to the story."

259719,20568,2011-03-23T10:41:33-04:00,,"Adobe Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)  reported earnings for the first quarter ended February 2011 that was  just slightly ahead of the Zacks Consensus estimate. Management stated  that the situation in Japan put $50 million of revenue at risk,  primarily in the CS and Acrobat product lines.Revenues from other parts of the world are not likely to be impacted.  Detailed commentary on the situation in Japan was not available,  primarily because the exact impact is still hard to determine. This  could be the reason that Adobe share prices lost 0.43% in after-hours  trading, after climbing 1.67% during the day yesterday.RevenueAdobe’s total revenue was $1.03 billion, up 2.0% sequentially, 19.7%  year over year and within management’s expectations of $1-1.05 billion  (down 0.8% to up 4.2% sequentially). Revenue was more or less in line  with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02 billion. Currency had a $5.9  million negative impact on year-over-year comparisons (there were no  gains from the currency hedge program).Products generated 82% of Adobe’s revenue, up 1.4% sequentially and up  19.7% year over year. The year-over-year increase in product revenue was  primarily driven by the CS5 and Acrobat product lines. Subscription  revenue comprised 10% of revenue, up 5.8% sequentially and up 11.2% from  the year-ago quarter. Services & Support brought in the balance,  representing sequential and year-over-year increases of 2.8% and 33.1%,  respectively.Revenue by SegmentThe Creative Solutions segment, which remains Adobe’s  largest, generated 41% of total quarterly revenue. Segment revenue was  up 4.9% sequentially and 27.7% from last year. The CS5 poduct line  continued to do well in the last quarter and a mid-cycle release has  been slated for later this year.The digital publishing suite (for creation, distribution, monetization  and analysis of digital content) became broadly available during the  quarter and Adobe stated that initial demand was strong all over the  world. The segment now includes the Flash platform products, prospects  for which are very bright according to Adobe.Management quoted the Strategy Analytics forecast of a 132 million unit  increase in smart phone shipments in 2011, 36% of which would support  Adobe’s Flash Player. Flash penetration of smart phones and tablets has  been growing over the last few months and video streaming through flash  increased 100% in 2010, according to management.Knowledge Worker revenues were up 7.0% sequentially  and 9.6% year over year to 18% of total revenue. Adobe attributed the  increase in the last quarter to both volume increases and price hikes.  Entrprise adoption of the newly launched Acrobat 10 was one of the  important drivers in the last quarter.The Enterprise business brought in 10% of Adobe’s quarterly revenue,  representing increases of  1.4% and 32.8% from the previous and year-ago  quarters, respectively. Day Software content management products have  been integrated within the segment and Adobe’s customers are  increasingly buying its customer experience management philosophy.Omniture generated nearly 11% of revenue in the last quarter,  increasing 1.7% sequentially and 15.5% year over year. Adobe remains  very upbeat about Omniture. And if Omniture’s transaction increase of 60  million and enterprise customer retention rate of 95% are anything to  go by, the business certainly seems to be doing very well.Revenue by GeographyAdobe’s business is fairly well diversified across geographies,  although the Americas region remains the largest contributor to its  revenues, with a revenue share of around 49%.The EMEA region accounted for another 31% in the last quarter, with the  balance coming from Asia. The Americas were up 2.2% sequentially, while  the MEA was down 1.8%. Asia was much stronger, given that Japan is  seasonally stronger in the months of February and March (February is  included in the fiscal first quarter and March in the fiscal second  quarter).MarginsAdobe’s pro forma gross margin for the quarter was 91.1%, up 3 bps from  91.0% in the previous quarter and down 60 bps from 91.7% in the  comparable year-ago quarter. The gross margin is typical of a software  company and variations are generally related to the mix of revenues  between categories.The product gross margin, at 96.4%, is the primary reason for Adobe’s  high-margin profile, with both subscription (gross margin of 54.9% in  the last quarter) and services & support (gross margin of 63.2%)  generating significantly lower margins. In the last quarter, the product  gross margin increased 59 bps sequentially, subscription increased 390  bps and services & support declined 700 bps. Subscription was the  only category that grew from the year-ago quarter.Adobe reported operating expenses of $607.5 million were 2.4% higher  than the previous quarter’s $593.4 million. The operating margin of  32.0% was down 21 bps sequentially from 32.2%. The slight decline in  operating margin may be attributed to higher R&D and engineering  costs (as a percentage of sales) that was almost totally offset by flat  to slightly lower cost of sales, S&M and G&A expenses (as a  percentage of sales).Net incomeOn a pro forma basis, Adobe generated a net income of $250.8 million,  or a 24.4% net income margin compared to $249.2 million, or 24.7% in the  previous quarter and net income of $164.4 million or 19.1% net income  margin in the same quarter last year.The fully diluted pro forma earnings per share (NYSEARCA:EPS) came in at 49  cents, similar to the November quarter and up from 36 cents in the  quarter ended February 2010. Our pro forma estimate excludes  restructuring charges, amortization of intangibles and investment gains  and tax adjustments, but includes deferred stock compensation. Our pro  forma calculations may differ from management’s presentation due to the  inclusion/exclusion of any items that were not considered by management.On a fully diluted GAAP basis, the company recorded a net loss of  $234.6 million ($0.46 per share) compared to $268.9 million ($0.53 per  share) in the previous quarter and $127.2 million ($0.24 per share) in  the prior-year quarter.Balance SheetAdobe ended with a cash and investments balance of $2.64 billion, up  $168.8 million during the quarter. Cash and investments were nearly 32%  of total assets at quarter-end. Cash generated from operations was  $332.1 million. Principal uses of cash during the quarter included $36.6  million on acquisitions, $32.4 million on capex and $125.0 million on  share repurchases.At quarter-end, Adobe had $1.51 billion in long term debt, taking the  net cash balance to $1.13 billion. Including long term liabilities, the  debt-cap ratio was a mere 25.9%.GuidanceAdobe provided guidance for the second quarter on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis.Revenue is expected to come in at around $970 million to 1.02 billion  (down 5.6% to 0.72% sequentially). The guidance excludes $50 million of  revenue that Japan was expected to generate in next quarter. The  mid-point of the guidance range assumes sequential growth in the  Enterprise and Omniture businesses, with Creative Solutions, Knowledge  Worker and Print & Publishing segments down slightly (impacted by  Japan).Beginning in the first quarter, the Creative Solutions segment was  split into Digital Media Solutions and Creative and Interactive  Solutions. Digital Media includes Adobe’s imaging and video-related  products, while Creative and Interactive include the CS product lines,  as well as the Platform segment, which is currently being reported as a  separate segment.The GAAP operating margin is expected to be 24.5-27.5%, non operating  expense $16-20 million, tax rate 22%, share count 510-512 million,  yielding GAAP EPS of 33-40 cents.On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin is expected to be 34-36%, non  operating expense $16-20 million, tax rate 22%, share count 510-512  million, yielding a non-GAAP EPS of 47-54 cents.Our RecommendationWhile we remain positive about Adobe’s market position, its compelling  product lines, strong balance sheet and the end market recovery that  should positively impact its results, Japan will be a slight negative  this year and possibly next year as well. Management’s estimate of a $50  million top line impact indicates that approximately 5% of revenue is  at risk.We think the actual impact could be slightly higher, since Japan makes a  more substantial contribution and the second quarter is usually a  stronger quarter. Guidance looks conservative, even if we are to add  back the estimated $50 million impact.Additionally, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  continues to maintain its distance, promoting HTML 5 instead. As a  result, the shares currently have a Zacks Rank of #4, implying a  short-term Sell recommendation."
294538,24706,2011-09-19T15:10:16-04:00,,"OverviewAdobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) is scheduled to report 3Q 2011 earnings after the close of trading on Tuesday, September 20. The results are typically reported at 4:05 p.m. EST and will follow with a conference call at 5:00 p.m.Outliers & StrategyRecent NewsSummaryAdobe shares have been hit hard in recent months, stemming from increased macroeconomic concerns, slower enterprise IT spending, and increased competition. The threat from Apple and failed adoption of tablet PCs using Flash also pulled Adobe shares lower in recent months. Against this cautious backdrop, however, valuation appears compelling at just over 10x forward earnings and 3.1x sales. The sentiment surrounding Adobe has also succumbed to depressed levels, leaving the door open for a potential upside surprise and meaningful move higher should results top estimates. Should the future outlook come in below Street estimates, however, the March 2009 lows near $23 could be in play.Disclaimer: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

275757,23479,2011-06-20T14:50:54-04:00,,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is expected to announce its Q2 2011 earnings on June 21st. During the last earnings call, the company revised its revenue outlook for Q2 down by $50 million due to the Japan strategy (see Lowering Adobe Estimates on Japan Impact). Adobe also mentioned that it would introduce a mid-cycle release of creative software version 5 (CS 5), [1] which it then actually released in April 2011. [2]During the upcoming earnings release, we will watch for how Adobe handled the situation in Japan and whether it managed to beat its revenue forecast for Q2 or not.  Adobe mainly competes with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Quark and Corel in this market.We will also look for  management’s comments on how CS 5.5 release  fared. Every Creative software release is important for Adobe as this  software accounts for more than 50% of our $37.28 price estimate for Adobe stock. Our price estimate for Adobe stock stands about 20% above market price.Will a Mid-Cycle Release be Successful?Historically a new CS software version is released approximately every 18 to 24 months, and Adobe has seen high volume sales growth near its launch date. Due to this reason, its market share has remained volatile and often jumps during or shortly after a software release.In 2010, Adobe largely made up for its market share loss a year earlier with the launch of CS5. Adobe’s Creative Suite 5 (CS5) was released in May 2010 while the next full release CS 6 is expected to be launched in 2012.Chart created using Trefis' app The success of CS 5.5 will decide the fate of Adobe’s market share in 2011. For now, we are conservative on our 2011 market share forecast for Adobe as it may turn out that a mid-cycle release may not have a material impact on its software sales.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"

The company announced the results for the first quarter of fiscal 2011, reporting record revenue of $1.03 billion, which an increase of 20% from the same quarter in 2010. Adobe just beat analyst estimates of $0.57 per share; posting non-GAAP diluted earnings per share at $0.58.Adobe’s non-GAAP operating income was $400.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, compared to $289.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 and $384.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Non-GAAP net income was $298.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2011, compared to $211.7 million from same quarter in the previous year and $285.7 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen said in a statement: ""Our record results in Q1 represent our sixth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth. Adobe’s vision for transforming how the world is creating, measuring and delivering digital experiences is resonating with our customers, and our solutions are enabling us to target large addressable markets that are fueling our growth.""In terms of financial targets, Adobe remained cautious due to the recent earthquake and tsunami in Japan. Says CFO Mark Garrett: ""Our hearts go out to everyone in Japan. Although Adobe has a very diversified business, Japan is our second largest country from a revenue perspective and March is typically our biggest revenue month of the year there due to fiscal year-end spending. Given the uncertain business environment in Japan, we are being prudent and have reduced our revenue expectation for our second quarter by $50 million - or roughly one-third of our original Q2 revenue expectation for Japan.""Adobe is targeting revenue of $970 million to $1 billion for the second quarter of 2011.Original post"

254720,23479,2011-02-24T10:12:36-05:00,,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is famous for developing software tools used for the purpose of website designing, video editing, print layouts and digital publishing. Adobe’s Creative Suite of software is used by creative professionals such as graphic designers, photographers as well as hobbyists to create visually rich print and online content. Such content includes photographs, videos, animations and mobile content. Adobe is the largest player in the creative software market and has around 46% market share. It competes mainly with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Quark and Corel in this market.Here we explore upside and downside scenarios for Adobe’s Creative software business, which accounts for around 55% of the $37.43 Trefis price estimate for Adobe stock. Our Adobe price estimate currently stands about 5% above market price.(Slideshow created by using Trefis Pro app)10% Downside – Risk of Adobe’s Market Share DeclineAdobe sells some of the popular software such as Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Flash Professional and InDesign, which has placed Adobe in a dominant position in the creative software market. Historically, Adobe’s share in the creative software market has fluctuated between 40% to 50%, and has historically increased when a new software version has been released.(Chart created by using Trefis' app)Creative Suite 3 (CS 3), which was released around Q1 2007, was successful because of the Adobe’s acquisition of Macromedia that allowed it to add Flash and Dreamweaver for the first time ever. CS 5, which was released in May 2010, was again a success as it had a few new features like the ability to handle large amounts of data at faster speeds and added new features for designers such as the ability to work on 3D objects and videos. Going forward, we estimate that Adobe’s market share will continue to increase as and when a new software version is released and then decline when the initial uptake for the new software version has died down.However, Adobe will need to continue to bring compelling features for every new version of its Creative suite to justify the uptick in its market share. This presents a risk to its market. Adobe has lost market share in the past such as its loss in market share following the release of CS 4. Its market share declined from 48% in 2008 to 43% in 2009 despite the release of CS 4 in October 2008, since it lacked compelling features for the users to upgrade their software.In the scenario where its market share declines to 36% by the end of Trefis forecast period, there could be a downside of 10% to our estimate for Adobe stock.(Chart created by using Trefis' app)10% Upside – Total Creative Software Market Increases at a Faster RateWe believe that the driving factors behind the growth of Creative software market are many. This includes:We estimate that the total market in terms of number of software licenses sold will continue to grow from 5.7 million in 2010 to 7.6 million by the end of Trefis forecast period, at an average annual growth rate of around 4%.However, if the market increases at a faster annual growth rate of 7% for the total market to reach 9 million by the end of Trefis forecast period, there could be an upside of 10% to our estimate for Adobe stock.Disclosure: No position"
259534,20568,2011-03-22T12:45:30-04:00,,"Adobe Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)  is slated to release its first quarter 2011 earnings results on March  22. Analyst estimates have not moved around too much in the past few  days and we think this could be because they are awaiting management  commentary on the situation in Japan.NegativesWe expect downward revision to estimates for following quarters based  on the crisis in Japan. Adobe has a significant portion of business  coming from the country (12.6% in 2010, 13.9% in 2009 and 12.6% in  2008). So the closing down of facilities, shipping out of important  personnel (both Japanese and other nationals) as a result of the  earthquake and risks related to the release of radioactive materials are  bound to have an impact on its results.Despite limited response from analysts so far, investors are  discounting the shares. Adobe has seen its share price dropping 8.7% in  the four days following the catastrophe, although shares appear to be  stabilizing now.Separately, Adobe’s Flash platform remains shut out of Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) products, which is something of a negative for growth.Margin expansion could also be a challenge in the near term, given the  step-up in sales and marketing expenses, as well as focus on growth  through small acquisitions, many of which are likely to have lower  margin profiles than AdobePositivesAdobe’s leadership in several key markets, solid business model, and  the success of new products and acquisitions will determine its future.Particularly, Adobe is seeing strong adoption of its CS5 and the CS6  suite (expected to launch later this year) is also likely to be popular.  Its Acrobat platform is also seeing traction and did particularly well  in the last quarter. Omniture has proved to be a good addition and the  company’s online marketing suite seems to be going places.Additionally, Google Inc’ (GOOG - Analyst Report)  Android has embraced Flash and Adobe will increase compatibility with  HTML 5 with new generations of its Flash platform. So while being shut  out of Apple’s business is not a good thing, the net impact may not be  too negative. Especially considering the fact that the Japan crisis  could see Apple facing component shortages related to its iPad2, which  will no doubt impact its sales.Adobe’s ability to generate strong cash flows and its end market  diversity that protects against downside to these cash flows are other  positives.Fourth Quarter RecapAdobe beat the Zacks Consensus in the fourth quarter, helped by the  turnaround in the commercial and enterprise markets. We were  particularly encouraged by the enterprise and Omniture segments, which  grew strongly both with respect to the previous and year-ago quarters.  Further details are available here – Adobe Beats on Enterprise StrengthGuidance and RecommendationOn a non-GAAP basis, Adobe expects first quarter revenue of $1-1.05  billion (down 0.8% to up 4.2% sequentially), operating margin of 37-38%,  non operating expense of $16-20 million, a tax rate of 22% and a share  count of 508-510 million, yielding a non-GAAP EPS of 54-59 cents.Adobe also stated that the Creative Solutions segment would be split  into Digital Media Solutions and Creative and Interactive Solutions.  Digital Media will include Adobe’s imaging and video-related products,  while Creative and Interactive will include the CS product lines, as  well as the Platform segment, which is currently being reported as a  separate segment.We do not see the company failing to meet guidance and think that a  moderate beat is on the cards. However, we expect a weaker second  quarter and 2011 outlook.We have a short-term (1-3 months) Hold rating on Adobe shares, as indicated by the Zacks #3 Rank."

The company’s results reflect  the gradual turnaround in the broader commercial and enterprise markets.RevenueAdobe’s total revenue was $1.01 billion, up 1.8% sequentially, 33.1%  year over year and just over management’s own expectations of $950  million to $1 billion. Revenue also exceeded the Zacks Consensus  Estimate of $988 million by 2.0%. Currency had a $7.4 million ($6.7  million excluding currency hedge) negative impact on year-over-year  comparisons.Products generated 82% of Adobe’s revenue, flat sequentially and up  23.9% year over year. The year-over-year increase in product revenue was  primarily driven by the CS5 and Acrobat product lines. Subscription  revenue comprised 10% of revenue, up 1.8% sequentially and up 172.2%  from the year-ago quarter. Services & Support brought in the  balance, representing sequential and year-over-year increases of 22.5%  and 53.4%, respectively.Revenue by SegmentThe Creative Solutions segment, by far Adobe’s largest, generated 54%  of total quarterly revenue. Segment revenue was down 1.4% sequentially,  while increasing 26.3% from last year.Favorable comps aside, the year-over-year increase was helped by the  launch of Photoshop Elements products, which led to progressively  stronger demand through the quarter. Adobe also mentioned several large  licensing contracts that were closed during the quarter.Knowledge Worker revenues were up 4.5% sequentially and 13.8% year over  year to 17% of total revenue. Adobe expressed excitement regarding the  segment, attributing the increase from the year-ago quarter to continued  success of Acrobat 9 as well as the newly launched Acrobat 10.  Enterprise adoption of Acrobat volume licensing remains phenomenal,  according to management.   The Enterprise business was very strong, generating 10% of Adobe’s  quarterly revenue, signifying increases of  10.6% and 66.7% from the  previous and year-ago quarters, respectively. The recently acquired Day  Software contributed $5.4 million, but was obviously not the sole reason  for the increase. The core business did extremely well, helped partly  by the improving commercial climate and stronger government spending, we  think.Omniture also generated 10% of revenue, increasing 8.1% sequentially.  Adobe has now completed a full year with Omniture in its ranks and  management was very upbeat about the success of the combined operations.  And if Omniture’s enterprise customer retention rate of 95% is anything  to go by, the business certainly seems to be doing very well.Revenue by GeographyAdobe’s business is fairly well diversified across geographies,  although the Americas region remains the largest contributor to its  revenues, with a revenue share of nearly 49%. The EMEA region accounted  for another 32% in the last quarter, with the balance coming from Asia.Revenues from EMEA were up 11.6% sequentially, while those from the  Americas and Asia were down 1.9% and 3.2% sequentially. Adobe stated  that demand was strong in the EMEA and stable in the Americas and Asia.MarginsThe pro forma gross margin for the quarter was 91.0%, down 70 bps from  91.7% in the previous quarter and 55 bps from 91.6% in the comparable  quarter of 2009. Variations in gross margin are generally related to the  mix of revenues between categories.The product gross margin, at 95.8%, is the primary reason for Adobe’s  high-margin profile, with both subscription (gross margin of 51.0% in  the last quarter) and services & support (gross margin of 70.2%)  generating significantly lower margins. However, while the product gross  margin saw a 72 bp sequential decline, subscription and services &  support expanded 219 bps and 125 bps, respectively. All categories  witnessed very strong increases from the year-ago quarter, due to easier  comps/higher volumes.The Creative Solutions segment generated a gross margin of 94.0%, down  84 bps sequentially, Knowledge Worker 96.7% (down 26 bps), Enterprise  82.0% (down 368 bps), Platform 94.4% (down 13 bps) and Print and  Publishing 93.7% (down 11 bps). Omniture was the only segment with  sequential margin expansion. The segment generated a gross margin of  54.7%, which was up 598 bps.The operating expenses of $593.4 million were 3.4% higher than the  previous quarter’s $573.7 million. The operating margin of 32.2% was  down 165 bps sequentially from 33.8%. The main reason for the weakness  was higher S&M expenses (as a percentage of sales), although the  weaker gross margin also contributed. R&D and G&A were down  slightly as a percentage of sales.Net incomeOn a pro forma basis, Adobe generated a net income of $249.2 million,  or a 24.7% net income margin compared to  $250.1 million, or 25.2% in  the previous quarter and net income of $165.1 million or 21.8% net  income margin in the same quarter last year. The fully diluted pro forma  earnings per share (NYSEARCA:EPS) came in at 49 cents, compared to 48 cents in  the August quarter and 31 cents in the November quarter of 2009.Our pro forma estimate excludes restructuring charges, amortization of  intangibles and investment gains and tax adjustments, but includes  deferred stock compensation. Our pro forma calculations may differ from  management’s presentation due to the inclusion/exclusion of any items  that were not considered by management.On a fully diluted GAAP basis, the company recorded a net loss of  $268.9 million ($0.53 per share) compared to $230.1 million ($0.44 per  share) in the previous quarter and loss of $32.0 million ($0.06 per  share) in the prior-year quarter.Balance SheetAdobe ended with a cash and investments balance of $2.47 billion, down  $110.3 million during the quarter. Cash and investments were 30% of  total assets at quarter-end. Cash generated from operations was $310.6  million. Principal uses of cash during the quarter included $193.3  million on acquisitions, $55.4 million on capex  and $200.0 million on  share repurchases.At quarter-end, Adobe had $1.51 billion in long term debt, taking the  net cash balance to $954.4 million. Including long-term liabilities, the  debt-cap ratio was a mere 26.6%.GuidanceAdobe provided guidance for the first quarter on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis.Revenue is expected to come in at around $1-1.05 billion (down 0.8% to  up 4.2% sequentially). The mid-point of the guidance range assumes  sequential growth in the Enterprise and Omniture businesses, with  Creative Solutions and Knowledge Worker segments flat to slightly up and  Platform and Print & Publishing down slightly.The Creative Solutions segment will be split into Digital Media  Solutions and Creative and Interactive Solutions. Digital Media will  include Adobe’s imaging and video-related products, while Creative and  Interactive will include the CS product lines, as well as the Platform  segment, which is currently being reported as a separate segment.The GAAP operating margin is expected to be 28-29.5%, non-operating  expense $16-20 million, tax rate 15%, share count 508-510 million,  yielding GAAP EPS of 43-49 cents.On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin is expected to be 37-38%,  non-operating expense $16-20 million, tax rate 22%, share count 508-510  million, yielding a non-GAAP EPS of 54-59 cents.Our RecommendationWhile we remain positive about Adobe’s market position, its compelling  product lines, strong balance sheet and the end market recovery that  should positively impact its results. We are also encouraged by the  improving demand trends in Europe.Despite these positives and notwithstanding the support from developers, we note that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  continues to maintain its distance, promoting HTML 5 instead.

Non-GAAP  earnings will be 47 cents a share to 54 cents a share. GAAP earnings  will be about 33 cents a share to 40 cents a share. Wall Street was  looking for non-GAAP earnings of 56 cents a share on revenue of $1.03  billion.In a statement, Adobe CFO Mark Garrett said that it was prudent to cut its revenue projections for Japan. Garrett said:Japan is our second largest country from a revenue perspective and  March is typically our biggest revenue month of the year there due to  fiscal year-end spending. Given the uncertain business environment in  Japan, we are being prudent and have reduced our revenue expectation for  our second quarter by $50 million — or roughly one-third of our  original Q2 revenue expectation for Japan.The outlook, which is likely to be echoed by other tech companies  with sizeable operations in Japan, overshadowed a strong quarter for  Adobe.Adobe reported first quarter earnings of $234.6 million, or 46 cents a  share, on revenue of $1.028 billion, up 20 percent from a year ago.  Non-GAAP earnings were 58 cents a share. Wall Street was expecting  earnings of 57 cents a share on revenue of $1.026 billion.By the numbers:Original post"

245872,23452,2011-01-11T03:30:54-05:00,,"The main thrust of this analysis is concentrated in three parts. The first two parts are based on free cash flow (current and historical) and the third is based on historical price action as a gauge of investor sentiment.The three methods used in this analysis are:1) Price to Owners Earnings (OE) = Current and future analysis2) Cumulative Owners Earnings (COE) = Historical analysis of owners earnings3) Statistical Indicator Analysis (SIA) = Historical price actionFor those new to this analysis please link here for an introduction: OE and COE, SIA, CapFlow.The main goal of my analysis is first to determine a sell price. With that in mind, we attempt to buy the stock at half its sell price and then hold it for 5 years (provided that no macro- economic negative catalysts force us to sell). Due to the fact that we bought it at par, we can potentially achieve an average annualized return of 15% per year. This may enable us to double our money every 5 years. Occasionally we do find a stock that is not selling at par, but is actually selling at a discount. When this happens, gains are usually higher.Analysis of Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE)Monday I was reading the news on Seeking Alpha and I came across the following:I am a big fan of ADBE’s products and use them in my research as well as in my communications with Clients, so I thought it would be interesting to see if my Mycroft Research System (MR) came to the same conclusion as BofA Merrill Lynch did.The following is a table housing Adobe System’s Owners Earnings data from 1984-2010 (including estimates);Before we start analyzing ADBE, we must first state what its closing market price was for Monday. ADBE closed at $32.91 and was up +2.71%, obviously from the upgrade.The first thing that catches my eye as an analyst is the CapFlow for ADBE. I like to own companies that have a CapFlow of 25% or less as that is a clear sign that the company requires little in the way of capital expenditures to grow or maintain their business. ADBE’s 27 year average CapFlow per year came out to 14%, so they pass this test with flying colors. Here is a chart of ADBE’s CapFlow:Having such low CapFlow‘s, one would have expected to find that ADBE was growing their Cumulative Owners Earnings at a rapid rate, but unfortunately that is not the case. Management has been able to grow Owner’s Earnings, but they have been very inconsistent in doing so. This is a pattern that can be seen throughout the entire history of the company. The way you can measure this is by examining the year to year growth of cash flow.1991-1993 Cash Flows Per Share1995-1998 Cash Flows Per Share2000-2003 Cash Flows Per Share2005-2009 Cash Flows Per ShareFrom examining the mini-tables above one can clearly deduce that ADBE exhibited a pattern of little growth for 3-4 years followed by a huge one year growth spurt up, to only go sideways again for 3-4 more years, followed by another huge growth spurt. This pattern unfortunately is not very conducive to strong COE growth. So even though they have had some amazing CapFlows, their COE after 27 years only came out to $14.82. Since we like to sell at 2 times COE, ADBE’s COE sell price is 2 X $14.82 or $29.64.Now that we have our Sell price for COE, let’s move on and determine our Price to Owner’s Earnings (P/OE) sell price. We like to sell at 30 times our OE, so if you look at the first main table above, you will notice that ADBE for 2010 has an estimated OE of $1.75, so 30 X $1.75 = $52.50, which is excellent.So with two out of three parts done let’s analyze ADBE’s SIA:Before we get to the current SIA sell number for ADBE, I would like you to turn your attention to trading day #2003 at the bottom of the chart above. That day was January 22, 2009 and it marks the first time ADBE ever broke below its SIA. It did so off and on until March 17, 2009 and then never looked back. At its low of $15.98, which it reached on March 3, 2009, it was trading at a 33% premium to its COE, but was trading at an 18% discount to its SIA and had a price to OE (P/OE) of 15. So it would have been a strong buy then. Once it achieved that low it proceeded to go up to $37.70 in just 9 months for a gain of +136%.So when you break even with the SIA Line (Red Line) or even go below it, in most cases good things should happen to you as an investor. That of course is if you also have strong OE and COE to back you up. As for ADBE today, its current SIA is $22.72, so we are trading at a 45% premium to ADBE’s SIA. I like to sell at 2.0 times a company’s SIA result, so 2 X $22.72 = $45.44.So for ADBE, we now have three separate sell prices and can now complete our Mycroft Research.1) P/OE = $52.50 (30 times OE per Share)2) COE = $29.64 (2 times COE)3) SIA = $45.44 (2 times SIA)Total = $127.58/3 = $42.53 = Sell PriceBuy Price = $21.26Conclusion = ADBE is a firm Hold but unfortunately is not anywhere near a buy as BofA Merrill Lynch suggests.Disclosure: Long AAPL, GOOG, No Position in ADBE"

With such a strong history of next-day outperformance to the upside, we would be favoring the long side in the wake of any up move tonight.ADBE has seen a positive post-bell earnings-driven trade in 16 of the 28 quarters we've tracked in our database, and in 11 of those upside evening moves the stock has followed that trade with a more aggressive positive run in the next day's regular session - 69% of the time. But if you're a short looking to glean some deeper downside off an Adobe earnings-driven move, we'd suggest you be cautious. Adobe has recorded a downside after-hours trade following 12 of the quarters we've tracked. It narrowed or reversed that after-hours downside move in the following regular session in six of those quarters. This is a straight mixed performance which will make watching the after-hours ranges far more important, keying in on where the ceilings and floors develop.

This post about a meeting between the CEOs of Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was published at 2:57 pm on Thursday October 7.And a look at Adobe’s price chart shows what happened next. The shares began rising so fast that trading was halted for about five minutes around 3:07 pm.  Whether you’re a bull or a bear, you have to admit that Adobe certainly isn’t a boring stock. The stock rose 11.5% that Thursday.Here’s a daily chart going back to June. Consider this: Mutual funds and other institutions hold close to 90% of this company’s shares.Yet 20% of the shares outstanding traded on September 27 and 12.8% of the float changed hands on October 7.So was any of the volume on October 7 from any of these these institutional investors?

But it led to Narayen revealing on interesting stat.“The amount of Flash video, despite what you might read in the press, is going through the roof,” Narayen said. He then said that Flash 10.1, the latest version, has exceeded every other Flash player in history in terms of adoption.In other words, he’s saying that despite the attacks by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and HTML5, the state of the Flash ecosystem is strong.A question the from the audience asked about the battery life issues with Flash on the Mac. Narayen would only says that if they have access to hardware acceleration, Flash is “as efficient in any tech in the world.”Battelle asked if that meant Adobe still doesn’t have access to Mac graphics hardware. Narayen noted that it’s in beta testing. And he stated again, that when they have hardware acceleration access, Flash ranks up there with any other tech.Original post"

227149,21950,2010-09-27T06:45:57-04:00,,"Adobe Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) was punished on Wednesday for an earnings report that produced guidance slightly below analyst expectations (see earnings call transcript here). The stock dropped as much as 26% after ADBE guided Q4 earnings to $0.48-0.54 EPS vs. $0.53 analyst consensus and Q4 revenues $950M to $1.0B vs. $1.03B analyst consensus (from briefing.com).The severity of the sell-off did not seem justified by the small size of the miss. Perhaps the selling was more about a complete reversal of the over-excitement from two weeks ago on the heels of Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) announcement that the company is relaxing earlier restrictions to its iOS Developer Program license (sections 3.3.1, 3.3.2 and 3.3.9). The supposed implication for Adobe is that its tools can now be used in the production of applications (as long as they do not download code). The reversal in this euphoria was massive:Such a massive response looked like a wash-out to me, so I bought the stock near the open to play a short-term bounce. The natural stop loss is at the low of the day. The chart below summarizes the recent trading action. In particular, note how this week’s sell-off accomplished in one day what it took six days to do in response to June’s earnings disappointment – with the stock having almost the exact starting and ending points. (Click for a larger view).The action in options on Wednesday was also very dramatic. In particular, open interest surged on puts and calls, particularly those expiring in October, November, and January. I am very intrigued by the focus on calls in the face of all the selling in the stock. It makes the put action look like small hedges to those bullish bets. The list of the change in open interest from Wednesday to Thursday is posted at the end of this piece, sorted by the change in open interest in descending order.Everything seems to be in place for a day where sellers flushed and washed themselves out of the system, except a friend of mine threw in the possibility that most of this massive action was the result of the dreaded tradebots. I have no data for assessing the impact of the tradebots and quants, but with 20% of the entire float trading hands and most of that happening within the first few hours of trading, I have to respect the possibilities. However, given the good risk/reward ratio on the bullish trade here using the same technicals that drive many automated programs, I am willing to take on the possibility that the machines ran counter to the opinions of the humans on Wednesday.Change in ADBE options open interest from 9/22/10 to 9/23/10, sorted by the change in open interest in descending order  (Source: Yahoo!finance options

227600,21848,2010-09-29T08:08:02-04:00,,"I was able to pick up a great company at a pretty good price when Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) fell 20% upon weak 2010 guidance. 3rd quarter results were great but Wall Street didn’t want to hear about a slowing 4th quarter.It’s the short term nature of Wall Street that creates entry points and if Mr Market feels like holding a ADBE sale, I’ll take it.At just under $27, I see ADBE to be a good deal with an ample margin of safety for such a high quality business.Adobe specializes in graphics and desktop publishing software. You’ve most likely heard of Photoshop, Acrobat and Flash. If you are unfamiliar with any of those names, just think of the Photoshop as Windows Paint on steroids. I’m sure you know what PDF and Flash is.Adobe is by far the leader for many of its software products in the industry.Since Photoshop and other creative software division makes up more than 50% of the company’s revenue, a comment on a slow education sector and Japanese market is enough to send shivers down Mr Market’s spine.Discounted Cash Flow CalculationIt really doesn’t matter whether the next quarter will be slow because ADBE should be able to generate more than $200m in free cash flow. This should get the company to the $900m range for fiscal 2010.Cash related numbers have increased consistently for the past 10 years and competitive pressures from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), plus the recession, definitely hurt Adobe's margins.Adobe’s net income margin was around 25% so if the market improves, the company should be able to get back to the 20% range again.With conservative assumptions of 13% growth and a 12% discount rate, the intrinsic value comes out to around $33.If I then include 20% of intangibles to the equation, as the name Adobe is what generates a significant amount of sales, then the fair value definitely comes out to the $30 range.Here’s a sensitivity matrix of what different assumptions would lead to.Earnings Power Value CalculationNormalized operating income of $900m with a 12% cost of capital yields an EPV of $19.Keep in mind that EPV is calculated with 0% growth assumptions.I have to admit that Adobe cannot be classified as screaming value. More like borderline GARP but the 25% margin of safety I have will allow me to profit-- even if I did make a mistake.1. Multimedia ExplosionWhat I do see, however, is the continuous evolution of the web and explosion in multimedia services. Websites and web applications are growing in number exponentially.There is also a young programming language called Ruby on Rails that makes web app development (which is the rage, in case you haven’t noticed) much easier.Flash isn’t just limited to your computer. It’s now integrated in mobile phones. The new wave of tablet PCs feature flash and with over 3m iPads sold, there is a huge market for developers.Dell (NYSE:DELL), Blackberry (RIMM), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and HP (NYSE:HPQ) have released or will be releasing their own versions of the tablet. This means more creative content than ever before, wherever you go.Another win for Adobe is the announcement by Apple that it will be easing up on app requirements, allowing developers to use competing technology.2. Recession is OverSupposedly the recession is over. Either way, will Adobe sales remain stagnant? No.The balance sheet has always been strong, with huge amounts of cash with no long term debt until the recent acquisition of Omniture in 2009. The market has rallied substantially and with a little patience ADBE should easily catch up.Disclosure: Long ADBE"
226476,20468,2010-09-22T05:17:15-04:00,,"Adobe’s fiscal third quarter earnings were solid, but the outlook for the fourth quarter was a bit light relative to expectations.The company reported earnings of $230.1 million, or 44 cents a share, on revenue of $990.3 million, up 42 percent from a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings were 54 cents a share.Wall Street was looking for earnings of 49 cents a share on revenue of $985 million.That was the good news. The bad news?Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) projected fiscal fourth quarter revenue of $950 million to $1 billion, or flat sequentially (statement). Earnings for the fourth quarter will be between 35 cents a share and 41 cents a share. Non-GAAP earnings will be between 48 cents a share and 54 cents a share. Wall Street was expecting earnings of 53 cents a share on revenue of $1.03 billion.In other words, Adobe will have to stretch just to meet current Wall Street estimates. Investors weren’t pleased as Adobe shares were hammered in afterhours trading.Still, in a call with analysts, Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen was bullish on the outlook and said the company is “on track to deliver record revenue in fiscal year 2010.”Two trouble spots for the Creative Services segment, with weaker than expected revenue in Japan and in the education verticals, but the company was quick to note that this wasn’t the results of market share loss but rather economic forces in Japan and a weaker back to school season across the board.He also addressed the upcoming release of Acrobat 10, due out late this quarter, by noting that it brings consistent growth. The product doesn’t see the same immediate upticks that come with the release of other products. Instead, it sees adoption over a longer period of time.Narayen maintains that “Adobe is at the center of the digital content revolution.” Using Adobe products, he said, customers can create, deliver, optimize and monetize across the many platforms, screens and devices.“Nobody is better at monetizing content” in a multi-screen environment than Adobe, he said.Original post"
226713,23479,2010-09-23T14:15:40-04:00,,"Adobe  (NASDAQ:ADBE) recently announced its third quarter 2010 earnings  results, in which the management gave weak outlook for the fourth  quarter of 2010 [1].  Adobe’s stock declined by 20% from $33 on Tuesday  to $26 the following day.Management cited the slow education market, which is the company’s  largest business vertical, and the weak Japanese market, which is the  company’s second largest market after the U.S., as the reasons for the  weak outlook.  We are not as bearish as the market on Adobe shares and  have updated the Trefis price estimate for Adobe stock down slightly from $38 to $36.   Despite Adobe’s weak outlook, we believe that the company will continue  to dominate the creative software market over the long term.Importance of Creative Software for AdobeWe estimate that Creative Software business constitutes around 54% of the $36 Trefis price estimate for Adobe’s stock.  Some of the popular create software products for Adobe are:Long-Term Demand for Adobe’s Creative SuiteAdobe released the newest version of its flagship product Creative  Suite version 5 in June 2010, but sales have trended below Trefis   expectations.  Management’s weak outlook suggests that Adobe’s creative  software market share for 2010 will be around 44% rather than the prior  Trefis market share estimate of 46% [2].Demand for Adobe’s creative software is based on new releases which  leads to cyclical market share.  We expect that Adobe will continue to  maintain  share and have around 42% share by the end of Trefis forecast  period.However, there remains risk to our estimates. In the future, Adobe  may not be able to deliver incremental software features that are  compelling enough for buyers to upgrade and such failures could further  hurt its market share. There could be a downside of 5% to the $36 Trefis  price estimate for Adobe’s stock if its market share were to decline to  around 38% by 2016, instead of around 42% that we forecast.You can see the complete $36 Trefis Price estimate for Adobe’s stock here. Notes: 1.  Q3 2010 Earnings Transcript 2.  Adobe’s market share in Creative Software market is an implied  number based on units and the total creative software market as provided by Adobe management . The calculation is: Adobe Creative Software Market Share = Number of Licenses Sold/Total Creative Software market. SEC filings  provide information on annual growth in the the number of licenses  sold.  We have used these growth figures over time along with estimates  of the number of licenses to calculate the licenses sold in each  historical year."

Essentially,  it’s just one stand-alone ECM provider with other software companies  offering ECM as part of their broader portfolio. All of them have done  deals to expand their ECM business, with the collective bill for  acquisitions across the sector topping more than $12bn since 2002.However, all of that activity has been done by – and for – proprietary software firms. In a recent report,  my colleague Kathleen Reidy analyzes how M&A might play out for  open source content management startups. Granted, the market is still  young, with many of the startups still bootstrapped. (Reidy looks at a  dozen potential open source content management targets, including their  funding and their focus.)So which startup might be the first to go? We speculate that Alfresco  Software could eventually find itself inside a larger company. However,  it probably won’t be the company we initially thought it would be. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Alfresco have a tight relationship, with Adobe embedding an Alfresco repository in its LiveCycle for content services like workflow, indexing and version control. But with Adobe reaching across the Atlantic for Day Software, it probably has all the Web content management technology it needs."
226521,21016,2010-09-22T10:22:26-04:00,,"Lost in this non-stop rally have been an increased number of earning warnings. It's the first time in quite a few quarters we have seen some quite visible names find an inability to keep up with analysts' ever rosier outlooks.Earnings season begins in a few weeks and, as I have said the past 3-4 periods, despite all the advantages handed to the 'masters of the universe' (U.S. multinationals) this is the first earning period where year over year comparisons are finally going to get a bit tougher. Further, the 9-10%+ straight up rally is going to leave many names vulnerable if there is not a correction in the market the next 2 weeks. This is especially true of many of the 'momo' (momentum) stocks, what were once leadership stocks but have now turned into a cadre of 50-100 stocks that people buy every day, at any price under the guise of ""it only goes up.""This works well for 89 days a quarter (as long as the Kool-Aid is flowing) since there is no real news to check against the every expanding valuation. But then a reality check can happen the other one day of the quarter - earnings release day.At this point the valuation in the 'momo' section of the stock market is so extreme, and charts so extended, I offer that even a misplaced comma in an earnings release is going to cause havoc in some of these stocks come mid-October, which is another reason it is difficult to buy almost anything here. Not only have some of these stocks rallied straight up 25-40%+ without a break, they are detached from any meaningful support on the chart AND must actually offer an earnings report in the not too distant future. So any purchases need to be culled significantly in just a few weeks as the risk of a poor reaction is now immense. I realize at this point of emotional buying, valuation is ""old school"" [Sep 2, 2010: I Want my Salesforce.com] but it does usually matter one day a quarter, no matter how much Kool Aid Quantitative Easing is flowing through the system.To represent this I am going to talk about Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), which is not even one of the 'momo' stocks. It did spike a few weeks ago as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) agreed to budge on the moat they have built around their applications, but that was a sort of unique one off news event, rather than one of these stocks that is related to the cloud in some manner and hence must go up 18 out of every 19 sessions. However, the company reported solid numbers last night but came in a bit light in revenue guidance. When stocks are priced for perfect ""a bit light"" means you receive an instant 20%+ haircut in stock price. As I type this the stock is below $26 in premarket. (Click to enlarge)So you can chase, and chase and chase all these names up without regard to valuation or sense, but the window for reality check is coming soon and the risk for the people who only buy stocks because they were up 7 of the previous 8 sessions, increases by the day.Via the AP:"
225973,23048,2010-09-20T03:21:02-04:00,,"By David GibbsEarnings Estimates (High/Mean/Low): $0.52 / $0.491 / $0.48San Jose-based Adobe Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: ADBE) is set to report 3Q earnings this Tuesday after the bell, and if recent trading is any indication, investors are expecting an upside Q. After falling as much as 30% on the year at its 2010 lows, shares received a much needed boost on Sept. 9 when Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) announced plans to significantly relax the compliance restrictions of its much-vaunted App Store. Management at Adobe had long been irked by Apple’s unwillingness to allow developers to use its popular Flash software to develop apps, but pressure from an increasingly popular Adroid platform seems to have swung the pendulum in ADBE’s favor.ADBE popped as much as 13.4% the day of AAPL’s announcement and has benefited from additional positive news/rumors in the interim, though it did finish up Friday’s trade at just below the 9/9 highs, closing at $32.78. Last Wednesday, Adobe made a joint announcement with Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) stating that the two tech bellwethers planned to enable developers to distribute and monetize Adobe AIR applications and games via Intel AppUp center storefronts. Using the new Adobe application distribution platform beta, code named “Melrose,” developers and publishers can now sell and distribute AIR applications to potentially millions of users while monitoring sales and downloads. Furthermore, rumors over the weekend are beginning to suggest that ADBE may have a tablet in the works.As a company with an $17 billion market cap, news out of ADBE will always be received as important. Recent happenings discussed herein will only fuel Street anticipation. ADBE has beaten estimates the past eleven quarters in a row, and mean 3Q estimates of $0.491 represent a 40% increase YoY and a 12% gain sequentially. The conference call is currently scheduled for 5 P.M. EST.Click to enlargeDisclosure: No holdings in ADBE."

The bad news is shares are plummeting after-hours on investor skepticism of what’s in store for Adobe. Here’s the Q3 earnings breakdown [see call transcript]:Earnings: Q3 profits of $.54 vs. $.49 consensus and $.26 in Q3 last year. Profits jumped 107% Year-over-Year.Revenue: Increased 42% Year-over-Year at $990.3 Million vs. $985 Million consensus, blowing away expectations. Last year, Adobe generated sales of $697.5 Million in the same quarter, so this year’s quarter is a drastic improvement and another sign of the economy’s improvement.“Strong performance in each of our major businesses contributed to record revenue and strong earnings in Q3,” said Shantanu Narayen, president and CEO of Adobe. “We remain bullish about Adobe’s long-term role in enabling the transformation of content and applications across industries.”Comment: Shares of Adobe were trading down big following the company’s earnings release after-the-bell, trading at $27.87 per share, compared to Tuesday’s closing price of $32.94 per share.Based on the chart above, Adobe shares are now trading below both their 50-day and 200-day moving price averages — a negative sign for the stock. Adobe issued mixed guidance for Q4, earnings per share of $0.48-0.54 vs. $0.53 consensus Q4 revenues of 950 Billion – $1 Billion vs. $1.03 Billion consensus. Either Adobe is setting up Wall Street for a big potential upside Q4 surprise or the company is finally cooling off from a year-over-year double digit rise in numbers. Right now, investors seem to think Adobe is undeserving of a brighter future ahead as shares are down 15% after-the-bell.Disclosure: None."

Their forecasts  suggest that Adobe’s Creative Software Pricing and Market Share will  trend slightly lower than the Trefis forecast. These projections suggest  a combined downside of about 2-3% for Adobe’s stock.Photoshop and Other Creative Software is the most valuable division  for Adobe, constituting around 54%  of the Trefis price estimate of $38 for Adobe’s stock.

219813,20568,2010-08-10T12:39:16-04:00,,"Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE),  which makes the Photoshop and Acrobat software, recently announced that  it agreed to acquire Swiss-based Web content management company Day  Software Holding AG. Although the $240 million acquisition is not  expected to be a game changer, it is in line with the company’s  acquisition strategy and its strong emphasis on boosting its Web content  management and enterprise software capabilities. Day Software specializes in high growth Web content  management, digital asset management and social collaboration  businesses. Over the past few years, the Swiss software maker has gained  a commanding position in the customer experience management space. This  has caught Adobe’s attention, even as it integrates Omniture. The deal,  therefore, appears to be a strategic fit and could result in additional  synergies if Adobe integrates Day Software’s experience in customer  experience management with Omniture’s Web analytics capabilities. Adobe  bought Omniture, which makes software for analyzing consumers’ website  usage patterns in September 2009.Recently, Adobe also announced the realignment of its  business units, with a clear focus on enabling customers to enhance  their digital experiences. Although Adobe generates half of its revenues  from its Creative Suite product lines, it has increasingly looked for  opportunities in the customer experience management space that helps  personalize visitor experience and enhance web-based engagement.After the regulatory process is completed, Day  Software will operate within Adobe’s Digital Enterprise Solutions  business unit and Day’s Chief Executive Erik Hansen will join Adobe.Adobe expects the acquisition to close in the fiscal  fourth quarter and does not expect the deal to have a material impact on  its earnings in the current financial year.  However, the acquisition  is likely to be accretive to the company’s earnings in 2011."
211669,20568,2010-06-24T08:33:32-04:00,,"Adobe Systems' (NASDAQ:ADBE)  earnings for the second quarter of fiscal year 2010 beat the Zacks Consensus estimate by 3 cents. But shares were lower Wednesday, as investors were disappointed by the currency headwind in Europe and the lower-than-expected expectations for the CS5 platform in the fiscal third quarter.RevenueTotal revenue was $943.0 million, up 9.8% sequentially and 33.8% year over year, exceeding management's own expectations of around $875-925 million, or an increase of 1.9% to 7.7% sequentially. An extra week of operations in the fiscal first quarter added an additional $35 million to revenue.Products generated 84% of revenue, increasing 13.0% sequentially and 22.7% year over year. The year-over-year increase in product revenue was primarily driven by the CS5 and Acrobat product lines. Subscription revenue comprised 10% of revenue, down 3.4% sequentially and up 664.5% from the year-ago quarter. Services & Support brought in the balance, representing a sequential decline of 6.3% and a year-over-year increase of 24.4%.Product gross margin came in at 95.0% (down 165 basis points sequentially and up 237 bps year over year). This was followed by the Services and Support gross margin at 67.6% (up 153 bps sequentially and 399 bps year over year). Subscription revenue currently brings in the lowest gross margin at 45.6% (down 650 bps sequentially and up 1255 bps from the year-ago quarter). The year-over-year expansion in the gross margin across categories was the result of much higher revenue in the last quarter compared to the recession-hit year-ago quarter.Revenue by SegmentThe single largest driver of the sequential increase in revenue was the CS platforms, particularly CS4 and pent-up demand for CS5 across all geographic segments, which pushed up Creative Solutions revenue. As a result, Creative Solutions grew 23.3% sequentially to 56% of total revenue.The other segment that witnessed a sequential increase was Print and Publishing, which at 5% of revenue, saw a sequential increase of 4.5%.Knowledge Worker, Omniture and Enterprise brought in 17%, 9% and 8%, respectively. However, they all witnessed sequential declines. However, except for the Knowledge Worker segment (which was flat), all increased from the year-ago quarter. The Omniture enterprise customer retention rate remained strong at 93%, although it was slightly down from the 95% reported in the previous quarter.Revenue by GeographyAlthough Asia remains the smallest contributor at just 22% of revenue, it witnessed the strongest growth at over 20%. The largest geography remains the Americas, which generated 48% of revenue and grew 11.5% sequentially. The EMEA region accounted for the balance and grew less than 1%. However, management stated that the debt crisis in Europe did not impact Adobe in the last quarter.MarginsThe pro forma gross margin for the quarter was 90.5%, down 120 bps from 91.7% in the Feb 2010 quarter and 134 bps from 91.8% in the May quarter of 2009. The sequential decline is related to gross margin declines in products and subscription revenue, stemming from margin contraction across all segments except Enterprise.The Creative Solutions segment generated a gross margin of 93.1%, down 165 bps sequentially, Knowledge Worker 96.7% (down 50 bps), Enterprise 81.6% (up 64 bps), Platform 93.6% (down 167 bps). Print and Publishing 94.3% (down 38 bps) and Omniture generated 44.9%, down 709 bps. The addition of Omniture has lowered Adobe's margin profile, due to the difference in its business model.The operating expenses of $578.2 million were 2.8% lower than the previous quarter's $562.7 million. The operating margin was 29.1%, up 301 bps sequentially from 26.1%. The main reason for the increase was lower R&D expenses, which declined as a percentage of sales. This was helped by lower G&A and flattish S&M, which more than offset the increase in COGS (as a percentage of sales).Net incomeOn a pro forma basis, ADBE generated net income of $190.5 million, or a 20.2% net income margin, compared to $164.4 million, or 19.1% in the previous quarter and net income of $141.7 million or 20.1% net income margin in the same quarter last year.Fully diluted pro forma earnings per share (EPS) came in at 36 cents, compared to 31 cents in the Feb quarter and 27 cents in the year-ago quarter. Our pro forma estimate excludes restructuring charges, amortization of intangibles and investment losses on a tax-adjusted basis, but includes deferred stock compensation. Our pro forma calculations may differ from management's presentation due to the inclusion/exclusion of some items that were not considered by management.On a fully diluted GAAP basis, the company recorded a net loss of $148.6 million ($0.28 per share) compared to $127.2 million ($0.24 per share) in the previous quarter and $126.1 million ($0.24 per share) in the prior-year quarter.Balance SheetThe company ended with a cash and investments balance of $2.64 billion, down $27.6 million during the quarter. Cash and investments were 33% of total assets at quarter-end. Cash generated from operations was $251 million. Principal uses of cash during the quarter included $250 million on share repurchases and $50 million on capex.At quarter-end, Adobe had $1.49 billion in long term debt, amounting to a net cash balance of $1.15 billion. Including long term liabilities, the debt-cap ratio was a mere 26.4%.GuidanceManagement provided guidance for the first quarter on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis.Revenue is expected to come in at around $950 million to $1 billion (up 0.7% to 6.0% sequentially), excluding $5 million deferred Omniture revenue. The mid-point of the guidance range assumes slight growth in the Creative Solutions segment, along with growth in the Enterprise and Omniture businesses. The other businesses are expected to stay relatively flat sequentially.The GAAP operating margin is expected to be 25.5%-27.5%, non operating expense $12.5-13.5 million, tax rate 25%, share count 532-534 million, yielding GAAP EPS of $0.32-$0.37.On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin is expected to be 36% - 37%, non operating expense $12.5-13.5 million, tax rate 25%, share count 532-534 million, yielding a non-GAAP EPS of $0.46-$0.50.Our RecommendationWhile we remain positive about Adobe's market position, its compelling product lines and strong balance sheet, we expect the currency headwind in Europe to keep pressure on shares. This is the main reason for the Zacks #4 Rank (short term Sell) and longer term Neutral recommendation on the shares."

Here's a chart displaying the annual trend in the company's net profit margin:Adobe's accounts receivables trend raises a flag: It's interesting to note that Adobe's account receivable grew by 16.84% during the most recent quarter, which is faster than the rate of revenue growth (9.16%). Is this a sign that Adobe's clients are struggling to pay their bills? Accounts receivables as a percentage of revenues increased from 38.16% to 40.83% during the most recent quarter, while accounts receivables as a percentage of current assets increased from 10.5% to 11.03% for the 13 weeks ending 2010-03-05.Adobe's operating costs are increasing: Adobe's cost of revenue, as a percentage of revenue, increased from 9.8% to 10.4% during the most recent quarter, while operating expenses, also expressed as a percentage of revenues, climbed from 73.6% to 79.4%.

However, shares were up 5.48% in pre-market trading, as investors responded positively to the strong guidance.  Revenue  Total revenue was $858.7 million, up 13.4% sequentially and 9.2% year-over-year, exceeding management’s own expectations of around $800-850 million (up 5.6% to 12.2% sequentially). This was much better than the double-digit year-over-year declines witnessed in the three preceding quarters. The last quarter also benefited from an extra week of operations, which added an additional $35 million to revenue (this was included in the guidance provided by the company during the fourth quarter conference call).  Products generated 93.1% of revenue, increasing 13.0% sequentially and 7.7% year over year. Services & Support brought in the remaining 6.9%, growing 18.5% sequentially and 34.1% year over year. The momentum in the business is indicative of a much stronger 2010 than was seen in 2009. Products and Services & Support usually generate gross margins of 90%+ and 65%+, respectively. Both areas saw gross margin expansion in the last quarter, although they were within the historical range. Management stated that the company was seeing much stronger demand for most key product lines. Revenue by Segment  Revenue by operating segment was as follows—Creative Solutions 50% (up 0.6% sequentially), Knowledge Worker 19% (up 11.1%), Enterprise 9% (up 27.8%), Platform 5% (down 0.9%), Print and Publishing 5% (up 8.6%) and Omniture 10% (up 233.5%). The significant increase in Omniture revenue was because Omniture was acquired in November 2009, so the previous quarter results only included a single month’s contribution. Revenue by Geography  The revenue increase was driven by all geographies, as both North America and Europe continued to stabilize, while Asia experienced typical seasonal strength. Around 48% of first quarter revenue originated in the Americas (up 6.3% sequentially), 32% in EMEA (up 14.8%) and 20% in Asia (up 31.4%). Margins  The pro forma gross margin for the quarter was 91.7%, compared to 93.6% in the Nov 2009 quarter and 92.0% in the Feb quarter of 2008. The slight variation is mostly on account of the mix of services and support revenues versus the product revenue during the quarter.  The Creative Solutions segment generated a gross margin of 94.7%, up 304 basis points sequentially), Knowledge Worker 97.2% (up 399 bps), Enterprise 81.0% (down 14 bps), Platform 95.3% (up 549 bps) and Print and Publishing 94.6% (up 419 bps). Omniture generated a gross margin of 52.0%, much lower than the rest of the company, due to difference in the business model.  The operating expenses of $562.7 million were lower than the previous quarter’s $470.0 million. The operating margin was 26.1%, down 338 bps sequentially from 29.5%. The main reason for the decline was increase in R&D expenses (as a percentage of sales), although other operating expenses also increased slightly. Net income  On a pro forma basis, Adobe generated a net income of $164.4 million, or a 19.1% net income margin compared to $165.1 million, or 21.8% in the previous quarter and net income of $202.1 million or 25.7% net income margin in the same quarter last year. The fully diluted pro forma earnings per share (NYSEARCA:EPS) was 31 cents, compared to 31 cents in the Nov quarter and 38 cents in the year-ago quarter.  Our pro forma estimate excludes restructuring charges, amortization of intangibles, investment losses and tax adjustments, but includes deferred stock compensation. Our pro forma calculations may differ from management’s presentation due to the inclusion/exclusion of some items that were not considered by management.  On a fully diluted GAAP basis, the company recorded a net loss of $127.2 million (24 cents per share) compared to net loss of $32.0 million (6 cents per share) in the previous quarter and profit of $156.4 million (30 cents per share) in the prior-year quarter. Balance Sheet  The company ended with a cash and investments balance of $2.7 billion, an increase of $767.9 million during the quarter. Cash generated from operations was $260 million. Principal uses of cash during the quarter were $60 million spent on the repurchase of 1.7 million common shares and $25 million on capex. At quarter-end, Adobe had $1.49 billion in long term debt, amounting to a net cash balance of $1.18 billion. Including long term liabilities, the debt-cap ratio was a mere 26.6%. Guidance  Management provided guidance for the first quarter on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis.  Revenue is expected to come in at around $875-925 million (up 1.9% to 7.7% sequentially). Management expects the Creative segment to benefit from the CS-5 launch, which will therefore, increase in the second quarter.  Since the first quarter benefited from an extra week, the Knowledge Worker and Enterprise businesses are expected to be flat sequentially. The Platform and Print and Publishing segments are also expected to be flat sequentially. Management also believes that the CS-5 will drive revenue increases across all geographies.  The GAAP operating margin is expected to be 21-24.5%, non-operating expense $16-18 million, tax rate 25%, share count 531-535 million, yielding GAAP EPS of 23 cents to 30 cents.  On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin is expected to be 33.5-35.5%, non-operating expense $16-18 million, tax rate 25%, share count 531-535 million, yielding a non-GAAP EPS of 39 cents to 44 cents."

210602,20568,2010-06-17T10:34:07-04:00,,"Adobe Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is slated to report  second-quarter earnings on June 22, 2010.   The shares have taken a tumble, falling 12.5% since the company reported  last March, the main reason being Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) continued opposition to  Flash and the propaganda surrounding HTML 5.  Estimate Revisions It appears that the 26 analysts covering the stock are divided on the  impact of HTML 5 on Adobe’s flash platform. While some believe Adobe’s  installed base is an advantage, especially given the high switching  costs, a few point to Apple’s popularity, which could pull customers  away from Flash. This is the main reason for the limited number of  estimate revisions over the past 30 days.   During this period we see 1 analyst lowering estimates for the upcoming  quarter and 1 for the following quarter, with 2 lowering estimates for  fiscal 2010 and 1 for fiscal 2011. However, since these revisions did  not impact the Zacks Consensus for either of the next two quarters and  only lowered the fiscal year 2010 estimate by a penny and raised fiscal  2011 estimates by a penny, we cannot think of these revisions as  material changes to analyst expectations.   The impact is somewhat more pronounced if we consider the past 90 days.  Analysts appear to be factoring in lower earnings for the back half of  the year, since May quarter estimates remain unchanged while August  quarter and fiscal 2010 estimates are down by 2 cents and 5 cents,  respectively. Fiscal 2011 estimates are also down by a penny.  Company Guidance Adobe’s guidance for the second quarter was not bad, with management  expecting a 2-8% sequential increase in revenue helped by the CS5  launch. Other segments were expected to come in flat, given the extra  week of operation in the first quarter. Operating margin expectations  were significantly higher than both the previous and year-ago quarters.  As a result, the non-GAAP EPS expectations of 39 cents to 44 cents  represent 34% sequential and 55% year-over-year increases at the  mid-point.   Analysts expect earnings of 34 cents for the quarter, below the guided  range.  First-Quarter Highlights Adobe’s first-quarter revenue grew both sequentially and year over year,  exceeding management expectations. Results were driven by seasonal  strength in Asia and continued stabilization in North America and  Europe. Creative Solutions revenue was soft, most likely because  customers decided to wait for CS5. However, the pickup in Knowledge  Worker and Enterprise Solutions was encouraging.   Management stepped up investments in R&D and SG&A, which  negatively impacted the operating margin in the last quarter. As a  result, the pro forma EPS of 31 cents was flat sequentially and down 7  cents from the year-ago quarter.  Reiterate Neutral  We believe Adobe is the undisputed leader and dominant player in the  content creation segment. We thought the company’s first-quarter results  were good, although unexciting, and we were not surprised by the  softness in Creative Solutions. Additionally, we believe that Adobe’s  leadership in several key markets, its solid business model, the  potential success of new products, strong cash generation and end market  diversity are positives.   However, we believe that investors could continue to discount the shares  as a result of its tiff with Apple. We agree that Flash is an important  growth avenue for Adobe, especially due to the proliferation of mobile  devices in recent times. However, the business is still a relatively  small percentage of sales and Adobe remains strongly entrenched. We  believe this calls for a wait-and-see approach to the shares.   Consequently, we are reiterating our Neutral rating on Adobe shares."

However, we do expect the new  Flash Player to spur license demand from developers of rich Internet  applications. In the most optimistic scenario, we would expect this  sector to drive a 2% upside for Adobe.  Our detailed analysis follows  below.The new and improved Flash Player features… 1.  Less CPU and battery consumptionAdobe claims that Flash Player 10.1 consumes significantly fewer CPU  and battery resources. When the user opens multiple Flash-enabled  browser windows, the new version helps lower power consumption for the  content running in the background or when the browser window is idle.2.  Multi-touch capabilityFlash 10.1 supports a broad range of smartphone operating systems,  including Google’s  (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android OS, RIM’s  (NASDAQ:RIMM) BlackBerry OS, Palm’s (PALM) webOS, Nokia’s  (NYSE: NOK) Symbian OS, and MeeGo. Many mobile phone companies as well  as computer makers are beginning to roll out touch-enabled devices like  smartphones and tablet devices, as well as PCs like the HP  (NYSE:HPQ) Touchsmart. Flash Player 10.1 allows users to play Flash  games or watch Flash videos through the device’s touch-screen interface.3.  Better memory managementFlash Player 10.1 addresses the issue of browser crashes, which are  generally caused by high memory usage. It does so by shutting down  instances of Flash which uses more memory than is available on the  device. This feature prevents browsers from crashing, which could  otherwise cause users to lose valuable informationImplications for Rich Internet Application and Mobile Phone  MarketsAlthough we believe Flash Player’s new version will help increase its  sales, we see little upside for Adobe’s stock. However, here are two  sectors to keep an eye on:1.  Rich Internet Applications on PCsFlash Player is one of the tools used to build PC-based rich media   applications such as online games and interactive  Websites. We estimate  that Rich Internet Application (RIA) licensing constitutes around 5% of  the $38  Trefis Price estimate for Adobe’s stock.We believe Flash Player’s improved features will help Adobe sell more  RIA licenses. There could be an upside of 2% to the $38  Trefis Price estimate if the number of RIA licenses increases at a  faster rate to reach 2.5 million by the end of the Trefis forecast  period, instead of the 1.8 million that we currently forecast.2.  Flash for Mobile DevicesFlash for Mobile Phones constitutes less than 1% of the $38  Trefis Price estimate for Adobe’s stock. We believe Flash’s  penetration in Mobile Phones will continue to  increase from around 53%  in 2009 to around 87% by the end of Trefis  forecast period. We believe  that with Flash Player’s improved features,  the Flash penetration rate  could accelerate even further. However, since Flash for Mobile Phone  sales contribute less than 1%  of Adobe’s total revenues, we don’t see  much upside for its stock  price.Recently, there was a controversy around Apple’s  decision to exclude Flash Player from Apple devices like iPhone, iPad   and iPod Touch. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) claims that Flash Player slows down   mobile phones and quickly drains their battery life. In   another article, we argued that because mobile Flash is such a  small market for Adobe, the absence of Flash from Apple  devices will  not have a material impact on Adobe’s stock .

While it does seem fanciful, I must admit that I understand less of how it translates to ""real world"" revolutions for a consumer of content on the web.Honestly, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Docs is as engaging to me as Adobe's various products are since it solves a simple problem: A common interface for different document types, whereas Adobe Reader doesn't understand other doc types (you still have to use a conversion tool before information dissemination).When I trawl through Adobe's website trying to understand the company's various products and acronymns (including the famous ones like CS and PDF and the not-so-famous ones like AIR, etc), the question that strikes me is that Adobe's product information content on its website is not engaging at all. It looks glossy but not engaging! When a company can't do something for itself, how does it expect to convince the world? For me, consumer/customer engagement is more about ease of use such that it becomes a habit rather than feature-rich applications which are nice on the eye but nothing else. Think about the click wheel on the ipod or Google's simple search interface. To me these define customer engagement more than Adobe's products since they provide consumers with something that is easy to use and they have never experienced before.If there is no real value that is ""visible"" to a typical consumer, why should corporates spend billions more on buying such productivity tools which probably add gloss but not necessarily increase consumer/customer engagement? For example, most basic features of Adobe Photoshop can be found in freeware or online photo editiing and archiving sites like Picasa and Kodakgallery. The better part is that such sites also help to archive and share content in a simple manner. I find this more engaging than using Adobe Photoshop and then mailing out the photos.The reason for this pessimism has nothing to do with the quality of Adobe's products. Rather it has to do with the thinking that such expensive products can garner a bigger market share in this business of ""content creation and engagement."" My view is that this market is limited if products are priced for large corporates and content developers only. It is in this context that we should view Adobe's current quarter results and revenue guidance for the next quarter (May10).   Source: Gridstone ResearchRevenues increased by 9% YOY in the Feb10 quarter to $858M. Knock-off $88M from the Omniture acquisition and $35M (Adobe's own estimate as per its earnings call) for the extra week in the Feb10 quarter and the organic revenue of $735 M is actually a 6% decline YOY. Ofcourse, the upcoming launch of the new edition of Creative Suite, CS5 would have impacted revenues from their main segment, Creative Solutions. (Click charts to enlarge)  Source: Gridstone ResearchThe graphic above clearly shows that Creative Solutions is still Adobe's flagship business with business productivity( Acrobat family of products) coming a distant second. But that is clearly factored in the bullish guidance for the next quarter where revenues are expected to come in between $875M-925M. Source: Gridstone ResearchThe Nov08 quarter had revenues >$900M and that was largely due to the launch of CS4 in that time-frame. While Omniture is a nice addition in terms of offering a different revenue stream, it also works on a on-demand hosted model, which I believe is an added advantage. So while Adobe has three promising revenue segments, the current expectations around Adobe sound too optimistic. Unless Adobe drops prices of its products, it would find it difficult to sell them in emerging markets.  Source: Gridstone ResearchAdobe doubled its revenues from ~$1.6B in 2004 to $3.2B in 2007 but any expectations of a repeat of this in the next three years would be a little far-fetched. Here's why:The Omniture acquisition is probably a result of Adobe's realization that it needs some revenues that are tied to the content and content-related traffic flow on the web rather than just design tools. For the Omniture business, Adobe will make more money as customers see the benefits of using the Omniture tool set in managing and optmizing their online content. This is customer engagement at its best rather than simply attracting eyeballs with glossy content. Adobe's Open Screen project (where content can be created in a single format for multiple devices) is another promising venture which could become lucrative in the medium-term.In my view, Adobe's real market opportunity is not in making tools for more feature-rich content but in actually helping consumers and small businesses create and share such content with ease. This would, however, require a more consumer-focused strategy. The current enterprise-focused strategy helps address the content creation needs fof the B2B and B2C segments, but to be really successful C2C (Consumer-to-consumer) and SB2C (small business to consumer) would be key. For these markets, pricing and easy-to-use features are of utmost importance. It would be interesting to see if the new launch,CS5, takes some steps in that direction. A mimimum sticker price of $999 for a basic CS4 edition (Soruce: Adobe) currently seems a big barrier. Will Adobe come up with something for the SMB (Small and Medium business) and Consumer segments?Disclosure: No Positions"

173840,20468,2009-11-17T12:07:57-05:00,,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) on Tuesday released the beta versions of its AIR 2 and Flash Player 10.1 software and the company includes multi-touch support to “bring innovations and optimizations from mobile devices to the desktop.”Most of the multi-touch talk around Adobe revolves around future mobile support (statement). However, multi-touch has a role on the desktop too. For instance, HP (NYSE:HPQ) on Monday announced a software development program for its TouchSmart PCs and digital signage displays. HP launched a developer portal and development kit to create things like touch enabled Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Hulu.The big question: If companies like Adobe and HP build multi-touch support for the desktop will the applications come?Thinking out loud you could see a bevy of possibilities. Perhaps apps are built for the desktop so information is pushed to you (the revenge of PointCast anyone?) Or the multi-touch support just means we ultimately do away with the mouse in select Rich Internet Applications (RIA). And then there are a lot of commercial applications.Adobe’s platform is appealing, but it’s in a race to stay ahead of advances in HTML. Multi-touch support could keep it ahead of the race, but we’ll see how things play out on the desktop."
188620,21382,2010-02-15T09:47:06-05:00,,"The bane of all mobile app developers is the need to rewrite the same app over and over again for different devices: the iPhone, Android, Blackberry, Palm Pre, Nokia (NYSE:NOK), Windows Mobile. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is positioning its Flash platform (which includes the Flash player, AIR, developer tools, and media servers) as the write-once, deploy-anywhere solution for both the mobile Web and apps. Sunday at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, it announced plans to bring Adobe AIR to mobile devices, starting with Android and Blackberry phones.AIR is currently used to create desktop applications, but it will soon be used to create Android and Blackberry apps as well. These mobile AIR apps will be able store data locally on the phone, access other data on the phones such as photos, and be distributed as regular apps in the Android and Blackberry app stores. Not only that, but the same apps created with Flash developer tools will be exportable as iPhone apps. Adobe wants developers to create their apps using its developer tools and then output them as AIR apps for Android and Blackberry phones, native iPhone apps, or Flash apps on the Web.With the upcoming Flash 10.1 player—which Adobe is publicly saying will come out in the first half of the year via an over-the-air update, and privately telling developers to expect by the end of April—it will extend the Flash runtime to mobile browsers. The Flash 10.1 player will run consistently across both the desktop and many mobile browsers (except the iPhone). No more Flash Lite (except for Windows Mobile, which initially won’t support Flash 10.1 but is working on a mobile browser plug-in).Flash 10.1 will be great for mobile video. Brightcove, for instance, is announcing support of Flash 10.1 in its video players, which makes possible all sorts of custom video player skins, advertising, analytics, and other features such as share buttons for Facebook and Twitter. (See this video to see how Flash 10.1 will look in a Brightcove player on an Android phone).Of course, the face-off with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues over Flash on the iPhone, even though last December, 7 million iPhone users attempted to download the Flash player from adobe.com through their mobile browsers, up from 3 million requests in July, 2009. Apple might eventually have to cave if Flash becomes a standard feature of all other smartphones. Adobe execs cite numbers by Strategy Analytics which estimate more than half of all smartphones will support Flash by 2012 (click chart at right to enlarge).Flash in mobile browsers seems like an inevitability. But whether apps built for Flash will be able to compete as standalone mobile apps outside the browser is still up in the AIR.Original post"
181591,21568,2010-01-08T04:35:12-05:00,,"By Michael KanellosSoftware giant Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) wants to explore the viability of cow power.The San Jose, Calif.-based company is examining the idea of installing an industrial-size fuel cell that converts methane into electricity and heat at its headquarters in San Jose. And, as part of the program, the company is studying if it would be possible to obtain the methane from manure digesters in California's Central Valley, according to Randall Knox, senior director of global workplace solutions at Adobe.""You keep it from off-gassing (the methane) into the atmosphere,"" he said.Like wave power, manure power has been one of those intriguing ideas stuck mostly in the planning stages for years. The potential benefits are enormous. Farmers now have to pay to get rid of their manure and manure lagoons can cause algal blooms and nitrogen run-offs. By putting it into a digester-essentially a big holding tank-- microbes can convert manure into pipeline quality gas. The remaining solids can also be converted into bedding for cows. (With the methane out, it doesn't stink.)Economically, manure methane can be a challenge. It takes about 20,000 cows at each digester location to break even, according to David Albers, CEO of BioEnergy Solutions. BioEnergy has 30 dairies under 10-year supply contracts and a fixed price contract for gas with Pacific Gas and Electric. In all, there are 70,000 cows contributing gas under these contracts. There are 1.8 million cows in the California Central Valley, Albers told us earlier this year.Manure companies have also had to experiment with different business models-selling digesters to farmers, setting up digesters as a service and selling the gas to utilities-to make it palatable to farmers and others in the supply chain. Additionally, natural gas prices have dropped in recent years.And who will Adobe get its industrial-scale digester from? Knox didn't say. But secretive Bloom Energy--backed by Kleiner Perkins--has developed a 25-kilowatt methane fuel cell that can be teamed with others to provide 50 to 100 kilowatts or more of distributed, onsite power. Ebay, San Francisco Airport and a few other high-profile customers have allegedly bought Bloom fuel cells. (Panasonic and ClearEdge Power make similar fuel cells, but these only put out 1 and 5 kilowatts respectively and are designed for residences and small businesses.) Bloom is expected to come out of the closet soon.What else is going on at Adobe:--The company has put 20 Windspire turbines from Mariah Power on the sixth floor of its headquarters. With the 14 mile per hour winds that course through the area, Adobe figures it can get 2,500 kilowatt hours a year per turbine,  collectively about the same amount of power required for ten homes.     ""One of the areas companies need to get more and more into is the production of sustainable energy,"" Knox said. ""Aesthetically and from a price point, these turbines seem to fit the bill""It is a little difficult in a high rise to get solar to pencil out,"" he added. (See the video-more in the future.)If it works, Adobe may expand the deployment of these vertical wind towers. It is already studying wind turbines for its San Francisco offices. No bird accidents have been reported with Mariah turbines, he added. And aesthetically, they do look nice.--As part of its LEED platinum certification, Adobe adopted software from Optimum Energy to reduce air conditioning bills. Optimum's software dynamically monitors the temperature of the water in the chillers behind the AC system to cut power. The company promises to cut chiller power by 35 to 50 percent and Knox says that the early data indicates that Adobe is getting results toward the top end of that range."

Now, it is taking a first tentative step towards changing that with the release of a new Distribution Manager for widgets created on the Flash Platform. In addition to making it easier for people to share the widgets across 70 Web and mobile destinations, it will track their usage, and serve as a widget ad network as well.Adobe is obviously interested in getting into the advertising end of the business, which is why it recently announced it is acquiring Omniture (OMTR) for $1.8 billion. Rather than just getting paid once for the tools to create Web apps and content, it wants to get a piece of those recurring advertising dollars too. The widget distribution play is along the same lines, except that for now Adobe is doing it through a partnership with Gigya, the widget distribution and advertising network. What that means is that any money Adobe makes will be split more ways, but in return it achieves faster entry into the market.The Distribution Manager allows Flash developers to put a share button on their apps, which opens up a menu giving consumers the option to send that particular widget to Facebook, iGoogle, MySpace, My Yahoo, or various other destinations. It also supports the iPhone, Windows Mobile, and Symbian phones. (Since the iPhone does not yet support Flash, a version of the apps must already be present in the iTunes Store in non-Flash form).Many advertisers themselves are creating Flash widgets which they are hoping will be spread around virally. They can buy installs on Adobe’s widget network for $1 per install. On the flip side, developers who choose to run these ads will get an effective CPM of $5 (i.e., for every 1,000 impressions). Adobe and Gigya will split whatever is the difference between those two numbers, which will be a function of the exact (undisclosed) revenue share, the number of times an ad widget is installed, and how often it is passed along.Developers also get an Adobe AIr app which helps them keep track of all of their widgets. They can measure unique users, number of impressions, interaction rates, installs, and how many times it is passed on. The Distribution Manager can also break down installs and usage by social network, device, or country. The next Flash platform service Adobe wants to role out is the ability to develop an app once and distribute it anywhere without re-writing the app.Original post"

On its last earnings call, Adobe management provided Q2 guidance of 31c to 38c in EPS and revenue of $675M to $725M. Also on that call, Adobe CFO Mark Garrett had had reported that the company has seen its business stabilize since early February, and added that Adobe's North America business is ""closer to a bottom."" The recession has slowed demand in the past couple of quarters for Adobe's Creative Suite 4, or CS4, the newest version of the software package that brings in the majority of the company's revenue. But analysts now say that demand for the product looks to be improving amid hopes for an economic recovery. In a June 10 note, Jefferies analyst Ross MacMillan said that a recent survey by Jefferies ""suggests that creative professionals continue to adopt CS4 at a steady pace and there is an increase in the number of individuals that intend to upgrade."" Based on Piper's US distributor checks and NPD data the firm expects slight upside on revenue and EPS for Q2, with guidance for Q3 essentially in-line with consensus of 33c on $676.05M in revenue, assuming a Q3 seasonal quarter-over-quarter downtick. While still a few quarters out, Piper believes investors will start getting positioned for CS5 now, given the historical CS cycle peak multiple occurs 1-6 months prior to ship. Piper expects CS5 will ship in April 10. Thomas Weisel says that while Adobe did indicate in its last report that it was seeing signs of stabilization in the February-March timeframe in its channel, the firm is modeling an 11% sequential decline in Q2 revenue to $701M and a flattish Q3 . Although European-end markets, which is 35% of total revenue, are likely to remain weak for a few more months, Weisel believes that Adobe has been able to put some pricing increases through in some regions, such as the U.K. The firm also expects the Education market, one of Adobe’s largest verticals, to help bridge the gap in Q3 as it shifts to CS4 for the Fall semester. Overall, Weisel suspects visibility is starting to improve somewhat for Adobe as the U.S. shows signs of stabilization and management continues to focus on expense controls."

From what we can gather at this point despite the vague wording used for the announcement, there won’t be too many changes at Business Catalyst as the products, partner agreements, team, pricing, etc. should remain largely unchanged. GoodBarry, on the other hand, being merely a Business Catalyst brand set up for their retail operations, will be gradually phased out and morphed into the Business Catalyst offering:As a result, the GoodBarry brand as such will cease to exist as of the 1st of October 2009, although the company says changes for customer will be mostly cosmetical (the billing and branding will be all Business Catalyst as of the aforementioned date).The most important question however is why Adobe bought Business Catalyst in the first place and what its intentions are with the company in the near future. We’ve contacted the company for more clarity on that but in the meantime here’s what we know.Business Catalyst / GoodBarry provides tools that help web designers set up online businesses for their clients with minimal cost and effort and no programming skills required, combining website content management, e-commerce features, e-mail marketing, business analytics and basic CRM tools into one system.Adobe evidently offers a wide range of tools for web professionals, but in the near future does not plan to integrate Business Catalyst’s products into its own offering, although they are clearly looking to hosted services to deliver websites and online businesses more and more. There will be an initial transit period, but with regards to what will happen after that both companies remain mum and mention only that they are currently in ‘planning stages’ and will provide more information in the following weeks.We’ll update if and when we hear more.On a side note, this isn’t the first time Business Catalyst CEO and Founder Bardia Housman sold a company. In 1997, he co-founded Start (start.com.au), Australia’s first free e-mail service provider, which in two years became the largest trafficked website in Australia as measured by Hitwise. In December 1999, Looksmart was acquired Start.Original post"
150159,22762,2009-07-21T11:17:45-04:00,,"By Leena RaoAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has rolled out two new open source initiatives aimed specifically towards developers for media companies and publishers. Adobe’s Open Source Media Framework lets developers build more robust, feature-rich media players optimized specifically for the Adobe Flash Platform. The second initiative, the Text Layout Framework (TLF), will help developers create sophisticated typography capabilities to Web applications.OSMF basically lets developers easily build media players for the Adobe Flash Platform. Adobe says the structure of OSMF lets developers leverage plug-ins for advertising, reporting metrics and content delivery along with standard video player features such as playback controls, video navigation, buffering and Dynamic Streaming. The OSMF source code and software components are available under the Mozilla Public License. Adobe is also partnering with content delivery service Akamai to create a cohesive standard to support Adobe media players that support Flash.TLF lets developers layout text on web applications with support for complex languages, bidirectional text, multi-columns and other advanced typographical features and controls. TLF is an ActionScript library built on top of the text engine in Adobe Flash Player 10 and Adobe AIR 1.5 software. Similar to OSMF, TLF is available as open source under the Mozilla Public License.Adobe’s product manager for Flash, Tom Barclay, says that these new initiatives are mainly targeted towards media companies who want to leverage typography technologies and rich media players off of the Flash and Adobe AIR platforms. The New York Times TimesReader 2.0 and The Boston Globe’s GlobeReader are both powered by TLF, and leverage the typography features of the open source code. Barclay says that Adobe saw an opportunity to open code to Flash applications that could prove to make interactive rich media applications. In the past, Adobe has also opened up the Flex Platform and launched the Open Screen Project.Original post"
130018,22918,2009-04-09T18:07:41-04:00,,"Despite Monday’s 4% drop in Adobe's ADBE stock price, the stock remains roughly 45% above its March low. Our research suggests this stock has a lot more room to run over the next several months.Dating back to the late 1990s, ADBE’s stock (adjusted for dividends and splits) has been correlated with the 12-month rate-of-change of software pricing power (note: we show consumer software prices as a proxy for overall software prices, i.e. business and consumer products). However, since last September ADBE’s stock price has diverged from software prices, a trend that we expect will reverse in coming quarters given the firm’s decent business prospects.Software prices should stay resilient, especially relative to overall prices. The main reason for this resilience is that businesses typically do not cut software spending as much as other expenses during recessions given software improves productivity which will help maintain a lid on costs.Our proprietary Ranking System rates Adobe as a Strong Buy. One of the main reasons for this optimism is that the Ranking System typically favors stocks with high free cash flows (among other factors) and Adobe fits this bill.Interestingly, the chart below reveals that Adobe’s long-term price trend is correlated with its free cash flow per share. However, due to the overall market collapse, Adobe’s stock declined substantially last year. Yet this decline may not reflect the stock’s financial and business conditions. As markets stabilize (assuming they do this year), we expect Adobe’s stock to play catch-up with its fundamentals.Note: “”LS” = Left Scale, “RS” = Right ScaleWe recommend investors buy Adobe’s stock. However, readers should understand that the arguments presented above represent just two angles (future pricing power and strong free cash flows). Investors seriously considering buying this stock should explore all risk factors to determine if owning Adobe meets their risk and return objectives.Disclosure: No Positions."

124522,22765,2009-03-06T04:52:06-05:00,,"Adobe Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) (""Adobe"") designs a number of ubiquitous software products most people who use a computer interact with on a daily basis, including Flash animation technology and the Flash Media Player (web video and other web applications), Adobe Acrobat (digital document creation/viewing), as well as a book of market-leading design products used by both professionals and amateurs including Photoshop (photo editing), Dreamweaver (website design), Encore (DVD creation), Illustrator (graphic design), InDesign (page layout), Premier (video editing), among others. Many of these products have become industry standards with defensible market positions due to both their high quality and the switching costs that accompany their wide acceptance.Adobe's business is currently divided into five segments: (i) Creative Solutions, which focuses on the Adobe Creative Suite family of products and accounts for roughly 58% of revenues, (ii) Knowledge Worker, which produces the Acrobat family of products and accounts for roughly 23% of revenues, (iii) Enterprise, which focuses on interaction with data stored in enterprise applications and currently accounts for roughly 7% of revenues, (iv) Platform, which focuses on improving the way Web and mobile device developers engage their customers and accounts for roughly 6% of revenues, and (v) Print and Publishing, which accounts for approximately 6% of revenues. Adobe's business is truly international. In 2008, 42% of sales were in the United States 4% in other Americas, 34% in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, 13% in Japan and 7% in Asia (excluding Japan).In Dec. 2005, Adobe purchased Macromedia for $3.4b in Adobe stock (at Adobe's 2005 price of about $35 a share). In doing so it acquired the creator of Flash technology and its biggest competitor in the media-rich web application space. This acquisition has also allowed Adobe to enter into the growing market for mobile device applications software and has substantially enhanced earnings and cash flow since 2005. Macromedia also created Dreamweaver, a leading product for website design. The acquisition has resulted in a large amount of intangible goodwill on Adobe's balance sheet as an asset (more on this later).Industry Insight: Over the last 20-30 years the stocks of pure-play software companies (ORCL, MSFT, ADSK, ADBE among others) have largely been thought of as ""growth"" stocks with their best earnings ahead of them. Historically, the market has priced them accordingly. But these same software companies are creating an enormous amount of value in the present. As an industry they produce astronomical returns on invested capital and equity and generate free cash flow much higher than their net income. In this bear market, valuations have swung to the other extreme and these stocks are priced as if they are no-growth or slow-growth businesses (which they certainly will be in 2009 and maybe 2010). We think that generally an investor should purchase companies at a reasonable multiple of present earnings and view future growth as a bonus for which a small premium, if any, is paid. We feel that the current market prices of the mature pure-play software companies now present that opportunity. Adobe is our favorite.Our favorite: While we certainly don't pretend to understand the technology involved in creating software or the variables that make certain software products financial successes, we find in Adobe: (i) a company (and a management team) with an excellent track record of growing revenue, EPS and free cash flow, (ii) the ability to create products with a loyal (and sometimes passionate - see Photoshop) following and (iii) a company that is on the right side of a number of worldwide growth industries including web video and other web applications, web site development, internet advertising, mobile device applications, the paperless office concept, secure digital documentation, and digital creative content (video, photography, sound, etc.).ROA: Adobe's return on assets has historically been very high - around 30% in the late 90s decreasing to around 15% now. This decline is largely due to: (i) the large cash balance Adobe carries on its balance sheet, and (ii) the large amount of goodwill and intangibles on its balance sheet due to the Macromedia purchase (the latter totaling about 37% of total assets in November 2008), and not due to a decline in the quality of the ""business"" or its earnings power. If one strips out the intangibles and excess cash on Adobe's balance sheet, ROA rockets to around 60%. This is a capital-light business that generates an enormous amount of profits on its investments, at least its organic investments. Note that while the Macromedia purchase price was probably unreasonable on a stand alone basis (over 40 x Macromedia's trailing earnings), the consideration paid was the inflated stock of Adobe. ROE: Adobe's return on equity could be stronger - dropping as low as 14.42% in 2007, and at 19.8% in 2008. This again is due to Adobe's large cash position and large amount of goodwill left over from the Macromedia purchase. We feel that Adobe holds too much cash and equivalents given the enormous amount of cash the business generates on an ongoing basis. The productive use of this current cash balance by management, as well as future cash flows, will be a key variable to the success of an investment in Adobe.Margins: Adobe's gross margin has stayed consistently around the 90% range (as high as 94% in 2005). This high number is due to the nature of the business - customers purchase a license to easily-replicated digital information. Note that pure-play software companies MSFT and ORCL operate with lower gross margins - each in the low 80s. Adobe's operating margin is around 29%, down from as high as 37% in 2005. MSFT and ORCL both have operating margins in the mid 30’s. Operating margins have declined largely due to non-cash amortization/depreciation expenses, but we consider it one point to monitor going forward. We would hope that Adobe can maintain a non-GAAP operating margin above 30% indefinitely. Note that R&D as percentage of sales has stayed constant around 18-20%, a manageable number but slightly higher than MSFT and ORCL. We will assume that this difference reflects the comparative complexity of Adobe's design software, but we will examine this further.Cash Flow: In each of last ten years free cash flow (operating cash flow - cap ex) has been substantially greater than net income. This is because large intangible amortization and depreciation expenses taken against earnings don't accurately reflect the reality of the ""business"" - the corresponding decline in the earnings power of these assets. We believe that this strong free cash flow generation demonstrates management's ability to invest in projects and acquisitions which add great value to Adobe's franchise over time. A separate point about FCF - software companies have relatively limited cap ex expenses (about 2-4% of sales for ADBE - similar to MSFT, ORCL). Investments instead take the form of R&D expenses, or acquisitions. The abundance of free cash flow puts management in an enviable position - determining how to spend it. Historically, management has chosen to repurchase an enormous amount of Adobe's shares and then given a number of these shares back to their employees. Adobe's large stock option grants are one item of concern and a point to monitor going forward.Growth: Adobe's revenue, operating income and diluted EPS growth rates are as follows:Revenue Growth:10yr - 14.9% 5yr - 22.6% 3yr - 22.1%Operating Income Growth:10yr - 23.4% 5yr - 22.1% 3yr - 12.2%EPS Growth:10yr - 23.4% 5yr - 23.7% 3 yr - 10.1% (this result appears to be an anomaly - in 2006 Adobe took non-cash charges against earnings in connection with the Macromedia acquisition. 2007 and 2008 saw EPS growth rates of 46% and 31%)10yr EPS Growth Comparisons:MSFT - 16.2% ORCL - 23%A 10yr EPS growth rate of 23.4% compares favorably to a 10yr revenue growth rate of 14.9%. However, we believe this difference could be drastically higher if fewer dilutive stock options were granted (we do however appreciate management's desire to hire and retain top talent). Nevertheless, the above growth rates exemplify management's ability to consistently grow sales over a substantial period of time with an eye towards the bottom line.Balance Sheet: We generally prefer to invest in companies that operate with a small amount of debt relative to their assets. Adobe certainly falls into this category. In fact, as noted above Adobe probably carries too much cash and short term investments - about $2b (35% of assets) vs. long term debt of $350M.As a capital-light business we view Adobe's balance sheet assets as largely irrelevant to the intrinsic value of the ""business"". Adobe's value is determined by the number of software licenses it can sell which in turn is determined by the quality of its employees and its intellectual property - not the equipment used to produce this software (computers, furniture, etc.) Thus, price/book ratios tell us very little. Instead, Adobe's intrinsic value is closer to the present value of its future cash flows (see below for an analysis of the present value of future cash flows).EV/EBITDA: At the time we entered into our position Adobe's EV/2008 EBITDA was around 5.8, and EV/3yr Avg. EBITDA of roughly 6.26 - numbers appropriate for a business with very little growth if any. Stripping out Adobe's excess cash and short term investments, the market is assigning “the business” a PE ratio of around 8.EV/FCF: At the time we entered our position, Adobe was trading at EV/2008 FCF of 6.7, and EV/3yr FCF of 7, very small numbers given Adobe's consistent cash generation. CAPM suggests an equity cost of capital around 12%-15%, EV/FCF ratio of around 6.6x for a zero growth company of Adobe’s size (10x for a company in Adobe's space with around 5% perpetual earnings growth, and 20x for a company in Adobe's space with around 10% perpetual earnings growth). As we have noted before, we believe attempting to assign an intrinsic value to be an educated guess at best - our guess would put intrinsic value at least 40-50% higher than current market price. We believe Adobe's current valuation combined with the stability of its business, and the ""bonus"" growth prospects provides a substantial margin of safety.Valuation Comparisons (at the time we entered our position): MSFT:EV/2008 EBITDA - 5.1 EV/3yr EBITDA - 7.42 EV/2008 FCF - 8.47 EV/3yr FCF - 8.38ORCL:EV/2008 EBITDA - 8.3 EV/3yr EBITDA - 11.2 EV/2008 FCF - 11.75 EV/3yr FCF - 15.13The current economic downturn will be tough on software companies, and Adobe in particular. A number of analysts have recently revised their estimates of Adobe's quarterly earnings and 2009 earnings downward. Design professionals and businesses will likely delay upgrading their software until the recession appears to be nearing its end (and then will likely all upgrade in mass). Amateurs will likely do the same. While these are disturbing trends for Adobe's short term prospects (1-2 years), we think that they are certainly priced into Adobe's current price and will soon enough (perhaps 5 years) be a distant memory. We believe Adobe's competitors present a more serious risk to its future than the economy. Microsoft has developed an alternative to Flash technology called Silverlight, and to the .pdf format called XML Paper Specification (XPS), and will undoubtedly be pushing these on Windows users. Tech powerhouses Apple and Google are also players in a number of Adobe's specialties (notably photo and video editing), especially with respect to the amateur market. We will closely watch the developments of Adobe's competitors.Beyond competition, we think the second greatest risk to an investment in Adobe is the potential of management to misuse Adobe's strong cash flows (engaging in poor acquisitions, performing stock buybacks when the stock is inflated).Finally, note that copyright infringement and piracy eats at Adobe's sales and is an ongoing risk to its business, especially in the less policed emerging markets.The Models:We've devised the following models which demonstrate the impact we believe Adobe's abundant free cash flow will have on the investor's rate of return. In all scenarios we have assumed a required rate of return of 12.5%, this rate inherently captures the riskiness of the cash flow stream. If it were truly a risk free cash flow stream, we would discount the future cash flows at the current risk free rate (approx. 3.8%), providing a much higher present value of the future cash flows. The 12.5% also far outpaces the historical equity rate of about 9%.  imagesIn the conservative scenario we assumed absolutely zero perpetual growth of FCF from the base of $800 million. $800 million is very conservatively 66% of 2008 FCF of $1.2B as we are trying to capture the effect of the recessionary economy in the short term. This scenario produces a value per share of approximately $15. We see this as an extremely attractive valuation, (purchasing a proven cash flow stream, with an inherent 12.5% annual ROR) which ties into our put selling at $15 in the event of a near term dip to this level. In the moderate scenario we assumed perpetual FCF growth of 5% from a base of $900 million. We see 5% growth as attainable by Adobe as historic growth has been closer to 20% (see above). In the aggressive scenario we assumed a perpetual FCF growth of 7.5% from a base of $1 billion. In the current scenario, we have reverse engineered the model from the current stock price, keeping the investors required return (12.5%) and beginning FCF the same, producing an implied perpetual growth of 2.1%, which we believe severely discounts Adobe's prospects (note that as discussed above this model begins with depressed 2009 FCF). In addition to the above we have provided another table outlining what we view as the appropriate valuations of FCF into perpetuity, using different perpetual growth assumptions and require rates of return. In the below table we hold the base years FCF constant at $800 million. Disclosure: Author holds a long position in ADBE"

Adjusted EPS was $0.60 versus the company’s forecast of $0.59 to $0.60. The forecast was lowered due to weak demand for its new Creative Suite 4 (CS4) line of products. Earlier coverage is available here and here.In Q4, Adobe bought back shares worth $206.3 million and during the full year, shares worth $2.14 billion. Cash flow from operations in Q4 was $338 million and the cash and short-term investment position at the end of the quarter was $2 billion, the same as in Q3.By segment, Creative Solutions segment Q4 revenue was $508.7 million, down 11% as demand for the new CS4 products was affected by the global economic downturn. Business Productivity solutions segment revenue grew 13% to $278 million. Within Business Productivity Solutions, Knowledge Worker revenue grew 4% to $199 million and enterprise revenue grew 45% to $79 million. Mobile and Device segment revenue more than doubled to $48.2 million due to strong demand for Flash Lite and renewal of several agreements with major OEMs.By region, demand was particularly affected in North America and Europe. The Americas accounted for 46% of revenue, Europe 34% and Asia 20%.For the full fiscal year 2008, revenue grew 13% to $3.58 billion, meeting the target set early in the year. Net income was $872 million or $1.59 per share versus $724 million or $1.21 per share in 2007. By segment, Creative Solutions revenue grew 9% to $2.07 billion, Business Productivity grew 16% to $1.06 billion, and Mobile business revenue grew 115% to $113.1 million.To control costs, Adobe has announced headcount reductions of about 600, or 8% of employees. Headcount at the end of Q4 was 7,544. The company has also reorganized its business segments. It is dividing its Other segment into two: Platform, and Print and Publishing. The Mobile and Device Solutions segment will be combined with the new Platform segment as it is focusing on making Flash a standard across all mobiles. However, getting Flash on the iPhone is still far in the future.While on the topic of Flash, Adobe is facing aggressive competition from Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Silverlight, with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and NBC Universal choosing the Silverlight technology. Adobe, which has a dominant market share of 98%, has launched the open screen project including 19 companies like Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). The project encourages users to develop applications using Adobe’s technology.For Q1, Adobe is targeting revenue in the range of $800 to $850 million impacted by the economic conditions and seasonality. It expects GAAP EPS in the range of $0.30 to $0.35 and non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.43 to $0.47. Its operating margin is expected to be in the range of 26% to 28%.

116069,22573,2009-01-23T02:00:17-05:00,,"Generally when something gets pushed to ""the cloud"", it seems the user experience gets depreciated or new limitations arise. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Flash based games have been a step in the direction of the cloud, being at least delivered from the cloud but run locally. Quality of Flash games have gotten better, although I wouldn't equate them with high intensity DirectX PC games. And in any case, you need a platform which supports Flash.Then along comes this idea of server-side rendering, using the browser as the canvas. This opens a whole new dimension for cloud gaming, virtual environments and other interactive 3D usage, whereby the rendering computation cannot be done ahead of time. Check out, for example, this excellent article about OTOY. What makes server-side rendering very interesting, is that it can unleash rendering capacity far greater than the CPU and GPU capabilities on the consumer device. So for example, if you're enjoying a game on a smartphone, the rendering might be parallelized across an array of servers and high-end graphics cards, giving resolution and effects quality not even remotely attainable otherwise on the smartphone (and certainly not within it's power envelope).Making this all work of course, presupposes respectable networking bandwidth and latency.

The consensus estimate is 58c for EPS and $918.25M for revenue, according to First Call. On Dec. 4, Adobe gave a disappointing revenue outlook and said it plans to cut 600 jobs, or about 8% of its work force. Adobe's expected revenue was between $912M-$915M, below the then consensus average of $930M. Adobe blamed weaker-than-expected demand for its new Creative Suite 4 family of products for the revenue shortfall. Earlier this fall, Adobe called the suite's launch the most significant in company history. The company forecast earnings, excluding items, 59c to 60c per share. The company also said at the time it plans to cut 600 jobs, or 8% of its work force, because of slower revenue growth due to the global economic crisis. The job cuts will involve all locations and business units. Cowen and Co. analyst Walter Pritchard said the slowdown in the company's sales is more sudden than he had expected -- but consistent with his view that the tough economy is going to hit Adobe hard. ""The lowered guidance looks achievable, but in past downturns, the bottom has not been found this easily and thus the stock is without a catalyst until it becomes more clear the bar is set lower enough,"" wrote Pritchard, who rates Adobe a Hold. Key issues for the conference call include forward guidance and an update on demand trends for CS4."

That has been one of the biggest drawbacks to creating a Website or application that displays itself as a Flash (SWF) file. Search engines could see the file, but they could not see what was in it. Until now.Adobe has come up with a way for the search engines to read SWF files and index all of the information they contain. That means any text or links in a Flash application can now be indexed. This is a huge step forward for Adobe and anyone who develops in Flash/Flex. Michele Turner, Adobe’s VP of marketing for its platform business, explains:Adobe has created a special Flash player for the search engines that acts like a virtual user going through each application. It actually goes through the runtime of each Flash application and translates it into something the search engines can understand. So all of those fancy interactive Flash Websites and other rich Internet applications that have been invisible to search engines, can now be seen by them.Turner acknowledges that this invisibility so far “has been a big problem for those developing rich applications.” After all, it doesn’t matter how pretty your Website is if nobody can find it. Flash applications and Websites (many ironically created by ad agencies) have not been able to take advantage of any of the search-engine juice that so many online ad campaigns depend upon. This should be seen as part of Adobe’s larger efforts to remove any remaining restrictions associated with Flash (in April, for instance, it opened up the Flash runtime as part of its the Open Screen Project).Google is already rolling out the SWF-indexing technology, while Yahoo still “has some work to do,” says Turner. Even so, this won’t solve all the problems with Flash content showing up on search engines.Becoming visible is one thing, actually ranking highly is another. Google currently can find about 73 million Flash files on the Web. But until Adobe makes it easy for the average Webmaster or blogger to link deeply into those Flash files, they are not likely to appear at the top of many search results.Update: More info from Adobe here and Google here."

Some industry people I spoke to seemed surprised that the NFL and NBC were using Flash considering that NBC just did the Olympics in Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Silverlight. Others are suggesting that Adobe, which announced the games with a joint NFL press release, might be helping to subsidize the cost to the NFL and NBCSports.com by covering some of the bandwidth costs associated with broadcasting the games online.While Adobe would not comment on the financial details of the deal with the NFL, it would not surprise me if Adobe is taking the same approach Microsoft took with NBC for the Olympics, by helping to cover the content delivery costs. Some might ask, 'if Adobe is willing to pay to get the NFL to use Flash, why didn't Adobe pay to keep Microsoft's Silverlight platform from being used for the Olympics?' The answer is, Adobe didn't need to. Outside of the NBC Olympics website, most of the other portals around the world were already using Flash video for the Olympics.The NFL games though represent a huge opportunity for Adobe down the road. If the games are successful, you could imagine the NFL really ramping up its online video strategy, and it would be in Adobe's best interest to make sure a property like the NFL uses its platform moving forward. There are only a few major sports leagues in the U.S. and the NFL probably has one of the most loyal fan bases around, outside of car racing, not to mention one of the largest marketing and promotional arms.While I have not been able to confirm that Adobe is in fact helping cover the costs of broadcasting the NFL games online, it's a smart move on the company's part if it is. It will be very interesting to see if Adobe and Microsoft start bidding on some of the same high-profile events down the road as more main-stream content gets broadcast live over the web.Disclosure: None"

However, over the past few years, this relationship has turned sour with their products competing with each other (e.g. Final Cut and Aperture from Apple). Adobe on its part has released products in Windows-only versions to add fuel to the fire. Its upgraded products like Lightroom improve on Aperture’s innovative features. Apple has increasingly sought to create software that fill gaps in existing software and its competition with Adobe seems to be a big treat for the consumers. An interesting post looking at the comprehensive creative software that Apple has been developing is available here.However, the sore point is not having Flash on the iPhone and is missing out on an amazing web browsing experience. In Adobe’s Q2 earnings conference this week, CEO Shantanu Narayen said that Adobe is working on Flash for the iPhone and have a working version on the iPhone emulator that is part of the iPhone SDK. However, apparently, Steve Jobs wants an exclusive version for the iPhone.As for the financials, Adobe had a strong second quarter that beat estimates. Revenue grew 19% y-o-y to $886.9 million and profit grew 41% to $214.9 million driven by strong international sales and product mix. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.50 compared to $0.37 in Q2 2007. Analysts expected EPS of $0.46 on revenue of $880 million.Segment-wise, Creative Solutions segment grew 21% to $527.2 million. Business productivity solutions segment grew 10% to $252.8 million in revenue. Mobile and device segment revenue was $22.2 million, up 80%. It is focusing strongly on dynamic media and in March launched an Adobe Flash Media rights management server for broadcast and media companies. It also launched Adobe Media Player based on Adobe Air.Region-wise, Americas revenue was flat y-o-y while it did well in Europe and Japan. Americas accounted for 43%, Europe 33%, and Asia 24% of total revenue.For Q3, Adobe expects EPS of $0.45 to $0.47 cents on revenue of $855 to $885 million, versus analyst estimates of $0.45 on revenue of $878 million. In Q2, it repurchased shares for $543 million. It is currently trading around $41 with a market cap of about $22 billion.I have always liked Adobe as a company.

With yesterday's announcement that Bill Joll has resigned as President and CEO of On2 and as a member of their Board of Directors, and the recent problems surrounding falsified revenue at On2, Adobe could swoop in and acquire the company for a very reasonable price. On2's stock price is nearing the lowest it has ever been in almost 5 years and sales for Q1 were only $4.5 million on a loss of almost $5 million for the quarter.While there is much debate in the industry over On2's VP7 codec being replaced by H.264, the fact remains that there is no one single codec that will rule the world. VP7 and H.264 both have strengths and weaknesses and both are needed in today's market. While I have never seen numbers published on how much money Adobe pays On2 to license the VP6 codec, clearly it's not a lot of money with On2 still having single digit revenue each quarter.If Adobe could acquire On2 for a reasonable price, it could take its line of Flix products and offer them to the market for free, or at a much cheaper cost than On2 charges today. Doing this would help accelerate Flash based video adoption and enable Adobe to offer a better live Flash encoder. It's a safe bet to think that some of the technical resources and development skills at On2, especially in the Hantro division could also be useful to Adobe with regards to its mobile video strategy. And while Adobe is not paying On2 a lot of money for licensing the VP6 codec, acquiring On2 means it would never have to deal with another licensing contract, if Adobe wanted to renew it when it expired. I know many will ask and the answer is, no, I don't know when it expires.On2 has some smart technology folks at the company, but its revenue should be more than it is today. The company has seen very little revenue growth over the past 12-18 months, all the while the market for online video continues to grow. On2 can't stay this small forever and like many companies in today's market, needs to be part of a larger organization to truly grow to the next level. On paper, this is one of those acquisition ideas where it seems to make a lot of sense from both a financial perspective and a product and technology one.Disclosure: None"

Today, a very large competitor, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), is entering the market by releasing a Web-based version of Photoshop for editing pictures called Photoshop Express. It is in public beta and anyone can sign up. Photoshop Express is by no means just Photoshop ported onto the web. It would even be a stretch to say it’s a stripped down version of the desktop software, since it’s intended for mainstream consumers, not professionals.This distinction shows in both what it lacks and what it offers. There are only 17 editing features in Photoshop Express: a tiny fraction of those available with the $650 desktop software. And all of these 17 features are filters intended for tuning and effects - you won’t find any tools for drawing lines, adding text, or creating shapes. What you can do is easily take out red eye, touch up undesirable areas, change saturation, pop color, and crop (among other things).One of the most innovative features in Photoshop Express is the ability to revert any filter you apply to a photograph. You can do this to a particular filter regardless of whether you’ve made other changes to the photo since applying it. All you have to do is uncheck the particular filter and it will be subtracted from your changes, which are represented in a historical filmstrip with all versions of the photo you have gone through. This undo functionality for particular changes partly makes up for the unfortunate absence of layers, which are so vitally important in the desktop version of Photoshop.Photoshop Express also differs from its desktop cousin by serving as an online storage and photo sharing service. You can upload up to 2GB of photos to the web app (or pull them in directly from Facebook, Photobucket, or Picassa). They are arranged in a collection that can be made available to others or kept private. Embedding and slideshow functionality is also available.Adobe has other motivations behind this launch: Doug Mack, the vice president in charge of Photoshop Express, says:So this is just the beginning for Adobe. Should smaller fry like Picnik be scared now that Adobe is, uh, flexing its muscles online? Picnik CEO Jonathan Sposato isn’t too worried. He gives me the classic Innovator’s Dilemma argument:Okay, but what about Adobe’s massive distribution through its existing products (Flash, Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.). Sposato’s got an answer for that one as well:No Jonathan, you’re not smoking crack. May the most winsome product win. Original post"

worthwhile contender in a market that includes a bunch of Web photo
editing tools or an instant also ran that won’t threaten any of the
upstarts nibbling at Adobe’s heels (Techmeme). Webware’s Lori Grunin has a good review of the Photoshop Express beta (gallery at right).But there is a bigger picture here. Adobe is trying to tackle multiple fronts with Photoshop Express (see official statement). Among the key motives:Adobe is trying to make the Photoshop brand Webby.
Adobe’s Photoshop desktop software is a staple among creative
professionals. It’s also pricey and has more features than any average
user can possibly figure out. Express gives Adobe a starter product and
the plan is to get folks to trade up to Elements and then the
full-blown Photoshop.Grunin writes:Photoshop Express is two things: a
photo-sharing site targeting the millions of snapshot photographers who
think software such as Photoshop Elements is too difficult, too
disconnected or just too much, and a platform from which Adobe will
serve partner sites with editing tools.Photoshop Express just has to be good enough. While Adobe’s beta is likely to be buggy it doesn’t have to be perfect. All it has to do is be as good as what’s out there.This is really about the Webtop.
What’s Adobe’s real game here? Making Flex and AIR the Webtop
development standard. Creating Webtop versions of Adobe’s staple
software is a great way to demonstrate the future of rich Internet
applications. Frankly, I wouldn’t mind a little more of Adobe’s
creative suite to be launched in Webtop versions.It’s a mindshare game right now. Adobe’s platforms,
which are roughly standards on the Web, are under fire from multiple
fronts. Microsoft’s Silverlight could be a threat to Adobe’s platform.
By product line there are always smaller players aiming at Adobe. By
launching Webtop versions, hooking into partners like Facebook and
being relevant, Adobe can leverage its existing brands. Anyone that has
heard of Photoshop–basically everyone–will at least give Photoshop
Express a spin."

software company's products, such as Photoshop, Dreamweaver and
Lightroom. The videos were produced by SplashMedia LP,
a Dallas area startup that has raised roughly $16.5 million from Marc

the PC and the Web by allowing users to download Web applications to
the desktop and letting them access those applications wherever the
user may be. For example, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has developed an AIR application, so
that bidders no longer have to monitor the eBay website or constantly
watch their email. Instead, changes in an item they are interested in
can be instantly displayed on their desktop. Adobe announced the beta last fall in lieu of a promised alpha release, and, at the time, I said I hoped the company would move more quickly on completing their work on it, as the RIA market seemed to be catching on quickly. There's talk of a Linux version.Everyone from the New York Times to niche bloggers are buzzing with trying to handicap the horse race that's now developing among the top contenders, including  Adobe's latest entry, and offerings from such other RIA powerhouses as Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Silverlight and Mozilla's Prism.Adobe is already planning to make its own applications available in an AIR version, and its website lists some major online organizations that have already developed applications. In addition to eBay, these include such household names as The New York Times (NYSE:NYT), NASDAQ (QQQQ), The American Cancer Society, Nickelodeon, Yahoo! (YHOO), and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). Those interested in a more grassroots approach can find over 120 applications at the Airapps wiki. While the spotlight seems to be on, it's hard to ignore Adobe's other announcement, which is the availability of Flex 3.0,
their open-source framework for building highly interactive Web
applications, which has also been languishing in beta since last fall. I recently saw a demo of Workday's human resource management applications
built using Adobe Flex, and the ability for users to navigate and
customize their work on the fly was very impressive. Workday has
artfully crafted on-demand business applications that rival any
client-server applications. I expect this to become the standard for
online productivity applications, and for AIR to grease the skids for
wider adoption of these compelling UIs. [Disclosure: Workday is the new parent of Cape Clear Software, a sponsor of BriefingsDirect podcasts.]Flex
3.0 has added a slew of new functionality to the 2.0 version, as well
as enhancing some of the earlier capabilities. Among the new functions:There are more at the Flex Web site.While Flex may tickle the fancy of developers, it's AIR that's caught the attention of the so-called mainstream media, with even the BBC
weighing in on the matter. One major issue has already reared its ugly
head -- security, with some commentators expressing the fear that users
could unwittingly download malicious programs. The developer will sign applications, and it will be up to the user to decide whether to
trust the certificate or not. While it's easy to say that end users
should be prudent in their choices, experience has taught us that
people often blow right by warning screens and download things they
shouldn't. Time will tell how much of a problem this is. Adobe can be downloaded now. Flex is available for purchase."

every non-Adobe design/animation software is seen as a poor man's fix.
(This doesn't include super high-end, specific software used in video
games or movies. Adobe owns the personal and casual market and have
decent market share in the super-niche market as well.)Adobe generates cash. It's tough to figure out how much cash
it will generate simply because the gigantic Macromedia acquisition
from a few years back is still working its way through the financials.
Still, Adobe generated about $980 million in owner earnings last year,
up from $580 and $540 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively.When a new Adobe product comes out, people want it - and they pony up the cash. After all, you aren't going to get an FWA award without After Effects video work or some stunning Photoshop design thrown into Flash.For every dollar of tangible long-term assets, Adobe has just $0.36 of long-term liabilities(1) . The company has no long-term debt (could be good or bad, but ""none"" is better than ""too much"") (2) and generated 21% owner earnings on its equity last year(3).What does all this mean?Though Adobe is typically considered a growth stock, its financial
position, dominance, and ability to generate dependable (and perhaps
predictable) excess cash makes it look more like a value stock. Of
course, why buy ""value"" stocks if you don't expect them to grow, and
why buy ""growth"" stocks if their businesses have no value? Buffett said
it best:Right now, some kids are banging away at computer code, trying to
become the next Google. In 10 years, Google went from nobody to the leader.
Who will be the leader in another 10? But Adobe? This is one of those
rare technology companies that have such a durable and broad moat that
any competition is going to have to be extremely well funded and large,
and will have to survive many years of losses during the software
development stages, all while trying to keep up with Adobe's products,
innovations, and possible buy-out attempts.You can run through the price on your own (see How to Value a Business),
but I come up with a value around $44 a share. I was extremely
conservative (in my mind, at least) by using a 14% growth rate for 3
years, followed by 12% for 3, followed by 10% for the next 4. And so,
throughout 2007, Adobe traded right around its intrinsic value. As the
markets tumbled, so did Adobe, and now it appears to be about 25%
underpriced.Is it a steal? Personally, I know the company well and I think my assumptions are on the conservative side. As Buffett said,I'd be happy to buy Adobe today and hang on to it for the long term.
Any mistake I made in my valuation will likely work itself out in my
margin of safety and through the company's aggressive stock buyback
program. (If I made a valuation mistake and the company was constantly increasing its outstanding shares, I'd be up a certain creek without a paddle.)"

Despite a strong fourth quarter and healthy guidance, negative sentiment has created an “attractive entry point,” analyst Lou Taylor said in a note to clients. He provided several reasons to own shares of the diversified software company in 2008. These include healthy expectations for its Creative Suite 3 products, more investor buying that could come before a product cycle in the second half of 2008 (Acrobat is expected in Q3), and the possibility that large cap software investors will see Adobe as a “safe alternative to companies with large enterprise spending exposure...”"
56271,20875,2007-12-04T15:19:00-05:00,,"While Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has gotten a lot of traction in the market with their Flash
video platform, many content companies have not adopted Flash streaming
due to the server license costs or the license fee that CDNs are
required to charge for Flash streaming. With today's announcement by
Adobe of Flash Media Server 3 and the new Flash Media Interactive
Server, those licensing costs have now been drastically reduced.As was expected,
Adobe cut the cost of the Flash Media Streaming Server which is now
priced at $995 for an unlimited connection license. And the newly
announced Flash Media Interactive Server, which is geared towards
customizable streaming solutions, multi-way social applications,
content protection and allows for more server side customization, is
priced at $4,500. (For technical details about the functions of each
server read Stefan and Ryan's blogs.)For
some time now, Adobe has known that price has been the biggest hurdle
for many customers to overcome in the adoption of the Flash platform.
With the new pricing, Adobe has essentially removed the number one
barrier to entry and while not discussed in the press release, has also
reduced the cost that CDNs need to charge customers for Flash streaming
delivery.By reducing the costs that CDNs need to charge
customers for Flash streaming, Adobe is making it a lot easier for
customers to use CDNs  and enabling the content delivery networks to
increase their margins. While the Adobe streaming license fee that most
CDNs have been charging averages around $0.05 per GB delivered, the new
Adobe streaming pricing is somewhere between $0.01 - $0.025 cents per
GB depending on the CDN and the volume of Flash streaming they are
pushing. Some CDNs have a better rate based on the volume they push and
some CDNs include the price into their overall cost and reduce the
price even further. The bottom line is that the average price per GB
Flash streaming fee that the CDNs are now charging is at least 50%
cheaper than what it was a few weeks ago. Within the past 2-3 weeks,
quotes from many of the major CDNs have already shown lower license
fees.This is good news for the industry as a whole, and for Adobe,
as the best way we can all truly benefit in the market is by having
more widespread adoption, with a lower barrier to entry."

55871,20342,2007-11-30T12:30:00-05:00,,"Given the recent volatility in the market, I have slightly modified my screening process, placing slightly greater emphasis on strong topline growth, earnings consistency and clean balance sheets - the qualities of companies that tend to trade well during times of economic uncertainty. Obviously, I am not the only investor seeking a safe haven in this market, and the redirection of money flow into these stocks has driven their prices and P/E ratios up. Stocks like Proctor & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are at their 52-week highs and trade at P/E multiples much higher than historical averages. Although my investment approach is rooted in value investing, I am willing to pay a premium for stability in this environment. After all, the great Warren Buffet has even been known to pay up for quality during times of turmoil, as evidenced by Berkshire's late 1980's purchases Coca Cola (NYSE:KO) and Gillette. My search has led me to Adobe Corp. (NASDAQ:ADBE). Most everyone that owns a computer in the developed world has at one time or another used Adobe Acrobat (900mm installed base). Adobe utilizes a ""reverse razor blade"" strategy by distributing free copies of its reader product to PC manufacturers, and generating its profits on sales of its writers, or applications used to create communications in .PDF format. This creates an enormous competitive moat for the company and allows it to generate strong returns on its invested capital. Not only does the company have a strong competitive position, but several growth catalysts are emerging that should increase the visibility of earnings growth and likelihood of upward revisions. From an industry perspective, the outlook is bright. Enterprise roll-outs of Vista (Microsoft) and insatiable consumer demand for notebooks is expected to support PC/Notebook shipment growth of 11%-13% according to Gartner and IDC forecasts. Most of these machines will come pre-installed with Acrobat software. Furthermore, the popularity of web-communities such as MySpace (NASDAQ:NWS) and YouTube (NASDAQ:GOOG) is resulting in exponential growth in the number of websites and the need for creative content solutions. Internally, the company is intently focused on its recent launch of CS3 (Creative Suite 3), a suite of tools used by creative professionals and consumers that want to use computers to create their own websites, blogs, and share media with family and friends. With the recent acquisition of Macromedia, known for its popular flashplayer technology, the new product offers much greater video functionality for web-developers and should generate significantly higher per unit margins than previous rollouts. Since 2003 the average selling price of ADBE's product mix has grown from about $250 to $400. This trend should continue. Going back 20 years, I found a strong correlation between product launches and accelerating sales trends. Given that CS3 is anticipated to be the most successful launch ever for the company, revenues are poised to follow the historical pattern of post-launch growth. On its most recent conference call Adobe management pointed out that penetration rates among creative professionals are 40% higher than previous releases at this point in the product roll-out cycle (launch +6 months), due to CS3's growing popularity and enhanced functionality.  Additionally, new product launches in mobile applications should gain traction in 2008. The number of ""flash enabled"" devices sold per year has grown from about 50 million to 250 million in just the last 3 years. Interestingly, most of the developing world (and over 60% of the world's population) will access the internet for the first time via a mobile device, so the enormous opportunity here is clear. There are indications that the company will launch a mobile product in 2008. Lastly, the company is making significant strides within the enterprise marketplace through a recently announced partnership with SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) which should dramatically increase the Adobe value proposition within large organizations. Longer term, the company has been beta testing a new html-based architecture known as AIR that will make web content creation much more accessible to the masses. As the operating system continues to look more and more like a home-page, applications such as AIR will be at sweet spot of this technological evolution. At a recent conference, management indicated that internally, they think AIR has the potential to do for internet content development what Acrobat did for document management. The company expects numerous product launches based on the AIR technology, as this next generation ""razor blade"" gains mass acceptance. Fundamentals & Valuation The company should earn about $1.85 next year, which means it trades at about 22x earnings at Wednesday's closing price of just over $42. They do have over $6B in cash & equivalents on the balance sheet, so adjusting for cash we are paying about 19X, not cheap, but not ridiculous either for a company that generates ROE of 25% and is expected to grow at 16% over the coming years. I also like to look at free cash flow [FCF], and as expected with any software company, Adobe is a cash machine. The company has well over $1B in cash flow earning power, which is healthy for a company with a net enterprise value of about $18B. Based on my FCF analysis, which assumes consensus growth rates, a discount factor of 10%, and a terminal multiple of 18X, the stock is intrinsically worth about $50 per share, a modest margin of safety. This isn't a classic value stock and any execution missteps with the new management team do pose a real risk to the thesis given the premium we are paying. I have met the new management team and they have been well groomed internally and largely seem to be thoughtful, shareholder-friendly managers. Not a risk-free story, but when the market gyrations have you reaching for the Pepto, a stock like Adobe, might let you sleep a little better."
47788,20875,2007-09-20T08:56:05-04:00,,"Over the past few months, Adobe has been starting to see more
competition in the market thanks to Microsoft's Silverlight platform
and products like the Wowza Media Server.
While they are not in jeopardy of losing the tight grip they have on
the market with Flash video anytime soon, it does mean that they have
to work harder than they had to last year, when they didn't have as
many threats. With their recent H.264 announcement and the work being
done on the new Adobe Media Player, they are not sitting idle by any
means.But put that aside and Adobe still has a major problem
when it comes to the cost of licensing the Flash Media Server. While
Adobe points out the functionality the Flash Media Server provides and
what they feel that is worth for content owners, many still find it too
expensive and it stops them from adopting the platform. Every single
week I hear from customers who want to use Flash video, but have not
done so once they find out how expensive it is. With prices for
licensing starting at $45,000 for any website that wants to host its
own content and reach more than 1,000 simultaneous users, it's not
cheap. And for those who instead use a content delivery network to
distribute their content, customers typically have to pay the CDN 2x
what it costs to stream content in the Windows Media format, since CDNs
have to charge customers a Flash platform license fee. CDNs are
required to have to share revenue with Adobe based on Flash streaming
delivery over their network. It's a very similar deal that RealNetworks
use to have in place with the CDNs many years ago, and one that didn't
work out well for RealNetworks in the long run. How is a CDN suppose to
know what it's fixed cost of doing business is each month when each
quarter the revenue share number changes? And why is the license fee so
high? Would customers mind paying a small premium if they see the
value? Not at all. But when it is 2x the cost of other platforms,
that's not a small premium, especially since the fee is based on the
volume of transfer a customer does. As the customer grows and does more
delivery, overall the license fee they pay goes up each month because
of the growth. In the long run, it's a bad licensing model for Adobe,
the CDNs and content owners.CDNs would much rather pay a one
time cost for the license and then pay 10% of that cost each year for
upgrades and support. Now Adobe probably feels it's better for them
from a business model to share in revenue and make more money that way,
but as I hear from customers all the time, that business model of
Adobe's is stopping a lot of customers from adopting Flash. And while
the Flash Media Server has it's strengths, like all platforms, it also
has it's weaknesses, especially in the areas of live, digital rights
management and scalability, when compared to other solutions in the
industry.When it comes to the buying trends in the market, we know that many customers buy on more than price alone. But price is always
a factor in their decision. It's my belief that before too long, Adobe
is going to have no choice but to reduce the license cost for the Flash
Media Server. While there has been a lot of talk in the industry about
Adobe's strength in the market, pricing is one factor that can easily
affect any company very quickly. And as Silverlight continues to
provide more functionality in its platform, over time customers will
have more options in the market and Adobe won't be the only game in
town. Adobe is smart and knows this and it is my belief that they want
to make the pricing issue less of a problem over time so that customers
don't have any strong reasons not to use Flash streaming. Before too
long, I think Adobe will reduce pricing of the Flash Media Server and
head this off at the pass before it becomes an issue that starts to
really have an impact of their market share.Note:
I asked Adobe if they wanted to discuss their current or future
licensing plans for the Flash Media Server but they declined comment."

In an interview Monday afternoon with Tech Trader Daily, Narayen noted that sales in the company’s creative segment grew 16% year-over-year, driven by strong adoption of Creative Suite 3. Other areas were even stronger, with 17% growth in Acrobat revenues, 20% for the enterprise software segment, and 44% for mobile, he said. “Out strategy is working,” he says. Narayen says uptake for Creative Suite 3 has been better than expected. Meanwhile, Narayen says he expects growth in each of the company’s segments on a sequential basis in the fiscal fourth quarter. He notes that Adobe will top $3 billion in revenue for the fiscal year, the highest total ever in the company’s 25 years history. Narayen says the company has not yet given any guidance for fiscal 2008, but will provide an outlook on the year when it reports fiscal fourth quarter results. He wouldn’t say how fast the company can grow going forward, although he did say that if the economy holds up, Adobe can remain a double-digit grower. Narayen says the company’s operating margin target remains 37%-38%, although the number in the fiscal fourth quarter should be around 39%.

The news broke Sunday by Josh Catone of ReadWriteWeb, who had this positive feedback regarding Buzzword:  What makes Buzzword different? It's the first online word processors written entirely in Adobe Flash, meaning that Buzzword can take advantage of the rich application tools and technologies that Flash offers. This always means that broad user-adoption is more likely, as the web-based application will more closely resemble the off-line products that consumers are more accustomed to using.  Josh always raises the question: is Adobe planning a larger push into the Web office space? My guess: Most definitely. The real question is how will they monetize their new services? Will they bundle it with the rest of their Creative Suite? Will they offer it a free Web-based Ad-supported service?

Sales in the company’s Creative segment grew 16% YoY, driven by strong adoption of Creative Suite 3. Other areas were even stronger, with 17% growth in Acrobat revenues, 20% for the enterprise software segment, and 44% for mobile products. Guidance from Shantanu Narayen now Adobe’s new CEO and past president and COO, was limited but described as a double-digit growth company as long as the economy stays strong. Unfortunately, the November tech fallout has wobbled this assumption. Narayen expects growth in each of the company’s segments on a sequential basis in the fiscal fourth quarter, noting that Adobe will top $3 billion in revenue for the fiscal year, the highest total ever in the company’s 25-year history (which is no small feat). Operating margins are expected to remain at 38%, although Q4 may bump slightly to 39%. The major wave in the Adobe pond is the abrupt November notice of the departure of CEO Bruce Chizen, which he sums up as, “I’m at a point in my life that I’d like to take a step back and think about what I would like to do with the rest of my life.” Chizen still plans to be around through Q2 2008, and to continue as a strategic advisor through the fiscal end of 2008. I have known new CEO Shantanu Narayen for a long time - since he was a Director of Engineering at SGI. He is a really solid guy, and has been working side-by-side, being mentored and prepared for this job for many years now. I am really happy to see that Shantanu got the job, and look forward to seeing what he does with the great platform from which he is now getting to operate. Bruce Chizen leaves on a high note. Under his watch, Adobe purchased and integrated Macromedia in 2005, making it a leader in providing development/design tools for building rich internet applications (RIAs). The company also raised its industry profile, gaining Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) attention by maneuvering to provide infrastructure for this new wave of web-based applications. And as a last Chizen salvo, Adobe has announced plans to move into online word processing by acquiring Virtual Ubiquity Inc., which offers a collaborative authoring platform service called Buzzword. Adobe will also unveil an online document-sharing service called Share. The services will be free, although Adobe may ultimately charge for extra features. Buzzword uses Adobe technology to offer some functions that are rare among Web-based document services, including the ability to wrap text around images, and preview how printed documents will look. In response, Microsoft is introducing Office Live Workspace, allowing corporate employees to share Microsoft product documents online for free. Both moves highlight an industry-wide move to the Web, a trend which is still estimated to be in its infancy. Will Adobe succeed? Its share price has basketball-dribbled between $37 and $47 for the year, signaling that the jury is still out. While happy with performance metrics, investors are still expecting more before raising the price. The challenge that Shantanu will be facing is increasing competition from Microsoft on one side, and from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) from the other. Apple is the darling of the creative professionals, and under its rejuvinated market momentum, has launched some superb products for photographers, hobbyists and other creatives. As long as Apple and Adobe collaborated, the world looked different. But when Apple becomes its competitor, life will become tougher for Adobe. Perhaps, these are the clouds hanging over Adobe’s stock price, that Shantanu Narayen would present a compelling roadmap to handle."

This includes such online developments as its Creative Suite, but also under-appreciated potentials for Acrobat as a vehicle for rich multimedia publication.  Analysts expect a good earnings report for Thursday; the chart below shows that we've had solidly rising dollar volume flows into the stock over the last 200 days--a good sign of institutional sponsorship. Money flows over the past 10 trading sessions have pulled back to their 200-day average: a situation that has marked recent buying opportunities."

The Street expectations for the report are high, and trading in the stock and its options has become a little fevered; Bloomberg reports that call option volume is running quadruple normal levels. Goldman Sachs analyst Sasa Zorovic late Tuesday increased his revenue estimate for the May quarter to $734 million from $721 million; the Street is at $729 million, and the company guidance was $700 million to $740 million. His EPS estimate goes to 36 cents from 35 cents; the Street is at 35 cents, and the guidance was 34-36 cents. For the full year, Zorovic’s revenue estimate goes to $3.007 billion from $2.994 billion; pro forma EPS goes to $1.50 from $1.48. GAAP EPS goes to $1.37 from $1.36. “Our conversations with Adobe’s resellers over the past couple of weeks continue to indicate a fairly strong start to the CS3 product cycle (particularly bundles) as well as increased growth for Acrobat (after its sluggish product cycle start in February),” he writes. He maintains a Buy rating and $47 price target on the stock. There were some other notes previewing the quarter Wednesday, and they were all largely bullish. Brad Manuilow, of American Technology Research, asserted that the company will need to drive the consensus for the November quarter higher in order for the stock to move up from here. He is looking for May quarter revenue of $730.5 million and EPS of 36 cents; for the August quarter he sees $801.5 million and 44 cents. Steve Frankel, of Canaccord Adams, Wednesday wrote that he sees the results topping his own estimate of $718 million and 35 cents a share; he repeated his Buy rating and $50 price target. For Q3 he sees $783 million and 39 cents, but expects the company to guide higher. Morgan Stanley’s Peter Kuper likewise wrote Wednesday that he sees the company topping his estimate of 36 cents a share for the quarter. Kuper writes that channel checks show “healthy acceptance” for CS3, as well as “surprising strength for CS2,” and “some incremental Acrobat 8 stability” over the last quarter. Kuper notes that the stock is near his $44 stock price, and that to move higher, guidance would need to be above expectations. One final note: Adobe is one of 22 stocks included on Citigroup’s new “Global Tech Conviction List,” which was unveiled Wednesday. It’s a collection of previous recommendations, not a new recommendation; still, maybe it helped a little. Oh, and one more thing (I sound like Steve Jobs). My colleague Michael Santoli says there was some chatter on the Minyanville site offering the theory that maybe IBM (NYSE:IBM) would like to buy Adobe. Options columnist Steve Sears heard something similar from a source of his. I’m skeptical; IBM’s approach to software has involved middleware and the IT stack; not graphics applications. But I suppose anything is possible. Adobe Wednesday was up $1.28 at $44.01, and was clearly accelerating into the close. ADBE 1-yr chart:"

As a result, the firm is opting for the sidelines, as a trade until later this year when visibility into FY2008 and further acceleration beyond current estimates emerges. GSCO's current estimates anticipate 32% yoy growth in the August quarter and 23% yoy growth in the November quarter, which is a testament, in their view, to the strongest product cycle in the company's history (with CS3) and ongoing strength in Acrobat/knowledge worker sales. However, shorter term, they do not anticipate a significant upside to these estimates and given the company's premium valuation compared to the overall sector (trading at 25X forward EPS estimate), they believe significant upside to the current stock price remains limited. Maintains $47 target. - Cowen notes trading in software stocks has become more volatile in the last month and Adobe stock has pulled back noticeably since the May quarter report. Sentiment has always played a major part in the stock action and with the stock now more controversial, they believe investors should look to add to positions. While too early to gauge prospects for upside to Street $0.40 EPS estimate (they are $0.43) for the August quarter, they believe set-up looks good. Firm notes strong deferred revenue build during Q2 as well as many specific tailwinds this quarter have the potential to drive upside. Given consensus controversial view after pull-back off CS3 launch quarter report, they believe expectations are properly set to be exceeded. Maintains Outperform. Notablecalls: I must say that I was somewhat surprised to see ADBE pull back so aggressively following Q1 results. I was ready to make a fade call after the company reported, but held off as most firms were still very positive on the stock. I was looking for a couple bucks worth of downside at the most. Now, ADBE is down little over 10% from highs. That's after reporting the second-largest increase in deferred revenue ever. There is very little doubt in my mind that ADBE can post some decent upside when it reports in September. This makes it a bounce candidate today following GSCO's call. I expect the stock to gap down and would be looking for a bounce just before it hits the $39 level. That's my ultra short term view. ADBE 1-yr chart"

At the time, analysts were betting the company would lower guidance. At the time I said “the company may lower guidance, but since investors already expect it the shares may not go down or could even rise.” I backed up my words by buying call options, a trade that worked very well for me. Comments like those tend to worry me, because the better investors think things are the easier it will be to disappoint them. I have been neutral since December, feeling that the Creative Suite product cycle could lead to a “what next” attitude among investors, who will exit until they see the next product cycle on the horizon. While the stock has not fallen much yet, it also has not performed any better than the average stock during the last six months.  The high current expectations may be the catalyst I need for my prediction to come true, which in turn would hopefully create an opportunity for me to buy the stock again. My ideal entry point would be $37.50, but anything below $40 might be interesting given the current earnings estimates."

Those two events were seen by many on the Street as potential catalysts for the stock. So guess what happened: Adobe is selling off.
In part, this is a sell-on-the-news situation; everyone has known for months about the CS3 launch. The analysts' meeting, according to various analyst accounts, was upbeat, with the launch the focus but with management discussion as well about future opportunities. But nothing market moving.
Heather Bellini, an analyst at UBS, asserted in a research note that the company Wednesday provided “disappointing share buyback commentary.” She notes that management said it would be more aggressive near-term with share repurchases, but that “investors were expecting to hear a definitive dollar amount as high as $1 billion instead of just ‘aggressive’ terminology.”
Adobe yesterday was down 35 cents at $41.23; the stock was down 4.4% since closing Monday at $43.16; on Tuesday the stock traded as high as $43.95, an all-time high."

Receive all our Barron's summaries by signing up here: COVER STORY: High-Wired Act by Jay Palmer Summary: ""Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is the driving force behind the creative activity of the Web today"" -- John Witte, creative director of COXnet AdStudio, which produces print and online support for the Cox newspaper chain. With a 500% share price jump since 2001, its potential has not escaped investors. Yet even at a rich 28.6x estimated 2007 earnings of $1.48/share (vs. rival Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) 19x), shares may be cheap. Its free cash flow, at over 30% of sales, makes it one of the most cash-rich stocks around. Many analysts, including Tom Ernst of Deutsche Bank, say Adobe may well post earnings surprises in the near future; conservative 20% growth estimates could easily come in as high as 30%. Integration of the Macromedia line, which it acquired in late 2005, will begin to show its colors with the much-anticipated release of Creative Suite 3 [CS3]. Prices for the suite run from $240 for a basic upgrade to $2,500 for the CS3 Master Suite. Yet despite the higher-than-expected prices, initial reviews have been 'strikingly favorable' -- the buzz has been particularly loud from the Mac crowd, due to the suite's aggressive approach to maximizing Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) new Intel-chip architecture, which will lead to quicker response times. Its Flash software dominates close to 99% of the red hot user-submitted web video content, as well as online video ads which are growing in triple digits. Even bigger may be its use potential for mobile video on iPods, cellphones and gadgets. Bulls say shares ($41.64) should hit at least $50 (+20%) within a year.

However, the pride in its building is more muted when it comes to showing the property and its associated debt on the balance sheet, as disclosed in a recent SEC filing:
With a value of $104 million and annual lease payments of approximately $6 million, the payments do not appear all that different from those the company would pay in a mortgage. It’s not like Adobe needs creative financing arrangements, either. With $2.2 billion in cash and short-term investments as of December, they could buy 20 such buildings without taking out a mortgage against any of them. We’re actually more concerned that management is spending time drafting arrangements like this than we are about the arrangement itself. But that’s not the least of it:
So rather than carrying the property on the balance sheet and taking a charge for depreciation and interest expense, the company keeps it off the balance sheet and pays rent. With the investment in the lease receivable, it makes us wonder why they even bothered."
30406,20468,2007-03-22T11:41:27-04:00,,"On Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) first quarter earnings conference call it became clear in a hurry that if you want to get the full impact of Creative Suite 3 you better upgrade those Macs. Meanwhile, more color on Creative Suite 3's impact and pricing will come next week.
As for that first item, the fact that Creative Suite 3 will best with the latest OSes and hardware shouldn't be surprising. In fact, the Mac upgrade cycle will be driven by CS3 to some degree. Adobe said after releasing mixed financial results (Adobe statement) that CS3 will work with Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) current OS and Leopard due in the spring.
As for Windows, Adobe said CS3 will also work best with Vista instead of older Windows releases. And if you have older Adobe applications they aren't likely to be updated for Vista. Those issues, however, are relatively minor considering Adobe's upgrade cycle is much more tied to Apple than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).  
Here's what Adobe's chief operating officer Shantanu Narayen had to say about CS3 and the hardware you'll need to get the most pop:
When asked about whether Adobe was testing on Leopard, Narayen said:
As pricing details on CS3, Adobe was mum ahead of Monday's launch. Here's what Adobe's Bruce Chizen had to say:"
30174,20454,2007-03-21T05:35:56-04:00,,"Most firms are positive on Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) following Q1 results:



- Goldman Sachs notes Adobe reported solid 1Q results, though revenues of $649 mn were a bit lighter than their $662 mn estimate, EPS (ex-ESOs) of $0.30 was ahead of their-and Street-$0.29 estimate, and continuing to demonstrate the company's close focus on costs and their ability to steer to EPS as the quarter progresses. Creative Solutions, in particular, delivered revenues of $346 mn, ahead of firm's $320 mn estimate, indicating strong demand for the product suite which is only likely to amplify, in their view, as CS3 launches later in the quarter.
Results should prove to be a positive for the stock. With the product cycle trough (for Creative Suite products) now behind us, the firm is looking for a succession of catalysts starting with next week's announcement of CS3 followed next day by the company's analyst day.
The key risk is that investors will tend to sell on the news as CS3 launches. GSCO notes that in each prior cycle, Adobe shares ran up significantly ahead of the release and then tended to trade down in the aftermath. Increased competition from Microsoft is also a threat with the launch of Vista. Maintains Buy with a $47 tgt.



- Piper Jaffray says that for Q2, Adobe guided to $0.34-$0.36 on $700m-$740m vs. Street

estimates of $0.35 on $718.1m. The firm is confident in this guidance, given CS3's impact on the second half of the May quarter will be significant.
They believe there are two risks to ADBE shares. The first is multiple compression. There is always the potential that investors believe this is the Adobe of old, and the way to trade the stock is to sell the stock before CS3 ships. (Typically the stock trades off 15% in the three months following shipment.) Firm believes this risk is low, given the sell off already happened in the month of January, and now investors are focusing on earnings growth and the upcoming easy comps in August and November. The second risk is the majority of the sell side is positive on Adobe, and investor optimism can only go down (i.e. Microsoft and Vista). 
Overall, they believe the positives well outweigh the risk. Maintains Outperform and $51.
Notablecalls: Yes, ADBE stands on the eve of its biggest product launch ever. But don't forget the company has a close to $25 billion market cap and trades at 25 times its 2008 EPS estimate. Quite simply, I don't think the almost 2 pt gain reached in after hours will hold today.

In a note this morning, Cowen’s Walter Pritchard noted that there will be a variety of “events, news and excitement” around the new software for the next two weeks. He asserts that the news “should convince those investors sitting on the sidelines that the CS3 catalyst is worth owning.” Pritchard notes that Creative Suite 3 should launch March 27, with an analyst meeting scheduled for March 28.

The Interactive Advertising Bureau and PricewaterhouseCoopers announced that Internet advertising revenues for 2006 are estimated at $16.8 billion, a 34% increase over the previous revenue record of $12.5 billion in 2005.
Let’s take a quick look at the beneficiaries of the trend. Besides the obvious suspects, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Yahoo (YHOO), other beneficiaries would include the newspaper and magazine industry, which we will cover in some detail this month.
In this piece, however, my primary focus is on Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), that continues to benefit from the growth of the online content publishing business, one of their primary customer segments.
Acc. to PiperJaffray analyst Gene Munster: 
Many Adobe products are used in the design and layout of web sites, and their Flash product suite is used in designing banner ads. I am still of the opinion that Adobe should buy a social media software company, to complete the entire authoring suite needed to support a Web 3.0 site, with not only content development tools, but also tools to support Community development.
This gap notwithstanding, the online advertising trend is definitely one that puts the wind squarely behind Adobe’s sail."

Heather Bellini, an analyst at UBS, reports that prices listed on Amazon showed CS3 Design Premium at $1,599 and CS3 Master Collection (the most complete bundle) at $2,499. Bellini notes that the Design Premium bundle showed an April 20 ship date, while Master Collection showed a July 1 ship date.
Ross MacMillan, an analyst at Jefferies, points out that the Master Collection price listed on Amazon is almost 20% higher than the highest Creative Suite 2 bundle. MacMillan notes that the April 20 ship date applies to the standard and premium versions of both the Web and Design bundles; with Production Premium shipping July 1 along with Master Collection.
MacMillan notes that according to the information on Amazon.com, the Master Collection bundle will be available on the Mac Intel architecture, but not for non-Intel Macs.



Sarah Friar, analyst at Goldman Sachs, found additional info on pricing on JR.com, as well as the Web site Apple Insider. She says the pricing scheme “should be a positive for the stock,” noting that “the uplift in pricing and the slightly earlier launch data suggests potential upside to our estimates.""
After a quick search, it looks like most of the data has been pulled from Amazon; Apple Insider, though, points to some Canadian pricing for some of the new Adobe products.

22582,20411,2006-12-18T05:11:59-05:00,,"There are a few key factors which drove me to feature Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) as the stock of the week this week. Each one of these factors are described in the analysis below.  The first factor is the expected product cycle of CS3 and the associated expected earnings recovery in '07; this includes the beta release from Friday. The second is the corresponding analytical comments stemming from Wall Street post Q3 results. Finally I will address momentum and the Technical Indicators associated with the stock. CS3    Creative Solutions 3 will officially be launched in Q2 '07. The English version is expected to be available in the second quarter and the rest of the languages will be available in the third quarter of 2007. It's all about product cycles at Adobe this time. Thus far earnings at the company have been driven primarily by their recently acquired programming arm, Macromedia. But analysts want and expect more from the company. Wall Street is looking for EPS figures in 2007 at or about $1.55. This includes some revenues from CS3. However, these estimates also suggest that the timing of the product rollout is critical to Adobe's ability to meet those expectations. Even a slight delay will be detrimental. Thus far no such delay is expected and there are no reasons to suggest that, but this risk-factor should be understood before entering any ADBE trade going forward. With that, Wall Street expects earnings in '08 to be about $1.89. According to these figures, ADBE shares are trading at 28x '07 and 22x '08 figures at current levels. This has raised some eyebrows. Wall Street Comments Even with valuation concerns lingering Wall Street analysts are still increasing their respective price targets for the stock. This has added to already established momentum. The increase in ADBE on Friday directly reflects Wall Street's expectations. RBC Capital and Prudential each raised their price targets and Oppenheiner and Jeffries had positive things to say about the results and the future projections with respect to '07 EPS expectations from the company. Wall Street has developed a positive slant on ADBE which hinges on the CS3 rollout. Right now, no one doubts the profitability potential of the product, and the stock reflects that perception. With that, the beta version, which was released on Friday, will like stir a few pots this week as well. I am expecting comments and product descriptions to foster continued interest in ADBE after Friday's strength. That should add a little more fuel to the fire and I expect the stock to eventually move higher as a result. But maybe not initially. Technical Indicators and Momentum Technical indicators this year were negative until the beginning of August. At that time the technical indicators for ADBE switched from negative to positive. The stock also began to cycle higher at that time. Since the reversal that occurred in early August the stock has had positive momentum; there are no reasons to expect that momentum to subside quite yet. In fact, the stock is likely to continue to cycle higher from current levels until such time as longer term resistance is tested again. I have defined longer term resistance as longer term parameter #3 in my trading report for ADBE. The Technical indicators suggest that the stock is preparing to test longer term resistance; there is a little more room for the stock to move higher before an official test occurs. After a test of longer term resistance occurs I expect the stock to stall and turn lower again.  Conclusion The positive comments from Wall Street and the street talk about the beta version of CS3 will almost surely add to the attention paid to ADBE in the coming week. However, given the existing concerns about valuation and built-in expectations, the stock is likely to pullback in the beginning of the week before it turns higher. I expect ADBE to test converted mid term support today or tomorrow. After that test occurs [after the dip] I expect the stock to turn higher again and test longer term resistance officially. After that happens I expect ADBE to turn lower again as it oscillates back towards $30.43. Therefore, longer term resistance could also be used as a sell/short signal for longer term traders."

20480,20139,2006-11-13T15:17:08-05:00,,"On May 18, 2006, Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), which makes a number of popular software applications, including PhotoShop and Acrobat, introduced Randy Furr as its new Chief Financial Officer. 
Pursuant to his employment agreement, Mr. Furr’s was to receive (i) an annual base salary of $500,000; (ii) a bonus of up to 75% of his annual base salary; (iii) a sign-on bonus of $100,000; (iv) eligibility to participate in the Adobe profit sharing plan and an executive “Performance Shares” program (with a targeted grant of 20,000 shares in FY 2007); and, (v) an option grant—which vested over four years—to purchase 300,000 shares of Adobe common stock at an exercise price of $28.78 per share (which was equal to the closing price of the Company’s common stock on June 19, 2006).
Fast Turnaround

CEO Bruce Chizen lauded Furr's move to Adobe, saying: “Randy, welcome to the Adobe team. We are proud of the company we have built and are confident you will soon discover why it’s simply better at Adobe. We look forward to your contributions to Adobe’s ongoing success.”
On Friday, after just six months on the job, Adobe Systems announced the resignation of CFO Randy Furr. The Company said, “Furr's departure had nothing to do with his job performance. In addition, no issues had been raised regarding the integrity of the company's financial statements.”
The 10Q Detective called the Company seeking additional clarification and was told that Furr left of his own accord, for “personal reasons.”
A salary/cash bonus potential of about $875,000 per annum and the forfeiture of (up to) 300,000 share options more than $10.00 (per share) ‘in-the-money’—we had to pinch ourselves. Human nature—we speculated—who would pass up such a sweet compensation package? Did Furr leave voluntarily, without prompting or coercion, or was the “personal reason” more rhetoric than fact?
Sanmina Scandal?

Before arriving at Adobe, Furr spent thirteen years at the integrated electronics parts manufacturer Sanmina-SCI (NASDAQ:SANM), serving as President and COO from 1996 to 2005, and as CFO from 1992 to 1996.
Some analysts pondering the mystery of Randy Furr believe that he resigned from Adobe because of his possible involvement in a stock option scandal announced by a Special Board Committee at Sanmina on October 12, 2006.
Sanmina said last month that its internal inquiry found that most stock option grants to executives and other employees between 1997 and 2006 were not correctly dated or accounted for and would require that the Company restate its historical financial results and record non-cash compensation charges. In addition, two former senior level executives employed during this time period had been implicated in the backdating option scandal.
In a conversation with Sanmina spokeswoman, Paige Bombino, she declined to identify the two executives who helped to engineer the option scheme, confirming to us only that it was not the company's [current] chief executive officer or chief financial officer.
Similar to his stated reason for leaving Adobe, Furr left this other San Jose-based technology firm (and a $500,000 –plus- annual salary) in October 2005, citing “personal circumstances and family reasons that required his immediate attention.”
Sadly, the 10Q Detective has since learned that Furr was telling the truth, for his wife, Karen, was fighting (a losing) battle with cancer.
When talking about quantum mechanics, Albert Einstein said: “The theory yields a lot, but it hardly brings us any closer to the secret of the Old One. In any case I am convinced that He [God] doesn't play dice.”
As to whether or not the hint of scandal shadows Furr’s resignation from Adobe, the 10Q Detective prefers not to roll the dice, for we are convinced that only Furr, God, and the SEC know for certain.

Last month they made bold calls to buy Research in Motion (RIMM) and sell Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN) which were not just on target but articulated regularly and with force. This is much of what investors long for in a world of bland research. Part of why Cramer is such a hit is that he gives a strong conclusion, even if it based on little to nothing. Today AmTech is out with a sell rating for Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), a stock generally loved by the Street right now for good reason. Specifically, the firm noted the high expectations, valuation, low probability for an increase in guidance and the potential slowdown from both seasonality and a new product cycle starting mid-2007. AmTech analysis calls for a near-term price objective of $33 although they admit that if the stock gets there, when the new product cycle does arrive next year then the longer-term outlook would remain positive. We've followed ADBE for some time and felt that their acquisition of Macromedia gave them a near-monopoly on Web development tools in addition to their strong position in graphic design with Photoshop. However, since the acquisition the company has not exactly been executing in a fashion suggesting anything close to maximizing the opportunity they created for themselves. There's just a little too much self satisfaction in their position and ability to charge obscene prices for their flagship product family (CreativeSuite). The near-term call by AmTech is a good one. Longer-term it's still a bit unclear. Adobe certainly owns a few areas with products like Photoshop that seem impossible to live without for an important segment of users. They are also working to build suites of functions and capabilities in the corporate space around document management and the business process. Thus far their success in adding potent growth engines is unproven. If they realize it isn't there we'd expect them to make another large acquisition to continue to play the growth through M&A wave.

The company that “Furr’s resignation is unrelated to his work performed at Adobe and no issues have been raised regarding the integrity of the company’s financial statements.”
So then what happened? The Street has been trying to unravel the mystery this morning. The most obvious explanation is that it had something to do with events at Sanmina-SCI (NASDAQ:SANM), where he had a long tenure before joining Adobe. As Goldman’s Rick Sherlund noted Friday morning, Furr served as President and COO at Sanmina from 1996 to 2005, and as CFO from 1992 to 1996. On October 12, Sanmina announced that its board found problems with most of its stock option grants from 1997 to 2006. The company said at the time that its internal investigation had concerns with the actions of “a former and a current member of management involved in the authorization, recording and reporting of stock option grants,” but didn’t identify the two individuals. Furr left Sanmina in October 2005, citing personal and family reasons.
Citibank’s Brent Thill says he believes the resignation was “not at Adobe’s request.” He note We believe he voluntarily resigned for personal reasons and not at Adobe’s request. He theorizes that “Furr may have decided it is best not to risk casting any shadows on Adobe,” given the issues at Sanmina.
Cowen’s Walter Pritchard thinks that’s the root of the problem, as well. “[B]etter for Furr to resign on own terms than under more formal circumstances like a subpoena,” he wrote this morning.
On the other hand, Heather Bellini, an analyst at UBS, says she does not think the resignation has anything to do with what happened at Sanmina. “We believe his Adobe resignation is likely for personal reasons,” she says, without providing any details on what kind of reasons those might be."

Brent Thill, an analyst at Citigroup, raised his price target on the company this morning to $47 from $40. He also slightly increased his earnings forecats: he now sees profits for the November 2007 fiscal year to $1.46 a share from $1.44, for fiscal 2008 to $1.46 from $1.44. Thill cited “increased conviction” about near-term strength for the May 2007 rollout of the new version of its Creative Suite software package, and a more positive long-term outlook due to synergies between the companies older products with the recently acquired Macromedia products. Thill increased his expected fiscal 2007 revenue growth to 16.5% from 14.0%; he boosted 10-year growth rate forecast to 14.0% from 11.4%. He continues to rate the stock a “Buy.”

Kuper has some near-term concerns - primarily the risk that Creative Suite sales will be weak until the arrival of the new version in May - be seems to be pretty bullish for the long haul. “We see near-term revenue volatility clouding investor views of the company’s long-term potential, however, Adobe has a track record of establishing ubiquitous platforms like PostScript and PDF, and we believe it will be able to leverage this core to dominate another – Flash,” he wrote this morning. “As content takes on greater importance and more relevance over multiple media outlets, we expect the ability to readily leverage yet control this data to become increasingly valuable. Assuming successful execution, ADBE’s stock should reflect the benefits of meeting this demand, even if it is challenged at the moment by concerns over Creative Suite (54% of total revenues) and Acrobat (est. 20% of total revenue). We see any pullback as an entry point for this compelling company.”

17085,20171,2006-09-18T11:27:05-04:00,,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) shares traded up about 8% after-hours Thursday night after posting $0.29 in earnings per share when the street was expecting $0.26. The news was so good for our portfolio (we are long call options) that we will spend only the briefest moment to poke a hole in the report: the $0.29 they earned was exactly what analysts expected them to earn until the company guided downward three months ago. But hey, if the market wants to give ‘em a mulligan for setting the bar lower when they don’t need to, who are we to complain? ‘Cause other than that, Adobe has been acting almost exactly according to our plan. So first we will update you on the history of our position, then tell you where we think it will go next. On March 19 we wrote: We followed up on March 25 with: On May 2 we started running the numbers: Piper Jaffray called the bottom on May 15, and UBS followed suit on May 23. We said long-term folks may want to nibble, and we bought our call options ($30 strike price) on June 1. (We also sold put options on two occasions, and the second of these looks to expire worthless today.) With one brief exception since then, the script has been played out to perfection. So what’s next? The next version of the PDF reader, Adobe Acrobat, is due out in November. The third edition of its Creative Suite, which packages Photoshop, Illustrator and other programs (and will be the first to run native on the new Intel-based Macs), is expected to ship in the first half of 2007. According to our thesis, the stock should continue rallying until about then. The estimates have come down a smidgeon since May (we expect them to go back up now, but what the heck - we’ll be conservative) so the new target range is $42-$45. Until either the release of Creative Suite 3 or a price above $45 we are comfortable holding (though our options expire in mid-January.) But don't just take our word for it. Here are what some others have said in the wake of the strong earnings report. Eric Savitz provided a nice run-down of commentary from the major brokerage firms covering Adobe. Short summary: they liked the earnings report. Other followers, however, sounded some sour notes. Motley Fool wrote that Adobe is Snoozing Toward Excellence, posting such good results each quarter that it has become boring. We have found the rally from recent lows far from boring, and believe Mr. Ellis missed his blue-light special earlier this summer with the stock closer to 25x earnings. Better luck next time. And George Gutowski weighed in with concerns about their restructuring liability: The quick answer is “no.” For one thing, Gutowski is double-counting the impact of the restructuring charge. A restructuring charge is accrued when it is recognized in net income. So the $322 million in 9-month net income that the restructuring laibility exceeds 10% of already reflects the restructuring charge. (Pro-forma numbers that exclude the restructuring charge are another story.) The main reason to be concerned about restructuring charges is if the company is repeatedly incurring them (recurring non-recurring charges) and asking investors to ignore them. In Adobe’s case, the restructuring is a rare occurrence related to a large acquisition they made, and as long as there aren’t a string of future charges this one seems legit. Accounting rules dictate that the estimated costs of any restructuring be charged to income when the decision to restructure is made. Since the costs typically occur in a later accounting period, the reduction in net income is matched by a liability. Amounts that are expected to be paid within one year are “current” liabilities and those expected to be paid later are “long-term” liabilities. It is not that different from an account payable, which arises when the company buys something but has not yet paid the supplier. In this case, the supplier is primarily labor. When the actual severance payments are paid, rather than being reflected in net income at that time (since they have already been deducted from income in the period the decision was made) the liability is reduced. If you want, you can use the information to adjust the financial statements to reflect the expense in the period(s) they actually occur. To do so, you would add back the restructuring charge to net income in the most recent period, and would reduce net income in future periods by the change in the restructuring liability. In Adobe’s case, the $12 million of current liabilities are about 3% of this year’s pre-restructuring operating income. The long-term liability may represent 5% of next year’s operating income. So when Yahoo! reports that Adobe is trading at 25.69x 2007 earnings, the investor may want to adjust that to reflect the restructuring charges as they are incurred, which would result in an adjusted price/2007E of 28.02x.

17029,20153,2006-09-17T19:50:46-04:00,,"So I'm looking at Adobe Systems (Nasdaq:ADBE) who reported their third quarter earnings last week. By all accounts it looks like Adobe did well - investors certainly are happy about the results (see quarterly conference call transcript).
When I looked through their press release, though, I keyed in on the following:
Holy gibberish Batman! What the heck is going on here... Well basically the majority of the paragraph is talking about various charges related to the acquisition of Macromedia. The theory behind backing these out of the net income number is to show Adobe results on an ""normalized"" basis with out the extra expenses related to the acquisition.
I can also see why investment losses would be excluded since they are not really part of the business operations of Adobe. Their investment activities consist primarily of equity investments and their interest in Adobe Ventures (a VC partnership with Granite Ventures). What I will say about the investments, though, is that they're not immaterial, and investors should certainly keep an eye on whether Adobe is actually creating value through these investments or whether they should be just giving that extra cash back to shareholders.
What really interests me, though, is the adjustments for SFAS 123R. If you're not familiar with SFAS 123R, it is a FASB (Financial Accounting Standards Board) rule put in place to make sure that equity instruments (particularly stock options) are accounted for in financial statements. Why is it important that options and other equity instruments be accounted for? Because they are typically used as compensation and have a definite impact on shareholder value. Options are not free money, when a company exec exercises their options it dilutes the shareholder pool for existing shareholders.
I think about it this way: if I'm investing in a company I want to be in the know about what it costs to run the business. Whether you're paying employees in cash, stock, stock options, or Amazon.com gift certificates you've gotta pay them, and I want to know how much it's costing me as a shareholder. Personally, I prefer that employees (CEO and other execs included!) just get paid cash; I don't know that I've seen any statistical studies that have shown any extra performance from companies that grant options versus those that don't, and cash is nice and easy to account for. Besides, I want the executives of the companies I invest in to be focused on building a great business, not trying to push for short term stock price movements to make sure that their options are in the money.
What only makes the matter worse is that Wall Street analysts endorse these non-GAAP numbers that generally exclude stock option expenses. It sure is nice for companies to be able to exclude part of their compensation expenses, but if we continue to overlook option costs, we might as well just go ahead and go the whole nine:
To Adobe's credit, they report GAAP earnings up front and then go into the exercise of calculating non-GAAP, but the same can't be said for everyone else out there. The use of options as part of a compensation package isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I think we still have some work to do on how to best reflect this issuance expense in financial reporting.

12192,20171,2006-06-16T09:55:38-04:00,,"A week ago, we were crowing about our seemingly timely move into Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) call options. We neglected to recognize a fifth possibility: that the market would anticipate a less-than-expected guidance reduction, such that when the “expected” reduction was announced, it was a disappointment after all.  The endlessly recursive logic loops that are occasionally indulged (I think the market expects A, but I think it’s more likely to be B, but what if the market really expects B and it turns out to be A?) are probably best avoided altogether. That said, it doesn’t change our original thesis a bit. We bought January 2007 calls, not June 2006, and there is no reason to pay an extra time premium unless, well, you aren’t sure of the timing. While it looked earlier this week to be fulfilling our expectations quickly, we are still willing to wait it out. So what was our thesis? Does last night’s report change anything? According to CNN Money, Like we said, the product cycle is looming. Not underway. Recent history (last five years) the stock has reached its peak valuation when a new product is launched, so the time to buy is usually ahead of that. As Forbes reported yesterday, And we are excited about it too. It is the first Creative Suite bundle that will run on the new Intel-based Macs, which are the instrument of choice for many of Adobe’s customers. The availability of Creative Suite could actually spur a massive upgrade cycle for both Adobe and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The valuation has also not changed. In fact, the after-hours selloff has basically just erased some recursive-logical optimism from earlier in the week. So we’re sticking to our guns.

And they are practically glowing. The Street is simply enchanted with the graphics software company right now.  On Thursday, Adobe reported solid profits for its fiscal third quarter ended Sept. 1, and a strong outlook for the fourth quarter. The Street liked what it saw, and with the company preparing to launch new versions of both Acrobat and Creative Suite, there should be more good quarters ahead. Here are a few excerpts from some of the dozen or so Adobe reports I’ve seen so far. I could keep going, but you get the idea. Adobe shares gained $3.85 on Friday, or more than 11%, to $37.50.

The company also lowered its forecast for the remainder of 2006, guiding to revenue of $2.54 billion to $2.6 billion, compared with March guidance of $2.7 billion.

12198,20201,2006-06-18T05:22:07-04:00,,"The second quarter (2Q06) reported by Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) did not change my long-term enthusiasm for the stock. In the near term, we stare down a rich P/E multiple of about 39x against guided, full year diluted EPS of $0.73 (+/- $0.03).  So logic for short-term plays eludes me, as it always does. Quality of earnings is high: the difference between GAAP EPS and non-GAAP is mostly either stock-based compensation or merger-related charges. I think they will eventually get “partial credit” toward non-GAAP EPS of $1.22 (+/- $0.02, full fiscal year 2006). The merger continues to, in a lagging effect, contribute to higher quality of reported earnings because there is hidden strength is some deferred segment revenues and they are expensing some items that might normally be capitalized. Also, foreign exchange losses apparently lopped $15 million of revenues for the quarter.  Adobe’s strategic position in software is strong. The company has moat, diversification and a few embedded options. Two of the three bundles may have under-whelmed for the quarter, but I count several products growing at double digits, in unit terms. And Adobe has enviable pricing; they don’t suffer intense price deflation like some software companies. I think they are well-placed to maintain, or in some cases, improve their position into higher priced segments (e.g., Acrobat Pro, vertical applications in imaging, high end video production). I doubt that Acrobat is seriously threatened by either Apple or the proliferation of PDF-generation tools (even if embedded into Office products). Erosion at the commoditized end of this business is more than outweighed by higher-end, value-added applications (e.g., the 3D version for engineers) as Adobe adds functionality. I’d argue Acrobat’s future has never looked better as it turns the corner from being widely perceived as merely a means to secure documents and toward an interactive, print-based workflow platform. It’s the upside-down logic of software and open standards (.pdf) where opportunities seem like threats, but Adobe can actually embrace all sorts of “nipping at its heels” as the standard proliferates while exposing the base to open, free alternatives… as long as Adobe leverages its know-how to climb up the value stack where it can sell stuff for a price. The ability to climb the value stack ought to be at the heart of the matter for any software company, and this is precisely where Adobe has a track record. My favorite embedded options (small today but maybe big tomorrow) are: the engagement platform, Flex, mobile Flash and Breeze. When they said on the conference call they are going to send more of their salespeople into enterprises, that sounded to me like the engagement platform. The Verizon deal is a harbinger of things to come for mobile Flash. Mobile flash has pole position in the race to serve mobile content. Breeze is the web conferencing platform that leads its category from a technical standpoint; a market that is nascent today but could become epic as it includes e-learning and more broadly, all things collaboration. With regards to diversification, try to find a software company with a deeper bench. The latest round of production tools raised the bar. If guided by able hands, AfterEffects 7 will take your breath away. Adobe bought the whole company Macromedia for Flash, which fits into the Flex platform. Eventually, maybe Flash morphs into Flex. Flex has been tagged at times as an antithesis to Ajax (a set of tools built on top of the existing HTML infrastructure) but it is now becoming clear they are likely to co-exist and complement; e.g., Google and Yahoo both deploy Ajax/Flash combinations. And here look at the difference between Microsoft and Adobe: can you imagine Microsoft bending over backwards to embrace Ajax like Adobe is doing with Ajax? I think Adobe’s clever reaction to (embrace of) Ajax reveals their wise approach to the web. It was a decision too early to be forced on them. Microsoft thinks they can control the environment, like they controlled the desktop. But that’s not working on the web, so you are much better to do like Adobe did with Ajax: make the other product look better when combined with your own. Be one of the partners on the winning team, since the winner won’t be one company. To summarize good web strategy, it is predestined that you cannot beat them, so may you be good enough to join them. When they bought Macromedia, Adobe also acquired ColdFusion which is quietly staging a comeback after a bit of uncertainty. I love ColdFusion – you can develop dynamic pages almost out of the box, so much easier than PHP or ASP (apparently, it’s slower than PHP and doesn’t do advanced apps as well). ColdFusion is also an interesting case study in open source. The server version of ColdFusion retails for over $1,000 while developers can instead use the open-source PHP for free (or ASP). PHP is an unqualified open source success but that has not killed off ColdFusion. Either/or dichotomies distract from the fact that markets are segmented. Individual pros can cobble together open source tools, but enterprises will always pay big bucks for deep, robust solutions. That’s the idea that is larger than the creative suite: both Microsoft and Adobe appear to believe that “expressive” rich media applications will supplant windows as the web’s de facto operating system. If you agree with that, there are a limited number of rich media platform candidates (i.e., Microsoft Expression, Flex, Ajax, Ajax on Rails). Who knows what the future will bring, but if you narrow the question to rich media platforms for companies (enterprise-wide solutions), it looks like a short list that Adobe is on. And Adobe owns the creative professional space. Look at InDesign romping all over Quark. You saw that coming. Creative professional is where Adobe started, but what’s interesting is how this formerly tiny market segment just keeps growing and adding expanding its definition. In the future, where will the creative professional segment stop and end? I think Adobe also has the inside track on video. On our site, we tested virtually all of the video formats. We did not expect to use flash player for video [FLV] given the strong legacy of the competing formats, but it trumped them in terms of speed/quality. Given the technical strength of FLV, I think the Disney announcement is just the start of many high-profile flash video adoptions. To be sure, we are between product cycles (Acrobat 8 comes in Q4 and Creative Suite 3 in Q2 of 2007), but the long-term case depends on Adobe’s leading position in the mobile, creative, self-helping rich media web. I do agree that the wildcard is Microsoft’s Expression suite, but as Microsoft’s forte is complexity not usability, it’s not clear how they will beat Adobe to the rich media web.

The valuation is approaching the low end of its historic range, and for investors who don’t mind a little more of a down leg before the shares bottom, it is probably worth a good hard look here.

11853,20171,2006-06-09T14:33:18-04:00,,"In a recent post about Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), we said Wall Street can be a tricky place to navigate at times. Sometimes you can get things exactly right, but the stock will react the opposite to what you thought because everyone else had also figured it out and baked it into the share price. That is one reason we try to keep track not only of what we expect, but also whether what others expect is getting out of hand. In an example of a case where the gaming of the system is going several layers deep, we have this story on Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) from Marketwatch: So far, we have a case where the expectations for the second half may be too high because the early estimates were overly optimistic about the contribution from Macromedia. Although the company recently reduced its guidance for the quarter, they didn’t change their annual guidance and some analysts now fear they will reduce that as well. But then the plot twists further. So the company may lower guidance, but since investors already expect it, the shares may not go down or could even rise. It lends way to several potential scenarios for next week’s earnings call (from worst case to best): We noted in past posts that before the bubble, and since it burst, ADBE’s trailing P/E multiple tends to vary between the low 20’s and high 30’s. Currently we are just above a 27x multiple. ADBE 1-yr chart with P/E multiples:  If Adobe earns the $0.30 analysts expect, the trailing P/E would fall to 26.5x, quite close to the low end of the range we described. Further, given that three of the four potential scenarios next week would result in either a neutral or positive response we recently purchased call options on Adobe. We were a bit early, but we still like our odds. Full Disclosure: The author is long Adobe call options with a $30 strike price and a January, 2007 expiration date."

10157,20171,2006-05-02T17:26:41-04:00,,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) sees second quarter profits, which it will report June 15, at the low end of the range it forecast on March 22. The shares are down about 6% in after-hours trading, to $36. We have written before how Adobe tends to trade around its product cycles. Specifically, it tends to reach its peak valuation levels sometime around the release of new products, and to decline to trough valuations in between new products. The chart below, from bigcharts.com (click to enlarge), shows those peaks and troughs over the last decade in the lower portion.  Before the bubble, and since it burst, ADBE’s trailing P/E multiple tends to vary between the low 20’s and high 30’s. The forward P/E tends to have a narrower range from the high 20’s to lower 30’s. Over the last four quarters, Adobe earned a total of $1.12, giving it a current trailing multiple (at $36) of 32x. It is expected to earn about $1.30 in the fiscal year ending November 2006, and about $1.50 in the November 2007 fiscal year. Given the reduced guidance in the current quarter, the FY06 number is probably light. However, Adobe is expected to launch the next Acrobat upgrade late this year (probably with most of the benefit accruing in FY07) and the Creative Suite (Photoshop, InDesign, etc.) in early 2007. So not only do the 2007 numbers seem achievable, but given past patterns, the stock should hit its peak P/E sometime late this year or early next. So now we do some simple math. At 35x the then-trailing P/E of perhaps $1.25 the stock would fetch $43.75. At 32x forward EPS of $1.50 it could get as high as $48. Against this we have a downside potential of perhaps 20x the $1.25 estimate, or $25. Furthermore, this year options are being expensed for the first time. Although the consensus estimates currently exclude option expense, our view is that over the next year the market will stop ignoring them, which may result in a reset to historic multiple ranges."

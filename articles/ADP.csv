4367410,41431,2020-08-11T02:22:19-04:00,"In a previous article, I categorized Automatic Data Processing as a sell at the then current share price.
        There was discussion in the comments section whether Q4 and full year results through June 30 might change that view.
        Full year earnings were released on July 29, and Q4 beat by $0.18.
        At current share price Automatic Data Processing remains a sell, based on 2021 guidance provided with full year results.","In my article of May 22, 2020, I wrote, The full year results are now in, and ADP non-GAAP EPS beat 4th quarter estimates. That does not change my view. ADP issued 2021 guidance at the same time as release of its 4th quarter and full year results. That guidance included, ""Adjusted diluted EPS decline of 13% to 18%"". This was the first time analysts had the benefit of ADP guidance for 2021. Subsequent to this advice, analysts' forward EPS estimates were reduced below the levels at the time of my previous article. The share price is now a few dollars higher and the EPS outlook has worsened. I maintain a 'sell' on ADP, mainly because ongoing declines in ADP TTM EPS will likely see periods of much lower share price over the next year or two. At the same time, for long term holders, there is light at the end of the tunnel, as shown in my projections below. For those investors, continuing to hold would be a reasonable option.The logo of the DGI+ Club explained:Total Return, Dividends, Share PriceThe only way an investor can achieve a positive return on an investment in shares is through receipt of dividends and/or an increase in the share price above the buy price - the only way. For more information and background on share value assessment please visit, ""Forget Irrelevant Valuations, Returns Based Investing Is A Better Approach"" and ""Free Cash Flows: Let's Have A Discussion Towards A Better Understanding.""Assets, LiabilitiesThe engines and the lubrication, along with human talent, drive the business. Shareholders have no legal rights to or ownership of the assets. Shareholders in a limited liability company have no legal obligations in respect of the liabilities.""Equity Bucket""Shareholders have an equitable entitlement to their equity in the company. Equity is increased by capital raised from shareholders, and by earnings of the company. While shareholders have an equitable entitlement to their equity in the company, they have little to no say in how the equity is distributed. In some companies, management actions in respect of the shareholders' equity do not always benefit shareholders and can be highly detrimental to shareholders. At the DGI+ Club, in addition to reviewing profitability, balance sheet strength, liquidity, and other metrics, we take the extra step of checking the ""Equity Bucket"" for ""leaks"", i.e., effective distributions out of or other reductions in equity that do not benefit shareholders.Below, I address:In this article and in most of my articles, I seek to show how targeting a desired return on an investment in shares can be facilitated by actually estimating what future returns will be based primarily on analysts' EPS estimates and other publicly-available data. After all, gaining a return is the primary aim of most investing.First, I provide details of actual rates of return for ADP shareholders investing in the company over the last four to five years.Table 1 - Automatic Data Processing: Historical Shareholder ReturnsFor many stocks where I create a table similar to Table 1 above, I find a wide range of returns indicating a degree of volatility and risk. Table 1 above shows the results for ADP were positive for six of eight different investors, each investing $3,000 over the last five years and holding to the present. The pattern of rates of return is interesting. For shares purchased in 2017 or prior, the rates of return are in the high single or double digits. Subsequent to 2017, as the share buy price took a sudden jump upward, rates of return have fallen to single digit and negative. These rates of return, ranging from negative (22.7)% to positive 13.7% are not just hypothetical results. They are very real results for anyone who purchased shares on the various dates and held through to August 7, 2020. Of course, before the fall in share price due to the COVID-19 effect, rates of return would have been much higher for all eight investors. In the above examples, the assumed share sale price is the same for all investors, illustrating the impact on returns of the price at which an investor buys shares.If rate of return is the basis on which we judge the performance of our investments, then surely we should be seeking to estimate future likely rates of return when we are making investments. But how do we do that? I use proprietary models to generate net income, balance sheet/funds flows, and projected rates of return going out three to five years. Much of this is automated, but still involves a great deal of research and business and data analysis to back up the projections. Let us first look at the traditional approach to assessing value of a stock for investment purposes.Share buy price, dividends, share sale price, and duration the shares are held are the only factors affecting the return on an investment in shares. That makes potential share sale price the single most important and uncontrollable unknown when making a share buy decision. My expertise is in fundamental analysis, but I do recognize, any methodology, Quant or Elliott Waves or other techniques providing assistance in assessing possible future share price direction, can be of benefit to share investors. I find SA Quant ratings useful for both screening for stocks of interest and as a form of due diligence.Figure 1Quant ratings for ADP show the company strong on 'profitability' and weak to very weak on all other ratings. Since I last wrote on ADP the Quant rating has shifted from Neutral to Bearish. Figure 2 - Summary Of Analysts' Adjusted Non-GAAP EPS EstimatesSome observations on contents of Fig. 2 -I incorporate the above analysts' EPS estimates from SA Premium into my rate of return projections utilizing my proprietary 1View∞Scenarios Dashboards further below. As for Quant ratings, EPS and EPS growth estimates do not quantify the rate of return that can be expected for the stock in question.Figure 3 - Non-GAAP P/E Ratios, Historical And Future EstimatesFigure 3 is primarily designed to determine an appropriate range of non-GAAP P/E ratios for determining estimated future share price levels for ADP. This is necessary for quantifying estimated future rates of return. Figure 3 also informs us of past non-GAAP EPS growth rates compared to forward estimates of EPS growth based on analysts' consensus estimates. The forward EPS consensus estimates indicate expectations of negative growth rate of (9.9)% for calendar 2020 over calendar 2019. Analysts' consensus estimate of EPS for calendar 2021 is estimated to be 6.7% up on a depressed calendar 2020 and still down 3.8% on calendar 2019. It should be understood, in quantifying the estimated rates of return below, I'm relying on the soundness of analysts' consensus estimates of EPS. The other important factor is determining appropriate future P/E ratios, which is fraught with difficulty. P/E ratios are impacted by issues both at the macro and micro level. I don't believe I will have any arguments against the notion P/E ratios are influenced by actual and expected EPS growth rates. I'm able to quantify potential rates of return under various scenarios utilizing my proprietary 1View∞Scenarios Dashboards.My forward-looking analyses bring another dimension - the quantification of potential returns utilizing various pieces of financial information already available.Table 2.1 - 1View∞Scenarios Dashboard Projected Rates Of ReturnTable 2.1 shows buying at the current share price would provide indicative rates of return of negative (9.5)% to positive 7.0% for 2020 to 2021. These rates of return assume EPS results in accordance with analysts' consensus, high and low estimates (adjusted as indicated) and a constant adjusted non-GAAP P/E ratio of 23.31 (current P/E ratio). The P/E ratio of 23.31 is well below the historical median of 28.88 (per Fig. 3 above). But this historical median ratio is from a period of much higher EPS growth than is currently estimated for the period ahead. The average yearly EPS growth rate for 2016 to 2019 was 17.1%. Based on analysts' consensus estimates average yearly EPS growth rate for 2019 to 2022 is expected to be 3.4%. This could result in the P/E ratio declining further from current level.Table 2.2 - 1View∞Scenarios Dashboard Projected Rates Of Return - Stress testingTable 2.2 uses the same assumptions as in Table 2.1 above, except for a ~8% reduction in the P/E ratio from the present 23.11 to 21.54. Ending share price for 2020 is assumed to be 15% below the current share price (at $117.29, still well above the low of $104.89 on March 23, 2020). At the assumed lower P/E ratio, potential returns for 2020 and 2021 are negative for all cases, except the high case in 2021. Holding through end of 2022 results in low to mid single-digit positive returns indicated for the consensus and high cases, with negative return indicated for the low case. This is not encouraging as 21.54 is still a relatively high multiple to maintain.Table 2.3 - 1View∞Scenarios Dashboard Projected Rates Of Return - Aiming For A Lower Buy PriceTable 2.3 projections have similar assumptions as for Table 2.2, except for an assumed buy price 15% lower than the current share price. Waiting for a lower share price around the $117 mark, even if it should eventuate, might require a deal of time and patience. The share price quickly rebounded off its low of $104.89 on March 23 and has traded in the $130 to $145 range more recently. Buying at the lower price still only results in positive return estimate of 4.5% for the consensus case for 2021, hardly enough for the associated risk. Rate of return for the high case for 2021 is higher at ~13% but low case estimate is negative (4)%. Table 3.1 ADP Balance Sheet - Summary FormatPeriod June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2020 (4 years)Table 3.1 shows ADP has increased net assets used in operations by $2,587 million over the last 4 years. This increase was funded by a $1,271 million increase in equity and $1,317 million comprised of a mixture of cash, $1,207 million, and increase in debt of $110 million. The $1,271 million increase in shareholders' equity over the last 4 years is analyzed in Table 3.2 below.Table 3.2 ADP Balance Sheet - Equity Section I often find with companies, while they produce earnings that add to shareholders' equity, significant amounts of distributions out of equity do not benefit shareholders. Hence the term ""leaky equity bucket."" I do not see that with ADP - the company's profits are being managed very much for the benefit of its shareholders. A significant percentage of profits is distributed to shareholders by way of dividend. Share repurchases are effectively reducing outstanding share count. Detailed comments on the management of shareholders' equity appear below.Explanatory comments on Table 3.2 for the period June 30, 2016, to June 30, 2020:The full year 2020 earnings result is now out and ADP's June 4th quarter results beat estimates. But ADP also provided 2021 guidance with the 2020 result, and forward EPS estimates are now below those current at the time of my previous article. Accordingly, I see a worsening of the outlook for ADP share price in the near to medium term."
4378828,102170,2020-10-13T09:43:25-04:00,The first half of the fiscal year was solid and hid the underperformance of the second half.Management's guidance for FY21 was weak and combined with the temporary suspension of the share repurchase program put a top on the stock price.The opportunity to continue to generate free cash flow to support their dividend and liquidity provides support for the stock price.,"Automatic Data Processing (ADP) was going strong into 2020 and they laid out plans in their February Investor Day of goals to have 5-6% top-line growth given their new product rollouts, large addressable market, and favorable operating environment. Both the business performance and stock price were hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although FY20 revenue and margins were slightly higher compared to the previous year, the fourth quarter ended 6/30 was rough as revenue declined and margins compressed. To preserve cash, management put share repurchases on hold. These were reasons why the stock price crumbled from ~$180 per share to ~$140 per share before rebounding to where it is currently trading ~$160 per share. This article will explore ADP's future cash flows and valuation to see if there is coverage for business operations, expansion, share buybacks, and dividends, and how ADP can expand its premium.ADP had some consistent revenue growth over the last several years. The real outlier was FY20 that was plagued by the pandemic.Source: Seeking AlphaThe figures outlined in the FY20 Press Release show how the pandemic impacted the fourth quarter (the wavy highlighting was included for emphasis). Bookings were down, retention rate was down, and margins were down. A bright spot is that the business was doing well enough into the second half that they still generated revenue growth.In February, ADP had its Innovation Day and it laid out its plans for long term of 5-6% per annum. This was to be achieved by continuing to penetrate the addressable market and rolling out products that they spent a bunch of capital on. 2020 was to be the year that these new products were supposed to be scaled and drive incremental revenue. The increase in sales from these products will not be as robust as initially anticipated. Management did make it clear that they will continue to roll out the products as planned and to continue to invest in these products and new products as planned.ADP's financial performance is really a lagging indicator in the health of the economy. As the GDP expands, so does ADP's revenue growth. With low GDP and high unemployment, generating revenue growth or incremental growth from the new products will be tough and this is reflected in the stock price.Given the tight economy, revenue is expected to decline YoY. There really are no bright spots here and the stock price has remained pinned down and valuation is stuck in a rut. Investors would like to hear about an improvement in sales and how the new products are rolling out. Positive cadence and improvement in some of the operating segments could push this stock higher.Unsurprisingly, margins have compressed in the fourth quarter but were favorable on a YoY basis. Once again, this points to a solid first half of 2020.Total margins are expected to decline ~300bps YoY in FY21. To get out of this rut, they will need higher volumes and more incremental revenue from their higher-margin new products being rolled out. Investors would like to see higher margins (of course) in the 1st quarter results or at least discussion of improvement and the roll out is moving ahead of schedule.ADP has historically generated strong cash flow and has returned about $2Bn annually to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. The share buybacks have been suspended, which is another strike against ADP's stock price. Even with a decline in revenues and margin compression, I would not worry about the dividend payment going down or not being covered. My model even shows that the Company can repurchase shares and maintain solid liquidity.My model assumes a three percent decline in revenue and 300bps in EBIT margin compression in FY21. Over the next two years, revenue growth expands to 4-5% per annum and margins head back to historical levels. As the table below outlines that there is strong unlevered free cash flow, but it should be considered additionally changes in the sources and uses of cash for long-term balance sheet items. The table below models net working capital and not long-term balance sheet items.The debt payments are aligned with recent historical figures and assume that their notes are refinanced with largely the same terms. Levered free cash flow is solid and provides sufficient coverage from dividend payments and an opportunity to restart the share repurchase program.I think that investors see that cash flow will remain solid in the near term and this has provided support for the stock price. The halt on share repurchases is a bummer, but it is a prudent move by management to preserve cash.There is nothing new to show here that wasn't said earlier in the article. The pandemic made all stocks correlated for a short period of time and all stock prices fell drastically. Some returned faster than others, but as mentioned earlier, the tie to the broader economy really put a ceiling on the stock price.Data by YChartsThe closest comparable to ADP is Paychex (PAYX) and its valuation is similar.For the stock price to go higher, investors would like to see improved performance or trends improving in the individual segments. Margin expansion will also be helpful. If management provides hints that liquidity is solid and the share repurchase program may start up in the near term would improve confidence and expand multiple valuations. Perhaps most important is the general health of the economy. If more funds are plowed into people's pockets or unemployment improves, look for the stock price to rip higher.ADP had three strikes in the second half of the year:It is not all bad at ADP. They will continue to roll out their new products and continue to invest in their business. I have modeled cash flow to remain ample and support both dividends and share repurchases (whenever that starts up). For the stock price to improve, look for actual improvement in financial performance in the first quarter or favorable outlook from management, the restart of the share buyback program, and improvement in the general health of the economy. Hopefully, some of these areas will be discussed in the first quarter earnings call."

Automatic Data processing showed up in my screening of DGI+ Club database of dividend-paying stocks as likely to provide above average returns at present share price. Closer analysis and review does not confirm that preliminary assessment. High unemployment resulting from COVID-19 is expected to last well beyond the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, the end of which in itself is highly uncertain. This will have an adverse impact on ADP's earnings for an indefinite period. The main issue with ADP's share price is the company has been attracting a very high P/E multiple due to a record of high EPS growth. A combination of a reduction in EPS due COVID-19 and a reduction in P/E multiple due to curtailed growth represents a double whammy for the share price. That impact has likely not yet been fully felt. It might not be fully reflected in the share price until full-year results through end of June are announced in July or thereabouts. The company has a solid balance sheet, with negligible net debt, and will likely continue to show positive, although reduced, earnings, and will certainly survive through this pandemic. The issue is purely with the share price which has not adjusted sufficiently to reflect the environment the company now operates in.From the ADP 10-Q filing for third quarter ending March 31, 2020 -In this article and in most of my articles, I seek to show how targeting a desired return on an investment in shares can be facilitated by actually estimating what future returns will be based primarily on analysts' EPS estimates and other publicly-available data.

The P/E ratio of 23.11 is well below the historical median of 28.88. It's also below the historical low of 25.64 through end of 2019 (per Fig. 3 above). But these historical ratios were set in periods of much higher EPS growth than is currently estimated for the period ahead.Table 2.2 - 1View∞Scenarios Dashboard Projected Rates Of Return - Stress testingTable 2.2 uses the same assumptions as in Table 2.1 above, except for a reduction in the P/E ratio from the present 23.11 to the sector median of 21.54.

At the assumed lower historical level P/E ratio, potential returns for 2020 are negative for all cases, consensus, high and low. Holding through end of 2021 results in high single-digit positive returns indicated for the high case only, with negative returns indicated for the consensus and low cases.

The share price quickly rebounded off its low of $104.89 on March 23 and has traded in the $130 to $145 range more recently. Buying at the lower price still only results in positive return estimate of 7.59% for the consensus case for 2021, hardly enough for the associated risk. Rate of return for the high case for 2021 is higher at ~17% but low case estimate is negative (2)%. The low case is possibly the more likely case than the high case.Table 3I often find with companies, while they produce earnings that add to shareholders' equity, significant amounts of distributions out of equity do not benefit shareholders.

Since June 30, 2016, Net Assets Used In Operations have increased by $1.0 billion. All this has been done without taking on additional debt. However cash has reduced by $1.5 billion since end of 2016. This has resulted in a net cash position of $1.2 billion at end of 2016 changing to a net debt position of $300 million at end of March 2020.Automatic Data processing has provided solid total returns to investors over the last four to five years. Future EPS growth will be adversely impacted by large increases in unemployment and these increased unemployment levels may persist far beyond the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. The growth story for ADP is interrupted and the high P/E multiples that came with that growth story will likely shrink in the period ahead. A combination of shrinking multiples and lower EPS will likely drive the share price down well below current levels. I will be looking to the full-year earnings results to see how this story is playing out, and whether I should adjust my views on this stock. ADP is a sell at present."
4341633,105417,2020-04-30T15:08:44-04:00,"EBIT margin expanded during the quarter, despite pressures from the top line.
        Capital return story remains intact, with both share buybacks and dividends.
        We are reducing EPS estimates further by 15 cents to $5.83, though at present valuation ADP remains a solid Buy.","Automatic Data Processing (ADP) reported results that were slightly ahead of our expectations and provided commentary that we view as optimistic enough in the age of coronavirus. Employer Services and PEO Services business segments came in at $2.81 billion and $1.24 billion, respectively, in line with low-single digits Y/Y revenue growth. Further, the company guided down on FY20 guidance, citing ""substantial impact"" to its business. As we said regarding other companies, we do not believe that annual guidance is appropriate at this point, especially for a company that relies on employment data, since in many cases it's a shot in the dark. We do not believe that investors will penalize ADP and other companies for being cautious around guidance during a pandemic. However, the good news is that ADP continues to do fairly well, and at the present valuation levels still remains a solid buy. Below, we revisit our valuation and discuss our Bullish thesis.Longer term, we continue to anticipate meaningful revenue growth and margin expansion from the ADP platform, as aggressive growth in new clients will remain at the very least flat in 2020, according to our estimates, but should make up for that flatness in 2021 and beyond. However, we need to recognize that for now our valuation should reflect the realities of 2020: therefore, we are further reducing our EPS from $5.98 to $5.83, while holding our P/E multiple at ~28x, unchanged from our preview. When we apply the multiple of ~28x to the 2020 EPS estimate of $5.83, we get the new target price of $163. As soon as the coronavirus noise clears and we have evidence of improvement in the payroll processing space, and ADP in particular, we will be happy to revisit our target price. We also note that our slight target price reduction has nothing to do with our confidence in the stock and is driven by some very moderate changes in the model (discussed below).EBIT margin expanded during the quarter: The company expanded EBIT margin by 60 basis points in 1Q, which was slightly above consensus, despite unplanned $50 MM global associate payment program for COVID-19. In other words, revenue performance was so strong that it drove not only the margin, but also unforeseen expenses. In the end, EPS growth was around 8%, which is around the midpoint of newly issued guidance (see below).Nearly all employees working from home: About 50,000 of ADP employees are currently working from home remotely, with remote capacity expanded and internet / laptops provided in those cases, when it was needed. Further, all field sales employees shifted from in-person to a virtual sales positions. Annual guidance brought down: ADP lowered its 2020 guidance, with revenue coming down from 6% Y/Y growth to 3% Y/Y, while EPS growth is now in the 4-7% Y/Y range, down from 12%-14% range. As we noted before, ADP is one of the few payments names in our coverage to provide modified guidance, rather than withdraw it all together amidst coronavirus uncertainty. We believe that much of the guidance revision is driven by bookings decline, since there was a 9% negative impact in 1Q alone, and its supposed to exacerbate in April, when nearly 30 MM people filed for unemployment. Reducing EPS estimates further, though not by much: We anticipated a reduction in EPS guidance, though our average scenario was around 5.9%, rather than 5.5% Y/Y growth. As a result, we are adjusting EPS further down from $5.98 to $5.83, which is nearly all revenue-driven and only 1-2 cents are related to incremental to COVID expenses.Transformational efficiencies on track, despite the turmoil: We anticipate at least $200 MM in cost efficiency savings over time, which should translate into annual 3% EPS growth in 2022-23. Despite current business pressures, we are glad to see that the company still remains committed to boosting the bottom line and that the initiatives will likely get pushed out into the future but not eliminated altogether. Capital return story remains a success! In our view, capital return will remain an important light at the end of the tunnel not only for payroll processing names, but for the payments industry as a whole. First of all, we were correct to expect the $5 billion of share buyback authorization to remain in place. Further, we do not see ADP accepting any bailout funds from the $2 trillion stimulus bill that was recently passed; hence, there should not be political pressures to suspend the buybacks. Furthermore, the dividend remains solid, with the yield around 2.6%. With such a strong dual capital return story support, we believe that demand among investors, particularly on the institutional side, shall remain strong.We see the following risks as potentially negatively impacting ADP’s bottom line:Data breaches represent the core of today’s technology problems, particularly since ADP is responsible not only for servicing private businesses, but also storing government-sensitive data. This also applies to disruptions of ADP’s data centers. We are now identifying this as the main business risk for Automatic Data Processing.Increase in license requirements, which is becoming more and more relevant for ADP, as it branches out across Europe and Latin America.Intellectual property infringement is another very important risk, since barriers to entry in ADP’s business are fairly low and any theft of copyrighted data could lead to problems on the competitive landscape."
4370939,50452,2020-08-26T15:36:54-04:00,"ADP recently closed out its FY2020 with a better than expected fourth quarter.While the quarter was solid, the real impact of COVID-19 will be felt in FY2021 with a large drop in earnings expected.The stock isn't quite pricing in the struggles ahead, but should the market push shares lower, investors should be ready to strike.","Many companies have felt the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, and dividend champion Automatic Data Processing (ADP) has been no exception. Despite the company managing a top and bottom line beat when it concluded its 2020 fiscal year last month, the stock's share price remains below pre-COVID-19 levels. While the depressed share price may seem like a buying opportunity, the impact of COVID-19 will be more strongly felt in FY2021. Earnings are forecasted to be drastically lower, and it doesn't look like this is quite fully priced into the stock. We will verify ADP's fundamental strength, and outline what an attractive entry point might look like.Automatic Data Processing is a company that provides various human resource products and services to employers all over the world. It was widely expected that a surge in unemployment thanks to shutdowns (in an effort to minimize the spread of the virus) would have a devastating impact on a company such as ADP.Data by YChartsADP wrapped up its fiscal year with 2020 Q4 earnings at the end of July. The company posted better than expected numbers with a top and bottom line beat (revenues beat by $60M and EPS beat by $0.18 on an adjusted basis).However, the impact of COVID-19 on ADP isn't avoided, simply delayed. The company had some unfortunate news during its earnings presentation. The company's new business bookings are down a whopping 67% in its Employer Services segment.Source: Automatic Data ProcessingAdditionally, the company guided for earnings to take a big hit in FY2021. From 2020 EPS of $5.92, next year's earnings will be down between 13% and 18%.While 2021 will be a tough year for the company, ADP is a strong business with good fundamentals. In other words, they will be fine in the long run. How do we know this?First of all, the setback for ADP will not drastically impact their operating metrics. The company is anticipating EBIT margin losses of 300 basis points.With EBIT margins for 2020 coming in at 23%, we are talking about a reduction to 20%. A 13% hit to profitability hurts, but it won't be nearly enough to really distress the company. Revenues will be down mid-single digits, and the resulting loss of cash will be absorbed by a sparkling balance sheet.Data by YChartsThe company is virtually debt free on a net basis, so even if things are worse than expected, ADP is well equipped to deal with this temporary setback.While ADP is positioned well for the long term, the shorter term is a bit more unclear. ADP came into the pandemic benefitting from a booming economy with very little unemployment.Almost regardless of how the rest of the pandemic plays out, it's unlikely that employment will snap-back to pre-pandemic levels. Many of the furloughs are becoming permanent layoffs, and it remains to be seen how many businesses will be unable to reopen their doors.Data by YChartsEven though the stock remains below pre-pandemic highs, the stock still trades at an earnings multiple of 23.8X, which is roughly in line with the stock's 10-year median multiple of 24.8X.There are two issues with this. First, the past 10 years represent a strong economic backdrop versus the current situation. Since 2010, the economy has steadily trended higher (for the most part). It remains to be seen how long it will take for the global economy to recover from the fallout of COVID-19. Airlines have already made it clear that they expect a multi-year recovery ahead. So, while ADP is a strong company, the operating environment (employment) over the next few years appears harsher than much of the decade leading up to COVID-19.This flows into my second concern. The company is poised to see a setback in operating performance, which management has already guided to for 2021. If we take the company's EPS of $5.92 and back it down 15% (the midpoint of 2021 guidance), the resulting $5.03 per share produces a forward earnings multiple of 28.2X. Even worse, it's impossible to know whether or not ADP will see earnings pressure in 2022, 2023, etc. In summary, the current stock price doesn't price in very much hardship when there is clear hardship on the way.To be clear, the long-term outlook of ADP is positive. It's a leading player in its industry and has a clean balance sheet. The company has also grown steadily with revenues growing at a 5% CAGR over the past decade and earnings following with a 9% CAGR.However, ADP does appear poised for some near-term turbulence. I don't believe that the stock price accurately reflects what is coming. This could mean a better buying opportunity down the road when turbulence hits or the market isn't setting new all-time highs. Shares would offer a bit more of a margin of safety were they to retreat to average values on a forward basis (in other words, factor in the looming drop in earnings). This would mean a forward multiple of 24X or $120 per share.As a long-term investor, building a position during a temporary setback (when it's not a reflection of a company's fundamentals) can prove lucrative when the operating environment eventually turns for the better.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4369326,105095,2020-08-17T17:22:18-04:00,"Long term, I believe there are a few trends ensuring ADP’s continued growth in the future.Even in the case of a temporary shutdown, companies still need to keep their HR/payroll infrastructure/systems in place. ADP enables and makes efficient the payroll and benefits function.I believe that ADP should be trading at an average P/E ratio closer to 30x-35x given the company’s competitive advantages, growth opportunities, and stable business.","The ongoing coronavirus crisis still leaves me with a lot of uncertainty even though the stock market has continued to soar to new heights. Despite my belief that things will eventually return to normal, I am still wary of a potentially prolonged recession. I wanted to look at companies that could be great long-term opportunities and are “defensive” in nature. I believe Automatic Data Processing (ADP) is a good candidate.Just a brief background on the company, ADP is one of the world’s largest providers of human capital management solutions. The company has over 860,000 clients worldwide in 140 countries. The company was founded in 1949 and has undergone a digital transformation to be more suited to the modern world. The company is organized around three segments.Investor presentationFirst is the HCM solutions which provide cloud-based software to assist employers of different types and sizes. An HCM solution acts as a portal for employees so that they can have a single data source for all HR/Benefits/ Payroll concerns. ADP’s primary software is called ADP Workforce Now and competes primarily against Workday (WORK). ADP Workforce Now software is more popular with mid-sized companies as it tends to be a cheaper option. Reviews of the software have stated that it is competitive against Workday, though some have complained about the dated interface and poor search capability. Apart from Workforce Now, ADP also has a specific solution for large enterprise clients called ADP Vantage HCM which serves over 500 enterprise-level clients.Investor presentationThe company also offers HR outsourcing solutions for administration, payroll, benefits management, and other services. The company offers outsourcing solutions to both large and small firms. For small- and mid-sized firms, this is done through a co-employment model where both the client and ADP employ employees and ADP takes on certain responsibilities such as payroll and tax fillings. The company’s outsourcing solutions work together with its Workforce Now software to create a comprehensive end to end solution for customers.Finally, the company’s Global Solutions consists of helping multinational clients navigate complex HR management issues across multiple countries. I believe in the case of ADP, the whole is worth more than the sum of its individual parts as these three segments working together form the competitive advantage of ADP. The company is able to use its own in-house technology platform to offer a wide array of services, in different countries, on a massive scale.Investor presentationIn terms of short-term results, we can examine the company’s fiscal year 2020 just ended in June. Compared to last year, 4Q 2020 revenues decreased by 2%, taking out the effects of currency fluctuation to $3.5 billion. Adjusted net income decreased only 1% during this time period and EPS was fat at $1.14. Full-year currency adjusted revenues increased by 4% and EPS increased by 9% to $5.70. This is despite the coronavirus and the lockdowns happening during that same time frame demonstrating the resiliency of the business. I believe this demonstrates the “stickiness” of ADP's business and the fact that it is essential to its customers. As of the last reporting period, the company has cash of $1.9 billion against long-term debt of $1.0 billion. The company has been prudent in paying down this debt as long-term debt was $2.0 billion last year. This ensures that the company is well prepared to weather the current ongoing crisis.The bear-case around ADP seems to be centered on the fact that the US is going into recession. With the current 10.2% unemployment, there would be less of a need for HR/ payroll management. However, I believe that this is not true as even in the case of a temporary shutdown, companies still need to keep their HR/payroll infrastructure/systems in place. ADP enables and makes efficient the payroll and benefits function, therefore, I believe that the only scenario where these functions would no longer be needed is if the customer goes out of business. Furthermore, ADP actually has a chance to win more new customers as businesses need to get leaner and cut costs in order to weather out the ongoing storm. We can see that even during the Great Recession, ADP still exhibited EPS growth (2007 EPS of $2.04 vs. 2009 EPS of $2.63).Despite being a dominant force in human capital management solutions, the company has been growing net income at a fairly healthy pace. Revenue has been growing at a CAGR of 4.5% in the last 5 years. Operating income has been growing at a faster rate of 8.0% CAGR in the last five years primarily driven by improving EBIT margins as the company executed on its software-focused transformation. EBIT margin in 2015 was 19.8% compared to the 2020 EBIT margin of 23.4%. These results are reflected in the cash flows generated by the company as well.Author calculations based on data from Seeking AlphaLong term, I believe there are a few trends ensuring ADP’s continued growth in the future. First is the continued increase in payrolls and compliance-related regulatory requirements. Payroll compliance costs are increasing as more regulations are put in place and offering a complete end to end software and outsourcing solution will ensure a steady pipeline of clients for ADP. Furthermore, ADP is increasing their enterprise and small-business solutions, ensuring that intelligent automation and “smart” data processing is available to all types of clients, i.e., eliminating manual inputting and other redundant tasks.Investor presentationI believe that ADP’s scale and recession-resistant business make it an investment to consider. In the last five years, the company typically trades at a P/E ratio above 25. At fiscal 2020 EPS of $5.70 and current share price of $138.9, this implies a P/E ratio of 24.4x which is right about the average. There are two important things to note, though. The fiscal 2020 EPS includes March 2020-June 2020 which was the height of the coronavirus pandemic. EPS growth may have been higher if it were not for that crisis. Furthermore, the 10-year government bond yield is at an all-time low of 0.71%, much lower than the 2%-3% yield of the past five years. With a dividend yield of 2.62%, I believe that ADP should be trading at an average P/E ratio closer to 30x-35x. I believe given the company’s competitive advantages, growth opportunities and stable business, ADP is a buy.Data by YCharts"
4381236,60561,2020-10-25T16:56:06-04:00,Automatic Data Processing is a Dividend Champion with 44 consecutive years of dividend growth. Shares currently yield 2.44%.ADP provides valuable outsourcing to allow management teams to focus on the core business.Valuing ADP using dividend yield theory and MARR analysis.,"Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), referred to as ADP from here on, is a global leader in payroll and human resources outsourcing. At the end of FY 2020, ADP had >680k clients worldwide with options supporting freelancers up to Fortune 500 companies.The value proposition for ADP's clients is that by outsourcing the rather mundane tasks of running a business, i.e. payroll, HR, etc., management can focus on the things that are truly important to improving the business over time.ADP is one of those chronically expensive businesses that I had long refrained from adding to my portfolio. Roughly one year ago, I finally initiated a position and have been slowly building up my stake since then.The investment strategy that I gravitated towards most is dividend growth investing. By adopting that strategy, I want to build my portfolio with businesses that generate plenty of excess cash flow that can then be returned to owners via a rising dividend payment.Image by author; data source Automatic Data Processing Investor RelationsAccording to the CCC list, ADP is a Dividend Champion with 44 consecutive years of dividend growth. That puts its streak starting back in 1976, and every year, ADP has been there rewarding shareholders with pay raises throughout all sorts of economic and political cycles.Starting with 1991, ADP has shown year-over-year dividend growth ranging from 3.6% to 33.0% with an average of 14.3% and a median of 14.8% across those 29 periods.Of the 25 rolling five-year periods over that time, ADP has shown annualized dividend growth between 7.6% and 21.0% with an average of 13.4% and a median of 13.4%.There's been 20 rolling 10-year periods over that same time where ADP has an annualized dividend growth ranging from 8.8% to 18.1% with an average of 13.3% and a median of 13.8%.The 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year period annualized dividend growth rates since 1991 can be found in the following table.Table and calculations by author; data source Automatic Data Processing Investor Relations*Based on calendar year record dates of dividend payments.**2020's dividend assumes a 4Q payout of $0.91 whereas Automatic Data Processing has traditionally increased the dividend with a record date in December.As a dividend growth investor, the safety of a dividend payment is very important. That means the payout ratio, whether based on net income or free cash flow, is a critical metric to track because inevitably the business will hit a rough patch that depresses the ability to pay and grow a dividend.Image by author; data source Automatic Data Processing SEC filingsOver the last decade, ADP's payout ratio has been quite stable based on both net income and free cash flow. Dividends have accounted for 59% of net income and 57% of free cash flow on average over the last 10 years.When adopting a dividend growth strategy, the quality of the business as well as its ability to continue to grow the dividend is of paramount importance. In order to get a gauge on the quality of the underlying business, I have a variety of metrics that I examine that help me get a glimpse of the business strength and growth as well as analyze management.Image by author; data source Automatic Data Processing SEC filingsADP has managed 56% total revenue growth from FY 2011 through FY 2020 which is ~5.1% annualized. Some of that is due to the spinoff of CDK Global in FY 2015. Outside of the decline in FY 2015, ADP's average year-over-year revenue growth has been 7%.Gross profits have shown 70% total growth over the last decade or ~6.1% annualized. Meanwhile operating profits grew 145% in total or ~10.5% annualized with operating cash flow showing growth of 77% and 6.6% annualized. Over that same time, free cash flow grew 69% in total or ~6.0% annualized. Image by author; data source Automatic Data Processing SEC filingsADP's gross margins have shown solid improvement over the last decade, rising from 38.6% to 42.1%. The average over the last 10 years is 41.2% with the five-year average at 41.8%. Image by author; data source Automatic Data Processing SEC filingsMy preferred profitability metric is the free cash flow return on invested capital, FCF ROIC. Much like the FCF margin from above, I want to see a FCF ROIC greater than 10%. ADP has easily surpassed the 10% FCF ROIC each year of the last decade with FCF ROIC regularly greater than 20%. ADP has managed a 10-year average FCF ROIC of 26.7% with the average over the most recent five-year period at 29.5%.When investing my capital, I want to take the perspective of a business owner. That means I want to see capital allocation decisions that make sense. Of course the first priority would be to invest in the business through capital expenditures to protect and grow it. Sustainable excess cash flow should then be returned to shareholders via a rising dividend payment. Any surplus cash flow above that should then be split between debt reduction, share repurchases, strategic acquisitions and building up a cash buffer.To understand how ADP has used its cash flow, I calculate three variations of the metric, defined below:Ideally the business would be generating enough cash flow to support the entire capital allocation process. I'm not concerned if any year dips negative, because opportunities can be short-lived; however, I do want to see the trend over time to show a positive FCFaDB. Image by author; data source Automatic Data Processing SEC filingsAs we saw earlier, ADP has shown positive FCF every year over the last decade with FCF showing year-over-year growth in 8 of the last 10 years. In total, ADP has generated $17.11 B in cumulative FCF which has allowed it to pay out $9.81 B to shareholders via a dividend that's grown every year. The 10-year cumulative FCFaD comes to $7.30 B.With that $7.30 B in FCFaD, management has further returned $9.69 B to shareholders via share repurchases. Unfortunately, that puts the cumulative FCFaDB at -$2.40 B for the decade. However, as you can see, ADP has generally returned 100% of FCF back to shareholders except for FY 2015 through FY 2017 which are the main offenders with regards to outspending FCF generation.That $9.69 B spent on repurchasing shares reduced the share count from 498.3 M in FY 2011 to 432.7 M by FY 2020. That's a total decrease of 13.2% or ~1.6% annualized. Image by author; data source Automatic Data Processing SEC filingsAs an investor in the equity of a business, the balance sheet is high on the list of things to keep an eye on since equity is lower on the capital structure. If debt levels are too high and not supported by the cash flows generated by the business, then shareholders' investment will be at risk. Image by author; data source Automatic Data Processing SEC filingsADP has been judicious with its approach to debt over the last decade. Over the last decade, the average debt-to-capitalization ratio works out to 18% with the median at 25%. In terms of the capital structure, debt is not a concern at this time. Image by author; data source Automatic Data Processing SEC filingsIn analyzing the balance sheet, I also want to see how much debt there is in relation to a variety of ""income"" metrics. Essentially what I want to find out is how quickly the debt load could be reduced should the cost of debt materially increases. The 10-year average debt-to-EBITDA, debt-to-operating income and debt-to-FCF levels are 0.7x, 0.5x and 0.7x, respectively.For valuing investment candidates, I use multiple methods to come up with a rough idea of the fair value. The approaches that I like to use are the minimum acceptable rate of return (MARR), dividend yield theory and a reverse discounted cash flow as a ""reality check"" to see what expectations are built into the share price.A MARR analysis requires you to estimate the future earnings and dividends that a business will produce, apply a reasonable expected multiple on those future earnings and calculate the expected return. If the expected return is greater than your hurdle rate, then you can feel free to invest; if not, then you either wait for the price to value relationship to change and look for other opportunities.Analysts expect ADP to show FY 2021, the current year, EPS of $5.00 and FY 2022 EPS of $5.96. They also expect ADP to be able to show 10.6% annual EPS growth over the next five years. I then assumed that ADP would manage 5.0% annual EPS growth for the following five years. Dividends are assumed to target a 60% payout ratio.I like to use history as a guide when determining what multiple future market participants might value ADP's earnings at. As you can see in the following YChart, ADP has typically traded between ~16x and ~30x TTM EPS. For the MARR analysis, I'll examine P/E ratios ranging from 15x to 30x.Data by YChartsThe following table shows the potential internal rates of return that an investment in ADP could produce provided the assumptions laid out above are reasonably close to how the future plays out. Returns include dividends taken in cash and are calculated assuming a purchase price of $149.20, Friday's closing price. Returns are run through the end of calendar year 2025, ""5 Years"", and calendar year 2030, ""10 Years"".Alternatively, I also calculate at what level I could purchase shares in order to generate the returns that I desire from my investments once again provided the assumptions above are reasonable expectations. My typical hurdle rate is a 10% IRR, and for ADP, I'll also examine 9% and 8% hurdle rates.Dividend yield theory is another method of valuing an investment and is built on the idea of mean reversion. This valuation method is best suited for stable businesses. For dividend yield theory, I will use the five-year average dividend yield as a proxy for the fair value of ADP.Image by author; data source Automatic Data Processing Investor Relations and Yahoo FinanceShares of ADP currently offer a 2.44% dividend yield compared to the five-year average of 2.24%.The reverse discounted cash flow analysis is a way to decipher what market participants are expecting out of the business in the future. I use a simplified version of the DCF built on revenue growth, the maximum of the 3-, 5- and 10-year average EBIT margin, a tax rate of 24%, and I vary the EBIT margin from no improvement of the forecast period up to 10% improvement to 22.6% over that time. Future cash flows are discounted at 8% and 10% hurdle rates.For the 8% hurdle rate and 0% EBIT margin improvement scenario, revenue growth needs to be around 4.9% annualized over the forecast period to justify the current share price. Whereas the 8% hurdle rate and 10% EBIT margin improvement scenario requires revenue growth of 4.6% to support the current share price. The required revenue growth rates are 7.9% and 7.4% respectively for the 10% hurdle rate scenarios.ADP appears to be an attractive business with strong cash flow margins and returns on invested capital. The balance sheet is strong with debt not posing any substantial risk at this time. Management has also shown a willingness to return excess cash to shareholders as evidenced by its ever growing dividend payment as well as the share repurchases, reducing the share count 13.2% in total over the last decade.Dividend yield theory suggests a fair value range between $148 and $180. While the MARR analysis with 8% IRRs suggests a fair value between $140 and $166. The MARR analysis with 10% IRRs suggests a fair value between $119 and $141.The reverse discounted cash flow analyses don't throw up any red flags with respect to the current valuation as the required revenue growth appears realistic over time and that 8% to 10% returns should be achievable.A rough calculation for the compounding rate of the business using reinvestment rate and ROIC puts the intrinsic value growing around 6-8% per year.At the end of FY 2020 ADP has 860,000+ clients compared to 810,000+ at the end of FY 2019. That's just over a 6% increase in the client base during a very difficult period for businesses due to the COVID-19 lockdowns and certainty around how the economy would look once it was re-opened.Future growth is likely to come in the form of both acquisitions and on-boarding new clients and the potential for both is huge. It's estimated that there's greater than 30 M businesses in the United States. With ADP's client base of 880k that's only ~2.9% of the potential enterprises that ADP could provide payroll and HR outsourcing services too.Management expects FY 2021, the current year, to be quite rocky with sales declining 1-4%, 300 basis points of EBIT margin compression and EPS to be down 13-18%. That's not exactly a rosy picture in the near term.Automatic Data Processing Q4 FY 2020 Earnings Call PresentationHowever, if you believe that the economy, both domestically and globally, will rebound within a 3-5 year horizon, then short-term weakness becomes an opportunity for those that can expand their time horizon.I'm a bit skeptical of the optimistic earnings growth forecasts by analysts at this time considering the rough outlook for FY 2021. If we take the earnings growth assumptions down to a flat 5% over the next 10 years, returns are likely to disappoint, but I also wouldn't be too upset with those results.In my opinion, the current price around $149 is attractive enough when looking out three to five years to continue adding to my position through continued dollar cost averaging. Should there be weakness that brings the share price back into the mid-$130s or lower, I would be much more inclined to add shares with bulk purchases."
4333392,95006,2020-03-21T07:45:44-04:00,"In April 2019, I warned investors about ADP's high valuation and suggested a rotational strategy so that they could avoid a big drawdown.Part of that strategy suggested rotating back into ADP's stock when it was trading near fair value for investors bullish on the company long term.In this article, I review the strategy and check to see if ADP's stock is trading near fair value, and I'll also share my potential buy price for the stock.","For the past two years, I have been warning investors about the dangers of overvalued, high-quality stocks and sharing a long-only rotational strategy to help mitigate the dangers of these highly-priced stocks. The basic idea is that when the expected 10-year forward returns of the target stocks (in this case Automatic Data Processing (ADP)) get low enough, one rotates out of the stock and into a pair of ETFs with the goal that the ETFs will be more defensive during a downturn. Then, when the price of the target stock falls more than the defensive ETFs, the investor who likes the target company can rotate back in and own more shares than they would have had if they just held the stock the entire time.In my April 25th, 2019 article, ""Automatic Data Processing: A 10-Year, Full-Cycle Analysis"", I made the case that ADP was a Sell. At the time, my two standard alternative ""default ETFs"" were the Invesco S&P 500 Low Volatility ETF (SPLV) and Invesco Mid-Cap Low Volatility ETF (XMLV). I tracked the results of my strategy (along with what would eventually become 42 other stocks I suggested selling due to high valuation this past year). The goal was to rotate half the funds back into ADP once one could achieve a 20-25% ""free share gain"" and to rotate the other half of the funds back in once the stock was trading at fair value again. (For me, fair value, in this case, was an expected 10-year CAGR of 8%).In this article, I'm going to examine whether it is time for investors who were bullish on ADP's long-term prospects who rotated out of ADP back in April, to now rotate back in.SourceNormally, this is a fairly simple process of checking the results of the default ETF versus the target stock, but we had a rare event take place at the end of February where it became clear we were headed for a recession. When that happens, we move all of our ""default ETF money"" into cash. I meticulously documented that in my last update article, ""Going To Cash: Rotational Strategy Update (February 2020)"". The way I'm tracking the results now that the default money has been moved to cash is to calculate the returns on a theoretical $10,000 up to the point it was moved to cash, and then to compare that cash amount (which does not grow when it is held in cash) to the theoretical growth of $10,000 kept in the target stock.In this case, when the money from SPLV and XMLV was moved to cash, it would have been worth $10,046 so it would have essentially been flat over the holding period. But the primary goal of this strategy was to increase our shares in ADP for free, so let's see what ADP would have returned.Data by YChartsData by YChartsADP's stock has fallen about -24% since my warning article and a $10,000 investment would now be worth $7,623. The money that was first put in SPLV and XMLV, then into cash, would now be worth $10,046. An investor who followed this strategy could now take that $10,046 and buy +31.78% more ADP stock than they owned back in April. In other words, an investor who owned 100 shares of ADP's stock on April 25th, 2019, could now buy 131 shares of the stock without spending any more money. This is above our 20-25% ""free share gain"" goal for the first part of the strategy, and so this part of the rotation is now complete.ADP now joins ten previous ""free share gain"" winners in the series so far.The first part of the approach was to rotate back in after a 20-25% ""free share gain"" was possible. The second half of the money is to be rotated back in when the forward 10-year full-cycle CAGR estimate is near fair value at about 8%. So, next, I'm going to run what I call a ""Full Cycle Analysis"", which is the same analysis I performed back in April that identified ADP's stock as being overvalued enough to sell. As part of the analysis, I calculate what I consider to be the two main drivers of future total returns: Market Sentiment returns and Business returns.In order to estimate what sort of returns we might expect over the next 10 years, let's begin by examining what return we could expect 10 years from now if the P/E multiple were to revert to its mean from the previous economic cycle. I start the previous cycle around 2007, about a year before the last recession.As I write this, ADP's forward PE is 18.99 while its normal P/E this past cycle has been 23.70. If, over the course of the next 10 years, ADP's P/E were to revert to its normal 23.70 level and everything else was held equal, it would produce a 10-year CAGR of about +2.24%. (At the time of my original analysis, this return was expected to be -3.26%.)We previously examined what would happen if market sentiment reverted to the mean. This is entirely determined by the mood of the market and is quite often disconnected, or only loosely connected, to the performance of the actual business. In this section, we will examine the actual earnings of the business. The goal here is simple: We want to know how much money we would earn (expressed in the form of a CAGR %) over the course of 10 years if we bought the business at today's prices and kept all of the earnings for ourselves.There are two main components of this: the first is the earnings yield, and the second is the rate at which the earnings can be expected to grow. Let's start with the earnings yield.Data by YChartsADP's forward earnings yield is currently +5.16%. The way I like to think about this is, if I bought the company's whole business for $100, I would earn $5.16 per year on my investment if earnings remained the same for the next 10 years.The next step is to estimate its earnings growth during this time period. I do that by figuring out at what rate earnings grew during the last cycle and applying that rate to the next 10 years. This involves calculating the EPS growth rate since 2007, taking into account each year's EPS growth or decline, and then backing out any share buybacks that occurred over that time period (because reducing shares will increase the EPS due to fewer shares).Let's start by looking at how much shares were reduced since 2007.Data by YChartsADP has reduced its shares outstanding by about -21% over the course of this cycle. I'll back these out for earnings growth estimates. When I go back to 2007 through today, I get a cyclically adjusted earnings growth rate of +9.46%, which is a very solid growth rate. (I also like how they had pretty steady buybacks even during the financial crisis while many other businesses stopped for one or two years during that time.)Next, I'll apply that growth rate to current earnings looking forward 10 years in order to get a final 10-year CAGR estimate. The way I think about this is, if I bought ADP's whole business for $100, it would pay me back $5.16 the first year, and that amount would grow at +9.46% per year for 10 years. I want to know how much money I would have in total at the end of 10 years on my $100 investment, which I calculate to be about $189.51. When I plug that growth into a CAGR calculator, that translates to a +6.60% 10-year CAGR estimate for the expected earnings returns.Potential future returns can come from two main places: market sentiment returns or earnings returns. If we assume that market sentiment reverts to the mean from the last cycle over the next 10 years, it will produce a +2.24% CAGR. If the earnings yield and growth are similar to the last cycle, the company should produce somewhere around a +6.60% 10-year CAGR. If we put the two together, we get an expected 10-year, full-cycle CAGR of +8.84%. Since this expected forward 10-year return is above 8%, ADP is now trading near what I consider ""fair value"", and for the purposes of this demonstration of the rotational strategy, an investor could now rotate the second half of the money back into ADP. Next, let's see how the ""fair value"" portion of the rotational strategy performed.Sometimes, the ""free share gain"" portion of the rotation and the ""fair value"" portion of the rotation meet their goals at different times, and so the returns are different. In this case, the stock price has moved so fast, they met their goals at the same time, thus producing identical gains for both parts of the rotation at +31.78%.ADP will now join eight previous rotational ""fair value"" winners.And now, this completes the demonstration of the rotational strategy with ADP. The first half of the rotation gained about 31% more free shares, and the second half also gained about 31% more free shares. I have 34 additional high-quality stocks I'm still tracking, though, so we should have a fairly large sample from which to judge and analyze the strategy in the future.My basic threshold for buying a stock with a margin of safety and good forward returns is for the 10-Year Full-Cycle CAGR to be greater than 12%. But since we are going into a recession, I have a slightly stricter standard that I apply. First, I want the business's 3-year revenues to have at least appreciated by 10%. So let's check that first.Data by YChartsRevenue looks fine. The next thing I want is for the business earnings portion of the CAGR to be at least 9%, and I also want the PE to be at least within 20% of the PE during the trough of the last recession. These let me know that I'm not relying too much on future market sentiment changes for all of my potential returns, and it tries to get us at least somewhat close to the bottom in terms of PE. (The earnings of these companies will certainly drop over the course of the next year, so using the PE is really just a way to avoid buying way too early if the market has a history of sending the stock really low during recessions. It's not particularly good at picking exact bottoms.)The price at which ADP will meet all these criteria based on current forward earnings is about $77.00, and that's the price I would, as a value investor, be a buyer of the stock. This isn't a 'target price', as much as it is a price that I think has a greater than 50% chance of occurring during this downcycle.So far, during this downcycle, I have purchased 23 stocks using this method, so plenty of the prices are hitting right now, but there is never any guarantee that all the stocks I'm watching will hit. I'm always trying to strike a balance between the likelihood of getting a lower price, and the likelihood of the price never dropping that far, so the price above is my best attempt to find a good balance."

Automatic Data Processing is one of the largest human resources products and services companies in the world. ADP is a conservative investment for the income investor who also wants good growth potential with the growing world economies and population. Automatic Data Processing has good cash flow, and the company uses some of the cash to expand its product line. The remainder of the cash is used to increase dividends each year, raising the stock price. Automatic Data Processing is 6.8% of The Good Business Portfolio, being my IRA portfolio of good business companies that are balanced among all styles of investing.I use a set of guidelines that I codified over the last few years to review the companies in The Good Business Portfolio (my portfolio) and other companies that I am reviewing. For a complete set of guidelines, please see my article ""The Good Business Portfolio: Update to Guidelines, August 2018"". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return, and growing companies that hopefully keeps me ahead of the Dow average.When I scanned the five-year chart, Automatic Data Processing has a great chart going up and to the right for 2016- 2020 YTD in a strong solid pattern with 2015 being flat.Data by YChartsAutomatic Data Processing is reviewed in the following topics below.I use total return as my starting point in looking at a company’s business. The total return must be greater than the Dow's total return over my test period. Automatic Data Processing beats against the Dow baseline in my 49-month test compared to the Dow average. I chose the 49 month test period (starting January 1, 2016, and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2017 and 2019, and other years that had a fair or bad performance. The great Automatic Data Processing total return of 147.07% compared to the Dow base of 62.17% makes Automatic Data Processing a good investment for the total return investor that also wants some increasing income. Looking back five years, $10,000 invested five years ago would now be worth over $23,200 today. This gain makes Automatic Data Processing’s a great investment for the total return investor looking back, which has future growth as the United States and worldwide economy continues to grow.Dow's 49 Month total return baseline is 62.17%Automatic Data Processing does meet my dividend guideline of having dividends increase for 8 of the last ten years and having a minimum of 1% yield. Automatic Data Processing has an average dividend yield of 2.0% and has had increases for 45 years, making Automatic Data Processing a good choice for the dividend growth investor. The dividend was last increased in November 2019 for an increase from $0.79/Qtr to $0.91/Qtr or a 15% increase. The five-year average payout ratio is moderate, at 59%. After paying the dividend, this leaves cash remaining for increasing the business of the company by expanding its product line and increasing foreign sales, all of which raise the earnings and value to the shareholder.I only like large-capitalization companies and want the capitalization to be at least greater than $10 billion. Automatic Data Processing easily passes my rule. Automatic Data Processing is a large-cap company with a capitalization of $76 billion. Automatic Data Processing’s 2020 projected operating cash flow at $2.8 billion is great, allowing the company to have the means for company growth and increasing dividends each year. Large-cap companies like Automatic Data Processing have the cash and ability to buy other smaller companies and weather any storms that might come along.Automatic Data Processing’s S&P CFRA rating is three stars or hold with a recently increased target price to $176. Automatic Data Processing’s price is above the target by 1.7%. Automatic Data Processing is above the target price at present and has a high forward PE of 28, making Automatic Data Processing a hold at this entry point for the dividend income and total return investor. I rate Automatic Data Processing a nibble (start a small buy) for future growth and a good growing income, quality does not come cheap. The cash flow drives ADP stock price up, and the company returns the cash to the shareholder with increasing dividends each year.I look for the earnings of my positions too consistently beat their quarterly estimates. For the last quarter on January 29, 2020, Automatic Data Processing reported earnings that beat expected at $1.52 by $0.08, compared to last year at $1.34. Total revenue was higher at $3.67 billion more than a year ago by 5.2% year over year and missed expected total revenue by $20 million. This was a great report with a bottom-line beating expected, and the top line increasing and a bottom-line increase compared to last year. The next earnings report will be out late April 2020 and is expected to be $1.93 compared to last year at $1.73 a good increase. The graphic below shows a comparison of earnings between FY2019 and FY2020. Source: Earnings call slidesOne of my guidelines is would I buy the whole company if I could. The answer is yes. The total return is great, and the increasing dividend for 45 years makes a good combination of growth and income. The Good Business Portfolio likes to embrace all kinds of investment styles but concentrates on buying businesses that can be understood, makes a fair profit, invests profits back into the business, and also generates a fair income stream. Most of all, what makes ADP interesting is the long-term growth of the world economy, giving you an increasing growth in the human resources sector.Automatic Data Processing is the largest provider of human resources data processing in the United States and foreign countries.As per data from ReutersOverall Automatic Data Processing is a good business with 12% CAGR projected growth as the United States and foreign economies grow going forward, with the increasing demand for ADP's services. The good dividend income brings you cash as I continue to see further growth as the world economy grows. As interest rates decrease, so will ADP's earnings on the payroll float, but this decrease is easily overtaken by the gain from product innovation sales increases.The paraphrase below from the 2nd quarters earns call. ADP is pleased with its worldwide bookings growth together with its improvements in Employer Services revenue retention and how they demonstrate the strength and stability of their business even as they have been going through a meaningful transformation as an organization with their Workforce Optimization and Procurement initiatives. The quarterly average consolidated revenue grew 6% reported, and organic constant currency over the past 18 months. Total revenue is tracking at 6% average growth through six quarters. They have a solid playbook with a proven track record of driving sustained growth and will continue to focus on delivering consistent strong bookings growth and retention performance as key priorities.The graphic below shows the guidance outlook for 2020.Source: Earnings call slidesThis shows the feelings of top management for the continued growth of the Automatic Data Processing business and shareholder return. ADP has good growth and will continue as the world's employment budgets grow with the world economy.Automatic Data Processing is a good investment choice for the total return and dividend growth investor with its average dividend yield and high total return. Automatic Data Processing is 6.8% of The Good Business Portfolio and will be held and watch it grow. ADP will be held in the portfolio and will be trimmed when it reaches 8% of the portfolio. I buy what I consider great businesses that are fairly priced, but value investors will want to wait for a better entry point if it ever happens. Good growing businesses do not come cheap, but over time, they grow and grow. If you want a solid growing dividend income and good total return in the human resources data processing business, ADP may be the right investment for you.The five companies comprising the largest percentage of the portfolio are Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) at 8.1% of the portfolio, the Eaton Vance Enhanced Equity Income Fund II (EOS) at 8.1% of the portfolio, Home Depot (HD) at 9.1% of the portfolio, Omega Health Investors (OHI) at 9.2% of the portfolio, and Boeing (BA) at 11.2% of the portfolio. Therefore, BA, EOS, JNJ, OHI, and HD are now in trim or close to trim position, but I am letting them run a bit since they are great companies.Boeing is going to be pressed to 15% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on 787 deferred plane costs at $1.3 billion in the third quarter of 2019, an increase from the second quarter. Boeing has dropped in the last nine months because of the second 737 Max crash, and I look at this as an opportunity to buy BA at a reasonable price. From the latest news on Boeing is a rumor that Warren Buffett is taking a position on BA, maybe he knows a good investment. It now looks like the 737 Max will not be approved until mid-year, but the FAA has said it could be earlier because Boeing is making good progress, all will depend on the first test flight with the FAA.JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because of its defensive nature in this post-BREXIT world. Earnings in the last quarter beat on the top and bottom line, and Mr. Market did nothing. JNJ in April 2019 increased the dividend to $0.95/Qtr., which is 57 years in a row of increases. JNJ is not a trading stock but a hold forever; it is now a strong buy as the healthcare sector remains under pressure.The total return for the Good Business Portfolio is ahead of the Dow average from 1/1/2020 to date by 0.7%, which is a nice gain above the market for the portfolio with BA a strong drag. Each quarter after the earnings season, I write an article giving a complete portfolio list and performance, the latest article is titled “The Good Business Portfolio: 2019 3rd Quarter Earnings and Performance Review”. Become a real-time follower, and you will get each quarter's performance after the next earnings season is over in a few weeks."
4337711,24643,2020-04-15T10:27:42-04:00,There are estimates - reasonable ones too - that the U.S. unemployment rate could rise into the 30 to 40% range in these next few months.This will obviously hurt payroll processors like ADP - there's no revenue from not processing payrolls after all.My assumption that the recession will be short holds - ADP will ride it out.,"We all know we're in a recession. It's going to be a deep one, too. My working assumption is that it's going to be a short one, and most economists are making that same pair of assumptions.However, between here and a return to something like normal, there is that recession to get through first. An important thing to think about during it being, well, how many unemployed are we going to get?There are reasonable estimates that it could rise all the way to 40% of the workforce. The contention here is that this is going to impact upon the payroll processing companies for fairly obvious reasons.(Automatic Data Processing stock price from Seeking Alpha)As we can see, the stock price dropped along with the market and then rose again, as did the market more generally. I think this is a gross underestimate of the short-term effect upon the company. In the medium term, I think the company's going to be just fine as the economy recovers.This gives us a little difficulty in predicting the stock price as that will depend on our evaluations of how other people think about that short and medium term. My reading of this, my opinion, is that, if the market generally takes too much note of any recession-induced drop-off, then that will be a good time to buy into the stock as the company will recover.We've all seen the initial unemployment claims for the past few weeks. 3 million, 6 million, and then, another 6 million on top.(Initial unemployment claims from FRED)We'd like the shape of that chart if it was the stock price of something we're long of. Of unemployment, not so much. For that's 10% of the working population or so laid off in just three weeks.The question is, how much worse is it going to get?I think we're probably through that 10% already, given that the US workforce is some 160 million people or so.We should note, though, that this estimation is ""from the Fed"". It's different groups of economists within the Fed playing with spreadsheets. That's why we've such a range, because it's obviously possible to make many different assumptions here.But even though these are assumptions and all that, we should also note that our starting point, our lowest estimate here, is already at the unemployment rate last time around, in 2008/09. What we're pondering is how much worse than that will it get?That 10% unemployment rate back then didn't seem to harm ADP much, as we can eyeball here. Yes, there was a fall in the stock price, but it was less than the market as a whole at the time. And once the crisis was over, the firm carried on growing very nicely.But this time is different. At least in this short term, it's useful for us to assume that it is. At which point, we've got to recall what it is that ADP actually does. They process payrolls. And, if vast swathes of the workforce are out of work, there'll be rather fewer payrolls to process.It's possible to muse on things like the float, the money held until it's time to pay the IRS, but given low interest rates in recent years, that's not of any great importance anymore. Whatever interest might have been earnt on that float is immaterial now, given those low rates. So, a reduction in the amount of the float that some pittance is made upon just doesn't matter.The big thing is going to be that, if some vast swathe of the population is out of work, then there's simply less for a payroll processing company to do. This would be bad for the ADP numbers, obviously and clearly.We've not got any worries about ADP being able to survive the coming disruption, the Q2 accounts show that it has plenty of liquidity. The Q3 accounts due on April 29, well, they'll only cover the period to March 31. That's just as the tsunami of job losses was breaking on the economic shores. There's not going to be too much direct information in those accounts, therefore.What will matter is, thus, the guidance that is given at that time on the current quarter as they release those results. It's not a huge leap nor difficult intuition to think that they'll be reporting that business has fallen off a cliff. That would, normally, be bad for a stock price.However, a disruption is one thing, what matters is how long it lasts. As up at the top and as is my general assumption, this cut off of the economy is going to last a couple of months at most. Simply on the grounds that no politician is going to impose lockdown for any longer than that.We might thus see pressure on the ADP stock price as that trading update is delivered - I'm pretty sure they're going to have to do one with Q3 results. But that pressure will, in my opinion, likely be overdone.I thus suggest monitoring this situation and seeing what happens at those Q3 results. Any significant fall in the stock price is to be treated as a buying opportunity.For I don't see any reason why people are going to stop using payroll companies (or as ADP themselves describe their activities, ""human capital management""), indeed, I expect usage to continue to grow as I don't expect the bureaucratic nonsense surrounding hiring people to decrease. A dip as a result of the coronavirus recession is thus a buying opportunity.Clearly, if unemployment goes up to that 30% or 40%, then the business of processing payrolls is going to take a hit. However, the underlying advantage of the use of an outside contractor isn't going to go away. Further, I expect the economy to come roaring back as the restrictions are lifted. Thus, any downturn is, for ADP, going to be a temporary thing.It's likely - not certain by any means but somewhere between possible and likely - that the stock price of ADP is going to take a beating as people think about the implications of mass unemployment on a payroll processor. Given what I take is going to be the short-term nature of the unemployment, such price pressure would be a good opportunity to buy into ADP.The advice is thus buy on any significant dips."
4336986,105417,2020-04-10T12:19:45-04:00,"Despite reducing our EPS estimates and the multiple, we still see ADP as a BUY with $170 target price.Capital return story remains a success, with a solid share repurchase authorization and ~2.7% dividend yield.We expect more market share gains against Paychex in 2021-22.","Our last update on ADP was on November 14 (See Article), when we reaffirmed our Buy rating, raised EPS estimates and raised the target price. In this note, we are still reaffirming our Buy rating, but taking down our EPS and target price, fairly similarly to what we did with Paychex (PAYX) in our April 3 note (See Article). The two payroll processing companies have their company-specific differences, but the negative impact they are about to feel from coronavirus implications, and, more importantly, the offsetting positive effects have been fairly similar.Founded in 1949, Automatic Data Processing (ADP) is a provider of cloud-based human capital management services to employers, serving more than 760,000 clients worldwide. The company focuses on growth of a complete suite of cloud-based HCM solutions and HR Outsourcing solutions; it also leverages global presence to offer clients HCM solutions wherever their employment needs exist. To date, ADP remains a go-to marketplace for companies large and small, as well as the source of employment-related data for the US government.Longer term, we continue to anticipate meaningful revenue growth and margin expansion from the ADP platform, as aggressive growth in new clients will remain at the very least flat in 2020, according to our estimates, but should make up for that flatness in 2021 and beyond. However, we need to recognize that for now our valuation should reflect the realities of 2020: therefore, we are reducing our EPS from $6.47 to $5.98, while taking down our multiple from ~32x to ~28x, in line with the market multiple reduction. When we apply the multiple of ~28x to the 2020 EPS estimate of $5.98, we get the new target price of $170 (down from $207). As soon as the coronavirus noise clears and we have evidence of improvement in the payroll processing space, and ADP in particular, we will be happy to revisit our target price.Capital return story remains a success! In our view, capital return will remain an important light at the end of the tunnel not only for payroll processing names, but for the payments industry as a whole. First of all, we expect the $5 billion of share buyback authorization to remain in place, with the company potentially taking advantage of the recent fall of the stock price. Further, we do not see ADP accepting any bailout funds from the $2 trillion stimulus bill that was recently passed; hence, there should not be political pressures to suspend the buybacks. Furthermore, the dividend remains solid, with the yield around 2.7%. With such a solid dual capital return story support, we believe that demand among investors, particularly on the institutional side, shall remain strong. Market share gains expected in 2021-22: While we have seen evidence of market share gains against Paychex (some investors see the two payroll processors as essentially a duopoly, though we do not subscribe to such assessment), we believe that the coming months of 2020 will be too chaotic to prognosticate any such gains. In our view, when the dust settles, we could see the old pattern reemerging and ADP potentially attracting mid-tier clients from its top competitor via lower pricing. This development, however, is not likely before 2021-22.Expect growth in new clients at around 8%: We still expect growth in new clients around 8% in 2020, primarily because new accounts have a strong lagging effect and are not tied to any particular quarter. Most accounts that should come on the books trace their origin from the second or third quarter of 2019. Technological and cybersecurity improvements likely: We increasingly believe that ADP will begin investing in long overdue tech improvements, which also protect the company against one of its key business risks (see below). In the past, we estimated that ADP needs to invest as much $70 MM annually into tech improvements and we believed that at least $50 MM of such spending shall commence in the new year, i.e. 2020. However, we now expect the company to postpone nonessential activities until the following year: therefore, we are now modeling only $10 MM of tech spend for the year (accomplished during the first quarter) and thus we are cushioning the EPS blow by saving as much 8 cents. Expect Revenue Growth Acceleration in 2021: This bullet does not change much from our previous note: just like we modeled earlier 50 bps of revenue growth acceleration in 2021 (note: not in 2020!), driven by incremental clients, similarly we are leaving it intact today. Alas, we no longer expect any upside to this number in 2021, but potentially in 2022.We see the following risks as potentially negatively impacting ADP’s bottom line:"
4306650,105417,2019-11-14T11:36:57-05:00,ADP announced a $5 billion in new share repurchase authorization.Heavier usage of share repurchases may signal that the company will be less aggressive with dividend raises.We are increasing our 2020 EPS estimates and raising the target price from $198 to $207.,"Founded in 1949, Automatic Data Processing (ADP) is a provider of cloud-based human capital management services to employers, serving more than 760,000 clients worldwide. The company positions its own business strategy as focused on three core pillars: 1) growth of a complete suite of cloud-based HCM solutions; 2) growth and scalability of HR Outsourcing solutions; and 3) leveraging of global presence to offer clients HCM solutions wherever their employment needs exist. To date, ADP remains a go-to marketplace for companies large and small, as well as the source of employment-related data for the US government.We anticipate meaningful revenue growth and margin expansion, driven by aggressive growth in new clients. This in itself should translate into a 32x P/E multiple on 2020 earnings, which is approximately 4x-5x above sub-industry average. When we apply this multiple to our 2020 EPS estimate of $6.47 (up from $6.21), it translates into our target price of $207, up from $198.Company Announces New Buyback Authorization: On November 12, the company announced $5 billion in a new buyback authorization, positioning itself for several more years of generous buybacks, which, we estimate, should translate into about 2.5%-2.7% annual capital return. The renewed authorization itself did not come as a surprise, since replacement of the previous authorization from 2015 has been long overdue. At the same time, the $5 billion number came about $1 billion above the analyst expectations. On our end, we did not predict a specific figure, since it's usually a shot in the dark, though it is indeed reassuring to see above-consensus buyback program.It's Not Only the Dividend Story! ADP and Paychex have been historically grouped in the same bucket not only as human capital management companies, but also as two high-dividend players. ADP's current dividend yield is about 2%, while Paychex's is ~3%. We believe that an increase in share repurchase authorization will keep ADP within its 2% band, without having to compete with Paychex and thus having to aggressively raise a dividend. This is also more prudent from a taxation standpoint. Recall the criticism both stocks received from industry experts is that often times their solid, consistent dividend payout made them appear as stocks with a bond profile. Such criticism signaled that the companies were trying to offset the bleakness of the revenue growth profile with an attractive dividend.Market share gains against Paychex: in recent quarters, we’ve been seeing some market share loss from Paychex to ADP Data Processing, mainly around mid-tier clients. The key driver of this market share shift is unknown to us, though most industry checks point to more attractive pricing.Transformation Efficiencies on Track: We anticipate at least $200 MM in cost efficiency savings over time, which should translate into annual 3% EPS growth in 2020-22. This is not a huge impact, but it is a symbolic indicator that the company is adequately managing its bottom line. In addition, increased buybacks should further boost the EPS in the outer years. Per our valuation (above), we are raising our 2020 target by as much as 26 cents, which translates into a $9 increase in target price.Expect Revenue Growth Acceleration in 2021: But it's not all about buybacks. Our 2021 model now incorporates about 50 bps of revenue growth acceleration, driven by incremental clients. We will continue to assess these new clients and may revise our 2021 acceleration estimate upward to as much as 120 bps in the coming months.We see the following risks as potentially negatively impacting ADP’s bottom line:"
4374034,105093,2020-09-14T05:59:03-04:00,"Back in March, I bought a small stake in Automatic Data processing with the intention of growing the position to a sizeable stake in my portfolio.Unfortunately (for me), the share price quickly appreciated to its relative premium, and currently trades at what could be considered a premium despite historical share price discounts.The company's growth prospects are, for the moment, somewhat muted, and a weighted average multiple of 23X is demanded for the company's earnings.This is too much - and I consider ADP to be a ""HOLD"" for the time being.","Automatic Data Processing (ADP) is a ""premium"" company. What I mean by this is that its valuation typically trends to follow at least several numbers of multiples above what I would typically consider ""fair value"". Reviewing such a company is tricky because its continued success and positive returns hinge very much on a continued trend of the company's premium - which is typically based on some sort of outperformance, dividend growth, or a mix of variables.Nonetheless, I bought ADP at north of $103/share and consider it well-bought. Let me show you why I bought it, and why I'd buy more as well as at what price.Automatic Data Processing is one of the largest HCM and HRO-oriented companies in the entire world. Its field is Human resources, and it provides customers with payroll services, human capital management, Talent, time management, benefits, and other HR-related services for both the extremely small as well as the global corporations.(Source: ADP Innovation Day 2020)The company was founded back in 1949 to enable customers to focus on their core business activities, by, as has become standard, freeing up from non-core tasks such as payroll and HR management services. Today, as of FY19, the company serves 860 000 clients in 140 countries.(Source: ADP 10-K)So, the company in essence does two things. It provides products and services that help to manage employees, and it also provides complete outsourcing for these services where ADP offers complete management solutions, including liability management, and so forth. These are HCM and HRO, respectively, and the company is actively trying to leverage its massive market size to become even larger.The company's services are split into two reportable segments. Employer Services offer clients ranging from single-employee businesses with corporations holding tens of thousands of employees with solutions including strategic, cloud-based platforms managing the areas of payroll, benefits, talent management, HR, Workforce, Compliance, Insurance, and retirement.Professional Employer Organization, known also as ADP TotalSource, provides the mentioned outsourcing of administration and employment, where ADP actually takes over as co-employers and employees are known as ""worksite employees"".The company, through its extensive solutions with its premier HCM suite, manages payroll services for about 1 out of every 6 workers in the US - or about 22 million workers. The solutions in this software suite are extensive and include almost everything an employer might need, including even compliance solutions for tax purposes, where the company delivered more than 69 million employee year-end tax statements and moved more than $2.2 trillion in client funds to tax agencies and other payees. The company also files tax returns.The secondary solution, mentioned as ADP TotalSource, is different, as it offers a co-employment model. ADP here assumes employer responsibilities, including payroll, tax, and other things, while the business retains management responsibilities and the like - again, enabling the company's clients to focus on running the business, as opposed to running payroll/HR. The company as of FY19 serves 13,000 clients in the US alone with its TotalSource solution, managing 530,000 worksite employees. TotalSource is the largest professional employer organization (""PEO"") certified by the IRS in all of the USA.To this, the company also adds global solution services that contain multi-country and in-country solutions that are scalable to any client size. With multi-national payroll and HR scenarios in such companies, ADP uses its expertise to assist clients to comply with a multitude of legal HR frameworks and seeks to make it possible to work not in one or five countries - but in over a hundred.So, what does ADP do? ADP is a full-service provider of anything having to do with HR - regardless of size, scenario or geography, ADP seeks to be able to fulfill client needs. Competition does of course exist, and it exists everywhere. The competition takes many different forms. In Sweden, for instance, competition for this sort of thing is woven into accounting suites, such as Visma, where clients use Visma's products to handle day-to-day accounting and bookkeeping and also getting the company's HRO/HR management tools and payroll. I myself, in handling my companies, use these products to do both, and I know from experience that it's not a question of size, with everything from single-employee companies to tens of thousands using similar products. On an international basis, ADP's peers are companies like SAP (SAP), Workday (WDAY), Ultimate Software, Paychex (PAYX), Epicor, and so on. In terms of absolute size when looking at Revenue, SAP is more than twice the size of ADP. In short, ADP works in a field where constant innovation and keeping on top of the competition isn't an option, but a necessity and even a large market share isn't a guarantee of success.ADP is a highly acquisitive business. While organic growth does contribute significantly, the company also is an active M&A'er, with several over the past few years alone to broaden its scope.(Source: ADP Innovation Day 2020)The company has already, long ago, taken the step that's been hard to take for nationally-oriented providers such as Visma - that step is to globalize the company's operations. This, of course, gives them a distinct advantage which differentiates them from large parts of the competition.(Source: ADP Innovation Day 2020)The company's mobile services and apps are well-received and well used, with excellent scores and over 90M monthly logins for the company's MyADP app. I personally did a bit of a deep-dive on the program to see what it looked like and how it worked, and it seems to offer very similar - though more expansive - services to my own HCM app and software suite, albeit on an international level. I don't have a need for things like benefits enrollment where I live/operate, but the software suites seemed, on a purely subjective level, extremely easy to use and well put-together.What interested me when I began looking at the company over a year ago was the split between bookkeeping/accounting and HR/HRM solutions. This is a completely natural fit here in Scandinavia, with virtually every solution provider combining the two - whereas outside of Scandinavia, it does not seem common at all. I'm not speaking to the possibility of exporting data to bookkeeping software suites, I'm talking about the two being part of the same system, always. The company is also employing new thinking modalities such as constructing teams, things we've seen in newer providers such as Slack (NYSE:WORK), incident response platforms, and many more innovations aimed either at a specific type of client or a specific field. Here, of course, I can see the advantage of differentiating HR more from bookkeeping, as the software suites here don't offer even close to the same flexibility in things HR.So, what are we looking at here? We're looking at one of the world's largest payroll and HRM/HRO companies. They offer services aimed at catering to every possible HR need, irrespective of client geography, scale or segment. The fact that they've been doing it for over 70 years shows reliance, and the company is as quality as quality gets in the field - at least seen from the surface of things.Let's look at the results.We need no crystal ball to know what trends will impact payroll/HR companies during a time of unprecedented global deployment decline. It would be surprising to see anything close to positive, and indeed, we're not. The company saw revenue and EBIT declines, with the company's much-lauded EPS growth being flat.(Source: 4Q20 Results, ADP)These results were driven primarily by the Employer Services segment, with significant COVID-19 headwinds. The company calls overall performance better than expected with numbers gradually improving, but new business bookings are down 67% YOY, including the backlog, with the continued strong FX from the USD impacting company operations as well. Fund balances are down, client fund yields are down, and only expense reduction across its entire portfolio of businesses saved ES margins from dropping.In the company's PEO services segment, revenues were actually up due to strong retention, but margin declines at a very significant level (down 450 bps to 10.9%) due to expenses impacted things heavily. The company doesn't exactly see things improving going into FY21 either. Pays per control are expected to be negative through 3Q21, but turn positive in 4Q21, then average for FY21. ADP sees further balance declines in client funds and interests, with a 50 bps drop in average yield. The overall outlook more or less says it all - things aren't going to improve quickly.(Source: 4Q20 Results, ADP)But it's not all bad, that's for sure. The company's revenues and adjusted EBIT as well as adjusted diluted EPS for the full fiscal of 2020 are all trending positive. (Source: 4Q20 Results, ADP)So should we be immediately worried because of these negative results? No, not really. The thing is, ADP is one of the most conservatively managed companies in the entire segment.Debt? The company has barely any, coming in at 0.22X NTM net debt/EBITDA, and a 0.11X debt/cap rate. The interest coverage is 30.71X. The company is safe here. It's AA rated, one of the very few dividend-paying companies to reach such a level.I recently lauded a company for achieving a 20%+ RoE rate - ADP makes this look small, coming in at a 44% LTM RoE ratio, and 37% RoiC, confirming not only an economic moat but also management's capital allocation skill. The company has operating margins nearly above 23% across the entire business. Make no mistake - this is beyond good - it's excellent by any measure.The one thing that perhaps is trending a bit high is the company's EPS payout ratios. I expected, over a year ago, ADP to have no more than a 20-30% payout ratio, but the fact is that ADP trends towards 60%, and on an NTM basis pays out nearly 73% of EPS to shareholders. Of course, this also comes with a nearly class-leading 45-year dividend streak, making it a dividend king in 2025 - which I have no doubt the company will achieve.My own research puts ADP as ""Class 1"" as Class 1 gets, with its credit rating, safe dividend, and a moat actually considered to be ""wide"". It's better than many IT companies I currently look at, and with a 13% dividend growth rate over the past 5 years, it achieves a chowder number of 15.7X at today's position, dividend growth rate, and price. Its meager yield and what I consider to be not that good valuation prevents it from reaching higher than 2.9/4.3, but very few companies with low yields reach as high as 3+ in my QO-system. What can be said for how the company has been doing is therefore that the company, being an HR and Payroll company at heart, has managed to prevent things from coming tumbling down, and given their business, this is quite ""good enough"". I do not expect things to recover quickly - and nor should you - because it's unlikely that they will. The best thing we can hope for regarding ADP is that the company continues its excellent capital management and carefully returns operations to normal levels in tandem with the economic recovery.I've no doubt they'll do just that - let's look at valuation.Valuation for ADP can be seen in two ways - but it requires a bit of explanation. As I mentioned initially, ADP is a high-market-share, high-moat, high-growth company. This merits a premium as the market sees, and the company has nearly always traded at a premium (with two very specific exceptions over the past 20 years.Furthermore, going into COVID-19, ADP traded at an overvaluation so excessive, I would have considered divesting the entire position and waiting for it to fall back down. ADP is great, but I don't see it being able to keep up the sort of growth warranted for a 30X earnings multiple - as we saw in 2019.(Source: F.A.S.T graphs)So, let's make a few things more clear. ADP doesn't really negatively miss estimates with a 10% margin of error. Not during the past 20 years, at least. While forecasts and expectations shouldn't be taken as gospel in any scenario, ADP seems easy enough to forecast to consider the earnings forecasts at the very least ""indicative"". I make the judgment call to view them this way, based on the historical data and that I've seen no reason in company expectations that the company is either too negative or positive, given the current situation.Having said that and despite the company now trading ""below"" its 15-year average premium, I don't view the company as undervalued when we take the problematic 2021 into account.(Source: F.A.S.T Graphs)If we assume that the 23X earnings multiple premia will be upheld in the long run going into fiscal -23 and -24, then an investment at current expectations would potentially bring no more than 7.7% annually. Now, I know what you may be thinking. This is a great company, and 7-8% from a great company that's safe may be good enough.It may be, but when I invest, I want potential annual returns of at least 9-12% and those calculated at a conservative level. Even if we consider 23X to be fairly conservative for ADP - which I have to tell you, I'm not sure I do, there's a bit too much faith in the company's historicals for me to be comfortable giving the company such a multiple. I began staking out my position in ADP based on a 19.9X earnings multiple back in March. The company was trading at nearly $110/share, and the upside was nearly 14-15% - that's where I am, and my capital appreciation has already rewarded me here. I have no intention of divesting my shares here.But here's the thing. Given the company's own forecasted average earnings growth of ""only"" 4-5% (which for a mature company is still great), I see the market overestimating ADP's value at this time. Given what we're likely to see in fiscal 2021, I think ADP's valuation should be closer to a 20-21X earnings multiple, which based on averaging the coming 3 years EPS forecasts, comes to a 5.85x20/21, or a share price range of $117-122/share.I don't view it as unrealistic that we may see these levels for ADP over the next few months.Critics of this valuation range may view these expectations as excessively conservative given ADP's history and quality - to these I say; You may be underestimating the impact of ADP alternatives in a post-pandemic world where businesses, especially smaller ones, may be looking at free HR management tools to cut costs. They exist, and they're growing.In the end, it's about what I'm willing to pay for ADP.I'm unwilling to pay more than a range of $117-122/share for a share of ADP's business and profits, and this makes ADP 7-11% overvalued at today's numbers.(Source: Unsplash)My stance that ADP is somewhat overvalued should in no way be mistaken for any sort of non-bullish stance. I'm bullish on the company's long-term expectations, and it may indeed turn out that my valuation range is too conservative and the company doesn't reach an appealing valuation that would allow me to go in and purchase further shares.In this case, however, I'll sleep well knowing I've invested in companies that, in my view, have a better potential of providing me with higher returns. The bullish thesis on ADP is that the company won't in fact fall further, even as a result of at least a further negative 3 fiscal quarters in 2021, and we won't see valuations close to the valuation range I've given. If this turns out to be the case, then today's price for the company marks an opportunity to invest in ADP at what could be considered a good price.The bulls would make the argument that based on ADP's market position, share and potential, a 23X multiple shouldn't be adjusted simply because of one negative potential year - and this may be so. Bullish investors on ADP would also tell bears to have more faith in management and their proven, capital allocation skills.In essence, however, as I see the bullish thesis, it boils down to the assumption that today's price isn't overvalued, despite the higher multiple and forecasted issues in fiscal -21.(Source: Unsplash)The bearish thesis is where I lie. The company can't be called excessively overvalued, but the company's valuation indicates that the negative 2021 fiscal won't actually occur. Had this been the case and growth would have been more flat, I wouldn't have had a problem with such a premium - the calculations and forecasting models would have even supported it. At this point, however, I view the company's share price to be unfairly high in the light of the coming troubles in the next year - even if these troubles are likely only temporary.So the slightly bearish, or neutral/bearish thesis I represent calls for ADP to be valued at a level somewhat more ""fair"" in the light of these expectations - at this point, I'd be willing to invest more.ADP is a great company - one of the best, if not the best in its field. I'd rather invest in ADP than in competitor SAP, and with its qualities, history, management, moat, and products and balance sheet, it exemplifies just what a company ""should"" look like when operating in this, or in any field related to this.However, in the end, it all boils down to what I'm willing to pay for company earnings/cash flows. Even when looking at the company's earnings recovered in 2023, I view the current average of these prospects as too unfavorable to purchase any more of the company's stock. It's not much - 7% isn't double-digits, and it's not world-ending, but I look at, and want minimum returns for a reason. If no such returns were available in the broader market, there might be something to investing in ADP here, but the fact is the market offers fundamentally more attractive alternatives - even in the same sector - with higher potential annual returns than ADP.Because of that, ADP is a ""HOLD"" here.Thank you for reading.Due to a 7-11% overvaluation, ADP is a ""HOLD"" at this time, with a price target range of $117-122/share."
4297804,105417,2019-10-22T08:37:07-04:00,We expect 7% Y/Y growth in Employer Services segment and 14%-15% growth in PEO Services segment.Transformation efficiencies remain on track and are expected to benefit the bottom line.Market share gains against Paychex remain noticeable.,"Founded in1949, Automatic Data Processing (ADP) is a provider of cloud-based human capital management services to employers, serving more than 760,000 clients worldwide. The company positions its own business strategy as focused on three core pillars: 1) growth of a complete suite of cloud-based HCM solutions; 2) growth and scalability of HR Outsourcing solutions; and 3) leveraging of global presence to offer clients HCM solutions wherever their employment needs exist. To date, ADP remains a go-to marketplace for companies large and small, as well as the source of employment-related data for the US government.We anticipate meaningful revenue growth and margin expansion, driven by aggressive growth in new clients. This in itself should translate into a 32x P/E multiple on 2020 earnings, which is approximately 4x-5x above sub-industry average. When we apply this multiple to our 2020 EPS estimate of $6.21, it translates into our target price of $198.Key Tailwinds for 2020:See ~7% Y/Y growth for Employer Services segment, driven by new accounts, as well as solid international growth. We note that the company has invested heavily in its own brand over the last two years, which should help this at least 200 bps revenue growth acceleration since 2017.Estimate 14.5%-15% Growth in PEO Services, with the total number of clients finally breaking 13,000 and HR management and administration functions meaningfully expanding, particularly for non-public companies with revenues under $5 MM.Transformation Efficiencies on Track: We anticipate at least $200 MM in cost efficiency savings over time, which should translate into annual 3% EPS growth in 2020-22. This is not a huge impact, but it is a symbolic indicator that the company is adequately managing its bottom line.Attractive dividend growth to continue: With ADP being one of the most generous dividend-generating companies in the S&P 500 index (current yield is 1.93%), we expect annual dividend growth to continue at an annual rate of 6-7%. We note that ADP is locked in a capital return catch-up game with its key competitor, Paychex, whose dividend yield is closer to 3%. The criticism both stocks received from industry experts is that often times their solid, consistent dividend payout made them appear as stocks with a bond profile.Buybacks in lieu of dividends: It is possible that ADP will eventually be opting for more buybacks versus dividends, since such structure more tax advantageous; however, at present, such scenario is not on the horizon, in our opinion.Market share gains against Paychex: in recent quarters, we’ve been seeing some market share loss from Paychex to ADP Data Processing, mainly around mid-tier clients. The key driver of this market share shift is unknown to us, though some industry checks point to more attractive pricing.We see the following risks as potentially negatively impacting ADP’s bottom line:"

After taking a deeper look at Paychex (PAYX) last week, I wanted to peer into the other behemoth of the industry, Automatic Data Processing (ADP).The business was founded in 1949 in an effort to aid business owners and entrepreneurs by letting them focus on the core business instead of relatively mundane, but critical, things such as payroll. Since then, Automatic Data Processing has continued to grow and innovate now serving over 810,000 clients across the globe.My primary investing strategy is dividend growth investing. The idea behind dividend growth investing is to shift your attention away from whatever the stock price is doing and towards the fundamentals of the business and its ability to pay and grow its dividend in the future.Image by author. Data Source: Automatic Data Processing Investor Relations*An interactive version of this data is available here.Automatic Data Processing is a Dividend Champion with 44 consecutive years of dividend growth. That's every year starting in 1976 that ADP has been there. That includes periods of high inflation, numerous geopolitical mix-ups, the tech boom and bust and at least 4 recessions.The 1-, 3-, 5- and 10-year rolling dividend growth rates since 1991 are shown in the following table.Table and calculations by author. Data Source: Automatic Data Processing Investor Relations*Dividends and growth rates are based off calendar year payments.**An interactive chart of the information in the table can be found here.Historically, Automatic Data Processing has been a strong dividend grower. While that isn't a prediction for the future, I do believe that it speaks to the culture of the business and that dividend growth will continue as long as the financials allow it.Of the 28 1-year periods starting in 1992, annual dividend growth has ranged from 3.6% to 33.0% per year. The average comes to 14.2% with a median of 13.9%.Expanding the time frame out the 19 rolling 10-year periods dividend growth is equally impressive. Annualized dividend growth has ranged from 8.8% to 18.1%, with an average of 13.5% and a median of 14.0%.Image by author. Data Source: Automatic Data Processing SEC filingsAutomatic Data Processing's payout ratio has been pretty consistent over the last decade and trending slightly higher. The average payout ratio based on net income for the last 10 years is 58.6%, and for the most recent 5 years it's 61.3%. Based on free cash flow, the average payout ratio is 55.8% and 59.2%, respectively.The basis of successful buy-and-hold investing is to identify high-quality companies that consistently grow their sales as well as their cash flow. Ideally, those businesses will generate high returns on invested capital, while maintaining reasonable amounts of leverage.Image by author. Data Source: Automatic Data Processing SEC filingsADP has shown solid revenue growth, which is the life blood of generating cash flow for the business. The company's revenue grew from $8.93 billion in FY 2010 to $14.18 billion in FY 2019. That's good for 59% growth in total, or ~5.3% per year.Operating income improved from $1.77 billion to $3.02 billion over the same period, which represents 71% total growth, or ~6.1% annualized. Cash flow from operations tracked revenue growth more closely, growing 60% in total, or 5.4% annualized.Free cash flow has been the laggard out of the four metrics, growing from $1.46 billion to $2.12 billion, which is 46% total growth, or 4.3% annualized.Image by author. Data Source: Automatic Data Processing SEC filingsSince free cash flow growth was slower than revenue growth, it should come as no surprise that the company's free cash flow margin has shrunk over the last decade.That being said, ADP's free cash flow margin is still strong, with a ten-year average of 14.0% and a 5-year average of 14.1%. Over the last decade, every year has been well above my preference of free cash flow margins >10%, although that is very industry-specific.My profitability metric of choice is the free cash flow return on invested capital, ""FCF ROIC."" FCF ROIC is the annual cash return that the business is generating based on capital invested. Successful long-term investing, a la Buffett, is focused on identifying businesses with the ability to earn high returns on capital as well as re-invest capital at similarly high rates of return. I want to see an FCF ROIC >10%.Image by author. Data Source: Automatic Data Processing SEC filingsAutomatic Data Processing's FCF ROIC has been excellent and routinely in the mid-20%'s area. The high FCF ROIC speaks to the strength of the business model. Over the last decade, FCF ROIC has averaged 25.6%, and over the last 5 years, the average comes to 28.5%.I want the businesses that I invest in to use their cash flow in ways that I believe I would as an owner. That means if there's cash generated by the business, then the first priority is to re-invest in the business to maintain and grow the business. With any remaining cash flow, I would reward fellow owners with dividends and then consider buying back shares, with the caveat that shares represent a good value at the time. Otherwise, excess cash flow would go towards building up the war chest or strategic acquisitions.To understand how Automatic Data Processing uses its free cash flow, I calculate 3 variations of the metric, defined below:High-quality businesses with managements that align with my own capital allocation preferences will show positive FCFaDB more often than not. I'm not worried about any specific year being in the red because opportunities can be fleeting; however, the trend over the longer term is what I focus on. A consistently negative FCFaDB means management is spending more cash than is generated by the business, and that shortfall has to be made up through asset sales, cash on the balance sheet or taking on debt.Image by author. Data Source: Automatic Data Processing SEC filingsAs we saw earlier, Automatic Data Processing has generated positive free cash flow every year over the last decade, as well as being able to grow it more often than not. In total, the company produced $16.16 billion in FCF, which allowed it to pay and grow the dividend to shareholders.Likewise, ADP has maintained a positive FCFaD every year as well. In total, the company paid out $9.02 billion in dividends, putting the cumulative FCFaD at a very healthy $7.14 billion.Unfortunately, Automatic Data Processing has spent a total of $9.45 billion buying back shares, which puts the cumulative FCFaDB at -$2.31 billion.Image by author. Data Source: Automatic Data Processing SEC filingsADP's share count fell from 492 million to 434 million over the last decade due to the share repurchases. In isolation, that's been good for existing shareholders, since it increases their ownership stake. However, just an 11.8% total reduction in the share count, or 1.4% annualized, seems a bit light considering how much cash has been used for buybacks.As I mentioned above, my preference is to see a management team that prioritizes their cash flow towards reinvesting in the business, then paying and growing the dividend, and if there's cash flow remaining, then moving to share repurchases if the value proposition makes sense.The following chart shows the breakdown of cash for shareholders on a percentage basis. I consider cash for the shareholders to be comprised of capital expenditures, free cash flow-funded dividends and buybacks, as well as outside-sourced (debt, cash on the balance sheet or asset sales) dividends and buybacks. In a perfect world, a management team would have plenty of free cash flow to fully support all cash used for shareholders' purposes.As we saw above, ADP had a net negative FCFaDB over the last 10 years, with 6 years in total showing overspending. The bulk of cash returned to shareholders has been from cash generated by the business. However, for FY 2014-FY 2016, extra buybacks accounted for 22-33% of the cash used for shareholders' purposes.Image by author. Data Source: Automatic Data Processing SEC filingsUntil FY 2015, ADP had carried essentially no debt on its books. However, starting in FY 2016, the debt level increased to $2.01 billion. The increase was sizable; however, the balance sheet is still conservatively leveraged, with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of just 27% for FY 2019.Image by author. Data Source: Automatic Data Processing SEC filingsThat being said, the debt that is held on the balance sheet isn't of much concern for the time being. The FCF interest coverage ratio for FY 2019 stood at 16.3x, which is more than adequate. The entire debt load could be paid off using 0.9 years of FY 2019's FCF and 2.4 years of FY 2019's FCFaD.One method that I use to determine whether a stock is trading at an attractive valuation is the minimum acceptable rate of return (""MARR"") analysis. A MARR analysis requires you to estimate the future earnings and dividends that a company will produce, apply a reasonable multiple on those earnings and then determine the expected return. If the expected return is higher than your MARR, with a margin of safety factored in, you can feel free to invest.Analysts expect Automatic Data Processing to report FY 2020 EPS of $6.16 for FY 2020, which ends in June 2020 and FY 2021 EPS of $6.97. They also expect ADP to manage a hefty 16.6% annual earnings growth over the next 5 years. I then assumed that ADP would have 6.0% annual earnings growth over the following 5 years and that they would target a 52.5% payout ratio.Historically, Automatic Data Processing has had a 16x-30x TTM P/E ratio. Currently, its trailing P/E ratio is 30.3x. According to Morningstar, ADP's 5-year average P/E ratio is 28.7x. For the MARR analysis, I'll examine P/E ratios ranging from 15x to 30x.Data by YChartsThe following table shows the potential internal rates of return that an investment in ADP could provide if the assumptions above play out. Returns include dividends taken in cash and are calculated assuming a purchase price near the intra-day price of $158.50 from Wednesday. Returns are run through the end of calendar year 2024 and calendar year 2029.Alternatively, I calculate what price levels would provide the returns that I desire if the assumptions play out as forecast. The target returns that I will use are 10%, my typical minimum investment threshold, 13% and 15%. The 13% is derived from the ~11.4% estimated annualized earnings growth over the next 10 years plus the 1.99% current yield, with the 15% from 25% undervaluation normalizing over the next 10 years, or 2.3% annualized.Another valuation method that I use is dividend yield theory. Dividend yield theory works best for well-established companies that have a history of paying dividends. The idea behind dividend yield theory is that the 5-year average dividend yield is a good proxy for a fair price of the business in question.Image by author. Data Source: Yahoo Finance and Automatic Data Processing Investor Relations*An interactive version of this data is available here.ADP shares currently offer a 1.99% dividend yield compared to the 5-year average yield of 2.22%. Dividend yield theory suggest a fair price of $142 for the shares.Automatic Data Processing is a high-quality business with strong cash flow generation, a culture of paying and growing dividend payouts, and strengthening returns on capital. The value add, especially for small to medium-sized businesses, is that it allows founders and other management to focus on the core strategy of the business instead of devoting brain power to payroll and HR.ADP's size is incredible, with over 810,000 clients across 140 countries. The market is still fragmented between smaller HR/payroll outsourcing firms as well as companies that still have them in-house. Further consolidation of the industry, as well as potential clients looking to streamline the mundane, but necessary, parts of their business, could potentially require ADP as a partner.Dividend yield theory suggests a fair value range between $129 to $158, implying that shares are on the upper end of fair value or slightly overvalued at this time. My fair value range based on the MARR analysis is $133-159.I believe there's a high likelihood of a purchase, even at the currently elevated levels, to still generate adequate returns, should the growth pan out as forecast in this analysis. You could suffer a multiple contraction of nearly 50% and still see upper-single digit annual returns.I initiated a position Wednesday morning at $158.50, when shares dipped down on the market open. It was a small initial purchase made more to keep me engaged and following ADP rather than a real value purchase.I'll be looking to add to my new position on dips into the low $150s and then again if the share price declines into the $140s."

The company, which was founded in 1949, offers payroll services, human resources technology, and professional employer organization services, or PEO, to more than 700,000 medium and large businesses. ADP client base is composed of businesses with at least fifty employees. ADP has a current market capitalization of $70 billion, with annual revenues in excess of $13 billion.Paychex offers computerized payroll accounting, benefits, and human resource services to businesses. Whereas ADP tends to focus on large business, Paychex focuses on small and medium-sized business. The company has more than 600,000 clients that generally employ between 10 and 200 employees. Most of Paychex's clients are located in the U.S., but the company does have operations in certain parts of Europe.Paychex is composed of two segments: Management Solutions, which provides employers with payroll and retirement resources, and PEO and Insurance, which offers outsourced human resource services and insurance. The company has a market capitalization of $29 billion, with annual revenues of $3.4 billion.ADP released financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 on 1/30/2019.Source: Automatic Data Processing's Second Quarter Fiscal 2019 Results Presentation, slide 4.The company's adjusted earnings per share increased 30% from the prior year to $1.34. This was $0.16 above estimates. Revenues grew 8.4% to $3.5 billion and topped estimates by $76 million. Adjusted EBIT improved 26%.Revenues from Employer Services increased 7% organically. This growth came from a combination of new business bookings, higher numbers of employees on clients' payrolls, and higher average client fund balances. New business bookings were up 1%, while pays per control improved 2.3%. Average client funds balance increased 5% to $25.3 billion. Despite a 50 bps headwind from acquisitions, this segment had a 460 bps improvement in EBIT margins.PEO services experienced a 12% increase in revenues. Excluding zero-margin benefit passthroughs, revenues for this segment improved 15%. Average worksite employees paid grew 9% to 545,000 and was the primary contributor to growth in this segment. Margins improved 70 bps.ADP increased its guidance for adjusted earnings per share for a second time in two quarters. The company now expects a midpoint for adjusted earnings per share of $5.35, up from $5.25 previously. This would result in an 18% gain in adjusted earnings per share if the company is able to deliver on this guidance. This would follow a 22% growth in earnings in fiscal 2018.ADP increased its earnings per share at a rate of 6.6% over the last ten years, but we estimate that the company can grow earnings at a rate of at least 8% due to continued gains in its PEO Services segment. If ADP is able to achieve this growth, then the company could earn $7.86 per share in 2024.Paychex released financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 on 3/27/19.Source: Paychex's Third Quarter Fiscal 2019 Results Presentation, slide 9.The company earned $0.89 per share, a 41% increase from the previous year and $0.01 above consensus estimates. Revenue grew 23.5% to $1.07 billion, though this was $3.3 million below expectations. One item investors should be aware of is Paychex's EBITDA margin has decreased 70 bps over the first nine months of the company's fiscal year.Revenues for the Management Solutions segment grew 4% to $802 million. This was primarily due to an increase in the number of clients Paychex serviced during the quarter. This segment benefited from a price increase which allowed higher revenues per check. Revenues from retirement services were higher due to increased asset values.PEO and Insurance services grew 65% to $246 million. Paychex closed on its $1.2 billion purchase of Oasis Outsourcing Acquisition Corp on 12/21/2018. Serving more than 8,400 clients and 1.4 million employees, Oasis was the largest privately-held professional employer organization in the U.S.Paychex was willing to make this the company's largest acquisition in its history because of Oasis's ability to add to revenues. For example, Oasis contributed 48% of the growth to the PEO and Insurance segment during the quarter. Excluding this acquisition, this segment had 17% revenue growth from the previous year. A larger client base as well as an increase in the number of health and benefit applicants also added to growth. Interest on funds held for clients grew 27% to $23 million due to higher average interest rates.Paychex expects to earn $2.85 per share in fiscal 2019, which would be a 16% increase from fiscal 2018. The company expects revenue growth to be in the range of 6% to 7% and the tax rate to be ~24%, much lower than the company's usual mid-30% tax rate prior to tax reform passed in late 2017.We expect that Paychex can grow earnings per share at its decade long historical rate of 3.7% per year over the next five years due to increases in revenue and the impact of acquisitions. If Paychex continues to grow at this rate, the company could earn $3.42 per share in 2024.Both ADP and Paychex have benefited from low unemployment. More employees leads to a need for more payroll and human resource services. Both companies have also produced high levels of growth in earnings per share and at least high single-digit growth in revenue in recent quarters. An increase in average interest rates also benefited the two companies.That being said, we favor ADP's higher historical earnings growth rate. The company should be able to grow earnings at a higher rate than Paychex over the next five years, which is the primary factor in favoring ADP when it comes to recent financial results.ADP has increased its dividend for 44 consecutive years. It has increased its dividend:The company increased its dividend by 14.5% for the payment made 1/1/2019. ADP should pay out $3.16 per share in 2019. With the company expecting to earn $5.35 per share during this time, ADP's payout ratio is 59%. This matches the company's 10-year average payout ratio of 59%. Even better, ADP has an average payout ratio of 62% over the last five years. The stock currently yields 2%, slightly above the average yield of the S&P 500.Many analysts believe that cash flow is a better measurement for dividend safety. Over the past four quarters, ADP has generated $2.8 billion of cash flow from operating activities and spent $168 million on capital expenditures for free cash flow of approximately $2.6 billion. The company distributed $1.16 billion in dividends during the same time period for a free cash flow dividend payout ratio of 45%.ADP's dividend appears well-covered using either earnings or free cash flow, and we see no risk of a dividend cut in the near future.Paychex has increased its dividend for eight consecutive years, though this is too short of a streak to qualify the company from being included in a dividend growth database like the Dividend Achievers. Paychex paused its dividend growth from 2009 to 2011, before restarting its dividend growth in 2012.Paychex has increased its dividend:Paychex increased its dividend by 12% for the payment made on 5/24/2018. The company should pay out $2.24 in 2019. Using the company's earnings per share guidance of $2.85, Paychex has a payout ratio of 79%. This is a very high payout ratio, but below the five and 10-year average payout ratios of 82% and 84%, respectively. Shares offer a yield of 2.8%, which is above the average yield of the S&P 500.A side-by-side comparison of their respective dividend profiles can be seen in the table below:Paychex generated $1.3 billion of cash flow from operating activities and spent $120 million on capital expenditures over the past four quarters of fiscal 2019 for free cash flow of almost $1.2 billion. The company distributed $805 million in dividends during the same time period for a free cash flow dividend payout ratio of 68%.Using earnings per share, Paychex has an elevated payout ratio. The payout ratio declines to a lower level when free cash flow is used.Both companies have plenty to offer dividend growth investors. ADP's more than four decades of dividend growth proves that it has experienced several different economic cycles and managed to increase its payment to shareholders every year. ADP also has a much lower payout ratio using either earnings per share or free cash flow.Paychex paused its dividend growth but was able to maintain its payments during the last financial crisis. The stock also provides a 40% higher yield than that of ADP.Overall, however, ADP's dividend growth streak and lower payout ratios outweighs Paychex's higher yield. The company's dividend grew during the last recession, giving the edge to ADP in this area.ADP's stock has returned nearly 24% in 2019. This follows a 12% gain in the previous year. Shares of Paychex has performed even better, having increased more than 27% year-to-date after declining more than 4% in 2018. Both stocks have beaten the returns of the S&P 500 so far this year.ADP currently trades at $160 per share. Using the company's guidance for earnings per share for the year, the stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 29.9. The current valuation is well above our fair value estimate of 18 times earnings. If the stock reverts to this estimate by 2024, total returns would see a reduction of 10.7% annually over this time period.Fortunately, total annual returns also consist of expected earnings per share growth and dividends. Total annual returns for ADP would be as follows:We estimate that shares of ADP will offer a total annual return loss of 0.7% through 2024. We believe fair value for ADP to be $96 per share. The gains in value to start 2019 have greatly reduced our expected total return for the company, and we view fair value at $96.Shares of Paychex trade for $81. Based off of the company's guidance for earnings per share for the year, the stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 28.4. We have a target of 20 times earnings. Annual returns would be reduced by 7.3% if shares were to revert to this target by 2024.To summarize, expected total annual returns for Paychex would be as follows:We expect that shares of Paychex will offer a total annual return loss of 0.8% through 2024. As with ADP, Paychex's return for the year has absorb all of our expected total return. We see fair value at $57.A side-by-side comparison of the expected returns for ADP and Paychex can be seen in the table below:The increases in share price so far this year have driven the valuations of both stocks to levels usually reserved for stocks favored by growth-oriented investors, not for companies with single-digit growth rates. For these reasons, neither company has an advantage over the other in terms of expected total return.ADP and Paychex are two of the top names in their sector. Both companies have performed well in recent quarters and both should continue to perform well if unemployment remains low.Sure Dividend usually reserves buy recommendations for stocks with at least 10% total return potential. Neither ADP nor Paychex offers even a positive total return estimate at this point, due to their very high valuations.However, if both stocks traded near fair value, we would prefer ADP's potential for earnings growth and streak of dividend increases to Paychex's higher yield."
4286226,85096,2019-08-16T09:07:50-04:00,"Automatic Data Processing’s dividends are about average at 2.0% and have been increased for 43 years in a row - a Dividend Aristocrat.The company’s total return outperformed the Dow average for my 56-month test period by 60.05%, which is great.Its S&P CFRA, three-year forward CAGR of 14%, is good and will give you solid growth with the increasing world economy and population.This is a growing company that is increasing its revenue and earnings using the cloud and improving its services.","Automatic Data Processing (ADP) is a ""Buy"" for the total return and the dividend growth investor. It is one of the largest human resources products and services companies in the world. ADP is a conservative investment for the income investor who also wants good growth potential with the growing world economies and population.Automatic Data Processing is 6.64% of The Good Business Portfolio, a full position. The company has steady growth and has the cash it uses to increase the dividends each year. As the interest rates decrease, the earnings of ADP are also decreased from the payroll float, but increased capabilities of its products and services more than make up for this decrease.I use a set of guidelines that I codified over the last few years to review the companies in The Good Business Portfolio (my portfolio) and other companies that I am reviewing. For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article, ""The Good Business Portfolio: Update to Guidelines, August 2018"". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return, and growing companies that hopefully keeps me ahead of the Dow average.Automatic Data Processing is reviewed in the following topics below:When I scanned the five-year chart, Automatic Data Processing has a great chart going up and to the right in a steady, strong slope for the last four years with hardly a bump down until the end of the year 2018, when the market had a downturn, and then recovered from this bump in 2019.Data by YChartsThe Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with, and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the Good Business Portfolio. My total return guideline is that total return must be greater than the Dow's total return over my test period. Automatic Data Processing beats against the Dow baseline in my 56-month test compared to the Dow average. I chose the 56-month test period (starting January 1, 2015, and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2017 and other years that had a fair and bad performance. The great ADP total return of 107.63%, compared to the Dow base of 47.58%, makes Automatic Data Processing a great investment for the total return investor that also wants a steadily increasing income. Looking back five years, $10,000 invested five years ago would now be worth over $25,700 today. This gain makes Automatic Data Processing a great investment for the total return investor looking back, which has future growth as the United States economy continues to grow.Dow's 56-month total return baseline is 47.58%.Automatic Data Processing does meet my dividend guideline of having dividends increase for 8 of the last ten years and having a minimum of 1% yield. ADP has an average dividend yield of 2.0% and has had increases for 43 years, making it a good choice for the dividend growth investor. The dividend was last increased in November 2018 to $0.79/quarter, up from $0.69/quarter, or a 14% increase, with increases expected to continue for many years. The five-year average payout ratio is moderate at 62%. After paying the dividend, this leaves cash remaining for increasing the business of the company.I have a capitalization guideline where the capitalization must be greater than $10 billion. ADP easily passes this guideline. This is a large-cap company with a capitalization of $71.4 billion. Its 2019 projected cash flow at $2.9 billion is good, allowing ADP to have the means for company growth and increasing dividends each year. Large-cap companies like ADP have the cash and ability to buy other smaller companies and weather any storms that might come along.I also require the CAGR going forward to be able to cover my yearly expenses and my RMD with a CAGR of 7%. My dividends provide 3.3% of the portfolio as income, and I need 1.9% more for a yearly distribution of 5.2% plus an inflation cushion of 1.8%. The three-year forward S&P CFRA CAGR of 14% easily exceeds my guideline requirement. This good future growth for ADP can continue its uptrend benefiting from the continued strong growth in the worldwide and United States economies.One of my guidelines is that the S&P rating must be three stars or better. ADP's S&P CFRA rating is three stars, or ""Hold"", with a target price of $172, passing the guideline. The stock price is presently 4% below the target. ADP is under the target price at present and has a high forward P/E of 25, making it a bit pricey at this entry point, but the P/E is about equal to the company’s peers. If you are a long-term investor that wants good, steady, increasing dividend income and future total return growth, you may want to look at this company.One of my guidelines is: Would I buy the whole company if I could? The answer is yes. The total return is strong, and the average growing dividend makes ADP a good business to own for income and growth. The Good Business Portfolio likes to embrace all kinds of investment styles but concentrates on buying businesses that can be understood, makes a fair profit, invests profits back into the business, and also generates a good income stream. Most of all, what makes ADP interesting is the potential long-term growth of its business as the working population and economy increases. The company gives you an increasing dividend for the dividend investor and a great total return.For the last quarter on July 31, 2019, ADP reported earnings that beat expectations by $0.01 at $1.14, compared to last year at $0.92. Total revenue was higher at $3.5 billion, up 5.4% year over year, and was in line with expectations. This was a good report, with the bottom line beating expectations and the top line increasing strongly compared to last year. The next earnings report will be out late October 2019, and EPS is expected to be $1.34 compared to last year at $1.20, a good increase. The company guided for next year’s earnings to be up 12-14%, consistent with the projected CAGR of 14%.The graphic below shows a comparison of the yearly earnings of 2018 and 2019. The earnings growth of ADP is well above average, and the company will continue with good, steady innovation in its product line.(Source: ADP 4th quarter 2019 earnings call slides)Automatic Data Processing is one of the largest human resources companies in the United States and foreign countries.From Reuters:Overall, Automatic Data Processing is a good business with 14% CAGR projected growth as the United States and foreign economies grow going forward, with increasing demand for the company's products. The good dividend income brings you cash, and I continue to see further growth as the world economy grows. As interest rates decrease, so will ADP's earnings on the payroll float, but this decrease is easily overtaken by the gain from product innovation sales increases.The quotes below from the 4th-quarter earnings call are only some of many improvements in its products that ADP is making to increase the growth of its business.This shows the feelings of top management for the continued growth of ADP's business and shareholder return with an increase in future growth. The company has constant, solid growth, and this will continue as the world economy and population grows. The growth is being driven by increased cloud computing and added features of its existing services, which are growing sales and earnings.The graphic below shows the 2020 outlook that will continue to bring growth to ADP stockholders.(Source: ADP 4th quarter 2019 earnings call slides)Automatic Data Processing is a good investment choice for the total return and dividend growth investor with its average dividend yield and high total return. Automatic Data Processing is 6.64% of The Good Business Portfolio. ADP will be held in the portfolio and will be trimmed when it reaches 8% of the portfolio. I buy what I consider great businesses that are fairly priced, and value investors will want to wait for a better entry point if it ever happens. Good, growing businesses do not come cheap, but over time, they continue to grow. If you want a solid, growing dividend income and good total return in the data processing business, ADP may be the right investment for you.The five companies comprising the largest percentage of the portfolio are: Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) at 7.9% of the portfolio, the Eaton Vance Enhanced Equity Income Fund II (EOS) at 8.3% of the portfolio, Home Depot (HD) at 9.5% of the portfolio, Omega Health Investors (OHI) at 8.2% of the portfolio, and Boeing (BA) at 12.8% of the portfolio. Therefore, BA, EOS, JNJ, OHI, and HD are now in trim position, but I am letting them run a bit, since they are great companies.On August 13, I trimmed HD down to 9.5% of the portfolio. It is a great business, but I needed some cash for my RMD, and HD was getting to be too large a percentage of the portfolio.Boeing is going to be pressed to 14% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on 787 deferred plane costs at $938 million in the first quarter of 2019, an increase from the fourth quarter. Boeing has dropped in the last four months because of the second 737 Max crash, and I look at this as an opportunity to buy BA at a reasonable price. On July 19th, BA said that it expects to have the 737 Max flying by the early fourth quarter, and the stock went up $16. The second-quarter earnings report was really bad, and BA lost $25 over three days.JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because of its defensive nature in this post-Brexit world. Earnings in the last quarter beat on the top and bottom lines, and Mr. Market did nothing. In April 2019, the company increased its dividend to $0.95/quarter, which is 57 years in a row of increases. JNJ is not a trading stock but a ""Hold"" forever; it is now a ""Strong Buy"", as the healthcare sector remains under pressure.The total return for the Good Business Portfolio is ahead of the Dow average YTD by 5.73%, which is a nice gain above the market for the portfolio with BA a strong drag.

4256558,95006,2019-04-25T03:04:30-04:00,"This analysis of ADP uses a 10-year time-frame and assumes a recession will occur at some point over that period.It analyzes expected returns from sentiment reversion-to-mean, earnings growth, and business returns that weight returns to shareholders more heavily.The analysis also examines the potential opportunity cost of waiting for a better price for the stock.","SourceTraditionally, most of my analysis on Seeking Alpha has focused on how to avoid losses and how to profit from the price cycles of highly cyclical stocks. When dealing with highly cyclical stocks, it's usually a good idea to evaluate potential returns over a relatively short 5-year time frame because the stock prices can move dramatically over short periods of time. Investing in these types of stocks requires techniques that are different than the standard analysis most investors use to evaluate a stock. There is another group of stocks, however, whose stock prices and earnings fluctuate far less than the classic cyclical stocks I have traditionally written about. While these stocks aren't as cyclical as a ""classic cyclical"", they are still usually subject to the short-term debt cycle (or business cycle) and to changes in sentiment (which can sometimes also have a cyclical quality about it). More recently, I have been adapting some of the techniques I've used with ""classic cyclicals"" so that I can apply them to less-cyclical stocks. And today's stock is one of those.One of the major assumptions that I make for both approaches is that history is the most reliable guide to the future. My experience has been that 80% of the time, even if we looked at nothing else, a stock will behave in a similar manner as it did the previous cycle or two unless there is a disruption to its core business. For this reason, I don't rely much on predictions of future earnings or sentiment that aren't supported by their existence during past cycles. That doesn't mean that ""this time is different"" isn't true sometimes. It just means that my analysis isn't counting on this time being much different. That said, if I think a stock is currently a ""buy"" based on my 10-year, full cycle analysis, before I invest, I will examine the forward-looking trends and narratives more carefully to make sure there aren't major changes in the works that could affect the business.The main difference you'll find between my analysis and others' is that: 1) I focus on a clear 10-year time frame and the compound annual rate of growth (CARG) one might expect over that period of time; 2) I assume we will experience a recession during that time period, and I build that into the expected returns; 3) I try to calculate the expected returns based on a full business cycle; 4) I weight shareholder yields from dividends (and potentially from buybacks) more heavily because that is money actually being returned to shareholders; 5) I provide an ""opportunity risk/reward analysis"" if a stock is not currently a ""buy"" so that we can get an idea of how likely it is the stock will trade low enough to become a ""buy"" over the next 4-5 years if we have a recession.As part of the analysis, I calculate what I consider to be the three main drivers of future total returns: 1) Market Sentiment Returns, 2) Full-Cycle Organic Earnings Growth Returns, and 3) Shareholder Weighted Business Returns. Then, I combine all three 10-year CARG estimates together to get an expected 10-year, full-cycle CARG estimate. Currently, I consider an expected CARG > 15% a ""buy"", 12-15% an ""outperform"", 8-12% a ""market perform"", 4-8% an ""underperform"", and < 4% a ""sell"".With that, let's get into the analysis.When dealing with stocks whose earnings are not very cyclical or economically sensitive, using long-term P/E ratios can be useful for gauging market sentiment. Let's take a look at Automatic Data Processing (ADP) using a F.A.S.T. Graph, which is a great tool for this sort of analysis:The first thing I want to check is how cyclical ADP's earnings are. Overall, they aren't very cyclical, but the did suffer declines of about -13% just after each of the past two recessions. The type of analysis I do is ideal for these sorts of stocks because I will include the assumption of a recession and corresponding earnings declines in my 10-year analysis, but first let's see what sort of return I could expect 10 years from now if the P/E multiple were to revert to its mean from the previous economic cycle. In order to estimate that, I'm going to shorten the time frame of the F.A.S.T. Graph so it starts in 2006.Over the past cycle ADP's normal P/E ratio was about 22.4 and today the ratio is about 31.2. If that ratio were to revert to the mean, over a ten-year time period, it would produce a CARG of -3.26%. If we begin our measurement around the same point we were last cycle, which I estimate to be about 2006, and we adjust the annually compounded EPS growth for the amount of stock that was repurchased over this time period, we can estimate how much CARG we can expect over the next 10 years if the next cycle is similar to the previous one.ADP has reduced its shares outstanding by about -24.5% this cycle. I will take the effects of these buybacks out when calculating the expected earnings growth over the next ten years, and I will also assume that we will have a recession at some point over the next ten years as well (remember how ADP's earnings fell -13%, we want to take those type of fluctuations into account).When I run the numbers on that, if the next cycle is similar to the previous one, we would expect an organic earnings CARG of about +0.97% over the next ten years from earnings growth.These return estimates are more complicated than the first two, but the idea behind this is to figure out how much the company is making in cash and/or earnings per share while taking into account debt and cash levels, how much of a dividend yield it is paying to shareholders, what percentage of shares it is buying back annually, and how much cash the company is keeping for itself, all on a per share basis. Once that is complete, I assume any money the business keeps for itself will accrue over a 10-year time period, but I don't assume that it will compound (since I estimated the earnings growth in the last section). For buybacks, if the company is buying back shares when sentiment is below average, I will assume the value of the buybacks will compound over time. If they are buying back when sentiment is higher than average, I will assume the buybacks accrue but do not compound value over the 10-year time period. (This is just a way to weight the value of buybacks over time for the estimate, it isn't intended to be mathematically precise - which is fine for me, because we never know exactly what price the buybacks will be made over time anyway, so there's no sense in pretending we do.) I will assume that dividends paid to shareholders compound their value over time because shareholders can immediately reinvest the dividends in the best investment available.As I noted, this process is intended to estimate how much money the business is likely to make and how much of that money will likely be returned to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. I limit the expectation of shareholder returns by how much cash is currently being generated and the company's apparent intention of investing that cash itself or returning it to shareholders. If buybacks and dividends are more than cash flows and earnings, I will assume they are unsustainable through a full cycle that includes a recession, and I limit the shareholder return expectations to actual cash flows and/or earnings estimates I think are reasonable.First, let's revisit those buybacks and see what sort of returns we might expect from them in the future. I'll look at both 1-year and 3-year time frames.ADP has a solid buyback trend in place of about 1.25% of shares per year, so that's what I'll assume they'll average in terms of buybacks over the next 10 years.Now let's take a look at the dividend yield.Currently, we can expect a 1.83% dividend yield going forward.In order to see if buybacks and dividends are sustainable over the next cycle, I like to take a look at both earnings yield and free cash flow to equity/enterprise value yield to make sure the company has the income to sustain the buybacks and dividends, and also to see how much is left for the company to invest in its business.The earnings yield looks like enough to cover the dividend and the buybacks.The FCFE/EV yield, at 4.1% has been pretty steady over the past decade as well.When I run the numbers on this, with buybacks accruing, but not compounding over the next ten years (along with the excess cash the business keeps for itself), and assume that the dividends will compound over the next ten years, I get a 10-year expected business return CARG of +3.75%.Putting all three -- market sentiment returns (-3.26%), earnings growth returns (+0.97%), and business/shareholder returns (+3.75%) -- together, I estimate a full-cycle 10-year CARG return of +1.46%. That level of expected 10-year CARG puts ADP in the 'sell' category for me. ADP is a great example of stock that experiences what I call ""sentiment cycles"". What I've noticed is that with these sorts of stocks, that one full sentiment cycle usually corresponds with two full business cycles. My theory about what happens is that a business with relatively stable earnings goes into one recession with a fairly low P/E multiple, thereby causing the stock price to fall less than the rest of the market during that recession. Then, as the new business cycle gets longer, and investors start getting anxious about the possibility of the next recession coming, they look back at the last recession to see which stocks performed better than the market during that recession. When this observation is combined with steady earnings and a long history of dividends, investors buy these stocks with little regard to the price they are paying. But, paying too high of a price, even for a good business, can lead to bad returns over the next cycle. I've seen this dynamic with several stocks in the late 1990s.Everyone remembers or tends to focus on the dot.com stocks of the late 1990s and the bubble they were in. But there was another class of stocks that were in a bubble as well, like Coca-Cola (KO), McDonald's (MCD), General Electric (GE), and, as luck would have it, ADP, which, near the peak of that cycle traded at a P/E ratio of 38.7 according to FAST Graphs. Not all that much higher than the 31.2 multiple we see today. What is great about this, is that I can demonstrate for readers what their 10-year CARG would have been if they invested in ADP on 2/28/01 and held for ten years. Their total annual rate of return would have +1.2%. Because, unlike the 2008 recession, where ADP when into it with a ~23 P/E ratio, in 2001, the P/E was much higher. I think we are in a similar sentiment cycle with ADP this time around and the returns over the next ten years are likely to be as low as the 2001 to 2011 period.But let's not end our analysis there. Let's look at what the chances are of getting back in at a lower price if we were to sell today because that is always the concern when one sells the stock of a good company.In order to estimate the opportunity risk/reward, I use FAST Graph's forecasting tool to estimate future price appreciation, including dividends, for the next 2-3 years using analysts' estimates. Then I assume we will have a recession after that point. What I want to know is if a recession begins in 2-3 years, whether I will have a reasonable chance to buy ADP at a significantly lower price than it trades today or if I would likely never get a chance at a lower price.If we hold ADP's P/E ratio steady, looking out to the end of fiscal year 2021, including dividends, analysts expect ADP's price to rise to $223.67. If at that point, we experienced a recession and ADP's price falls as much as it did during the post-dot-com bubble, it will fall ~60% off its highs. If its P/E multiple reverts to the 14.3 it saw in 2003, the stock price would fall ~53%. During the Great Recession, even with the stock going in with a relatively low P/E multiple compared to what it has today, the stock fell -38%. So, let's estimate that we could see a -40-60% drop in price during the next recession. If the recession starts 2-3 years from now, we could expect a future price of ADP stock in the $89.47-$134.20 range. Keep in mind that if the recession starts sooner than 2 years, those prices would be lower because we baked in 2-3 years of expected future growth. With that entire range below the current stock price $161.91, I think there is little risk of not being able to buy the stock back at a lower price if one sold today.If one wished to moderate the potential opportunity cost of going completely into cash-equivalent, a 50/50 mix of cash and Invesco S&P MidCap Low Volatility ETF (XMLV) should capture a bit more of the upside between now and the next recession, yet fall less than the market during an economic downturn. Using this strategy of rotating out of ADP now and back in during the next recession, I expect one could increase the total shares of ADP one owns today by 20-25% at no extra cost, and be well positioned for the next cycle or two of steady growth."

(NASDAQ:ADP) are down 7.62% since peaking on Oct 2, 2018 (shares popped 4% today after a Q2 earnings beat on EPS and revenue), and in my opinion, the shares of this global supplier of human capital management solutions are an attractive buy at current price levels. The company has a strong history of generating earnings growth, and the future growth ratios point to continued growth over the next 12 months. I lay out my bullish argument for the company below by reviewing some pertinent fundamental and technical aspects of the stock.My Momentum Growth Quotient (MGQ) plays a critical part when it comes to determining if I'm going to go long or short a stock. Generally, I only want to go long a stock with an MGQ higher than that of the S&P 100, and I want to go short a stock with an MGQ lower than that of the index (for a more detailed explanation of how I calculate the MGQ, please see my blog post).As of the end of December 2018, the MGQ for the S&P 100 was 9.11.The current MGQ for ADP stands at 13.42, which implies a 47.72% higher growth rate compared to the S&P 100. This tells us that ADP has strong future growth potential and is a good candidate for a long position.Let's dig a little deeper into the financial data to get a better feel for how the company has performed on certain fundamental metrics and what these numbers imply for future growth.Caveat Lector: I am a Quant Trader - that is, I seek to understand market behavior by using mathematical and statistical modeling, measurement, and research. So, you won't find much qualitative analysis in my work or in my trading process. The goal is to identify optimum entry points for trades based on my quantitative model and execute those trades as effectively as possible.During the past 12 months, the average EBITDA per share growth rate of Automatic Data Processing was -5.30% per year. During the past three years, the average EBITDA per share growth rate was 6.50% per year. During the past five years, the average EBITDA per share growth rate was 9.60% per year. During the past 10 years, the average EBITDA per share growth rate was 3.90% per year (GuruFocus). Although earnings growth turned negative over the last year, today's earnings release by the company shows a re-acceleration of earnings growth is underway for fiscal 2019.The operating margin percent for ADP stands at 20.08%. Each dollar of revenue the company generated brought in 20.08 cents of earnings. The company's operating margin has grown at an average clip of 1.5% per year over the last five years, which is an acceptable rate of growth.Knowing how a company has performed in the past is important in order to evaluate management's past record in running the business. But more important to us is how profitable the company will be in the future because we are investing going forward, not backward. And it's the forward-looking metrics that should really get you excited about ADP.I like to use two measuring sticks to gauge the future growth potential for companies: Forward P/E and forward rate of return.I prefer to use the forward P/E ratio (current stock's price over its ""expected"" earnings per share) rather than historical P/E to gauge a company's expected future earnings power. A high forward P/E ratio means that investors are anticipating higher growth in the future and are willing to pay more for future earnings - momentum investing is all about following the trend (perceived or real).ADP has a forward P/E of 23.58 compared to a 16.99 forward P/E for the S&P 100. The forward P/E for ADP is greater to that of the index, suggesting that the markets are expecting a market growth rate for the company greater than that of the broader markets.The forward rate of return for a stock (created by Donald Yacktman) is one of my favorite quotients for gauging the market's expectation for future growth for a company. Yacktman defines forward rate of return as the normalized free cash flow yield plus real growth plus inflation. In simple terms, the forward rate of return can be thought of as the return that investors buying the stock today can expect from it in the future.The forward rate of return for ADP stands at 14.39%. This implies that an investor buying the stock today should expect a 14.39% return over the next 12 months. The average forward rate of return for the S&P 100 as of the end of December was at 7.90%, so ADP has an implied potential rate of return that's 1.82x greater than that of the index.The risk inherent in the forward rate of return is that the calculation is reliable only if the company can grow at the same rate in the future as it did in the past. If the growth rate falters, the projected returns will not materialize. But we are willing to accept this risk as part of the difficult process of forecasting earnings and growth momentum.As per my ChartMasterPro Daily Trade Model, there's a high probability of a rally to the $148.00 level from here, which would equate to a gain of around 8% for the shares:I will buy call options for ADP over the next few days.For investors in the shares, I recommend that you hold for three months or $148.00, whichever comes first. For longer-term investors, I believe ADP is a solid addition to any growth portfolio over the next 12 months.When looking for companies to invest in, I like to find management teams that have outperformed their peers in the same industry with regard to growing earnings, running the company efficiently and generating higher-than-average returns for shareholders.Management EffectivenessSource: ReutersThis is a company that's posting higher profit margins than its peers, with a management team that's very good turning revenue into earnings, and generating higher returns on equity than its competitors. The price drop in the shares over the last three months presents an excellent opportunity to initiate a position in ADP.The chart below shows the company's net operating profit after tax on a TTM basis - you can see that although NOPAT has been trending higher at a healthy pace through 2018, the share price has collapsed over the last three months. With the company's long history of being able to convert rising revenue into earnings in an efficient manner, this significant drop in the share price is an excellent opportunity to pick up these shares on the cheap - I view the recent drop in the share price as an overreaction to the downside given the company's strong future looking growth ratios.Data by YChartsWhen I go long a stock, I want to invest in a company that provides superior future growth potential, but I also want to time the entry into any position to try to maximize my return.So, I use fundamental analysis to identify shares with a strong future growth rate, and then I apply technical analysis to identify ideal entry points.In my opinion, ADP is a strong buy at these levels from both a fundamental and technical perspective."
4267122,85096,2019-05-29T16:26:32-04:00,"Automatic Data Processing's total return outperformed the Dow average for my 53-month test period by 85.89%, which is great.Automatic Data Processing's S&P CFRA three-year forward CAGR of 14% is good and will give you good growth with the increasing world economy and population.Automatic Data Processing's dividends are average at 2.0% and have been increased for 43 years in a row, a dividend aristocrat.","This article is about Automatic Data Processing (ADP) and why it's a buy for the total return investor that also wants some solid, increasing dividend income. Automatic Data Processing is one of the largest human resources products and services companies in the world. ADP is a conservative investment for the income investor who also wants good growth potential when interest rates start rising again.Automatic Data Processing is 6.52% of The Good Business Portfolio, a full position. The company has steady growth and has the cash it uses to increase the dividends each year. When interest rates increase, the earnings of ADP are also increasing from the payroll float. Right now, with the market relatively high, ADP is matching the market. The recent dip at the end of 2018 created a buying opportunity at a good price, but now ADP is fully valued.When I scanned the five-year chart, Automatic Data Processing has a great chart going up and to the right in a steady, strong slope for the last four years with hardly a bump down until the end of the year 2018 when the market had a downturn.Data by YChartsFundamentals of Automatic Data Processing will be reviewed on the following topics below.I use a set of guidelines that I codified over the last few years to review the companies in The Good Business Portfolio (my portfolio) and other companies that I am reviewing. For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article ""The Good Business Portfolio: Update to Guidelines, August 2018"". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return, and growing companies that hopefully keeps me ahead of the Dow average.Automatic Data Processing passes 11 of 11 Good Business Portfolio Guidelines, a good score (a good score is 10 or 11). These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. Some of the points brought out by the guidelines are shown below.The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the Good Business Portfolio. Automatic Data Processing beats against the Dow baseline in my 53-month test compared to the Dow average. I chose the 53-month test period (starting January 1, 2015, and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2017, and other years that had a fair and bad performance. The great total return of 128.46% makes Automatic Data Processing a good investment for the total return investor that also wants a steadily increasing income. ADP has an average dividend yield of 2.0% and has had increases for 43 years, making this dividend Aristocrat also a good choice for the dividend growth investor. The dividend was last increased in November 2018 to $0.79/Qtr., up from $0.69/Qtr. or a 14% increase with increases expected to continue for many years.Dow's 53-Month total return baseline is 42.57%For the last quarter on May 1, 2019, Automatic Data Processing reported earnings that beat expectations by $0.08 at $1.77, compared to last year at $1.82. Total revenue was higher at $3.84 billion more than a year ago by 4.1% year over year and missed expectations by $70 million. This was a good report with bottom line beating expected and the top line increasing with a good increase compared to last year. The next earnings report will be out late July 2019 and is expected to be $1.12 compared to last year at $0.25 (with exceptional items).The graphic below shows the 3rd quarter comparison with 2018.Source: ADP 3rd quarter 2019 Earnings call slidesAutomatic Data Processing is one of the largest human resources companies in the United States and foreign countries.As per excepts from Reuters:Overall, Automatic Data Processing is a good business with 14% CAGR projected growth as the United States and foreign economies grow going forward, with the increasing demand for ADP's products. The good dividend income brings you cash as we continue to see further growth as the world economy grows. As interest rates have risen, so have ADP's earnings on the payroll float.The Fed has kept interest rates low for some years, and on December 19, 2018, they raised the base rate of 0.25%, which was expected. I believe that they will go slow in 2019, which should help keep the economy on a growth path. If infrastructure spending can be increased, this will even increase the United States growth going forward with better economics for the consumer. At the March 20 meeting, the Fed lowered United States GDP projection for 2019 which they said is getting to neutral on the economy, projecting no rate increases for 2019. The Fed meeting statement was a wait and see and a bit more dovish than the last meeting. At the May 1 meeting, they did not raise rates and kept them the same.From May 1, 2019, earnings call, Carlos A. Rodriguez (Chief Executive Officer and President) said:This shows the feelings of top management for the continued growth of the Automatic Data Processing business and shareholder return with an increase in future growth. ADP has good constant growth that will continue as the United States and the world economy grow.The graphic below shows the 2019 outlook that will continue to bring growth to the stockholders.Source: ADP 3rd quarter 2019 Earnings call slidesAutomatic Data Processing is a good investment choice for the total return investor with its average dividend yield and high total return. Automatic Data Processing is 6.52% of The Good Business Portfolio and will be held and watched as it grows. ADP will be held in the portfolio long term and will be trimmed when it reaches 8% of the portfolio. If you want solid growing dividend income and a good total return in the data processing business, ADP may be the right investment for you.I intend to watch the earnings reports for the companies in the portfolio and may finally decide to trim my high flyers that are over 8% of the portfolio so I can invest in good companies on my buy list.The Good Business Portfolio trims a position when it gets above 8% of the portfolio. The five top percentage of the portfolio companies in the portfolio are Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) at 8.2% of the portfolio, Eaton Vance Enhanced Equity Income Fund II (EOS) at 8.6% of the portfolio, Home Depot at 9.0% of the portfolio, Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) 8.2% of the portfolio and Boeing (BA) is 13.1% of the portfolio. Therefore, BA, EOS, JNJ, OHI, and Home Depot are now in trim position, but I am letting them run a bit since they are great companies.Boeing is going to be pressed to 15% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on 787 deferred plane costs. The first-quarter earnings for 2018 were unbelievable at $3.64 compared too expected at $2.64. Farnborough Air Show sales in dollar value just beat out Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF) (OTCPK:EADSY) by about $6 billion, and both companies had a great number of orders. Boeing received an order for 18 more KC-46A planes. The second quarter 2018 earnings beat expectations by $0.06 at $3.33, but a good report was hurt by a write off expense on the KC-46, which has started delivery in 2019. Eight KC-46A tankers have been delivered YTD for 2019. Boeing has dropped in the last 7 weeks because of the second 737 Max-8 crash, and I look at this as an opportunity to buy BA at a reasonable price. This is just my opinion. An FAA representative said on May 23 that the 737 Max could be flying again by late June which would be great.JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because of its defensive nature in this post-Brexit world. Earnings in the last quarter beat on the top and bottom lines, and Mr. Market did nothing. JNJ has just increased the dividend to $0.95/Qtr., which is 57 years in a row of increases. JNJ is not a trading stock but a hold forever; it is now a strong buy as the healthcare sector remains under pressure.The total return for the Good Business Portfolio is ahead of the Dow average YTD by 5.21%, which is a nice gain above the market for the portfolio.

4293888,105080,2019-09-27T08:30:53-04:00,"During the last several weeks, we sold our stake in Automatic Data Processing.If ADP meets its 2021 earnings targets, we estimate the stock will generate a low-double-digit return from our exit price.While we believe now was the appropriate time to sell our investment in ADP, we wish the company well as it continues its business transformation.","The following segment was excerpted from this fund letter.During the last several weeks, we sold our stake in Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP). Although we expect ADP to continue to do well over time as the company executes on its business transformation, we view the prospective returns from today as more modest because the market is now more accurately pricing in ADP's prospects for success.We achieved many of the objectives we established when we initiated our position in ADP. This led to a highly successful investment outcome particularly considering the low-risk and unleveraged nature of ADP's business. At the time of our exit, approximately two years from the establishment of our position, ADP's stock price had increased to $167 per share, generating a total shareholder return including dividends of 64%, more than double the S&P's total return of 30% over the same period.(1) Including the benefit of leverage in the form of long-dated, very-deep-in-the-money call options that were used to finance a portion of this investment, PSH realized returns in excess of the stock return, culminating in an attractive 40% annualized rate of return.Prior to our investment, ADP was not well understood by the investment community, and garnered little critical attention. While the company participates in an excellent industry and had produced good shareholder returns over time, its performance was well below its structural potential.While our original approach was to work quietly behind the scenes to achieve our investment objectives, we were quickly forced into a proxy contest which led us to publicly air our concerns and the opportunities we had identified. During the contest, we were able to successfully make the case to shareholders that ADP had the potential to materially improve its competitive position, generate higher revenue growth, and achieve substantially greater efficiency and margins while enhancing the customer experience.Our activism bore significant fruit. ADP's investor base emerged from our engagement better educated about the company's enormous potential. With the support for change from other major shareholders, we were able to catalyze the company to embrace a business transformation. As a direct result of our activism, ADP made commitments to accelerate revenue growth, bolster its competitive position in the Enterprise market, and improve efficiency and margins.During the past year, management started to execute on these new commitments by accelerating existing efficiency initiatives and embracing new projects to streamline ADP's business. These initiatives have included: (1) Accelerating the development of ADP's next-generation platforms, (2) broadening and accelerating the company's Service Alignment Initiative, (3) launching an early retirement program, (4) executing a broad-based workforce optimization effort focused on spans of control and management layers, and (5) launching an accelerated procurement transformation effort aimed at third-party vendors and internal expense management. These projects, along with other smaller initiatives underway, allowed ADP to realize significant margin expansion and earnings growth in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. These initiatives should provide a tailwind for continued operating progress over the coming years. ADP's business transformation has been accomplished as the company continues to post near-record client retention and accelerated bookings and revenue growth, demonstrating that customers are supportive of the changes.At the time we invested in ADP, the company was forecasting approximately $3.80 of earnings per share in fiscal-year 2018. Recently, ADP has provided earnings guidance of $6.10 to $6.20 for fiscal-year 2020 (ADP's fiscal year ends June 30th), and ~$7 per share of earnings in fiscal year 2021, an ~85% increase in earnings per share in three years if the company meets its projections which historically have been conservative.Furthermore, we believe that there continues to be a significant opportunity for ADP to execute its ongoing business transformation in the years ahead, and to expand margins and earnings beyond current targets, but best-in-class execution will be required. If ADP meets its 2021 earnings targets, we estimate the stock will generate a low-double-digit return from our exit price. While we believe now was the appropriate time to sell our investment in ADP, we wish the company well as it continues its business transformation.1. Total returns for ADP are calculated using the Company’s average acquisition cost of the position at the date the position was made public and the issuer’s closing share price on the date of sale. Average acquisition cost is calculated by taking into account the cost of outright purchases of stock and the per share cost of shares underlying derivative instruments acquired by the Company to build the position, as applicable.Editor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."

If you prefer learning through videos, you can watch a video analysis on the topic below:To begin, let's talk about Automatic Data Processing's business model. Automatic Data Processing is one of the largest business services outsourcing companies in the world. The company provides payroll services, human resources technology, and other business operations to more than 700,000 corporate customers. Automatic Data Processing was founded in 1949 and currently trades with a market capitalization of $57 billion.Automatic Data Processing is a well-known dividend stock because of its compelling track record of dividend growth. With 44 years of consecutive dividend increases, Automatic Data Processing is a member of the Dividend Aristocrats Index, a group of elite dividend stocks with more than 25 years of consecutive dividend increases.Looking ahead, investors cannot rely on Automatic Data Processing's dividend history alone to measure its dividend safety. For the remainder of this article, we will discuss the company's current dividend safety from four perspectives:First, let's discuss Automatic Data Processing's dividend safety in the context of the company's current earnings.When Automatic Data Processing announced its most recent quarterly financial results on October 31st, the company reported that it generated earnings per share of $1.20 in the three-month reporting period. For context, Automatic Data Processing paid a $0.69 dividend during the same quarter for a dividend payout ratio of 58%.Looking out over a longer time frame, our conclusion is the same. Automatic Data Processing's management team has provided guidance for adjusted earnings per share of about $5.25 in the current fiscal year. The company's current dividend of $0.79 per share implies an annual dividend payout ratio of just 60%.Using earnings, Automatic Data Processing's dividend appears very safe for the foreseeable future.Many analysts believe that comparing a company's dividend payments to its free cash flow is a better method for assessing dividend safety. Accordingly, we will now compare Automatic Data Processing's current dividend payment to its free cash flow.In the most recent quarter, Automatic Data Processing generated $149.2 million of cash from operating activities and spent $43.2 million on capital expenditures for free cash flow of $106 million. The company distributed $302.6 million of common share dividends during the same time period for a free cash flow dividend payout ratio well above 100%.On the surface, this may be alarming. With that said, some additional investigation reveals that this short-term inability to cover dividend payments with free cash flow may be related to the timing of cash entering and existing this business.In fiscal 2018 (which ended on June 30th, 2018), Automatic Data Processing generated $2.5 billion of cash from operating activities and spent $206 million on capital expenditures for free cash flow of $2.3 billion. The company distributed $1.1 billion of common share dividends during the same fiscal year for a free cash flow dividend payout ratio of 48%.Using free cash flow, our conclusion is the same as when we used earnings to measure Automatic Data Processing's dividend safety, although a second-level analysis was required. The company's dividend appears safe for the foreseeable future.Companies do not cut their dividends in the good times. Instead, dividends are reduced when companies experience financial difficulties. Accordingly, this section will analyze Automatic Data Processing's current dividend safety in the context of the company's historical recession performance.We believe that the best way to measure a company's recession resiliency is by measuring its earnings per share performance during the financial crisis that occurred between 2007 and 2009. Automatic Data Processing's performance during this time period is shown here:Automatic Data Processing's earnings per share continued their streak of uninterrupted increases during the 2007-2009 recession. Accordingly, we have no concerns about the company's ability to pay rising dividends during future economic downturns.The last angle that we will use to assess Automatic Data Processing's current dividend safety is by looking at the company's current debt level. More specifically, we will see how much the company's weighted average interest rate will need to increase before the company's free cash flow will no longer cover its dividend payment.In fiscal 2018, Automatic Data Processing generated $102.7 million of interest expense and had total debt outstanding of $2.0 billion for a weighted average interest rate of 5.1%.The following image shows how changes to Automatic Data Processing's weighted average interest rate would impact the company's dividend coverage, as measured by free cash flow.Source: Sure Dividend CalculationsAs the image shows, Automatic Data Processing's weighted average interest rate would need to rise well above the 25% level before its dividend would no longer be covered by free cash flow. Accordingly, we believe that Automatic Data Processing's debt level is unlikely to impact the safety of its dividend moving forward.While Automatic Data Processing's long dividend history is a good sign that it pays a safe dividend, fundamental analysis is also important.In this article, we analyzed ADP's dividend safety by looking at earnings, free cash flow, recession performance, and debt. Our conclusion is that ADP's dividend is extremely safe for the foreseeable future."
4237956,21798,2019-02-04T16:58:12-05:00,Automatic Data Processing's strong FQ2 results have the company on track for double-digit earnings gains for the fiscal year.ADP's upgraded earnings guidance provides a catalyst for the stock.The valuation and growth will support a double-digit stock gain over the next year.,"Automatic Data Processing (ADP) exceeded estimates for both revenue and earnings for FQ2. Revenue increased 8.3% y-o-y and exceeded estimates by $70 million. Adjusted diluted EPS increased 30% y-o-y and exceeded estimates by $0.16 per share or 13.6%.The strong results led the company to increase guidance for the full fiscal year which ends in June 2019. ADP now expects adjusted diluted EPS to increase 17% to 19% for FY19. This is up from the previous range of a 15% to 17% gain.My thesis is that the increased guidance, ADP's overall growth, and reasonable valuation will drive the stock for a strong double-digit gain over the next year.Automatic Data Processing is achieving growth in their primary business segments. The company provides services for companies that encompass recruitment to retirement.ADP operates two main segments: Employer Services (71% of total revenue) and Professional Employer Organization [PEO] Services (29% of total revenue). The Employer Services segment provides small to large businesses with human resources outsourcing and tech services, which include cloud-based solutions. The PEO segment offers a co-employment model for human resources outsourcing solutions.ADP is expected to grow revenue in the Employer Services segment by 5% to 6% for FY19. The company is also expecting margins for this segment to increase 175-200 basis points and new business bookings growth of 6% to 8% for FY19. The margin improvement in this segment is important for ADP's earnings growth since Employer Services comprises 71% of total revenue.The PEO segment also looks strong as ADP expects full-year revenue growth of 9% to 10%. However, margins for the PEO segment are expected to remain flat for FY19.ADP is projecting to achieve total revenue growth of 6% to 7% for FY19. That will help drive the double-digit expected gains in earnings growth for the fiscal year as a result of the company's margins and P&L structure. The consensus earnings estimate among 19 analysts is calling for 21% growth for FY19.ADP DataCloud is the company's data analytics solution. This is the company's differentiating solution for human capital management [HCM]. ADP DataCloud provides real-time data to help clients analyze patterns and trends on categories such as overtime, compensation, and turnover. The solutions can provide employers with information to help improve their businesses.ADP DataCloud can also help employers analyze how they compare to the market averages. The benchmarks that are analyzed include: workforce demographics & changes, time & attendance, compensation, and ADP system usage. These tools help employers get quick access to help manage key aspects of their business more efficiently.These tools can help employers pay competitive, equitable wages, while reducing turnover.Another example of a differentiator is ADP's Accountant Connect solution. This allows CPAs to view and analyze their client's payroll, tax forms, and provide them with central practice management tools.ADP's solutions are highly ranked from user recommendations and usability according to a survey from softwareadvice.com. The company has a well-known name in the industry with the resources to provide effective solutions to their clients.Since ADP is expected to grow earnings at an above-average double-digit rate for multiple years, I like to use the PEG ratio for valuation purposes. The PEG takes future earnings growth into consideration. In this case, I'm using the 5-year PEG, which takes a 5-year projection of average earnings growth into account.Here's how ADP compares to their peers:source: finance.yahoo.comFrom the table above, we can see that ADP has the lowest valuation and one of the highest expected growth rates for 2019. Therefore, ADP's stock has a good chance of outperforming most of their peers. With an above-average growth rate, ADP is likely to outperform the S&P 500 (SPY).ADP has a strong balance sheet along with positive cash flow, which gives the company flexibility to grow the business and reward shareholders.ADP has more current assets than current liabilities with a current ratio of 1.05. The company also has 1.14x more total assets than total liabilities for shareholders' equity of $4.76 billion. ADP has $2.79 billion in total cash with $3.2 billion in total debt.The company produced $2.78 billion in operating cash flow and had $2.33 billion in free cash flow over the past twelve months. ADP also gets high returns for their investments. For the past twelve months, ADP achieved an ROE of 36.8% and an ROIC of 25.5%.ADP's strong balance sheet, positive cash flow, and high returns allow the company to expand their core business, to do acquisitions, to increase dividends, and to do share repurchases. These are all positive things to drive strong shareholder returns.When all of the evidence is analyzed, ADP looks like a good combination of a fairly valued company with above-average growth. The company has effective solutions that can help other companies manage their human capital. ADP's ability to grow their business through acquisitions and other ways will help drive the company to grow at a strong pace going forward.Investors should be aware that competition remains the biggest risk for ADP. There are numerous companies with HCM solutions. Therefore, ADP will have to effectively upgrade and provide clients with solutions that will improve their businesses. With that in mind, ADP does have strong capital resources to acquire some of their competitors going forward. With those resources and high returns, ADP is likely to continue their growth at an above-average pace.With the valuation at a fair level, the stock can grow approximately in-line with earnings growth going forward. Since ADP's fiscal year ends in June 2019, I took the average expected earnings growth of 21% for FY19 and 13% for FY20 to get average expected earnings growth of 17% for the next 12 months.So, my one-year price target is $166 based on that earnings growth. That would take the forward PE up to about 28 based on EPS of $5.97 for FY20. That may sound high, but other HCM software companies such as WorkDay and ULTI are trading with much higher forward PEs of 116 and 45 respectively. Therefore, a PE of 28 is reasonable for ADP's strong double-digit growth within a bull market."

Automatic Data Processing is one of the largest human resources products and services companies in the world. ADP is a conservative investment for the income investor who also wants good growth potential with the rising interest rates.Automatic Data Processing is 5.95% of The Good Business Portfolio, a full position. The company has steady growth and has cash it uses to increase the dividends each year. As the interest rates increase, the earnings of ADP are also increasing from the payroll float. Right now with the market relatively high, ADP is beating the market. The recent dip at the end of 2018 has created a buying opportunity at a good price.When I scanned the five-year chart, Automatic Data Processing has a great chart going up and to the right in a steady, strong slope for the last four years with hardly a bump down until the end of the year 2018 when the market had a downturn.Data by YChartsFundamentals of Automatic Data Processing will be reviewed on the following topics below.I use a set of guidelines that I codified over the last few years to review the companies in The Good Business Portfolio (my portfolio) and other companies that I am reviewing. For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article, ""The Good Business Portfolio: Update to Guidelines, August 2018"". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return and growing companies that hopefully keeps me ahead of the Dow average.Automatic Data Processing passes 11 of 11 Good Business Portfolio Guidelines, a good score (a good score is 10 or 11). These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. Some of the points brought out by the guidelines are shown below.The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the Good Business Portfolio. Automatic Data Processing beats against the Dow baseline in my 48.0-month test compared to the Dow average. I chose the 48.0-month test period (starting January 1, 2015, and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2017, and other years that had fair and bad performance. The great total return of 73.01% makes Automatic Data Processing a great investment for the total return investor that also wants a steadily increasing income. ADP has an above average dividend yield of 2.3% and has had increases for 43 years, making ADP also a good choice for the dividend growth investor. The dividend was last increased in November 2018 to $0.79/Qtr. up from $0.69/Qtr. or a 14% increase with increases expected to continue for many years.Dow's 48.0-month total return baseline is 37.84%For the last quarter on October 31, 2018, Automatic Data Processing reported earnings that beat expected by $0.09 at $1.20, compared to last year at $0.91. Total revenue was higher at $3.2 billion more than a year ago by 7.8% year over year and beat expected by $40 million. This was a great report with bottom line beating expected and the top line increasing with a good increase compared to last year. The next earnings report will be out late January 2019 and is expected to be $1.17 compared to last year at $1.05, a good increase.The graphic below shows a comparison for the yearly earnings of 2017 and 2018.Source: ADP 4th quarter 2018 Earnings call slidesAutomatic Data Processing is one of the largest human resources companies in the United States and foreign countries.As per excepts from Reuters:Overall, Automatic Data Processing International is a good business with 14% CAGR projected growth as the United States and foreign economies grow going forward, with the increasing demand for ADP's products. The good dividend income brings you cash as we continue to see further growth as the world economy grows. As interest rates rise so have ADP's earnings on the payroll float.The Fed has kept interest rates low for some years, and on December 19, 2018, they raised the base rate 0.25%, which was expected. I believe that they will go slow in 2019, which should help keep the economy on a growth path. If infrastructure spending can be increased, this will even increase the United States growth going forward with better economics for the consumer. The Fed lowered GDP projection for 2019 which may mean they are getting to neutral on the economy, projecting two rate increases for 2019. The recent volatility may keep the Fed on hold. Recently, the Fed Chairman made a statement which was dovish, and the market went up strongly.From October 31, 2018, earnings call, Carlos A. Rodriguez (Chief Executive Officer and President) said:This shows the feelings of top management for the continued growth of the Automatic Data Processing business and shareholder return with an increase in future growth.

Automatic Data Processing is 5.95% of The Good Business Portfolio and will be held and watched as it grows. ADP will be held in the portfolio and will be trimmed when it reaches 8% of the portfolio. If you want a solid growing dividend income and good total return in the data processing business, ADP may be the right investment for you.I intend to watch the earnings reports for the companies in the portfolio and may finally decide to trim my high flyers that are over 8% of the portfolio so I can invest in good companies on my buy list.The Good Business Portfolio trims a position when it gets above 8% of the portfolio. The four top companies in the portfolio are Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) at 8.2% of the portfolio, Omega Health Investors (OHI) at 8.7% of the portfolio, Home Depot at 8.9% of the portfolio and Boeing (BA) at 14.3% of the portfolio. Therefore, BA, OHI, JNJ, and Home Depot are now in trim position, but I am letting them run a bit since they are great companies.Boeing is going to be pressed to 14% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on 787 deferred plane costs at $316 million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase from the fourth quarter. The second quarter saw deferred costs on the 787 go down $530 million, a big jump from the first quarter. The second quarter of 2017 earnings was fantastic with Boeing beating the estimate by $0.25 at $2.55. The third quarter of 2017 earnings were $2.72, beating the expected by $0.06 with revenue increasing 1.7% over last year, another good report. The first-quarter earnings for 2018 were unbelievable at $3.64 compared to expected at $2.64. Farnborough Air Show sales in dollar value just beat out Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF) (OTCPK:EADSY) by about $6 billion, and both companies had a great number of orders. The second-quarter earnings beat expectations by $0.06 at $3.33, but a good report was hurt by a write off expense on the KC-46 which should start delivery in 2019. Boeing received an order for 18 more KC-46A planes. As a result of the good third-quarter earnings, S&P CFRA raised the one-year price target to $450 for a possible 37% upside potential.JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because it's so defensive in this post-Brexit world. Earnings in the last quarter beat on the top and bottom lines and Mr. Market did nothing. JNJ has an estimated dividend increase to $0.97/Qtr. in April 2019, which will be 57 years in a row of increases. JNJ is not a trading stock but a hold forever; it is now a strong buy as the healthcare sector remains under pressure.For the total Good Business Portfolio, please see my article on The Good Business Portfolio: 2018 3rd Quarter Earnings and Performance Review for the complete portfolio list and performance.

4229429,98446,2018-12-20T12:05:12-05:00,"Automatic Data Processing has a very long track record of dividend growth.
        The company posted solid quarterly results at the end of October.
        While I've long found Automatic Data Processing shares to be overvalued, the stock is very much within my price target.","I am always looking to add quality companies trading at a reasonable valuation to the March to Freedom Fund. Companies with long track records of dividend growth are especially appealing to me as this has shown that they can survive a weak economic environment with their dividend not only intact, but higher than the year before. Since dividends will pay our expenses in retirement, I want to partner with businesses that are likely to continue increasing their payments to shareholders.One company that I have followed for some time, but have not yet purchased due to valuation is Automatic Data Processing (ADP).Automatic Data Processing, which was founded in 1949, is the largest payroll services provider in the U.S. The company offers payroll services, human resources technology and other operations to more than 700,000 medium and large businesses. Automatic Data Processing’s primary customers are those businesses with fifty employees or more. The company benefits from an improving labor market and with close to record lows for unemployment, Automatic Data Processing’s business should do well. Automatic Data Processing has a current market cap of $56.9 billionAutomatic Data Processing released financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on October 31st.Source: Automatic Data Processing’s Third Quarter Financial Results Presentation, slide 4.Adjusted earnings-per-share, or EPS, for Automatic Data Processing was $1.20 in the quarter, topping the average analysts’ estimate by $0.09. This was a 28% improvement from the previous year. Revenue increased 7% in constant currency to $3.3 billion. This was $40 million higher than expected by the market. EBIT increased 18% year-over-year. A lower tax rate of 21.9% added $0.05 to earnings results, meaning that even without this benefit EPS still improved more than 22%.Each of Automatic Data Processing’s segments showed solid growth during the quarter.Source: Automatic Data Processing’s Third Quarter Financial Results Presentation, slide 5.Revenues from Employer Services, which provides human resource solutions, saw 6% growth in constant currency on an 8% increase in new bookings. The number of pays per control grew 2.4% in the U.S. Margins for the Employer Service segment increased 260 basis points to 27.3%.PEO, which stands for Professional Employer Organization and offers administrative outsourcing solutions, saw revenues grow 10%. The average worksite employee count grew by 9% and margins improved by 110 basis points.Automatic Data Processing’s investment funds saw interest from client funds improve nearly 20%. The average yield on client fund investments grew as did the size of client fund balances. The company had an average client fund balance of $22.2 billion, 5% higher than the first quarter of fiscal 2018. A combination of increase in clients, wage inflation and pays per control helped lead to this growth.Due to the strength of the first quarter, Automatic Data Processing increased its financial guidance for the fiscal year.Source: Automatic Data Processing’s Third Quarter Financial Results Presentation, slide 6.Automatic Data Processing now expects revenues to increase between 6% to 7%, 1% higher than previously thought. The company sees adjusted EPS growing 15%-17% for the year, with a midpoint of $5.25 per share. For reference, Value Line tells us that Automatic Data Processing was able to grow earnings by almost 8% between fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2018.Employer Services expects new bookings to grow ~7% during the fiscal year and pays per control to improve 2.5%. The low end of expected revenue growth for PEO was increased by 1% to a range of 8% to 9%. The company’s tax rate is seen as falling to 24.5% from 25.1% previously.Automatic Data Processing’s stock has been fairly resilient this year. Even as the markets have struggled in recent weeks, the stock is still up almost 11% since the first trading day of the year.Automatic Data Processing produced a solid first quarter result and has already raised its guidance for both earnings and revenues for the current fiscal year. This should allow the company to continue paying and raisings its dividend.In an ideal world, the stocks in our portfolio would all have very long dividend growth streaks. The ability to continue to pay and raise a dividend in a recession is an impressive feat. I also prefer companies that can give the same size raises year after year while keeping the payout ratio at a similar level. This shows that these companies are very good at projecting their future earnings for it could be a sign that the dividend is in trouble if the payout ratio spikes too high in a given year.Having raised its dividend for forty-four years, Automatic Data Processing is a Dividend Aristocrat. Only fifty-six other companies in the U.S. can claim a dividend growth streak of at least this length. The U.S. Dividend Champions website, which was created by the late David Fish, says that Automatic Data Processing’s dividend has survived four previous recessions. The company has increased its dividend by:An average of 10.6% per year over the past three years. An average of 10.6% per year over the past five years. An average of 11% per year over the past ten years.Automatic Data Processing has given shareholders a remarkably consistent dividend increases over the short, medium and long term. The company recently raised its dividend by 14.5% for the upcoming January 1 st payment. This is one of the higher dividend increases of the past few years. Shares currently yield 2.43%, above the 2.05% yield of the S&P 500.Automatic Data Processing is expected to pay out $3.16 in dividends per share in 2019. Based off of EPS guidance for 2019 of $5.25, the company has a current payout ratio of 60%. This is pretty much in line with the five and ten-year average payout ratios of 61.5% and 58.8%, respectively.Automatic Data Processing’s dividend growth streak, very consistent increases and stable payout ratio all meet my criteria for investment, but is the current price attractive?If you’re not familiar with how I value stocks, I take the current price and compare it to fair values and price targets from a number of different sources to see how over or undervalued shares are currently. I then take the average of these values to determine a price target. For companies that have increased their dividend by more than a decade, which Automatic Data Processing has clearly done, I am willing to pay 5% above what I consider to be fair value. I am willing to pay this premium because these are companies that have demonstrated the ability to increase their dividends over several different economic cycles.Prior to purchasing a stock, I check Value Line’s safety and financial strength to get a sense of the company’s ratings. I am looking for at least a 2 for safety and at least a B++ for financial strength as this gives me reassurance that the company is on solid financial footing. Automatic Data Processing receives a 1 for safety and an A++ for financial strength, the highest ratings for both categories.Shares of Automatic Data Processing have traded with an average price-to-earnings, or P/E, of 25.7 over the last five years. The stock closed Tuesday at $130 per share. Using the midpoint for expected EPS ($5.25), Automatic Data Processing has a current P/E ratio of 24.8. This means that shares are 3.8% undervalued compared to its historical P/E.CFRA has a one-year price target of $146, offering 12.3% upside from the current price. Their fair value is $97.96, meaning shares are 24.7% overvalued at the moment.Morningstar estimates fair value to be $102 per share. This would place shares at 21.5% overvalued based on the most recent closing price.Value Engine has a one-year price target of $139.55, which would result in a 7.4% gain if this price were to be realized. Their fair value for Automatic Data Processing is $141.03, which would have shares at 8.5% undervalued.Average these values out and I find shares to be 2.4% overvalued. While buying undervalued shares is always a priority, this is the least overvalued that I have found Automatic Data Processing to be in the last several years. I estimate based off my sources that fair value for the stock is ~$127.Given the Automatic Data Processing’s history of dividend growth, I would be willing to pay 5% above what I find fair value to be. Under $134 and I would be a buyer of the stock.Automatic Data Processing had a solid quarter, growing both earnings and revenues at solid rates. Both of the company’s segments are showing growth. A positive business environment and a low unemployment rate should help Automatic Data Processing continue to grow both its top and bottom lines. The company also has increased its guidance for the year.Automatic Data Processing has one of the longest dividend growth streaks available in the market and is a very consistent dividend grower. The recent above average raise signals that management expects earnings to improve going forward. While shares are not undervalued currently they also aren’t as overvalued as they have been in the past. I think investors buying the stock of Automatic Data Processing at the current prices can acquire shares of a quality company with a long dividend growth streak."

(ADP for short) is a company that provides business outsourcing solutions to various companies across the world. In all, ADP services more than 700,000 business across more than 110 countries.ADP reports as two business segments - Employer Services, and Professional Employer Organization. Employer services makes up just over two-thirds of the $13B in annual revenues that ADP generates. Between the two segments, ADP as a whole offers a wide range of outsourced human capital management and human resource solutions.Source: Automatic Data Processing, Inc.It's a fantastic business model, because a vast majority of companies lack one/all of the know-how, desire, or resources to properly manage its workforce and ADP is able to provide this via services that are economical, convenient, and efficient.Since 2011, the company has redirected its business to take advantage of technological advances. For example, ADP has heavily invested to bring its services to the cloud.Source: Automatic Data Processing, Inc.It then spun off its automotive retail services business ADP Dealer Services into what is now CDK Global (NYSE: CDK) in 2014. These moves have worked well with ADP seeing solid top and bottom line growth over the past five years.Source: YchartsThe company is also very profitable with ADP able to convert a healthy number of its sales into cash.Source: YchartsWhen a company is able to consistently convert 10% or more of its revenues into free cash flow, it opens up a lot of value adding options for management. Cash can be either reinvested back into the company without the need to take on debt, or cash can be distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends, or share buybacks.When management has decided to reinvest cash back into the business, the results have been sparkling. ADP has consistently generated a cash return of more than 20% on invested capital. This is important because investing your resources into ventures that generate a high rate of return is a fundamental driver of organic growth. When the company deploys its hard-earned cash into activities that have little/no return, it is almost the equivalent of a company lighting money on fire.Source: YchartsWith a growing business that generates healthy cash flows and achieves high rates of return on invested capital, it shouldn't surprise you to hear that ADP is a dividend champion. ADP has increased its dividend for an impressive 43 consecutive years and running. With an annual payout of $2.76 per share, the dividend currently yields about 2% on shares.Source: YchartsThe dividend has a 10-year CAGR of 11%, and has received a ""double-bump"" this year with a second surprise increase thanks to tax reform laws unlocking more cash for ADP to disperse by lowering the corporate tax rate. Looking forward, dividend growth will lean on continued revenue growth and margin expansion. With the dividend at approximately 60% of free cash flow, you don't want that figure to go much higher. It is important for the dividend to not become an anchor if the business hits a downturn, or slows down. Management is expecting revenue growth of about 7-8% for full year 2018, and EBIT margins to remain consistent with prior year. Management should raise the dividend again in November, and investors can probably count on another 7-8% increase at that time (in line with revenue growth). ADP is working towards additional margin expansion over the next few years (23-25% EBIT margin by FY2021), so any margin expansion will aid in dividend growth over that time frame as FCF would increase.Source: YchartsFinancially, I won't elaborate too much here because ADP is about as good as it gets. Although the company is carrying $2B on its balance sheet in debt, the $2.78B in cash and equivalents essentially mean that ADP is operating on a net debt-free basis. For investors, that means that the company has virtually every single penny of profits at its disposal. When a company is highly levered, the cost of servicing a debt load can choke cash flows and make the company sensitive to rising interest rates.There is a lot going on at ADP as the company continues to shift for the future. We already saw the massive adoption of cloud-based technology. The company is continuing to innovate by aggressively expanding the delivery of its services to customers.Source: Automatic Data Processing, Inc.The company is focusing on open platform applications to allow for a more tailored solution offering to the marketplace. This is incredibly important because the work environment is consistently becoming increasingly complex. The rise of fragmented work forces via remote employees, those that are contracted, freelancers, etc. They all require different products and services. These next generation platforms, broken into HCM, payroll, and tax categories are currently in pilot phase and will be expanding over the next handful of years.This ties into ADP's main growth driver moving forward, which is HRO or Human Resource Outsourcing.Source: Automatic Data Processing, Inc.By leveraging its technology base of cloud services, data/analytics, and intellectual property, ADP can further integrate itself with customers which leads to higher retention rates and margins.ADP will be aided in growth by a sizeable market for its services. Management's investor day presentation indicated an addressable market worth of $125B in potential revenues. To penetrate as much of that as possible, ADP leans on a large and strategically assembled sales network.Source: Automatic Data Processing, Inc.The company is shifting its mix of inside/outside sales from a 25:75 mix, to 40:60 by 2021. The strategy behind this is to minimize selling cycle time and costs, while maximizing the customer experience. This heavy attention to detail on such a large sales force is a competitive advantage for ADP, and can help increase penetration into new markets. With products and services that are becoming increasingly capable and flexible, customer education is key.There is a flip side to this industry though, and it represents a potential business risk to ADP. Because this business is dealing with high volumes of sensitive information, protection of information is key. Any potential failure of cyber integrity/security would be disastrous for ADP.The same goes with government regulations and compliance laws. It is crucial that ADP keeps its eye on the ball and successfully navigates the many legislative pitfalls that present themselves when working with customers in so many different countries, states, and industries.Shares of ADP are currently trading in the $134 range, which places shares at the upper end of its 52-week range.Source: YchartsWith ADP's full-year earnings are forecasted to arrive in the neighborhood of $4.46 per share, the stock is trading at approximately 30X earnings. This is a huge premium to its 10-year median earnings multiple of 19X earnings. The dividend yield of 2% is also less than its decade norms of 2.73%.Source: YchartsIf we look at FCF yield, the figure is near its lowest point over the past decade. I typically look for 10% as an ideal level of FCF yield. That can be hard to find - especially in high growth, high quality stocks. However, the yield being less than 3%, and near a decade-low indicate that the stock is a poor value at current prices when you take the earnings multiple into consideration as well.Even though growth is expected both by management and analysts to accelerate over the next five years, I have a difficult time justifying the current valuation as an entry point for investors.It's exciting when you see a strong, profitable, well-run company innovate its business model to find a newly ignited path to growth. ADP happens to offer investors just that. The top line should continue to grow on the back of innovation, and a strong sales force that will enable the company to penetrate a large existing market of opportunity - both new business, and up-selling existing customers.Financially, the company is profitable and responsibly run. The balance sheet carries zero net debt, which means that all profits can add value to the company. The dividend is going to continue growing at a pace that well exceeds inflation for years to come.My only hangup on the stock is its valuation. While the increased growth prospects warrant a conversation, I can't get to 30X earnings and a FCF yield under 3%. A P/E ratio of 22X earnings (15% premium over decade norms) would be the point where shares warrant a much harder look in my opinion. This would put a potential entry point at around $98, just under 52-week lows. It is important for investors to stay in a favorable cost position so that growth can be reaped as a reward for prudent decision making. If you overpay for a stock, the growth will only keep you treading water, with P/E compression a more likely outcome."
4181847,39141,2018-06-15T04:21:05-04:00,Shares of ADP have jumped since my last recommendation in April.ADP upped its guidance on revenue and EBITDA.ADP is now significantly higher than its average valuation.,"I last recommended Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), ADP for short, in an article back on April 17th. With interest rates generally rising and bonds becoming more and more reasonably priced compared to stocks, it is increasingly important for income investors to be exposed to secular, long-term trends that will be able to grow in any environment, including one with higher rates or higher inflation. ADP is definitely one of those names. The 'Digital Transformation' is perhaps the defining megatrend of the Millennial generation, as T-Mobile CEO John Legere put it, all content is going on to the internet, and the internet is going mobile. Among many other things, this means automation, mobility, machine learning and digital interface will increasingly become the order of the day. ADP is leading its peers in this regard. ADP was the first mover among comprehensive human resource management companies to have a proprietary digital payment processing platform; the Wisely digital pay platform provides instant, on-demand payments for workers and is available to both traditional and freelance workers and works on a mobile platform. ADP also recently made an acquisition of WorkMarket, which provides a platform uniquely built for dynamic, team-based organization, thereby providing a freelance labor solution which is becoming increasingly common in the ""gig economy."" Also worth mentioning is ADP's big data solution, DataCloud, which leverages the company's unprecedented access to employee meta data to provide insight to businesses that are not easy to find anywhere else.In many ways ADP is an innovation driver in the transition to a more digital economy, and that makes ADP an interesting secular growth name. This article takes a look at ADP's latest quarter, its ongoing valuation, and what it means for long-term minded income investors. ADP has appreciated substantially since the April article. Dependable, long-lived growthOver the last quarter ADP not only delivered strong results, but also raised its guidance. Total revenue grew 6% organically, and management raised guidance to 7%-8% growth for the full calendar year. EBITDA increased 8%, and earnings per share climbed 16% higher on a tax cuts and a lower share count. Guidance is being increased because large businesses, which make up the bulk of ADP's clients, are needing ADP's services much more, particularly in the form of comprehensive, intelligent human resource management. ADP has a lot of momentum in both its products and its technology, and in many cases has already full transitioned to a digital model. For example, Already 90% of 'human capital management' revenue comes from cloud-based applications.In addition, human resource outsourcing continues to drive revenue growth higher, and even still ADP sees human resource outsourcing revenue growing 12-14% through to 2021. There are several sources of growth momentum for ADP. The good news for income investors, is that this secular growth comes with relatively low capital requirements and very high recurring revenue.This chart, while it has a lot of technical terminology, succinctly shows what the company is aiming to do over the medium term. As the 'gig economy' expands disproportionately, and as both clients and their employees demand more flexible solutions to both human resources and payroll, ADP is developing apps and solutions to go outside the traditional bounds of 'human capital management.' Effectively, this is what the 'digital transformation' looks like in the human resources business, and ADP is in many cases driving the trend. Dividend and valuationManagement reiterated its commitment to keeping the dividend somewhere between 55% - 60% of earnings per share. Last year, the payout ratio was 61%, and so I expect the dividend to roughly match earnings per share growth, or grow slightly slower. Last quarter, ADP's board elected to raise the dividend from 63 cents to 69, a 9.52% dividend hike, which, considering the 16% EPS growth, was a rather conservative move. I'm not too surprised by this, however, because last year dividends were a hair over 60% of EPS (at 61%), and also because a good chunk of that outsized EPS growth came from tax reform, meaning that earnings growth will not be recurring.As far as valuation goes, the market finally realized what is going on with ADP. Back in the April article, shares were about $115, and now shares are up by about 20%. You couldn't be blamed for not wanting to bite at this valuation: According to data from FAST Graphs, shares of ADP have averaged 22.8 times trailing earnings, but now trades at a lofty 32.5 times; a premium of about 42%. Despite the clear premium ADP now trades at, it is important for income investors to have some perspective. These are times where we should be more fearful than greedy: Bonds have become reasonably priced compared to stocks and inflation seems to have returned in a meaningful way. In an environment where stocks are not only historically highly-valued, but also pricey in comparison to bonds, income investors should look to hitch on to long-term secular growth 'megatrends' that will persist at any interest rate or inflation scenario. ADP definitely fits the bill on this one. I recommend buying ADP, if not here, then at any kind of pullback or weakness."
4252542,101523,2019-04-03T08:07:35-04:00,"“Legacy Assets” represents timeless businesses that have paid dividends for generations.ADP’s business benefits from a size advantage and high switching costs.Shares represent an attractive investment today given the company’s financial position, growing payout, and reasonable valuation.","I wouldn’t hold most stocks for 10 minutes. But occasionally, I find a stock I want to own for 100 years.Regular readers know I’m a big fan of a group of stocks I like to call my “Legacy Assets.” These companies represent timeless businesses that enjoy entrenched market positions. For that reason, these firms have paid dividends, not just for years or decades, but generations. I’ve covered such stocks in previous articles, such as Hershey Co. (NYSE:HSY), PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and The Royal Bank of Canada (NYSE:RY).Case in point: Automatic Data Processing (ADP). The business represents the largest payroll processor in the world. Companies turn to ADP to outsource their payroll and tax-filing needs. And with now more than 750,000 clients worldwide, the firm has become a cash machine. Last year, the business generated $13.3 billion in total sales. From that figure, over $1.6 billion flowed down to the bottom line in profit.That income stream has paid off for shareholders. Since 1994, ADP stock has generated a total return, including dividends, of 2,100%. That crushed the 512% gain from the broader S&P 500 over the same period.But do shares represent a good place to put money to work today? Actually, yes. Let’s dive into the financials here.ADP pays out one of the safest dividends around, to begin with. The company owes its success to its raw size, which allows management to earn higher margins than rivals. Long-term contracts and the inherent difficulty in switching outsourced human resources processes allows ADP to lock in clients. Average client retention is estimated to be more than 10 years. This inherent stickiness allows executives to raise prices year after year with little customer turnover.This business model provides plenty of cash to reward shareholders. In 2019, analysts project ADP’s earnings will come in at around $5.38 per share. Over the same period, management expects to pay out $3.16 per share in dividends. Generally, I like to see companies pay out 80% or less of their income out to investors. This leaves management with a little bit of wiggle room to keep making payments in the event of a downturn. So ADP’s 60% payout ratio should allow investors to sleep well at night.That same conservative approach applies to the company’s balance sheet, too. ADP’s long-term debt stands at only $2.0 billion. That represents only $0.42 in debt for every dollar of equity on the books.Source: MSN MoneyThat payout will likely continue to grow, too. Management has boosted the dividend to shareholders every year since 1975. That track record has earned the company a place on the list prestigious list of Dividend Aristocrats.ADP has several avenues to grow that dividend. First, management has started to reduce overhead costs by buying out employees through an early retirement program. Second, boost revenues by rolling out the next generation of products and services such as cloud analytics solutions. Third, raise prices on existing customers as they roll over their service agreements.This has translated into respectable growth. Last quarter, revenues increased 8% to $3.5 billion. Adjusted net earnings, which strips out a number of one-time charges, increased 29% to $587.0 million. Over the next five years, Wall Street projects ADP’s earnings per share will grow at a 17% compounded annual clip.Data by YChartsFinally, investors now have a rare chance to scoop up ADP stock at a reasonable price. Over the past nine months, shares have basically gone nowhere. Traders have batted around the stock in a range between $130.00 and $150.00 per share since last August.This sideways trading action, however, has allowed earnings to catch up to the share price. Today, ADP stock trades for 21 times forward earnings. Given the company’s 17% projected annual growth rate, shares look reasonably priced on a price/earnings-to-growth basis. Not cheap mind you. Investors will always pay a premium multiple for a wonderful business like ADP. Shares, however, now trade at some of their lowest valuations in years.Data by YChartsADP, of course, is no sure thing. Many of the company’s service agreements are on a per-employee basis. If the economy slows down and employers begin laying off staff, ADP could see revenues drop. As technology improves, more businesses may opt for do-it-yourself SaaS solutions. In recent years, we’ve also seen the company lose customers to Cloud rivals like Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) and Ultimate Software (NASDAQ:ULTI).Shareholders don’t have too much to worry about. ADP’s strong financial position should allow the business to soldier through any downturn. Management has also responded to rivals by introducing new products to clients. ADP’s new cloud service, which allows businesses to analyze trends in their human resource departments, has really resonated with customers. Still, investors need to keep an eye on these risks.ADP stock represents a true Legacy Asset. The company benefits from an entrenched market position, which should allow it to earn outsized returns (and pay growing dividends) for decades to come. My suggestion: stick this name in your portfolio, forget about the market ups and downs, and cash the dividend checks for decades to come."

So today I decided to take a hard look at Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (""ADP"") and determine if it is a fit for my portfolio and if the company is considered an ""undervalued"" dividend growth stock. However, based on the company's current stock price, P/E Ratio, and payout ratio, I will not be investing in ADP as the company is not considered an ""undervalued"" stock at this time. Let's learn more about ADP.Over the years ADP has evolved from just a payroll processing company to an outsourced, market-leader in human capital management. This evolution of the business model has been the company's primary driver of growth recently and is a key part of the company's strategic growth initiatives going forward (per the company's 2017 investor presentation). Here were a few interesting stats that jumped out at me from this presentation that caused me to do a double take and help me comprehend the company's position as a market leader:As I mentioned in the early paragraph, ADP is focused on growing their role as an overall human resources provider. The company has continued to make strategic moves that position the company to continue to grow in this digital environment, as well. One such example is how ADP has invested heavily in improving their cloud-based technology to ensure they can provide companies with a full suite of cloud-based services. While the company made significant capital investments prior to 2018 in this area, the company further bolstered these efforts by announcing the acquisition of WorkMarket, a ""leading cloud-based workforce management solution provider that allows companies to build and manage an integrated workforce across W-2 employees, 1099 contractors, vendors and other types of workers."" ADP is not messing around here!Sure the strategic initiatives sound great, but how has the company performed so far in the fiscal year? The company's most recent earnings release was in January and there was a lot of positive news in the earnings release. In the reported quarter, the company's earnings increased 8% and their adjusted EPS increased 14% (The non-GAAP EPS figures, which includes and adjustment for the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, restructuring charges, and other items). The company's top line growth was strong for each of the major operating segments; however, the company's SG&A expenses also which reduced the company's gross margin slightly. A large portion of the increased SG&A costs are attributed to the restructuring charges. Management has stated that the company expects to incur $25m of restructuring charges in the current year and had $85m in restructuring charges in the prior year. This is not a small chunk of change. But if the restructuring is as successful as advertised, it has the potential to create significant shareholder value going forward.The main takeaway from the earnings release and management's 2017 investor presentation is that the company is expecting strong growth over the next several years. The results of the company's investments and strategic initiatives are starting to show. The company upward revised their total expected revenue growth in 2018 to 7%-8% in the last earnings release and increased their anticipated EPS growth rate to 8%-9%.But as a dividend investor, you know my eye is always on the dividend and the company's ability to continue to grow their dividend going forward. ADP is a Dividend Aristocrat and has increased their dividend for 42 consecutive years. Earlier in the month, ADP increased their quarterly dividend by 9.5%. This is music to a dividend investor's ears. If management continues to grow revenues and earnings as expected, I would expect this strong dividend growth rate to follow.The figures cited above are great. However, we are always on the lookout for undervalued dividend growth stocks. It is time to run ADP through the Dividend Diplomats' Stock Screener to see if the company currently passes our investment filters used to identify undervalued dividend growth stocks. Our stock screener uses three simple screens to identify the stocks: P/E Ratio (valuation), dividend payout ratio (company's ability to continue growing their dividend), and their dividend growth rate/history of increasing their dividend (as we focus on companies that have demonstrated their ability to increase their dividend over a long period of time). If a company passes our screener, and a few other metrics, we will consider purchasing. We also included the results of one of ADP's competitors, Paychex, Inc. (NYSE:PAYX), in our analysis to see how well ADP performed against a competitor within its industry. Here are the results of our screener:1.) Dividend Yield: Typically, I look to invest in companies with dividend yields exceeding the S&P 500. Otherwise, I would consider investing in a nice, diversified S&P 500 mutual fund or ETD. ADP's dividend yield of 2.36% is above the current market. Interestingly though, it is well below its competitor.2.) Payout Ratio: We typically use a 60% payout ratio in our stock screener as we believe this percentage point allows companies to safely continue growing their dividend without sacrificing the safety of the dividend. Using forward earnings, ADP's payout ratio exceeds our threshold and therefore, does not pass this metric.3.) Dividend Growth Rate and History: As I mentioned above, ADP is a Dividend Aristocrat that recently announced a 9.5% dividend increase. Their 5-year average dividend growth rate is 7.67%, which is a very solid figure. ADP passes this metric and also significantly outshines PAYX.4.) Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio: I'm always looking for companies that are trading at a multiple below the broader market. Currently, the broader market has a P/E ratio in the mid-20X. ADP is currently trading at a multiple higher than the market! Once again, ADP does not pass this metric of our stock screener.I love ADP's growth story. The company continues to invest in the technology needed to grow their revenue for many years into the future and maintain their position as a market leader for human resources services. The results of the company's strategy are currently being realized as the company continues to deliver strong revenue, EPS, and dividend growth. Strong results like these have also caused the company to trade at a premium and this premium appears justified. However, the purpose of our stock screener is to find potentially undervalued dividend growth stocks. Because of the fact that the company's current P/E ratio and their payout ratio that is greater than 60%, the company did not pass our stock screener. I will pass on investing in the company for the time being.What are your thoughts about ADP? Do you think the company is worth the premium stock price? Do you currently own shares?"
4163543,39141,2018-04-17T14:32:44-04:00,"ADP has a lead over its competitors, with the first proprietary digital payments platform in its industry.ADP expects strong top and bottom-line growth in fiscal 2018.However, shares are trading well above their average valuation. It is best to wait for a pullback before buying.","The transformation to digital transactions is, I believe, a defining generational change as Millennials and the later 'Gen Z' become more important consumers. This transformation isn't only about e-commerce or intrepid technology companies, but rather, it is affecting many sectors and industries, and is doing so in enumerable ways.Income investors should look for companies that are jumping out ahead of this trend. One such company doing so is Automatic Data Processing (ADP). You might know ADP as the payroll processor of many large companies in the US. On the client side, ADP is also a provider of human resources solutions for companies. ADP has been working hard to adapt to where the world is going. Management noticed that workers were demanding more ease of access, functionality, and flexible payment options, and has begun acting accordingly.In 2017, ADP acquired WorkMarket (for freelance vetting and solutions) and Global Cash Card (for digital accounts and flexible payments). In addition, ADP is now the first human resource management company to have a proprietary digital payment processing platform. Those moves will pay off greatly in the future as clients reap the productivity benefits of digitalization. Indeed, in 2018, ADP has already accelerated its dividend growth and expects solid growth in both the top line and the bottom line. This article takes a look at ADP's prospects going forward and why I believe that income investors should seriously consider adding this company to their watch list.Last quarter, ADP managed revenue growth of 8% with adjusted, diluted EPS growth of 14% year on year. Booking growth from new businesses was 6%; a sign that ADP is expanding its client base. Of that, employer services revenue grew 4% organically, with HR outsourcing services revenue growing 15%. Outlook for 2018 is looking similar. Management expects 7-8% revenue growth over the year, with HR outsourcing growing between 12% and 13%. New Business Bookings are expected to be up 5% to 7%.Client funds are also increasing, with average client funds growing by between 4% and 5% in 2018, and the 'yield' on client funds increasing by 20 basis points to 1.7% in fiscal 2017. This is a sign that 'clients' are becoming more profitable on average for ADP, and that the underlying businesses themselves are growing and hiring more people.Although there are many different variables that will affect ADP's business performance beyond 2018, I generally believe that revenue and earnings growth will accelerate in the years to come because of the company's successful and early move to a digitalized platform. All other things being equal, investors should expect ADP to gain share and accelerate earnings growth in the years to come.ADP is a cash generation machine. Much of that excess cash is being returned to shareholders in the form of share repurchases. For example, over the last twelve months, ADP generated $2.1 billion in operating cash flow. Of that, $1.65 billion was free cash flow. Of that free cash flow, ADP repurchased $1.2 billion worth of shares and paid another $995 million in dividends.To put that into ratios, the dividend is 60% of free cash flow, which is quite a nice cushion of safety. ADP only has about $2 billion in total debt, which comes out to a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of about 0.75 times. ADP has a very strong balance sheet.ADP is not cheap, and it has run up significantly over the last three years for good reason. ADP is a leader in the field of payroll solutions and HR outsourcing. Its system is implicitly relied upon by many of the biggest American companies; a platform rather difficult for any would-be competitor to replicate.ADP is also a solid dividend grower, and that growth is accelerating. For the three previous years, ADP only raised its dividend by 4%, 7%, and 8% respectively. Earlier this year ADP increased its dividend 9.5%. Currently, ADP yields a respectable 2.4%.Valuation wise, ADP is quite expensive no matter how you slice it. Over the last ten years, ADP has averaged 23.2 times earnings, but, today, shares trade at 28.4 times trailing earnings; a big premium of 22.4%. That is pretty expensive, and it is difficult to recommend ADP even with all the things this company has going for it.Dividend investors must be forward-looking, and ADP fits the bill of a company that is leading the way in the digital transformation. Shares are quite expensive right now, there can be no arguing that, and so it is difficult to recommend. However, I would recommend income investors pick this one up on any weakness, as this is exactly the type of company you'll want to own for years to come."

When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the Good Business Portfolio. Automatic Data Processing beats against the Dow baseline in my 52.0-month test compared to the Dow average. I chose the 52.0 month test period (starting January 1, 2014, and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2017, and other years that had fair and bad performance. The good total return of 82.00% makes Automatic Data Processing a great investment for the total return investor that also wants a steadily increasing income. ADP has an above average dividend yield of 2.3% and has had increases for 42 years, making ADP also a good choice for the dividend growth investor. The dividend was just increased in April 2018 to $0.69/Qtr. up from $0.63/Qtr. or a 10% increase.DOW's 52.0 Month total return baseline is 47.89%Click to enlargeFor the last quarter on May 2, 2018, Automatic Data Processing reported earnings that beat expected by $0.09 at $1.52, compared to last year at $1.31. Total revenue was higher at $3.69 Billion more than a year ago by 8.2% year over year and beat expected revenue by $20 Million. This was a great report with bottom line beating expected and the top line increasing with a good increase compared to last year. The next earnings report will be out August 2018 and is expected to be $0.87 compared to last year at $0.66 a good increase.Automatic Data Processing is one of the largest human resources companies in the United States and foreign countries.As per ReutersOverall Automatic Data Processing is a good business with 10% CAGR projected growth as the United States and foreign economies grow going forward, with the increasing demand for ADP's products. The good dividend income brings you cash as we continue to see further growth as the world economy grows. As interest rates rise so will ADP's earnings.The Fed has kept interest rates low for some years, and on March 21 they raised the base rate up 0.25%, which was expected. I believe that they will not raise the rates three more times this year, but will go slow at 1-2 for the rest of 2018, which should help keep the economy on a growth path. If infrastructure spending can be increased, this will even increase the United States growth going forward with better economics for the consumer. The recent market volatility may slow down the Fed.From May 2, 2018, earnings call Carlos A.

(KHC) that is 0.5% of the portfolio because of its bad performance, and I have better companies for investment. The last earnings showed growth, so I will wait another quarter to see if this continues.The Good Business Portfolio trims a position when it gets above 8% of the portfolio. The four top companies in The Good Business Portfolio are, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) is 8.0% of the portfolio, Altria (MO) is 6.8% of the portfolio, Home Depot (HD) is 9.5% of the portfolio and Boeing is 13.9% of the portfolio, therefore BA, JNJ, and Home Depot are now in trim position with Altria getting close.Boeing is going to be pressed to 13% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on 787 deferred plane costs at $316 Million in the first quarter of 2017, an increase from the fourth quarter. The second quarter saw deferred costs on the 787 go down $530 Million a big jump from the first quarter. The second quarter earnings were fantastic with Boeing beating the estimate by $0.25 at $2.55. The third quarter earnings were $2.72 beating the expected by$0.06 with revenue increasing 1.7% year over year another good report. The first quarter earnings for 2018 were unbelievable at $3.64 compared to expected at $2.64. I just can't bring myself to sell Boeing.JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because it's so defensive in this post-BREXIT world. Earnings in the last quarter beat on the top and bottom line and Mr. Market did not like it. JNJ has announced a dividend increase to $0.90/Qtr. which is 56 years in a row of increases. JNJ is not a trading stock but a hold forever; it is now a strong buy as the healthcare sector remains under pressure.

4165199,104172,2018-04-24T12:25:11-04:00,"Bill Ackman's activist fund Pershing Square initiated a large long position in Automatic Data Processing in 2017.Pershing's maneuvering has forced management into action, and several improvements have been promised.Despite ADP's tax rate being lowered and Pershing's pressure on management, the stock has remained stagnant awaiting a breakout from its current resistance.","Automatic Data Processing (ADP) is a AA-rated provider of human resources management software and services. The recent maneuverers by Bill Ackman's activist fund Pershing Square combined with the lowering of ADP's tax rate from 30.9% to 26.9% have turned ADP into a buy, as despite these positive tailwinds the stock price has remained stagnant despite warranting a strong breakout since September 2017:(Source: TradingView)When price breaks through the strong resistance that has formed at $119, I recommend entering a long position with a holding timeframe of at least 36 months to allow management to act on Pershing's ultimatum to boost revenue and margins.• ADP's group revenue increased 8% to $3.2 billion for the quarter, with 7% organic growth. Management has subsequently raised fiscal 2018 revenue growth outlook from 7% to 8%, with worldwide new business bookings increasing 6% for the quarter.• In January 2018, ADP acquired WorkMarket, a leader in cloud-based freelance management, for $125 million. This acquisition is an example of management being forced into action by Pershing, and in this instance resulted in a prudent move, as the composition of work is increasingly moving toward the freelance, or ""gig,"" worker and it is with this evolution in mind that ADP's acquisition makes sense. WorkMarket is leading provider of cloud-based freelance management solutions.With this acquisition, ADP has expanded its market opportunities while building on its current portfolio of industry-leading payroll and HCM solutions that help clients and workers modernize the way work gets done, while unlocking productivity, engagement, and growth. According to Jan Siegmund, ADP's chief financial officer:I expect results for the next several years to beat analyst estimates as margins are targeted by management (ADP’s Employer Services has net operational margins of 19%, while Paychex has net operational margins of 41%). Shareholders have been made aware of the need for action on margins due to Pershing Square's actions, and while it would be stretch to suggest margins be boosted to Paychex's level, there is strong room for improvement.Employer Services – Employer Services revenues increased 6%, with 4% organic growth compared to last years second quarter. The number of comparable employees on ADP clients' payrolls in the United States increased 2.6% while revenue retention declined 20 basis points compared to last year’s second quarter. Employer Services' margins decreased approximately 50 basis points q/q. This decrease was primarily due to increased acquisition activity and foreign currency movements.PEO Services – PEO Services revenues increased 15% q/q driven primarily by a 10% increase in the number of average worksite employees for the quarter and higher than expected growth in pass-through revenues. PEO Services segment margin declined approximately 30 basis points compared to last year’s second quarter (primarily driven by pressure from higher pass-through revenues). PEO services ended the quarter with 504,000 worksite employees.Here's management on the near-term outlook for the PEO Services segment, from the second-quarter earnings call transcript:Interest on Funds Held for Clients – Client funds are invested in accordance with ADP’s prudent and conservative investment guidelines and the credit quality of the investment portfolio is predominantly AAA/AA. As rates continue to rise, the revenue from this segment will increase. For the second quarter, interest on funds held for clients increased 16% to $107 million from $92 million a year ago. Average client funds balances increased 7% in the second quarter to $22.5 billion compared to $20.9 billion a year ago. For the second quarter, the average interest yield on client funds was 1.9% which was up 10 basis points compared to a year ago (this will increase as the Fed continues to rise rates this year, boosting this segment's revenue).Pershing Square/Bill Ackman has provided several avenues of growth for management to pursue in order to boost profitability and efficiency. ADP’s labor productivity trails competitors by over 25% (ADP's average revenue per employee is $161,000 versus $223,000 for competitors). ADP’s Employer Services has net operational margins of 19%, while Paychex has net operational margins of 41% (35% of Employer Services revenue is directly comparable to Paychex).As such there is a lot of room for improvement from a management team that has been satisfied with resting on its laurels for several years, allowing competitors to gain advantages in both market share and releasing superior platforms. The actions of Pershing have finally forced management into action, as shareholders' attention has been drawn to the company's laggard performance in recent times. In order to keep Pershing's board takeover bid from succeeding, ADP’s existing board/management have made a number of important commitments to shareholders, the three most significant of which are:Bill Ackman said in November in an email to investors:While such actions might cause investors to shy away from a company due to management disruptions and the risks that poses, I believe that this outcome is unlikely, as Ackman has made peaceful overtures (following defeat) on several occasions. Again, from the November email:ADP now anticipates full-year fiscal 2018 revenue growth of 7% to 8% compared to the prior forecast of 6% to 8%. This revenue forecast continues to include approximately one percentage point of growth from acquisitions and the impact from foreign currency movements. Adjusting for additional anticipated PEO pass-through pressure, ADP now assumes adjusted EBIT margin will decline approximately 50 basis points for the full year compared to the prior forecast of -25 to -50 basis points.ADP has a healthy history of dividend distribution increases, keeping its yield consistent throughout the last 10 years, yielding 2.5% pa on average:(Source: StreetInsider Dividend History)ADP's growth has been steady over the last 5 years, with growth recently picking up due to increased investment activity by management in large part due to the actions of Pershing Square (as discussed):(Source: Yahoo Finance)There is still major room for improvement in reducing expenses and increasing product margins as detailed by Bill Ackman, and I expect to see management strive to improve performance in these areas or face hostile shareholders driven to action by Ackman.In my opinion, having an activist fund as a major shareholder is a major net positive for shareholders in this instance, as poor management is held to account for their lack of initiative. In the words of Ackman, “We are rooting for the company.”I recommend holding a long position with a timeframe of over 3 years, as management's planned changes will take time to implement and filter through into returns for shareholders."
4164671,63883,2018-04-22T18:53:25-04:00,"Automatic Data Processing has enormous competitive advantages and multiple growth catalysts.
        ADP has increased its dividend for 40+ years. In the past year, ADP has increased its dividend twice, for total dividend growth of 20%+.
        ADP is a high-growth Dividend Aristocrat.","By Bob CiuraStocks that have long histories of dividend increases might be associated with bloated, slow-growing companies. Dividend-paying stocks might not be the most exciting to own, but they aren’t all lumbering giants. Several of the Dividend Aristocrats, which have increased their dividends for 25+ consecutive years, still raise their dividends at very high rates each year. You can see all 53 Dividend Aristocrats here.Automatic Data Processing (ADP) is one of the highest-growth Dividend Aristocrats. Not only has ADP raised its dividend for 40+ years in a row, but it has increased its dividend twice in the past year. First, ADP increased its quarterly dividend by 10.5% on 11/7/17. It increased its dividend again on 4/11/18, by 9.5%. Taken together, the company has increased its quarterly dividend by 21% in the past year.ADP does not have a high current yield, but it is a very strong dividend growth company.ADP is a business outsourcing services company. It was founded in 1949, and began with a single client. In the nearly 70 years since, ADP has grown into the leading payroll and human resource outsourcing company, with approximately 700,000 clients worldwide.Source: 2017 Investor Presentation, page 3ADP has two business segments:ADP provides services including payroll, benefits administration, and human resources management, to companies of all sizes. ADP enjoys high demand for these services, as companies would prefer to outsource these functions, to better focus on their core business activities. It also earns interest on funds held for its clients, which works as a nice additional revenue stream. ADP has a highly diversified client list. No single customer represents more than 2% of annual revenue.The company has undergone a significant restructuring in recent years. In 2014, ADP spun off its human capital management business, which now trades as CDK Global (CDK). It reshaped its business model to place greater emphasis on helping clients streamline their business functions, by investing in cloud-based software. The restructuring has served the company well, through higher growth rates. For example, in fiscal 2017, ADP’s total revenue increased 6%, to $12.4 billion. Excluding the impact of currency exchange, organic revenue increased 7% for the year. The company has continued to grow to start fiscal 2018.Two key growth catalysts for ADP are continued increases in payrolls, and regulation. First, as the economy continues to grow at a modest rate, businesses are adding employees. The number of employees on ADP clients' payrolls in the U.S. increased by 2.4% in fiscal 2017. Strong employment gains have continued in 2018. ADP’s employment report for March showed a 241,000 increase in non-farm private employment. Next, the increasingly complex regulatory environment creates significant compliance costs for businesses.These growth catalysts have helped ADP continue its positive momentum in the current fiscal year. On 1/31/18 ADP reported strong fiscal second-quarter earnings results. Source: Earnings Presentation, page 4Revenue of $3.24 billion rose 8.4% year-over-year, and beat analyst estimates by $60 million. Adjusted earnings-per-share of $0.99 beat by $0.09, or 10%. Earnings-per-share increased 14% from the same quarter a year ago.Employer Services and PEO Services revenue increased 4% and 15%, respectively, last quarter. Helping to boost growth this year is the January acquisition of WorkMarket, a leader in cloud-based freelance management. This is a savvy acquisition to enter a growing corner of the U.S. employment market, which is freelance workers.Not only did ADP handily beat analyst expectations for the most recent quarter, but the company also raised its full-year forecast. ADP now expects fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings-per-share growth of 12% to 13%. Revenue is expected to increase 7% to 8% for 2018.Source: Earnings Presentation, page 6ADP’s growth is fueled by its competitive advantages, of which it has many. ADP has a deep connection with its customers, and it enjoys a strong reputation for customer service. This helps keep customer retention very high. ADP enjoys tremendous scale, that its competitors cannot match. As a global company, ADP is uniquely positioned to help companies that have employees on multiple continents.Compared with 2017 adjusted earnings-per-share of $3.70, ADP expects 12% to 14% growth for 2018. As a result, fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings-per-share are likely to be in a range of $4.14 to $4.22. At the midpoint of this range, ADP stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 27.8. In the past 10 years, ADP stock held an average price-to-earnings ratio of 21.9. This is a fairly rich valuation, but not altogether surprising for a high-growth, industry-leading business.Source: ValueLineThe stock appears to be fairly valued, meaning investors are not likely to see continued expansion of the price-to-earnings ratio as a driver of shareholder returns. That said, returns will still be generated by earnings growth and dividends. The good news is, the company is growing at a high rate, meaning returns can still be quite satisfactory. A potential breakdown of future returns is as follows:In this forecast, total returns would reach 10%-12% per year, including dividends. This is a strong rate of return, assuming the price-to-earnings ratio remains constant. If the valuation multiple declines from current levels, it would reduce annual returns for the stock.ADP’s dividend is highly secure, with room for future increases. With the recent dividend increase, ADP’s forward annualized dividend payout is $2.76 per share. This represents a current yield of 2.3%, which is at least above the average yield for the S&P 500 Index. And, ADP consistently raises its dividend at high rates, meaning investors’ yield on cost will rise quickly.Source: 2017 Investor Presentation, page 8The forward annual payout of $2.76 represents a dividend payout ratio of approximately 65%. This is near the company’s stated target dividend payout ratio, and leaves plenty of room for continued dividend growth, particularly if earnings-per-share keep rising at a high rate.ADP is a strong business. The company maintains a large list of customers, and it holds a top position in the industry. This gives it a wide economic “moat”, a term popularized by investing legend Warren Buffett, to demonstrate a company’s durable competitive advantages.Indeed, ADP’s moat keeps competitors at bay, and leads to high profitability. There should be plenty of growth going forward, both in terms of earnings, as well as dividends. The U.S. economy is growing, meaning employers continue to add jobs. ADP is not a deeply undervalued stock, but it is still a good choice for steady dividend growth."
4144826,65113,2018-02-08T17:10:13-05:00,"Automatic Data Processing pays a relatively low dividend yield compared to other ""Dividend Aristocrats.""While Q2 2018 earnings were up, lower taxes were a significant contributor to this.For dividend investors, I'm of the opinion that better options exist at this point in time.","In my previous article on Automatic Data Processing (ADP), I made the argument that while the company has very favourable characteristics as a dividend aristocrat, the stock is simply too expensive and an investor would be better off waiting for a lower price before jumping in.Specifically, I ran a dividend discount model to argue that even with an assumed 10% growth rate per annum in dividends and earnings, this would lead to little over a 1% annualized rate of return.In this regard, I advised that investors should wait until the price dips below $100, or unless free cash flow growth increases to a level significantly above 10% per year.Since December, we have seen the stock rise to the $120 level, before reverting back to $113.56 at the time of writing:Source: investing.comThis stock currently has an annualized payout of $2.52 and a current dividend yield of 2.22%. To get a yield of 3% on this stock, ADP would need to trade at $84 on the current payout. If we were to assume that ADP’s dividend grows by 10% over the next year, and price were to remain at the current level, then a payout of $2.77 would mean a yield of 2.44% at the current price of $113.56.Given that it is highly unlikely we would see a price drop down to a level of $84, a higher dividend yield is highly dependent on the dividend payout increasing. Over the past five years, we see that the growth in yield has been 44.83%, giving an average of 8.96% per year:Now, let’s compare Automatic Data Processing to yields being offered on some other dividend aristocrats (ones that have a record of raising dividend payments for 25 years or more):From a dividend standpoint, this stock may not be as attractive as once thought.Looking at ADP’s Q2 fiscal 2018 reveals a couple of interesting insights.For instance, let’s look at the breakdown of EBIT margin and diluted EPS for 2Q FY18 and 2Q FY17. Technically speaking, the adjusted diluted EPS is up by 13% on a constant dollar basis. However, we see that the adjusted EBIT margin is down by 1.2% over this period. It is notable that the provision for income taxes in 2Q FY18 accounted for 21%, while it accounted for 54% in 2Q FY17.Source: 2Q Fiscal 2018: ADP Earnings Call & WebcastI interpret this to mean that the gain in diluted EPS can be attributed to tax savings rather than organic earnings growth per se, and hence the reason we are seeing lower margins.Moreover, we also see that margins for both Employer and PEO services are down by 50 and 30 basis points respectively:Source: 2Q Fiscal 2018: ADP Earnings Call and WebcastWhile revenue growth for Employer Services had been slowing (as more and more companies outsource their HR processes by forming a co-employment situation with ADP), we have seen that margins for PEO services also have come under pressure on the margin front, and with Client Revenue Retention also having dropped for Employment Services, a continued drop in margin on the PEO side could end up hurting performance.If you already own ADP, I don’t necessarily think this stock is a sell per se. The company continues to perform well on the earnings front, and while margins are coming under pressure, it is possible that this could be a one-off. However, there are better offers available as far as dividend yields go. For this company to offer a substantially higher yield, price would either need to drop significantly or ADP would need to grow dividend payments at a rate higher than 10%, of which neither scenario is particularly likely."

It clearly is not.","I'm a sucker for a good entrepreneur story. The idea that someone could start a business in their basement and have it become the next great American company, or that someone could be fed up with their job, cobble together a few dollars and start a project in their off-hours that replaces their income from ""The Man"" is so romantic and inspiring.In my personal taste, one doesn't have to cure cancer for it to be viable or respectable. As Chris Guillebeau has taught us, a perfectly reasonable side income can be had making saddles for chickens.Such was the case in 1971. B. Thomas Golisano took his idea of payroll processing for companies with under 100 employees to his employer Electronic Accounting Systems, Inc. as an idea to expand their business, the ""outside the box"" thinking that corporations always stress. They rejected him twice. So with $3,000 of his own money, he left the company to start Paymaster.He took out loans, borrowed money from friends, and charged credit cards in the beginning. But by 2000, Paychex (PAYX) had surpassed Eastman Kodak (NYSE:KODK), Bausch & Lomb, and Xerox (NYSE:XRX) to become Rochester, NY's most valuable company. Moreover, in the nearly five decades since its founding, Paychex has delivered steady and almost predictable revenue growth for stakeholders.From those humble beginnings, Paychex now serves ~600,000 clients, providing payroll, insurance, human resources, and retirement options to small and midsize businesses predominantly in the United States.Golisano is not at the helm anymore. He moved to Florida, married Monica Seles, and donates an inordinate amount of time and energy to philanthropy. But what he has left is a company worthy of our consideration.I am a dividend growth investor in my retirement portfolio. And as such, Paychex is a cute story, but the elephant in the room is a simple question: why not just invest in Automatic Data Processing (ADP) instead? It is quite a bit larger than Paychex by market cap ($52 billion vs. $22 billion), has a larger and more diversified client base, and ADP has increased its dividend over three decades longer than PAYX. It would seem to be not much of a contest. Here is my rationale for going the other way.Addressable MarketWhile Paychex makes their bones in the small (10-50 employees) and medium (50-1000) sized business space, ADP has no problem going after those, plus multinational corporations. As a result, ADP is responsible for cutting the payroll check for roughly 1 out of every 6 workers in the United States and 13 million workers worldwide. In addition, they offer wage collection and remittance in the U.S., Canada, the U.K., Australia, France, China, India, and the Netherlands, and offer products in more than 110 countries.By contrast, Paychex by design has long been predominantly a U.S. story that has just started writing international pages. Even though they've had a presence in Germany for the past ten years, it has never proven material to earnings. However, with the March announcement of the acquisition of Lessor Group from a Nordic private equity firm, Paychex is getting a 46-year old HR company with presence in Germany, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Though it will only account for 1% payroll revenue initially, the optionality is certainly there to gradually become a bigger piece of the pie.In my view Paychex has the longer runway ahead of it. And though revenue growth is acceptable at both companies, the dwarfing size of ADP means that barring a tie in 2014 Paychex has already exceeded ADP in revenue growth every year since 2013.Margins and ReturnsNot only is Paychex holding their own in growing their top line vs. ADP, they're having to spend less of their money in order to do it. For the last decade now, Paychex has simply been the cheaper operator.As a result, a higher percentage of Paychex's revenue makes it down to the bottom line and by extension, back into the business or available to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. Consistently ~$.25 of every dollar of revenue makes it to Paychek's bottom line, verses $.12-.14 for ADP. If revenue growth continues, over time this discrepancy will prove meaningful.What emerges then is that Paychex more than holds its own with ADP in actual returns on shareowners' equity.Moreover, Paychex has been able to do this without taking on any long-term debt. As a result, Paychex consistently dwarfs ADP in its return on assets already in the business and the capital that gets invested in it.With my time horizon, these latter three numbers are the ones I care the most about. As a shareholder, some of the equity will be my own, and time and again Paychex has shown the ability to be a more than sufficient steward of shareholder capital.BusybodiesBack in olden times, activist investors took meaningful positions in dumpster fire situations, with the hopes that any improvement would result in outsize returns. That appears to be passé, as progressively shorter time frames for demanded returns makes it untenable to wait for those situations to positively develop. The new model appears to be taking over mediocre, suboptimal or simply good situations in the hopes that a few minor tweaks can increase performance.Wendy's (WEN), Cracker Barrel (CBRL), Darden Restaurants (DRI), Pepsi (PEP), among others, are companies that have felt the hands of activist investors in recent years to varying results - not to mention the fiasco over at Procter & Gamble (PG). Unfortunately ADP is also on this list.This isn't to say that this automatically makes ADP an inferior investment. Pepsi was and is perfectly deserving of investing dollars, and was able to rebuff their encounter with activists - including the idiotic idea of divesting its snack business. However, the risk for ADP is that dealing with well-heeled investors with an eye on the shorter-term will cause management to make decisions that will compromise the long-term health of the business.About that StreakThere is no denying that ADP has the more enviable dividend growth track record. 7 looks terrible next to 43. Paychex floundered in the Great Recession. Exiting founder Golisano and the arriving (September) CEO Martin Mucci made the decision in 2010 to freeze the dividend at the 2009 level. Had this not occurred, Paychex's streak would not be 7 but 30, as they otherwise have increased their dividend every year since establishing one in 1988.Moreover, Paychex's dividend growth rate has come more in line with ADP's venerable record in recent years.Though in the interest of full disclosure, ADP's dividend continues to be better covered by free cash flow. However, any percentage under 75% is perfectly acceptable.There are a couple of industry risks associated with both ADP and Paychex. First, both companies cite the risk of the Affordable Care Act being repealed as having a negative effect on their business. Both companies have spent much manpower and headspace walking current and new clients through the complexities of complying with the new regulations. To have to roll all of that back due to a repeal is an understandable worry.In my view this will not happen. Regardless of party, the political class is predominantly concerned with self-preservation. Campaign and political rhetoric aside, to be on record as voting against health insurance for the most vulnerable of Americans will not be good optics come reelection time. That nothing happens, or that it remains the law of the land with a few tweaks around the edges is exponentially more likely.Second, and more germane, is the volatility that a downturn in the economy would play. ADP and Paychex are at the forefront of both economic expansion and contraction. While it is true that small and medium-sized businesses are responsible for most of the new hires in this country, they also are more volatile. ADP has built-in protection in that the corporation side of their customer demographic is relatively more stable in economic downturns. This is a protection that Paychex does not have (which explains their disparate performances during the Great Recession).Third and most pressing to Paychex is good ol'-fashioned competition. ADP and Paychex are the Coke (NYSE:KO) and Pepsi of the human capital management business. The width of their moats is based on their ability to provide a veritable panoply of products for their clients - payroll, retirement, insurance, etc. - better than the other. Once the tentacles are in, the pain in switching providers is often prohibitive, but not impossible.2017 saw a modest step back in existing revenue retention for Paychex after a company record 2016. Though reliance on bigger clients may skew the numbers towards ADP a tad, and even though retention at ADP has decreased for two years in a row, ADP's existing revenue retention is still ~90%, 9% higher than Paychex's. Tightening the screws on this will undoubtedly lead to even more pressure on ADP.Paychex is not quite breathing down ADP's neck but in my view it has already begun to close in. They are better managers of shareholder capital (though ADP could never be called a slouch). However, their stock prices appear as though the gap between them is much wider.PAYX PE Ratio (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsIn practical terms, from Friday's close, if Paychex closed at ADP's TTM PE multiple, the stock price would have been 21% higher. Frankly I don't think there's that much of a gap between the two companies. Over time I would expect it to converge.Automatic Data Processing is perfectly worthy of investment - and for the ""well-seasoned"" investor, the case could be made that it is the more desirable of the two. However, my time horizon is such that chunks of my retirement portfolio must be focused on ""next"" and not ""now"". Paychex is the better operator, the better steward of shareowner capital, and although ADP's dividend track record is easily the more desirable of the two, ""past performance is not a guarantee of future results"". The disclosure will show that I don't have any intention of buying Paychex in the next 72 hours. However, it is only because I don't currently have the cash to do so. It will be in my retirement portfolio when I can remedy that.If you found value here, make sure to follow me to get future updates.

(NASDAQ:ADP). Over the past decade, the dividend yield on this stock has bounced between 2% and 4% – not enough to knock the socks off of most income investors.But by focusing on an upfront payout alone, yield hogs would have missed a great run. Through the 10 year period ended January 31, ADP stock has delivered a total return – including dividends – of 350%. That number crushed the 105% return from the broader market over the same timeframe.You can’t invest on historical numbers, of course. Investors, though, have good reason to believe ADP will continue to crank out solid returns. I can’t say what the share price will do over the next quarter or two – it's had a big run lately and we could see some profit-taking. But over the long haul, owners should get paid nicely.Here's why:ADP pays one of the safest dividends around, first off.The company has built a wide economic moat around its business through massive scale. And because switching payroll processors represents a big hassle, management can pass on price hikes each year.Most of these profits go straight to investors. ADP has paid distributions without interruption for decades, delivering 43 years of consecutive dividend increases. Last year's bump came in at 10.5%, signaling management has a lot of confidence in the future.Today, ADP stands in good financial shape. The stock’s 60% payout ratio is low compared to peers, leaving management with plenty of wiggle room to stomach a down year or two. The company’s balance sheet is arguably underleveraged (almost no long-term debt), especially given the business’s annuity-like profits and ample free cash flow.That payout will likely keep growing, too.With the U.S. economy shooting the lights out, employers need to spend more money on managing their staff. The company stands to benefit from new hires and an expanding labor pool.Moreover, ADP’s customer base is ripe for cross-selling. Management has pushed a wide suit of services over the years, helping businesses navigate changing regulations.Not only does selling new products boost profits, but they tend to tie customers down to a single business. In the same way Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) locks you into their ecosystem with each song downloaded, ADP becomes intertwined with the businesses they serve. Over time, this makes it easier to raise prices at or above the rate of inflation.Through the past five years, ADP has increased adjusted earnings per share at a 10% compounded annual clip. That growth looks sustainable going forward, thanks to higher revenues, operating leverage, and other cost cutting measures. And given the company’s reputation as one of the best dividend stocks on the market, I have little doubt most of those profits will get paid out to owners.ADP Dividend data by YChartsThe combination of a modest upfront payout and growing dividend should translate into respectable returns.At today’s price, ADP yield 2.1%. Add the prospect of 10% to 12% dividend growth for many years to come, and our total return potential hits the low-teens.Those numbers aren’t set in stone, of course. A sharp drop in total employment would clip profits. Investors also need to consider the direction of interest rates. If yields drop, ADP would earn less float income on the funds it holds for clients.No doubt the company will have a bad year or two over the next few decades. I suspect, however, that ADP will make substantially more money (and pay out substantially more dividends) 20 years from now. And investors skipping over this stock for its tiny yield today might be kicking themselves later."

Automatic Data Processing is one of the largest human resources products and services companies in the world. ADP is a conservative investment for the income investor who also wants good growth potential with rising interest rates.Automatic Data Processing is 4.89% of The Good Business Portfolio. The company has steady growth and has cash it uses to increase the dividends each year. I have started reviewing the companies in The Good Business Portfolio starting with the highest percentage of the portfolio and working down. This is the eighth article of the series. These eight companies plus Enton Value Enhanced Equity Income Fund II (EOS), Omega HealthCare Investors (OHI) and Texas Instruments (TXN) comprise 81.56% of the portfolio. EOS, OHI, and TXN will be reviewed in this series at the end since not much new news has come out since my last report.In scanning the five-year chart, I see Automatic Data Processing has a good chart going up and to the right in a strong slope. This is the kind of chart I like to see. In a good economy, ADP really shines, as in 2013 and in 2017 to date.ADP data by YChartsFundamentals of Automatic Data Processing will be reviewed on the following topics below.I use a set of guidelines that I codified over the last few years to review the companies in The Good Business Portfolio (my portfolio) and other companies that I am taking a look at. For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article "" The Good Business Portfolio: Update To Guidelines and July 2016 Performance Review"". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return and growing companies that hopefully keeps me ahead of the Dow average.Good Business Portfolio Guidelines.Automatic Data Processing International passes 11 of 11 Good Business Portfolio Guideline, a good score (a good score is 10 or 11). These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. Some of the points brought out by the guidelines are shown below.Total Return and Yearly DividendThe Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the Good Business Portfolio. Automatic Data Processing passes this total return guideline against the Dow baseline in my 59.0-month test. I chose the 59.0 month test period (starting January 1, 2013, and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2013, and other years that had fair and bad performance. The good total return of 114.70% makes Automatic Data Processing a good investment for the total return investor that also wants a steadily increasing income. ADP has an above average dividend yield of 2.13% and has had increases for 42 years making ADP also a good choice for the dividend investor. The Dividend has just been increased in November 2017 to $0.63/Qtr. from $0.57/ Qtr. or a 10.5% increase.DOW's 59.0 Month total return baseline is 87.02%Click to enlargeLast Quarter's EarningsFor the last quarter on November 2, 2017, Automatic Data Processing reported earnings that beat expected by $0.06 at $0.91 and compared to last year at $0.86. Total revenue was higher at $3.08 billion up more than a year ago by 5.5% year over year and beat expected revenue by $20 million. This was a good report with the bottom line and the top line increasing. The next earnings report will be out late January 2018 and is expected to be $0.90 compared to last year at $0.87, a fair increase. The strong dollar is hurting ADP's foreign earnings.The graphic below shows the growth potential for ADP next year.Source: ADP earnings call slidesBusiness OverviewAutomatic Data Processing is one of the largest human resources companies in the United States and foreign countries.As per Reuters,Overall Automatic Data Processing International is a good business with 10% CAGR projected growth as the United States and foreign economies grow going forward, with the increasing demand for ADP's products. The good dividend income brings you cash as we continue to see further growth as the world economy grows. As interest rates rise so will ADP's earnings.Also as a tailwind, we have President Trump wanting to lower corporate taxes on income. As the corporation foreign and domestic tax rate is lowered, earnings of Automatic Data Processing business should increase.The economy is showing moderate economic growth right now (about 2.9%), and the FED has raised rates in December 2017, with future rate increases dependent on the United States economy and inflation. The FED projects for more increases in 2018 depending on inflation. I feel the Fed is going slowly; they don't want to trigger a slowdown in the economy.From October 24, 2017, earnings call Carlos A. Rodriguez (chief executive officer and president) said:The graphic below sums up the CEO's outlook.Source: ADP earnings call slidesThis shows the feelings of top management for the continued growth of the Automatic Data Processing business and shareholder return with an increase in the future growth. ADP has good growth and will continue as the foreign economies grow and demand for human resource products and services increase.TakeawaysAutomatic Data Processing is a good investment choice for the total return investor with its above average dividend yield and high total return investor. Automatic Data Processing is 4.89% of The Good Business Portfolio and will be held and watch it grow. ADP will be held in the portfolio and will be trimmed when it reaches 8% of the portfolio. If you want a growing dividend income and good total return in the data processing business ADP may be the right investment for you.Recent Portfolio ChangesThe Good Business Portfolio trims a position when it gets above 8% of the portfolio. The four top positions in The Good Business Portfolio are, Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) is 8.8% of the portfolio, Altria (MO) is 7.0% of the portfolio, Home Depot (HD) is 9.1% of portfolio and Boeing is 11.3% of the portfolio, therefore BA, JNJ, and Home Depot are now in trim position with Altria getting close.Boeing is going to be pressed to 11% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on 787 deferred plane costs at $316 million in the first quarter, an increase from the fourth quarter. The second quarter saw deferred costs on the 787 go down $530 Million a big jump from the first quarter. The second quarter earnings were fantastic with Boeing beating the estimate by $0.25 at $2.55. The third quarter earnings were $2.72 beating the expected by $0.06 with revenue increasing 1.7% year over year another good report. S&P CFRA raised its one-year target to $272.JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because it's so defensive in this post-BREXIT world. Earnings in the last quarter beat on the top and bottom line and Mr. Market did like the growth going forward. JNJ is not a trading stock but a hold forever.For the total Good Business Portfolio, please see my article on The Good Business Portfolio: 2017 3rd Quarter Earnings and Performance Review for the complete portfolio list and performance.

4129690,65113,2017-12-05T09:08:29-05:00,"Automatic Data Processing (ADP) has shown significant growth in its main business segments.However, the stock is approaching a level where further price increases can no longer be sustained at the current growth rate.I would look for a price below $100 to get in on this stock.","Back in a previous article, I made the assertion that Automatic Data Processing (ADP) has significantly more room left to run despite the run-up in price. Specifically, I argued that the company remains at a good valuation on an earnings basis, and that the company's competitive advantage in Employer and PEO services will serve it well going forward.In this article, I would like to delve deeper into the valuation aspect. A notable observation last time was that while price was rising, the P/E ratio itself was remaining stationary at a range of 27-29; i.e. the growth in price was being matched if not outpaced by the growth in earnings.Here, I run a Dividend Discount Model in order to determine the potential upside that ADP has on a five-year basis.My assumptions:- I am using the current P/E ratio of 28.87x as the terminal P/E ratio for this analysis.- In line with average performance on a 5 and 10-year basis, I am assuming a 10% yearly growth in dividends and earnings per share.- A 7% discount rate is used as a proxy for the minimum yearly annual return I would expect for holding shares of ADP.From the above, we see that at a target price of $118.64, this represents little under 7% upside from the current price, even when taking dividends into account.Therefore, according to this model, even if growth in dividends and earnings continues at an average of 10% per year, this means little upside for ADP at the current price.In this regard, my assumption regarding the P/E ratio last time may have been inaccurate. Instead, it appears that while the P/E ratio has been growing, there is a limit to which the current rate of growth in earnings can sustain further price increases.Now, for long-term dividend investors, should price be an overwhelming consideration here? After all, such investors are looking to buy such a stock for its cash flow through dividends. In this regard, let's look at a potential valuation on a free cash flow basis.When we look at free cash flow per share over a 10-year basis, we see an average growth of just over 8% per year:Assuming that this is rounded up to 10%, let us now see what a potential annual return based on discounted cash flows would look like.- I am using a rough 10-year median of 26x as the price/free cash flow ratio.- Again, I assume a discount rate of 7% and project 10% growth in free cash flow per year.- The calculations are similar to the above, only dividends are not being included and free cash flow is being discounted instead of earnings.With the assumed rate of free cash flow growth, the following target price and return is yielded:My previous article outlined that ADP has a distinct competitive advantage given its degree of relationships with the world's largest companies and its capacity to utilise big data to significantly maximise employee value.Notably, PEO (Professional Employer Organisation) services have significantly outpaced growth in Employer Services - where the HR function is effectively outsourced to ADP rather than simply providing certain products and services to assist in the in-house process.In this regard, while PEO has continued double-digit growth, that of Employer Services has been steadily falling, having come in at 3% in Q4 2016.However, while outsourcing has been on the rise across HR departments, it is not necessarily a given that this trend will necessarily continue. Instead, it is more likely that a ""mix and match"" approach will increasingly be adopted, as organisations wish to retain control of functions that significantly add business value - such as talent recruitment.In this regard, there remains a risk that ADP might remain attractive for HR outsourcing purposes from a cost standpoint, but organisations that wish to outsource a select few functions might go to competitors such as Oracle (ORCL), SAP (SAP), or Workday (WDAY) if it is perceived that doing so can offer more flexibility in this regard. Moreover, Employer Services still accounts for over three-quarters of the total revenue for ADP, so a slowdown here could still hurt overall growth.Overall, we see that on both an earnings basis and free cash flow basis, the yearly upside for ADP is limited. While I see growth continuing for ADP, the stock is reaching a point where a 10% annual growth rate can no longer sustain further price increases. In this regard, we would need to see a pullback in price to $100 before we would start to see a near 7% return per year on a free cash flow basis. Therefore, I'll be keeping my eye on ADP, but won't buy the stock unless I see 1) a dip in price below $100, or 2) an acceleration of growth in free cash flow significantly above 10% per year. Moreover, while I still see the company continuing to dominate the field of HR for the foreseeable future, a continued slowdown in Employer Services growth would leave me concerned."
4163492,21544,2018-04-17T12:02:43-04:00,"As part of my monitoring process, I review the list of dividend increases every week.I use this exercise to monitor performance on existing holdings, and also to uncover hidden gems for further research.In the past week, there were several companies on my watchlist, which raised their dividends to shareholders.I review each company's raise, along with a brief check of fundamentals and valuation.","As part of my monitoring process I review the list of dividend increases every single week. I use this exercise to check on the health of companies I own. I also check the list of dividend increases as part of my overall monitoring of companies I am reviewing for potential addition to my dividend portfolio.I do find it helpful to narrow the list down by focusing only on the companies that have raised distributions every single year for at least a decade. Next, I tried to discuss each company and provide some helpful stats in order to determine if they look promising under certain circumstances.The fact that a company that has raised dividends for a decade is just the first step in the process for further research. Making sure that those dividend increases are as a result of improving fundamentals is important. Equally important is making sure that the dividend company in question is also attractively valued.Over the past week, there were four companies that raised dividends to their shareholders. Each one of those companies has managed to boost distributions for at least ten years in a row. The companies include:The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) provides branded consumer packaged)goods to consumers in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico, Europe, the Asia Pacific, Greater China, Latin America, India, the Middle East, and Africa.Procter & Gamble increased quarterly dividend by 4% to $0.7172 per share. This marks the 62nd consecutive year that this dividend king has increased its dividend. P&G has been paying a dividend for 128 consecutive years. The ten year dividend growth rate is 7.20%/year.However, as was discussed in my last analysis of Procter & Gamble, the company has been unable to grow earnings per share since 2008. Therefore, the dividend payout ratio has been increasing steadily over the past decade. Furthermore, the rate of annual dividend increases has been decelerating, as the payout ratio is close to reaching its upper limit. As a result, future dividend growth will be harder to come up. Therefore, while the stock seems fairly valued 18.70 times forward earnings and a dividend yield of 3.70, the lack of earnings growth and the high forward payout ratio at 68% make this company a hold. I will continue holding on to my existing P&G, waiting for a turnaround. However, the dividends will be allocated elsewhere.Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD) provides midstream energy services to producers and consumers of natural gas, natural gas liquids (NGLs), crude oil, petrochemicals, and refined products. The company operates through four segments: NGL Pipelines & Services, Crude Oil Pipelines & Services, Natural Gas Pipelines & Services, and Petrochemical & Refined Products Services.Enterprise Products Partners raised its quarterly distribution to $0.4275/unit, a 3% increase over distribution paid this time last year. This is 55th consecutive quarterly distribution increase for Enterprise, which has rewarded partners with a raise for 20 years in a row. The ten year distribution growth is 5.70%/year. This dividend achiever is one of the better managed partnerships out there (the other being Magellan Midstream Partners). I like the fact that it does have some margin of safety in its distributions coverage from DCF. However, as I have alluded before, the pass-through business model is more exposed when things get tough due to the needs for constant access to capital markets for growth. That being said, an investor looking for high current income may find the 6.60% distribution yield appetizing enough for some exposure to the partnership.Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (ADP) provides business process outsourcing services worldwide. The company operates through two segments, Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization (NYSE:PEO) Services.Automatic Data Processing raised quarterly dividends by 9.50% to $0.69/share. This dividend aristocrat has a 43 year track record of annual dividend increases. The Board of Directors is also considering another hike in November (consistent with historical pattern of dividend hikes). The ten year dividend growth rate is 11%/year. I like the growth in earnings over the past decade for ADP. In addition, I like their business model. Unfortunately, the stock has been overvalued for quite some time, while compounding earnings and dividends for shareholders. Right now ADP is selling at 27.60 times forward earnings and yields 2.40%. I would be interested in adding to my stock there on dips below $84/share (equivalent to a forward P/E below 20).Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. (SKT), is a publicly-traded REIT headquartered in Greensboro, North Carolina that presently operates and owns, or has an ownership interest in, a portfolio of 44 upscale outlet shopping centers.Tanger's Board of Directors approved a 2.2% increase in the annual dividend on its common shares from $1.37 per share to $1.40 per share. Tanger is a dividend champion which has increased its dividend for 25th consecutive years. The ten year dividend growth rate is 6.70%/year.The latest dividend increase certainly is on the low side, and it signifies the challenges in the retail industry today. Those challenges could impact portfolio occupancy, and from there impact rental income and FFO. That being said, Tanger is selling at a low valuation today of 9.30 times forward FFO. In addition, the REIT yields 6.60% today. The FFO forward payout ratio is 57.60%, which is sustainable and leaves a margin of error even if things deteriorate further from here.The low valuation is the reason I have bought some shares as they have been sliding over the past year. While I do want growing earnings over time (or in the case of REITS - growing FFO/share), I do understand that a low valuation can result in great performance over time. The potential investor in Tanger today is getting paid 6.60% to hold on to a quality REIT, with a margin of safety in distribution coverage of 57.60% based on FFO/share. At that valuation, the REIT needs to grow only by 2% -3%/year to generate a total return of 10%/year. Today we reviewed four companies that have raised dividends for at least a decade. We checked the latest dividend increase, and also the number of consecutive annual dividend increases. We then evaluated the dividend increase relative to the history of dividend increases and fundamentals. This is a monitoring exercise that I perform on a weekly basis in order to check my portfolio holdings, as well as companies I am interested in at the right valuation."

The battle between Bill Ackman and Automatic Data Processing (ADP) has ended in defeat for Ackman whose agenda failed to be adopted by shareholders. The announcement of Ackman’s stake in ADP sent shares flying and despite the defeat, the share price has remained near that peak. Has Ackman’s influence pushed the stock price beyond its fair value? Time to take a look.ADP’s current price to earnings ratio is 29.7 which appears to be elevated but not far from its usual range according to the company’s 5-year PE history. Several times ADP reached this value or slightly higher and then subsequently retreated possibly suggesting that at those levels ADP is overvalued.Source: YChartsYCharts reports that the 5-year average is 26.4 while Gurufocus.com shows that ADP’s 10-year median PE ratio is 18.8. The industry median is 22.6x while the market is 24.9x. These indicators suggest that ADP is currently overvalued compared to its historical norms, the industry and the market.The earnings yield is a quick method to determine the valuation of a stock. You can learn more about it here. A value below 6% means that the stock is considered overvalued. In the case of ADP, the TTM EPS is $3.97 and the current price is $117.13 which equates to an earnings yield of 3.39% suggesting the stock is overvalued.The infographic below further shows that ADP’s PEG ratio is 1.9x which is considered poor value based on next year’s expected growth and that its price to book ratio which is 13.1x is overvalued based on its assets when compared to the business software and services industry average and the market. Furthermore, the P/FCF is 25.32 which suggests that the stock is trading above fair value based on a typical 15x multiple that investors are commonly willing to pay for every $1 of free cash flow.Source: SimplyWall.StI have selected Paychex (PAYX), Insperity Inc. (NSP) and Trinet Goup Inc. (TNET) as ADP competition peers in order to compare several valuation ratios to determine which company within the same industry is presenting the better value. Source: Old School Value, SimplyWall.St, Morningstar, table created by the authorIt would appear based on a series of valuation ratios, that ADP finds itself in the fair to overvalued range compared to its peers but, at the same time, it appears to be a better valuation compared to its peers in general.ADP has lots of analyst coverage. At present, there are 2 analysts with buy or outperform ratings, 17 with a hold rating and 1 with a sell or underperform rating. The current consensus among the 20 analysts is to hold ADP which rating has not changed since before May 2017.Putting it all together, ADP appears to be overvalued in general but may be a better value compared to its peers.The infographic below shows what analysts are predicting as ADP’s earnings per share over the next few years. Source: SimplyWall.St The company reported an EPS of $3.26 in FY2016 and an EPS of $3.70 in FY2017 which represented a 13.50% increase. Management had guided for a 2%-4% in EPS for FY2018. This would suggest an EPS range of $3.77-$3.85. Management later revised their guidance in their Q1 earnings report to 5%-7% growth over FY2017. This would suggest an EPS range of $3.89-$3.96.Below are the analysts EPS estimates (with ranges) for 2018 through to 2020 along with the year over year growth.Source: CNNMoney, SimplyWall.St, table created by the authorADP is estimated to grow its EPS this year by nearly 6% which falls inline with its 10-year average. Analysts however are expecting big things over the coming years with double digit earnings growth. Growth estimates for FY2019 are nearly equal the 5-year growth average for ADP which is 10.33% which is also an improvement over the previous 5-year growth average of 6.30%. FY2019 is also inline with the industry long term growth rate of 10.20%.Based on these growth estimates, ADP is currently trading at 29.9x FY2018 earnings, 27.1x FY2019 earnings and 22.4x FY2019 earnings. Apart from the FY2020 PE estimate, these PE ratios remain well above the 5-year average and 10-year median which suggests that it is still overvalued based on future earnings. If I use the 5-year PE ratio, based on ADP’s EPS estimates, the stock would be trading around $103.49 in FY2018, $113.88 in FY2019 and $137.81 in FY2020. This suggests that the market is already pricing in ADP’s FY2019 earnings. Over the next 12 months, analysts are estimating that ADP’s median price estimate will be $112.50 which represents 3.9% downside from the current price. The range runs from a low of $80.00 (31.7% downside) to a high of $125.00 (6.8% upside). This shows that the risk vs. reward is not favorable and that there is a great deal more downside potential also suggesting no margin of safety.I used a reverse DCF to determine how much the market expects ADP’s growth rate to be. With shares trading at $117.13, the market is pricing in earnings to grow at 15.25%. This is above analyst’s estimates as well as the 5-year growth average. If the company grew its earnings by 15.25%, then ADP’s FY2018 EPS would be $4.26 which falls within the range of analysts FY2019 estimates. This suggests that the market has gotten ahead of itself in terms of valuing the company based on its growth.What is my fair value estimate for ADP? To answer this question, I calculated the fair value of ADP using three models: Discounted Cash Flow, Graham’s Formula, and EBIT multiples.The inputs I used for the DCF was a growth rate of 10.33%, a discount rate of 7.73% based on the work of Prof. Damodaren's rates for each industry, a terminal rate of 2% and a starting free cash flow value of $1.89B. This provided a fair value estimate of $86.53.The inputs I used for the Graham’s Formula include a growth rate of 10.33%, an EPS estimate of $3.92 and a 20-year AAA corporate bond rate of 3.57%. This provided a fair value estimate of $83.73. Please note that the Graham Formula is not the same as the Graham Number and that the formula has also been modified. The explanations of each can be found here and here respectively.The inputs I used for the EBIT model has a conservative, normal and aggressive case. Based on ADP's past 5-year EV/EBIT history, I chose a multiple of 18.1x for the conservative case, 19.1x for the normal case and 22.0x for the aggressive case. Revenue estimates were $13.22B in each case. This resulted in fair value estimates of $101.84, $107.26 and $123.36 respectively.The table below provides a summary and calculations of the estimated fair value of ADP.Source: Old School ValueBased on these calculations, the average fair value estimate is $98.70 and the median fair value estimate is $103.49. Based on today’s stock price, ADP is currently overvalued by 15.73% to 11.65%.Below you will find my risk/reward chart based on the long-term growth rate (10.33%) and the average and median fair value estimates. The red and green lines in the price action chart below represent the trading range of ADP based on that growth rate. Obviously, when the stock is near the top line, it is not the time to buy and when it is near the bottom line, it is time to consider buying. Source: Freestockcharts.com (daily view) Source: Freestockcharts.com (weekly view)As you can see in the daily view chart, ADP is outside the buy price box. I have also noted that ADP is approaching the cross roads of an ascending wedge. It is usually when the stock reaches near the end that the stock either breaks up or breaks lower, but in many cases, it breaks lower. This will have to be watched and may provide patient investors a great buying opportunity.Finally, here is a quick table to show various margins of safety based on the estimated fair value.Now that the dust has settled between ADP and Bill Ackman, at least for the moment, perhaps time will allow investors to digest the events of the past 4 months. Remember, it was reported that Ackman had taken a stake in ADP on July 27, 2017 which sent shares higher. As the battle waged on between Ackman and ADP, the share price has also fluctuated but has always returned to its Ackman generated spike peak which is close to where we are now. It is interesting that before that news broke out, shares were trading at $103.18, around my estimated median fair value. I should also note that back in early May after a disappointing Q3 report, shares were trading below my average fair value.Now that Ackman’s proposals have been rejected and his influence seemingly negated, will shares return to their fair value? At the moment it doesn’t appear so but time will tell. Ackman took the share price from fairly valued to overvalued and as such, I will wait for shares to pull back before initiating a position.I hope you enjoyed this article.

4123232,36431,2017-11-10T09:57:53-05:00,"ADP recently bumped both its guidance and dividend.The company remains an elite business, but this could be due to the underlying economics of its industry.Valuations of one of its smaller competitors appear more compelling.","ADP (ADP) recently caught my attention after it bumped its dividend by more than 10%. The company also recently bumped its guidance, and now sees adjusted earnings per share growth in the 5% to 7% - up from the previous guidance of 2% to 4% growth. After analyzing Paychex (PAYX) and finding it to be a great business, I decided to see how ADP stacks up after its strong first quarter.One of the things that makes ADP great is its ability to consistently out-earn its cost of capital. This means that it's earning ""economic"" profits. To illustrate this concept, I created the below model (and all others in the article, unless otherwise noted) using data from the firm's 10-K.I also decided to create a chart with more conservative equity costs, as well as their impact on the company's overall weighted average cost of capital.ADP earns wide excess profits no matter how high the equity cost, which indicates a wide moat quantitatively. The company also maintains a relatively conservative balance sheet as well, sporting almost as many current assets as total liabilities.Next, I'll take a look at ADP's return on equity by breaking it down into five analyzable pieces with the below DuPont.The first thing that jumps out is the highly-magnified nature of the firm's ROE, with a very high leverage ratio of 9.56x assets-to-equity. While return on equity over 40% is very impressive, it's less than that of Paychex, a company that turned out ROE above 42% in its fiscal 2017. Paychex was also able to accomplish this with much less leverage, which came in at roughly 3.43x for its fiscal 2017. Despite ADP's high leverage, it also maintains a very healthy balance sheet, as indicated earlier.One of the reasons Paychex is able to generate better quality ROE is because it maintains operating margins that are almost touching 40% - more than double that of ADP's. Paychex's asset turnover of 0.4751x is also 55% higher than ADP's, indicating better efficiency. Perhaps because of its smaller, more nimble size (and focus on smaller businesses, a lucrative niche), Paychex looks like the better company here - even though its ROE isn't much higher than ADP's ROE. This is because its ROE is of much higher quality in my opinion, due to higher margins and much better efficiency.Still, ADP is no slouch, and remains a better-than-average business. It's raised its dividend for decades, and the last bump of over 10% (coupled with raised guidance) tells me that it won't be slowing down anytime soon. The underlying economics of the industry appear to be very attractive, and both Paychex and ADP will likely continue to benefit.ADP tends to turn out high quality earnings, where free cash flow covers its net income.This is the same story for Paychex, another company that drowns itself in cash flow.As a percentage of sales, free cash flow remains in the double digits for ADP as well.Once again, ADP shines as an above-average operation, spitting out impressive free cash flow and turning roughly $0.13 to $0.15 of every $1 into free cash. This doesn't look as impressive when stacked against Paychex, however. The company consistently turned $0.25 to $0.31 of every $1 in free cash flow over the last five years, once again besting its larger peer ADP.Despite its lesser history of increases, Paychex shares also yield over 3%, while ADP shares only yield a touch over 2%.ADP, like Paychex, trades at a lofty price tag on an earnings basis.Its current multiple is much higher than the 13-year median multiple of roughly 18.51, and also above the 5-year average multiple of about 25. It's also a premium to the 28.68 times earnings multiple currently placed on PAYX shares.While relative valuations look pricey, I think growth also needs to be factored in, especially after management increased its guidance for adjusted earnings growth in the 5% to 7% range.Even factoring in higher growth, shares still appear to be fairly valued at best using a conservative 10% to 12% discount rate, and possibly overvalued if earnings growth comes in at the lower end of management's guidance.I like ADP as a business, but I think it's priced for perfection. I'd personally pay more for PAYX shares as I think it's a better-run business, especially since they are trading at a discount to ADP and more in line with their growth expectations. ADP, like Paychex, also benefits from rising rates, and management is focusing on expanding margins going forward. Increasing rates could provide a tailwind of sorts for achieving this goal. As long as Paychex's operating margins are hovering around the 40% range, however, there's a pretty high bar set in the payment processing space, so ADP shouldn't be trading at a premium here, in my opinion.If you enjoyed this article and would like to receive further updates and articles in the future, please feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button at the top of the page next to the author's name."
4113150,48311,2017-10-12T12:00:54-04:00,"Activist Pershing Square released a one-hour presentation about improvements ADP could make.The campaign is about improving margins, which is a type of campaign Pershing has been very successful with.Pershing lays out a convincing case, and management as well as the board should take the outside criticism very seriously.","To convince Automatic Data Processing (ADP) shareholders to vote for his board nominees, Pershing Square's (OTCPK:PSHZF) Bill Ackman launched an hour-long presentation detailing areas of improvement. I've watched the whole thing and I believe that Ackman makes a convincing case. The stock has run up somewhat since Pershing Square got involved, but there's substantial room for price appreciation left if only half of Ackman's assertions prove right. I'll highlight the points he makes that I found most convincing.Image: Bill Ackman, presentation stillActivists are generally most effective if they find targets where margins are subpar compared to competitors and their campaign leads to change. Making changes within a business that's run less than optimally is much easier as compared to battling for market share or successfully acquiring and integrating competitors. However, these changes are often also painful for company insiders and therefore unpopular with managements.That's why activists campaigns can be useful. Pershing Square has historically had success with similar campaigns. The firm also had its share of problematic campaigns like at Valeant (VRX) and Herbalife (HLF), but those weren't traditional margin campaigns. ADP trades at a P/E of 30x, which makes potential margin improvements very valuable. Any additional net income generated gets a 30x multiplier. Ackman's efforts revolve around demonstrating margins can be improved.ADP generates much less revenue per employee as compared to Paychex, which is really the only really large competitor. It's perfectly understandable that some smaller competitors focusing on a certain niche market have higher revenue per employee, but ADP with its $50 billion market cap and Paychex with its $20 billion market cap should be fairly similar.Lagging Paychex in revenue per employee doesn't help with EBIT, and the difference there is breathtaking. Paychex generates almost 2x the EBIT margin enjoyed by ADP. Remember that net income is treated to a x30 multiplier, so if this gap could be bridged without much investment, it would result in mind-blowing gains to shareholders.In several embarrassing slides, Ackman makes the point that ADP is held back by its legacy sprawl. The legacy business model required the company to have physical locations close to its clients, but that's no longer true. Modern, more nimble competitors do not have this sprawl. Different departments are spread across the country, and even ADP's headquarters is spread across multiple physical locations that are a 30-minute drive away from each other. This can't be good to foster cooperation and nimble operation. It looks like the perfect setup for a slow-moving bureaucracy, and Ackman has a point that this should be addressed.Ackman went through two ADP spin-offs that convincingly demonstrate the room for margin improvement. The first was Solera and the second was CDK Global (CDK). The two went from 16%-18% margins to 35%-40% margins. That means they went from the ADP margin level to the Paychex margin level. This seems like a strong indication there's the potential for gains at ADP.CDK Global outperformed the market markedly since the spin-off:CDK Total Return Price data by YChartsADP also outperformed the market, but without Pershing Square's activist bump the outperformance would almost be negligible.Pershing Square located an old quote by President and CEO Carlos Rodriguez from the ADP Sanford Bernstein Conference on May 29, 2013:Even back in 2013, which is four years ago, the CEO admits a 20% pretax operating margin leaves plenty of room for improvement. It just didn't happen. In addition, Pershing Square highlighted management compensation as problematic -- not because it's too high, but because it is tied to the wrong metrics. In practice, it rewards management for making very small incremental improvements over long periods of time. You could even argue it to be punitive if transformational positive margin changes were achieved too quickly.Interestingly, Morningstar analyst Colin Plunkett writes:Overall he rates stewardship as poor, citing underinvestment in technology, among other things. That's a sentiment also echoed by Pershing Square.Ackman and Pershing Square built a convincing case that there is room for improvement at ADP, and also why it is not being achieved. The story is at least partially backed up by independent analysts. Even if Pershing Square's people aren't elected to the board, shareholders could benefit by stepping up the pressure on the board and pushing for a review of management incentives. These should always be aligned with the interests of long-term shareholders."

Purcell, who has been with the firm since 2002 and was previously CEO of temporary staffing firm P.C. Services.Below is a keynote video of Global Cash’s system:(Source: Global Cash Card)Global Cash Card’s primary offerings include a variety of paperless card payment solutions aimed at particular use cases:The firm operates in Visa (NYSE:V)/MasterCard (NYSE:MA) certified operation centers and says it is ‘certified as a direct processor on multiple financial networks.’Neither firm disclosed the acquisition price or terms and ADP didn’t file an 8-K or disclose a change in financial guidance, so I presume the deal was for a non-material amount.The combination of Global Cash Card and ADP promises to expand ADP’s existing ALINE Card offering to appeal to younger business users such as millennials and Gen Z demographics.As ADP stated in the deal announcement:ADP believes that paycards are not only more popular with younger users but also with the estimated 24.5 million ‘underbanked’ U.S. households that do not use traditional banks for financial services.The firm is also gaining a ‘proprietary digital payments processing platform,' becoming the only human capital management provider to have this capability in-house.Additionally, ADP hopes to leverage its increased paycard offerings to provide convenient pay services to the ‘gig economy,' which has been growing dramatically in the U.S.Assuming ADP didn’t overpay for Global Cash, the transaction makes sense and will likely prove a smart step as ADP seeks a greater piece of rapidly changing and fragmenting payments marketplace.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, and IPOs.

4110489,67473,2017-09-29T01:26:02-04:00,"Despite the large opportunity for improvement, ADP's board and management have made clear that they are committed to the status quo, recently releasing a ""plan"" which projects no improvement in its annual margin improvement targets. In other words, the board and management have effectively said that they can't do any better.By examining the performance of two businesses that were once owned and operated by ADP and subsequently sold or spun off - both of which delivered large increases in operating margins shortly after their disposition - one can better understand the potential for improvement at ADP.CDK and Solera are clear illustrations of the operational underperformance which exists at ADP. The rapid and significant improvement of these businesses post ADP is very instructive and raises important questions.","By VW StaffPershing Square (OTCPK:PSHZF) releases letter to shareholders regarding nominees for ADP's transformation.Dear Fellow Shareholder:Pershing Square is one of the largest shareholders of ADP. We made a $2.3 billion investment in ADP because we believe it is a good business that can be substantially improved.In our first letter to you, we discussed the substantial and achievable opportunity that exists for ADP to improve its operating efficiency, product and service offerings and long-term shareholder value. Despite the large opportunity for improvement, ADP's board and management have made clear that they are committed to the status quo, recently releasing a ""plan"" which projects no improvement in its annual margin improvement targets. In other words, the board and management have effectively said that they can't do any better.We have detailed ADP's opportunity for significant improvement in our prior letter - that said, you may wonder how one can understand the potential for improvement and its time frame for execution. By examining the performance of two businesses that were once owned and operated by ADP and subsequently sold or spun off - both of which delivered large increases in operating margins shortly after their disposition - one can better understand the potential for improvement at ADP.The dramatic improvement in these businesses once they were no longer overseen by ADP's current board and management reflects the value that can be unlocked at ADP, which The Nominees for ADP's Transformation will work to achieve for the benefit of all shareholders. If ADP can achieve its potential, it will drive an additional 50% increase in ADP's overall profitability, dividends, and stock price by 2021 compared with the status quo.Over the last decade, ADP has narrowed its focus on the Human Capital Management (""HCM"") industry and disposed of other processing businesses, namely Solera (NYSE:SLH) (known as Claims Services within ADP) and CDK (known as Dealer Services within ADP).Following its sale in April 2006, Solera increased its operating margins from 18% to 40% within five years. Solera made these impressive improvements by focusing on operational efficiency, reducing management bureaucracy, delayering the organization, rationalizing facilities, and reducing waste to drive unnecessary expense out of the business.CDK was spun off from ADP on September 30, 2014. After the spin-off, several activist shareholders announced investments in CDK. In stark contrast to ADP's response to us, CDK's board and management embraced these shareholder views, hired a consultant to independently evaluate the company's potential, and then shortly thereafter announced a transformation plan. Since its spin-off from ADP, CDK has improved its operating margins from 16% to 26% in three years, and is projecting margins of 35% or more by the end of FY 2019 (year five), a more than two-fold increase in margins since it was disposed of by ADP. CDK is a very recent example of ADP's inadequate business oversight and governance, which, if improved with the addition of fresh perspectives and a major shareholder on the board, can unlock substantial shareholder value at ADP.Under ADP's ownership, CDK aimed to produce only marginal increases in profitability over time. Running a business for incremental gain, regardless of its full potential or the improvements of competitors, is also how ADP manages its Employer Services business, as described by the former CEO:Clearly, this approach led to a missed opportunity for ADP shareholders. CDK made dramatic improvements and is on target to more than double margins just five years after its disposal by ADP. Simply put, ADP was either unaware of this significant opportunity for improvement or it was unwilling to take the steps necessary to capture it. This was a massive missed opportunity for ADP shareholders.CDK was able to improve its performance substantially and quickly after being freed from ADP's oversight. The driving force behind the improvements at CDK was its renewed focus on operating efficiency. We believe a similar approach at ADP will yield similarly impactful results. In fact, the CDK transformation included many cultural and operational efficiency initiatives that can be applied to ADP:The similarities between the pre-transformation CDK and ADP are striking, including their organizational structures, business complexity and inefficiency arising from multiple acquisitions, corporate and management bloat, and cultures which lack accountability for operational efficiency and continuous improvement.CDK was able to dramatically improve efficiency and performance, while also improving customer relationships and product offerings. CDK's transformation drove significant margin and earnings improvement, did not require significant expense or investments to make these improvements, and caused no harm or risk to CDK's business or its customers. CDK is a much more effective and efficient competitor as a result of the steps it has taken since the spin-off from ADP.CDK's board was totally refreshed as a result of the spin-off, and included the addition of two directors proposed by an activist shareholder. The shareholder-friendly approach taken by CDK's board allowed the company to fulfill its potential. The new CDK board:CDK's business performance and stock price have benefitted greatly from its board's open-minded, shareholder-friendly approach. CDK has delivered a total shareholder return of 108% in the three years since it was spun off by ADP (as compared to ADP's 41% TSR over the same period).Despite ADP's comments to the contrary, there is no reason that what CDK has achieved in just a few years after the spinoff cannot be achieved at ADP. Doing so will require fresh perspectives and a willingness to embark on a true transformation plan, rather than the reaffirmation of the status quo that ADP's management and board continue to endorse.CDK and Solera are clear illustrations of the operational underperformance which exists at ADP. The rapid and significant improvement of these businesses post ADP is very instructive and raises important questions:At ADP's annual meeting on November 7, 2017, shareholders will have the opportunity to vote for transformational change at ADP by electing three highly qualified and experienced independent director nominees. If elected to the board, The Nominees for ADP's Transformation will bring a shareholder orientation along with a major ownership stake, fresh perspectives, and relevant expertise in business transformation and operating efficiency to accelerate the necessary changes required for ADP to achieve its full potential.With a strong mandate from shareholders, we look forward to working constructively with members of management and the newly reconstituted board for the benefit of all ADP shareholders.

4113078,65113,2017-10-12T08:10:36-04:00,"This company is one of the best Dividend Aristocrats I've come across.Very few other companies have managed to create the competitive advantage that this one has in its industry.Moreover, the company is not only attractive from a dividend perspective, but has also shown significant growth in total returns.","Here is why I think Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is a must-have in any dividend investor's portfolio:In the world of Big Data, everything that can be analyzed is being analyzed. Companies are using data science to solve all kinds of business problems - from how to maximize cost savings to how to increase brand loyalty among existing customers. This space has become very competitive, and the ones that thrive are those who have carved out a very defined niche in this space. Enter Automatic Data Processing.This company is one of the few that has been preparing for the information age before it became mainstream. ADP started out as a manual payroll processing business, and has since gone on to become a pioneer of the provision of data services for human resource and payroll purposes.As well as automating these processes for some of the world's largest companies, ADP's big data strategy has gone on to allow companies to gather mission-critical data to maximize employee value through unearthing insights such as company vs. industry salaries, methods to increase employee retention based on factors specific to particular roles, etc.The value of the insights that ADP is able to generate for its clients is not necessarily as a result of its big data know-how: rather, it is as a result of the key relationships that the company has forged with clients over the years. According to the Washington Post, the company is second only to the U.S. federal government in terms of the data it holds on U.S. companies and employees.Interestingly, when we compare Employer Services with PEO Services (the latter indicating a service where ADP forms a co-employment situation with the client and the HR function is effectively outsourced to ADP), revenue for Employer Services was up 3% compared to last year's fourth quarter, while that for PEO Services increased 16% over the same time period.While revenue for Employer Services has been dropping to low single digits over the past few years, the average fee per client along with number of clients served continues to increase, and therefore, a sustained revenue growth of 3-4% for this company is not unreasonable.Moreover, even with low interest rates, Interest on Funds Held for Clients saw an 8% increase to $105 million from $97 million one year previously, and earnings have increased both on a diluted and an EBIT basis:(Source: Fiscal 2017; ADP Earnings Call and Webcast)In this regard, I expect that demand for PEO Services will continue to increase as small to medium-sized business look to not only outsource HR functions, but also gain access to cutting-edge Big Data analysis that can inform their business practices - and which would not be possible to implement to as large a scale in-house.Automatic Data Processing is a Dividend Aristocrat, having increased its dividend for 42 years in a row, and currently paying a yield of 2.02% and an annualized dollar amount of $2.28. While the dividend payout ratio is above 50% (59.5%), this still represents significant reinvestment into the business - and I see the dividend as being sustainable for this reason.EarningsFree Cash FlowAdditionally, when we look at earnings and free cash flow, we see growth in both of these metrics.Moreover, the P/E ratio has been holding more or less steady since 2014, while EPS has been rising, and while we have seen a slight increase in price-to-free cash flow recently, free cash flow growth has also been on the up overall.In this regard, ADP could be one of the few Dividend Aristocrats that delivers significant growth in both dividends and total return.We see that in spite of a stationary P/E ratio, the stock price has more than doubled in the past five years:To conclude, I see this company as continuing to offer significant value for investors even in spite of its run over the past five years.ADP's competitive advantage is virtually unrivaled in its industry, and the company is one of the few that has shown significant growth in both dividends and total return. I'm not long right now due to my positions in other dividend stocks, but if I decide to add to my portfolio, this will be one of the first on my list."
4109196,24992,2017-09-25T10:44:04-04:00,"Company appears to be immune to the business cycle - consistent revenue and earnings growth year after year.The dividend has increased 6% per year over the last five years.If we assume future dividend growth of 5% per year, our growth model shows a 7% total annual return on the shares to 2021.ChartMasterPro upward target price of $115.00.","Although the shares of Automatic Data Processing (ADP) are up about 21% over the past twelve months, in my view, there’s more upside ahead. The shares represent excellent value at these levels, in spite of the fact that they are trading roughly in line with the overall market. I’ll go through my reasoning by commenting on the financial highlights, by forecasting the dividend’s impact on price, and by making an appeal to authority. In my view, investors would be wise to buy the shares at these levels as they are undervalued.There’s a great deal to like about the financial history presented by ADP. Over the past five years, both revenue and net income have risen nicely, up at a CAGR of about 5.5% and 8.2%, respectively. In addition, both revenue and net income have grown consistently over time. This is a company that seems to be more immune to the business cycle than some that I’ve reviewed lately.In addition, earnings per share has risen at a CAGR of 9% on the back of growing net income and management’s effort to reduce the share count. This is critical in my view, as it speaks to management’s shareholder focus. Over the past five years, management has returned $9.1 billion to shareholders, in share buybacks and dividends. I believe that a friendly management is a necessary precondition to successful investment because the alternative almost guarantees an economic loss.Turning quickly to the capital structure, the debt load here is not significant in my view for a few reasons. First, 50% of the debt is due in 2020, and the other 50% is due in 2025. In addition, the company has more cash and equivalents on hand than debt. For that reason, there’s little worry about a credit or a solvency crisis anytime soon.Although the financial history offers an interesting guide for what will likely happen in future, investors are understandably more concerned about the future than the past. It’s with that in mind that I’d like to make a forecast about the future returns here. Whenever I forecast, I engage in a ceteris paribus function, meaning that I hold all variables constant but the one that is most relevant. In this case, I think the dividend is the most relevant “driver” of returns, so I’ll change it while holding the yield constant.Over the past five years, the dividend has grown at a CAGR of about 6%. While I consider this to be a reasonable forecast, I feel it worthwhile to be reasonably conservative in my estimates, as I prefer my surprises to be pleasant ones. For that reason, I’m going to forecast a 5% dividend growth rate over the next four years. When I perform this exercise on ADP, I forecast a CAGR of 7% over the next four years. I consider this to be a very reasonable return for the risks present.As per our ChartMasterPro Daily Trade Model, the trend for ADP turned bullish on September 22 when the shares closed above the $108.00 level. This signalled a bullish breakout from a Descending Triangle pattern on the daily charts. From here we see the shares climbing to the $115.00 level over the next three months.Today, we will buy ADP call options which will provide us with approximately 16x leverage on our long trade. Our initial stop-loss exit signal will be a daily close below $106.00.For investors in the shares, we recommend that you hold for three months or $115.00, whichever comes first. For longer term investors (years, not months), we believe ADP is a solid addition to any dividend growth portfolio over the next four years.One of the interesting things about the financial markets is that it is a manifestation of a meritocracy in action. Some investors are simply more talented than average, and we should therefore pay some attention to what they do. It’s with that in mind that I’d point out that such luminaries as Bill Ackman, First Eagle Investment, and Joel Greenblatt have bought massively over the past six months. Both Ackman and Greenblatt bought shares as a new buy in 2017, and between the two of them already own just over 37 million shares, valued at approximately $3.9 billion. If investors of this calibre are willing to put this much capital to work here, we should at the very least pay attention.In my view, the run up the shares of Automatic Data Processing have enjoyed over the past year are just the beginning. In my view, the returns may be more muted going forward, but they will certainly be positive. This is a shareholder friendly organisation that seems to have the seal of approval of a number of talented institutional investors. For all of these reasons, I consider ADP a strong buy."
4102904,80476,2017-08-30T07:49:00-04:00,Vendor lock-in makes Automatic Data Processing's business very lucrative.The company is able to generate excellent margins.Dividend growth might stall soon if free cash flow will not start to grow again.,"Automatic Data Processing (ADP) looks like a quintessential fantastic business with wide moat and lucrative margins. If I already didn't have SAP in my portfolio, I would instantly purchase shares of ADP.The reason why I like Automatic Data Processing is because the company has passed a long list of my personal strict screening criteria. I quite often divide this screening process into two simple steps. In the first step I evaluate various quantitative metrics. This is simply because the best companies out there with strong and wide moats usually have the best financial metrics. If a company can charge 10% more than its competitors, it clearly needs to do something better than the rest. These type of companies are usually the ones who are able to survive even the most difficult business environments and still continue rewarding their shareholders. In the second step, I continue applying a few qualitative factors on the companies which have passed my first step.In this article, I will be showing what type of quantitative metrics I applied to Automatic Data Processing. I will not be considering the current or historical valuation of the shares. That will be left for the reader. Automatic Data Processing is a company founded in 1949 which provides for instance HR, payroll and tax management software. I have for some time had my eye on the company's shares but I have not done my due diligence until now.Let's start the analysis by looking at historical debt loads. Especially during the current zero interest rate environment where money is almost free, many corporations are relying on it for wrong purposes, such as share buybacks or excessive acquisitions. Therefore I find it important to look at how free cash flow has historically covered existing debt. In the case of Automatic Data Processing, free cash flow has covered debt very well.Source: author generated from SEC filingsWhen it comes to return on equity using free cash flow, it has been around 27.2% and 24.9% for the last 10 and 20 years. Those values are really good.Source: author generated from SEC filingsReturn on assets is probably one of the best metrics when calculating profitability. This is simply because it takes into consideration all physical and intangible assets. Intangibles are especially generated through major acquisitions so it is advisable to assess how profitable they have been. After all, it is rather simple to pay too much. In the case of Automatic Data Processing, return on assets using free cash flow has been on average 4.9% and 6.4% for the last 10 and 20 years. Those values are rather weak and have been trending down for the last two decades.Source: author generated from SEC filingsHow has free cash flow relative to sales developed through the years with Automatic Data Processing? For the last 10 years it has been on average 15.1% and for the last 20 years 15.5%. Those values sound exceptional.Source: author generated from SEC filingsThe long-term dividend history seems to be exceptional with an annual growth of 11.0% and 12.5% for the last 10 and 20 years. The dividend growth has been supported in the long term by the increasing free cash flow as can be seen further below from the free cash flow graph.Source: author generated from SEC filingsIrrespective of good historical dividend growth, more important is the fact how much there is still growth potential left. Historically, the free cash flow has been able to cover dividend payments rather well while the current ratio is around 62.4%.Source: author generated from SEC filingsThe most common ways to distribute profits to shareholders are via dividends and share buybacks. Lets next look at how has the company managed its share capital in recent years. In the case of Automatic Data Processing, per share figures are even better as share buybacks have decreased the amount of shares annually by around -2.0% and -1.1% for the last 10 and 20 years.Source: author generated from SEC filingsFrom historical point of view, free cash flow has been growing at an annual rate of 0.0% and 5.8% during the last decade and two decades. These figures can be considered dismal. In addition, in the case of Automatic Data Processing, it is quite easy to assess near term cash flows. However, free cash flow has been stagnating since the start of the millennium. Unless the management can turn around this direction soon, dividend growth can be expected to slow down quite dramatically.Source: author generated from SEC filingsPersonally I prefer investing in companies that have low capital expenditure requirements and that require little capital for growth. Automatic Data Processing has been using on average 2.3% from sales to capital expenditures during the last 10 years. For the last 20 years the same figure stands at 2.6%. These figures sound very promising which is not actually that uncommon in the software business. This is because software development expenses are usually deducted from the operating cash flow.Source: author generated from SEC filingsSales are probably one of the most important metrics in a financial statement. This is simply because without an increasing revenue, there is no possibility for a company to grow its dividends in the future. As you can see below, top line has been growing at an annual rate of 2.7% and 6.1% for the last 10 and 20 years, which is rather weak.Source: author generated from SEC filingsSummaryEven though Automatic Data Processing's ability to increase cash flow has been a bit problematic during the last 15 years, I would still consider the company as a core holding in any portfolio. The margins from the RoS, RoE and RoA point of view clearly indicate that Automatic Data Processing is doing something right. In addition, capital expenditure requirements are very low and debt load seems to be under control. However, as I am already very satisfied with my position in SAP, I unfortunately have to pass this wonderful dividend aristocrat."

But it should be, at least for income investors.Automatic Data Processing, or ADP for short, has raised its dividend each year for 42 years in a row. Its most recent increase was on November 8, 2016, when the company announced a solid 7.5% raise.ADP is a member of the Dividend Aristocrats, a group of 51 stocks in the S&P 500 Index, with 25-plus years of consecutive dividend increases. You can see all 51 Dividend Aristocrats here.ADP’s long history of dividend growth is the result of a strong business model and multiple competitive advantages.This article will review ADP’s fundamentals and discuss whether the stock is trading at an attractive valuation right now.ADP is a business outsourcing services company. It was founded in 1949, and began with a single client. In the nearly 70 years since, ADP has grown into the leading payroll and human resource outsourcing company. It has approximately 700,000 clients, in more than 110 countries, worldwide.ADP has two business segments:ADP provides services including payroll, benefits administration, and human resources management, to companies of all sizes. ADP enjoys high demand for these services, as companies would prefer to outsource these functions to better focus on their core business activities.Source: 2017 Investor Presentation, page 3ADP has a highly diversified client list. No single customer represents more than 2% of annual revenue.The company has undergone a significant restructuring in recent years. In 2014, ADP spun off its human capital management business, which now trades as CDK Global (CDK).Its reshaped business model will place greater emphasis on helping clients streamline their business functions by investing in cloud-based software as a growth initiative.ADP has strong growth prospects. The company recently concluded fiscal 2017, which was another very good year. Total revenue increased 6%, to $12.4 billion. Excluding the impact of currency exchange, organic revenue increased 7% for the year.Revenue growth, combined with share repurchases, drove earnings-per-share growth of 13% for 2017.Source: FY17 Earnings Presentation, page 4Both core segments performed well. Employer Services revenue increased 4%, while the PEO Services segment generated 13% revenue growth.Growth in Employer Services is slower, but the segment is highly profitable. In fiscal 2017, Employer Services had a 30% gross margin.The PEO Services gross margin is less than half that, but in return, it is the company’s main growth engine.For fiscal 2018, ADP expects the Employer Services segment to grow revenue by 2%-3%. The PEO Services segment is expected to grow revenue by 11%-13%.Overall, revenue and adjusted earnings-per-share are expected to increase 5.5% and 3%, respectively, at the midpoint of fiscal 2018 guidance.Source: FY17 Earnings Presentation, page 6Two key growth catalysts for ADP are continued increases in payrolls and regulation. First, as the economy continues to grow at a modest rate, businesses are adding employees. The number of employees on ADP clients' payrolls in the U.S. increased by 2.4% in fiscal 2017.Next, the increasingly complex regulatory environment creates significant compliance costs for businesses.This also helps provide ADP with steady growth. The company expects new business bookings to increase 5%-7% in the upcoming fiscal year.ADP’s growth is fueled by its competitive advantages, of which it has many. ADP has a deep connection with its customers and enjoys a strong reputation for customer service. This helps keep customer retention very high.ADP enjoys tremendous scale that its competitors cannot match. As a global company, ADP is uniquely positioned to help companies that have employees on multiple continents.In addition, ADP benefits from a recession-resistant business model. ADP’s earnings-per-share during the Great Recession are shown below:ADP increased earnings-per-share in 2008 and 2009, which is a rare accomplishment. Businesses still need ADP’s payroll and human resource services. This helps insulates ADP from the effects of a recession.ADP generated adjusted earnings-per-share of $3.70 for fiscal 2017. Based on the current share price, the stock has a price-to-earnings ratio of 30.1. This is a fairly rich valuation. The S&P 500 Index has an average price-to-earnings ratio of 25.3.Put differently, ADP is valued at a 19% premium to the S&P 500. The stock appears to be overvalued.As a result, investors cannot rely on an expanding price-to-earnings ratio to fuel shareholder returns. Instead, future returns will likely be generated from earnings growth and dividends. In fact, the company's high valuation could weigh down total returns for the stock.The good news is, the company is growing at a high enough rate that could justify its current valuation. A potential breakdown of future returns is as follows:In this forecast, total returns would reach 10%-13% per year, including dividends.ADP is likely to increase its dividend before the end of 2017. It has not yet announced a dividend increase during 2017, but will need to do so to continue its streak of consecutive increases.A dividend increase is easily justified by the company’s fundamentals. ADP maintains a target payout ratio of 55%-60% of annual earnings. ADP has an annualized dividend of $2.28 per share.In fiscal 2017, earnings-per-share were $3.70, resulting in a dividend payout ratio of 61%. While this is slightly higher than the company’s target payout ratio, there should be enough future earnings growth to justify a dividend increase.ADP is a strong business. The company maintains a large list of customers and holds a top position in the industry. This gives it a wide economic “moat,” a term popularized by investing legend Warren Buffett. Indeed, ADP at most keeps competitors at bay, and leads to high profitability.There should be plenty of growth going forward, both in terms of earnings as well as dividends. Regulations continue to increase, and only become more complex. And, as the economy expands, companies are adding employees.If a recession occurs, ADP should continue to increase its dividend, as customers will still need its services. This makes ADP a highly consistent dividend stock.Our exclusive service Undervalued Aristocrats provides actionable buy and sell recommendations on the strongest dividend growth stocks.

4097869,102551,2017-08-11T03:31:18-04:00,"ADP is currently the third most heavily shorted company in the data processing and outsourced services sector.Pershing Square Capital Management L.P. has accumulated an 8% stake and has put forth an amended proposal in an effort to gain three seats on ADP’s Board.ADP has a history of 42 consecutive years of dividend growth, and its shares have appreciated considerably in value over the long-term.I view ADP's shares as expensive at the moment. I do not, however, have any intention of selling our shares even though wealthy influential investors feel a correction is overdue.","On July 27, 2017, Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) released its FY2017 results and provided guidance for fiscal 2018. This was followed up with Pershing Square Capital Management L.P. (“Pershing”) informing ADP on August 1, 2017, that it was seeking effective control of the company through five Board seats at ADP's 2017 Annual Meeting as well as a CEO change. Shortly thereafter, Pershing modified its proposal.In this post, I touch upon ADP’s “Client Funds Portfolio Extended Investment Strategy”, provide my opinion on Pershing’s recent proposal, and what I view as a reasonable valuation.Founded more than 60 years ago, ADP has grown to the stage where it now generates almost $12.4B in revenue from its more than 650,000 clients in more than 110 countries. You can find a Corporate Overview here.While you can easily review ADP’s 13 page fiscal 2017 presentation which accompanied the recent earnings call (it includes management’s projections for fiscal 2018), I want to touch upon ADP’s Client Funds Portfolio Extended Investment Strategy which impacts the adjusted results.The adjusted numbers reflected in the presentation include interest income earned on investments associated with ADP’s Client Funds Extended Investment Strategy and any interest expense on borrowings related to this strategy.ADP believes these client funds are fundamental to the underlying operations of its business model. As at June 30, 2017, it had ~$27.3B of client funds on deposit while as at June 30, 2016, it had ~$33.8B. Naturally, deposits of this magnitude, a positive yield curve, and longer-dated investments will allow ADP to generate a substantial amount of investment income. When deemed prudent, ADP will further enhance its investment returns by investing long and borrowing short to take advantage of the yield spread I reference the following from ADP’s July 27, 2017, earnings release:“Client Funds Extended Investment Strategy Fiscal 2018 ForecastThe interest assumptions in our forecasts are based on Fed Funds futures contracts and forward yield curves as of July 25, 2017. The Fed Funds futures contracts used in the client short and corporate cash interest income forecasts assume an increase in the Fed Funds rate in March 2018. The three-and-a-half and five-year U.S. government agency rates based on the forward yield curves as of July 25, 2017 were used to forecast new purchase rates for the client and corporate extended, and client long portfolios, respectively.Having said this, ADP has always maintained that safety, liquidity, and diversification of its clients’ funds are the foremost objectives of its investment strategy. Could you imagine what would happen if it came time to disburse its clients’ funds and there was a shortfall!? As a result, client funds are invested extremely prudently and conservatively in an investment portfolio that is predominantly AAA/AA quality.There are concerns that new business bookings are slowing at ADP. This has resulted in ADP being the third-most shorted company in the data processing and outsourced services sector.Given the pressure being placed on ADP by sophisticated investors, Pershing is of the opinion that it can step in and have a say at the Board level as to what changes it feels are necessary to drive up the stock price.Its proposal calls for the following individuals to stand for election:While these are undoubtedly very bright people, I don’t know what deep expertise they possess in the areas in which Pershing indicates ADP must make significant improvements.When I look at the 2016 Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders and Proxy Statement Annual Report on Form 10-K to see who stood for re-election as Directors, I also see some very bright experienced individuals.Pershing is of the opinion ADP can accelerate growth, improve the quality of its software and service offerings, slash operating costs, and improve efficiency. I have not seen the specifics on what Pershing wants ADP to do to achieve these objectives, but I suspect Pershing desperately needs to improve the performance of Pershing Square Holdings, Ltd. and will do whatever it can in this regard. The variance between its returns and various benchmarks is significant, and I am certain Pershing’s investors are looking for better results very quickly. I, however, would hate for Pershing to narrow the gap between its returns and the benchmarks at the expense of ADP employees, customers, and shareholders. I hope Pershing is unsuccessful in gaining any seats on ADP’s Board.On that note, it certainly appears ADP’s CEO feels the same way and that he does not have a lot of love for Bill Ackman!ADP has an enviable history of having increased its annual dividend for 42 consecutive years.The following reflects the compound annual growth rate of ADP’s annual dividend over two different time periods:I chose to show the compound annual growth rate starting in 2009 separately because that is the last year when ADP’s dividend ended its six-year stretch of double-digit growth.While growth has slowed subsequent to 2009, investors have still been rewarded with a reasonable dividend growth rate of ~7%.In addition to the reasonable dividend growth and capital appreciation, the overall return on an ADP investment is even more impressive if you have owned ADP shares for many years. If you acquired ADP shares prior to 2006 and still own them, you have also benefited from the spin-off of the following publicly traded companies:We have owned ADP shares prior to both spin-offs. If you are in a similar position, you will know exactly what I mean when I say our overall return on investment is far greater than what ADP’s stock chart suggests.ADP reported $3.70 in adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (Non-GAAP) for fiscal 2017 and is projecting growth in the 2-4% range. On this basis, $3.77-3.85 is the projected EPS range and the consensus 2018 earnings expectations from 17 brokers is $3.82.Source: TD Bank WebBrokerIf we use $3.82 and the August 9th closing stock price of $109.66, we get a forward PE of 28.7. This is in line with ADP’s PE for the last few years.(Source: Morningstar)While ADP is a wonderful company, I view recent valuations as somewhat rich. This is coming from someone who has been thinking this way for several months and who already owns several hundred shares outside the FFJ Portfolio. I continue to reinvest all dividends, but for the sake of investors looking to initiate a position in ADP, I would like for the stock price to retrace to more reasonable levels.As noted in previous posts, I am of the opinion a market correction is long overdue and I am not alone in this camp. I have no way of knowing if/when a correction will occur, but I suspect patience would be warranted for a better entry point.ADP is a wonderful company that belongs in any long-term investor’s portfolio. My definition of long-term is perhaps slightly longer than that of Pershing as I want to pass on our ADP shares to the next generation. Hopefully that will not happen for at least another 20 years!I don’t think Pershing will bring any added value to the equation by having its representatives on the Board and hope shareholders vote “AGAINST” its shareholder proposal.I continue to believe ADP is somewhat overpriced and urge caution if you wish to acquire shares. A retracement to the mid $90s would be nice, which would mean a PE ~25 based on the consensus broker estimated earnings of $3.82 for FY2018.Note: I appreciate the time you took to read this article and hope you got something out of it.

After initially requesting a 30-45 day extension, he said that he actually would only need an extension of a week. Rodriguez said Ackman's request was similar to that of a spoiled brat in school, asking for an extension on an assignment. Love or hate Ackman, his investment thesis should be taken seriously. Many are quick to point out his failures, for example, Valeant (NYSE:VRX) or JCPenney (NYSE:JCP). Some have also deemed his ongoing battle with Herbalife (NYSE:HLF) a total failure. In the case of Herbal Life, I think Ackman has shown the true spirit of activist investing, other may have a different opinion on this. Before passing judgment on Pershing Square's thesis, investors should weigh Ackman's losses and wins. You cannot overlook the brilliance of his work with General Growth Properties (GGP) and Canadian Pacific (NYSE:CP). The interaction between Automatic Data Processing and Pershing has many parallels to Ackman's interaction with Canadian Pacific. One major difference is ADP's markedly better share performance in comparison to CP's. You can draw your own conclusions based on Ackman's track record. Let move on and examine the main points from Pershing Square's 3 hour, 167 slide presentation, which can be found at ADPascending.com.Source: Pershing Square presentation, ADP: The Time is Now (page 6)As I move through the most important slides and points made, I will provide some of the commentaries from Pershing's presentation. Any paragraph labeled with Pershing, is providing a brief summation of what was mentioned in the investor presentation. It is important for me to give background on these slides before weighing in myself.Pershing: One thing to note is the margin of ES or employer services as this number along with a few questions about ADP's disclosure are the crux of Ackman's thesis. This level of margin is referred to by Pershing as adjusted net operating profit margin. I feel that this truly is a more accurate representation of the margin for their ES business and working the numbers to present it at the 31% level along with consistent dividend payments has kept investors from asking questions.I agree that this is a more accurate representation of the margin for their ES business and ADP working the numbers to present it at the 31% level has kept investors from asking more questions.Source: Pershing Square presentation, ADP: The Time is Now (page 51)Pershing: ES drives 87% of ADP's revenue and this is where it seems they have been lacking in profit margin. As human capital management (HCM) has incorporated more and more technology, these are numbers that shareholder would like to see expanding. PEO is also pivotal to Ackman's thesis as Pershing Square feels that pass-throughs within this business segment have been used to manipulate earnings.While PEO is only 9% of their business, I think that this is still a bit of trickery by management. Booking this using a fixed number of 4.5% Rates are not even near this level so I do have questions as to why management would knowingly use a number that is incorrect. If they see no problem overstating their float at 4.5% then they should tread lightly in their accusations against Ackman, saying he has some of his numbers wrong.Source: Pershing Square presentation, ADP: The Time is Now (page 8)Pershing: Pershing Square made it clear, they feel that executives are more concerned with meeting their incentives through incremental growth each year rather than exploring options that trade short term gains for long term benefits. Accusations of insularity and short term focus are likely the reason that CEO Carlos Rodriguez was so quick to snap back at Ackman.Anytime you raise questions about the integrity of a C-Suite, you are going to get a strong and immediate response. I believe that the questions Ackman has raised are actually valid and this is part of what prompted a response from Rodriguez containing a personal attack on Ackman. I have questions about the way Rodriguez responded to accusations of ADP manipulating their financials. Rodriguez made an appearance on Mad Money with Jim Cramer to address Pershing Square's presentation.In response to Pershing Square's questions about disclosure in recent 10-K and 10-Q reports, Rodriguez said. ""We kind of take offense to the implication that we are, I guess, playing with numbers or not disclosing information that we should be disclosing"". For someone who immediately went on the offensive, making personal remarks towards Ackman, I expected an unequivocal denial of any possibility that ADP was choice or deceptive in their disclosures under current leadership. In this same interview, he went on to say, ""Despite what you might think, we're professionals and we don't take things personally"". Rodriguez does not take things personally, yet he felt the need to refer to Ackman as a ""spoiled brat"" for requesting a deadline extension in board nominations. While he went on to say that this would have required modifications to the company bylaws, Ackman says that changes could be made that only apply to Pershing Square. Rodriguez's knee-jerk reaction to Ackman's request for an extension completely contradicts what he has gone on to say in reference to the situation, as he has tried to claim he was acting as a professional instead of addressing Ackman's major points with conciseness and clarity.Source: Pershing Square presentation, ADP: The Time is Now (page 14)Pershing: ADP, founded by accountants, has primarily focused on their namesake, data processing. Today, companies are in need of a suite of HR products, these products are referred to Beyond Payroll HCM. If you want to be best in class, you must offer a comprehensive product. If there is a task HR needs to perform, there is likely a product offered to improve or optimize the execution. It is clear that ADP is the dominant player in the payroll space, but failing to evolve can lead to major problems in a world where technology rules.IBM (NYSE:IBM) is a great example of what can happen if you fail to evolve quickly. They have experienced a shrinking revenue stream for 21 consecutive quarters. Analysts have questions about financial engineering that IBM may be using to maintain dividends and boost numbers. Cloud based start-ups and companies that are focused on newer technology have steadily taken customers from IBM. Failure to quickly evolve from legacy business leads to a major bleed out of customers to companies that provide technologically advanced services.Source: Pershing Square presentation, ADP: The Time is Now (page 15)Pershing: ADP understands that they are failing to evolve quickly. To combat this, they have made many different acquisitions over the years. Failure to create organic growth is a major issue for ADP and speaks to a lack of action from management. In many cases, these products are patched together on the back end or as Pershing says, ""cobbled together"".While I know that strategic acquisition can help to accelerate growth and bring better products to market, it is not necessarily an efficient long term strategy. Constant acquisitions to keep up with the evolution of HCM Beyond Payroll products has led to a confusing product structure. A company should strive for a strong culture that creates organic growth. The only real example of company culture is illustrated by their long-standing executives, most of whom were promoted from within.Source: Pershing Square presentation, ADP: The Time is Now (page 18)Pershing: An overview of ADP's business HCM business, which represents 87% of net revenue (illustrated on slide 6), show that they have strong competitive positions in three of their four markets. The Enterprise level, which drives 20% of ES revenue, looks to be vulnerable to newer players like Ultimate (NASDAQ:ULTI) which have soared in this space.I find this slide to be very representative of ADP's current situation. At every level, there are many strong competing companies eager to take ADP's clients. They should be very focused on the Enterprise level, where they do offer a great product in Vantage, but they are also offering multiple other products. This is a space where I believe they should look closely at Ultimate and Workday and see why they have found so much success with their new technology.Source: Pershing Square presentation, ADP: The Time is Now (page 21)Pershing also made claims that ADP looks to be losing market share. Carlos Rodriguez addressed this claim on CNBC, stating that Pershing failed to realize that the March 2009 number included stand-alone clients. The 2017 number is in reference to payroll customers and does not include stand-alone clients. Rodriguez went on to say, ""So our client count has not gone down from 5,000 to 2,500. In fact, it's about slightly up to modestly up depending on your perspective."" This is a misunderstanding that could have been clarified had ADP and Ackman agreed to go over the presentation in a private meeting, instead the two sides were at odds when it became clear ADP would fight to retain their current board. Even if these are two different numbers and one reflects stand-alone plus pay roll clients, Rodriguez still gives a nebulous response in reference to their client growth.This is a misunderstanding that could have been clarified had ADP and Ackman agreed to go over the presentation in a private meeting, instead the two sides were at odds when it became clear ADP would fight to retain their current board. Even if these are two different numbers and one reflects stand-alone plus pay roll clients, I feel that Rodriguez still gave a nebulous response in reference to their client growth.Source: Pershing Square presentation, ADP: The Time is Now (page 21)Under the assumption that Rodriguez's statement in regard to where the difference in these two numbers comes from is true, this down trending line does not actually illustrate ADP's client growth. If instead, they have remained flat from 2009 to 2017, this chart still shows the rapid growth of Ultimate and Workday in this space. In order for both of these companies to gain this much traction, it is clear they are offering different or superior products than ADP. Since 2011, Ultimate has only spent a total of $590 million dollars on r&d yet the continue to grow at an impressive pace.Source: Pershing Square presentation, ADP: The Time is Now (page 103)Pershing: The slide above represents the difference in spending between ADP and their competitors. Ultimate has managed to grow revenue quickly, yet they are spending much less than ADP on r&d. As a younger company, growth may come easier, but they are on pace to reach more than $2 billion dollars of revenue by 2022. If Ultimate can maintain their trajectory, there is no question they will cut into ADP's client base.I understand that as a younger company, growth may come easier, but they are on pace to reach more than $2 billion dollars of revenue by 2022. If Ultimate can maintain their trajectory, there is no question they will cut into ADP's client base. That being said, ADP still have a huge advantage over these companies. With major r&d spending and capex in the short term, they will continue to dominate their competitors in the long term.Source: Pershing Square presentation, ADP: The Time is Now (page 34)Pershing: The above slide illustrates an important takeaway from Pershing Square's thesis. ADP prides themselves on their high touch business model. Lee Cooperman, a former board member, spoke up, saying that Ackman should reconsider his decision to seek board seats. Cooperman's warning actually points to one of ADP's largest problems. A High touch business does not lead to maximized margins. While it is clear one of ADP's strengths is their customer service, it is not an efficient way to keep clients happy. If ADP were to offer more updated and functional products, they would not need such a high headcount for customer service. This is not to say that ADP customers are unhappy, they are just being serviced in an antiquated manner.Today, products that are intuitive and efficient are preferable. As a millennial, I can speak to this point. Younger people want products that offer suggested solutions and troubleshooting videos in place of having to reach out to someone from customer service in a call center. ADP should do everything in their power to keep their customers happy, but I know first hand that younger generations do not prefer high touch service.While they pride themselves on their business model, I believe they are positioning themselves for failure with younger clients are less likely to appreciate interaction with customer service. Whether or not you agree with a move away from human interaction, there is no question that it is inefficient to continue providing superior service through headcount and not explore the effects that better products have on the need for customer service. Source: Pershing Square presentation, ADP: The Time is Now (page 54)Pershing: The chart above illustrates how high the headcount at ADP is and why their competitors have stronger margins. When factoring out the PEO pass-throughs, ADP is generating $161 dollars per employee, while major competitors like Ultimate and Workday generate well over $200 dollars. ADP should be able to reach comparable numbers if they can improve their technology.Again, I think this perfectly illustrates where the problem is. ADP is not a bad company, they are the most dominant in this space and they have been for some time. This is why I am skeptical of commentary from management. There is no reason that ADP should not be able to post similar numbers to their competitors. This is likely a result of too many employees and inefficient technology. Source: Pershing Square presentation, ADP: The Time is Now (page 86)Pershing: ADP is in a business that's focus has shifted towards technology. Why should a tech company have such a large footprint? One of the very positive takeaways from this office structure is that ADP owns roughly 40% of this office space. As technological breakthroughs occur and more intuitive products are made, some of this real estate can be leased or sold, creating a new revenue stream for the company. This is a major opportunity for ADP and it is something that they should be pursuing.I completely agree with the point made by Pershing Square. Moving forward, companies will have to adjust to prosper in a world that depends on technology and online services. This same thing is happening in the retail space. If a retail company owns many of their stores, often times it is more logical to move more products online and lease their store spaces to generate more revenue. Why should ADP be missing out on this opportunity?Source: Pershing Square presentation, ADP: The Time is Now (page 92)Pershing: Another important point raised in the presentation relates again to the legacy products that ADP is using. Dinosaur languages like COBOL make it very difficult to attract talented younger programmers. By using older languages, ADP is failing to create an environment that can attract the best young programmers.I feel that this will cause major problems for ADP. Younger people have no idea how to use these languages. At what point are they going to transition to more modern languages that are being used at startups and in classrooms. If you do not have young and innovative minds in your office, you are likely to miss out on opportunities for improvement and efficiency.Source: Pershing Square presentation, ADP: The Time is Now (page 116)On a quantitative level, I cannot speak to exactly what kind of savings will be created by attracting the best programmers. From a qualitative standpoint, there is no question that hiring talented young programmers will result in better products while helping to position ADP for future success and growth.Source: Pershing Square presentation, ADP: The Time is Now (page 114)Despite what Rodriguez has said, it does seem that ADP has an insular management. I am not saying that promoting from within is negative, in fact in many cases it leads to very competent management who know their industry inside and out. There is only one member of senior executive management that has spent less than 10 years with ADP. This can lead to complacency as everyone has a similar understanding and view of the business. Having someone with an entirely different perspective can be illuminating. After spending a lot of time within the same company, it is only human nature to become inherently biased and view things through your own lens. If Rodriguez claims that they do not have an insular culture, why then are they not offering one board seat to someone that owns 8.3% of their shares.Source: Data from SEC filingsIt seems outlandish to deny a board seat to someone who owns 8.3% of your shares. Especially considering that directors and executive officers as a group. own less than 1% of shares. How can Rodriguez say there is no insularity and he does not get personally offended, yet deny a board seat to someone who owns 200x more shares than him and has had great success in past activist campaigns. Someone with this large of a stake clearly has the best interests of the company in mind. It seems that Rodriguez is taking actions to preserve his position at the company. Rodriguez's actions are completely understandable but do not be fooled by what he is saying. Actions speak louder than words and denying an 8.3% shareholder a board seat points to an insular culture.Source: Pershing Square presentation, ADP: The Time is Now (page 127)Pershing: Finally, let's take a look at the key financial model assumptions that Pershing Square has come up with. Under the transformation model assumptions, Pershing believes that ADP can reach an EPS of $8.70. In the status quo scenario, EPS will reach $5.90 by 2022. The status quo takes into consideration commentary from management and 2017 guidance issued by ADP, while the transformation model assumes that ADP can work on the many issues that Pershing touched on in this lengthy presentation.Even if Pershing was wrong in some of their assumptions because they were not able to privately meet with ADP, Ackman raises some very strong points. There is a difference of $2.80 in EPS between the two models. If Pershing came to some of their conclusion due to misunderstanding, there is still likely major room for improvement to ADP's business, revenue, and margins. ADP was not convincing in their response to the presentation, issuing a brief statement 2 hours after its conclusion. They claimed that they are not ""resting on their laurels"". Past performance is not indicative of future results. ADP has an extremely impressive dividend record and recent stock performance. Despite this, they actually are resting on their laurels. Rather than addressing the many points raised by Ackman, the CEO has resorted to name-calling. The Chairman of the Board, John Jones, was unwilling to take a call from some of the previous CEO's Ackman has worked with. This includes Seifi Ghasemi, the CEO of Air Products. It is clear that ADP is not actually open to change or outside perspective and they are much more interested in preserving their current leadership. Sometimes it takes an entirely different and outside perspective to see things from a new angle. If ADP fails to address some of the questions that have been raised, they will find themselves losing their competitive advantage. If instead, they show urgency and a willingness to improve their technology, they will be able to leverage their current competitive advantage to ensure even stronger performance in the future. Right now, it seems that Rodriguez and ADP will ignore the well-researched points raised by Ackman because a few of his numbers may have been incorrect. Rodriguez can keep comparing his own returns to those of Pershing Square, in which case, he is ironically the one acting like a spoiled brat.Source: Pershing Square presentation, ADP: The Time is Now (page 139)As of today (8/25/17), There is a major potential that this situational will result in a proxy fight. The two sides have finally agreed to meet on September 5th. Personally, I think it is unlikely that they are able to settle their differences and come to an agreement. Either way, I believe that this will all have a positive effect on ADP's future. Even if you do not agree with Ackman and the way he approached this situation, as an activist his goal to gain board seats and implement a plan, not make friends. If he gains these board seats, either through a proxy fight or an agreement with ADP, I believe that it will result in great changes for ADP. If he does not end up gaining these boards seats, ADP will still be forced to respond to concerns that are raised. Either way, they are likely to make some changes or come out with answers as to how they are dressing some of the points made in Pershing Square's presentation. As this continues to shake out, investors can look to make an entry into ADP as there seems to be a ton of room for revenue and margin growth at the company."
4087887,21151,2017-07-15T14:50:22-04:00,"ADP benefited from several labor regulation changes to promote its products.The company has become a solid player offering many cross-selling opportunities in its industry.Unfortunately, the recent stock rally has pushed ADP's price over reasonable standings.","Investment ThesisAutomatic Data Processing (ADP) is the largest USA payroll provider. It uses its 650,000 clients and many HR related products to create strong cross-selling opportunities. As clients use more ADP services, it becomes harder to switch their main HR products provider. ADP shows an impressive dividend growth history with 42 consecutive years with an increase. Unfortunately, the recent stock price surge of 81% over the past 5 years has priced ADP above its fair value.Understanding the BusinessADP is a comprehensive global provider of cloud-based Human Capital Management (HCM) solutions that unite HR, payroll, talent, time, tax and benefits administration, and a leader in business outsourcing services, analytics and compliance expertise.The company operates under 2 segments. Employer services are basically where ADP offers its payroll services along with many cross-selling options such as benefits administration, talent management, HR management, etc.The second segment, Professional Employer Organisation, is growing rapidly. ADP offers clients to “hire” its employees. Therefore, new workers are employed by ADP (where payroll and other benefits are managed) while they work for ADP’s client. This gives ADP’s clients the opportunity to offer better benefits packages to their new employees as they get the large size price of an organization like ADP.Source: Author chart – numbers from ADP 2016 Financial StatementADP is more than a simple software business where its key advantage remains the customer support it provides to smaller employers. Many ADP clients don’t have a HR department, making the customer service support and other related services a solid bond to ADP.RevenuesSource: YChartsADP has recently benefited from many labor regulation changes and requirements such as the Affordable Care Act, often nicknamed as Obamacare. Many small companies can’t follow all regulation modifications and therefore rely on ADP services to comply to these rules.In order to increase its revenue, ADP focuses on cross-selling opportunities. While it can enter in a business with its payroll services, it then becomes easier for it to offer many other products. Its sweet spot is businesses with 25 to 100 employees where they often don’t have a HR department and will require additional services from ADP.EarningsSource: YChartsADP now has over 650,000 client relationships (ADP website) providing it a solid base of earnings. Also, adding new clients to its platform has now come to a minimal cost due to ADP's large size.ADP's second segment of business (PEO) is also a great alternative for smaller employers who are looking to offer better conditions to their employees. As employee benefits are very important for many workers, this division could become a strong growth vector in the future.Dividend Growth PerspectiveADP has increased its dividend payment each year for 42 consecutive years making it part of both the Dividend Aristocrats and Dividend Achievers list. The Dividend Achievers Index refers to all public companies that have successfully increased their dividend payments for at least ten consecutive years. At the time of writing this article, there were 265 companies that achieved this milestone. You can get the complete list of Dividend Achievers with comprehensive metrics here.Source: YChartsWhile ADP's dividend payment grew from $0.395/share quarterly in 2012 to $0.57/share in 2017, it wasn’t enough to keep ADP's yield from going lower and lower. This is because the stock price surged by 81% (as at July 14th 2017). Still, ADP provides a good combination of dividend growth and decent yield.Source YChartsLooking at both payout and cash payout ratios, we can see that while the dividend payment increased, both ratios remain under control around 55%. This gives management enough room to keep the 42-year dividend increase streak alive for many years to come. ADP meets my 7 dividend growth investing principles.Potential DownsidesUnfortunately, not everything is pinky pink with ADP. While many labor regulations enabled ADP to gain more clients and increased both its revenues and earnings, most of the wave has clearly gone through. In its latest quarterly update, management acknowledged a decrease of 7% in new business booking (ADP press release). Let’s hope it’s a temporary bad quarter, but this situation needs to be addressed.ADP is also highly dependent of the U.S. workforce. Back in 2008, ADP had 585,000 clients. This number dropped to 550,000 in 2010 due to the recent U.S. recession. While recession is not a concern at the moment, ADP's business will suffer upon the next one.The increasing amount of cloud services and Software as a Solution (SaaS) may expose a part of ADP clientele to a risk of moving toward a cheaper (but with no support) solution. ADP's strength will remain in providing a global service and additional support to its clients making the switching cost very high.ValuationNow let’s take a look at how ADP is valued. The first method I use is a quick glance at the 10-year PE history. This tells me how the market valued ADP in the past:Source: YChartsAs you can see, ADP has never showed a higher valuation than in the past 12 months. It looks overvalued.Digging deeper, I’ll use a double stage dividend discount model to determine ADP's value as a dividend paying machine. Since management has enough room to increase its dividend, I used a 10-year growth rate of 7.50% and a terminal growth rate of 6%. Since ADP has a solid business model with a relatively stable client base, I used a 9% discount rate.Source: how to use the Dividend Discount ModelThen again, ADP seems overvalued by about 10%. There is no short-term upside potential here.Final ThoughtI respect ADP's stellar dividend growth history. It looks like a good option if you are looking to add stability to your income portfolio, but don’t expect much capital growth in the future. The low yield and high price are two factors playing against ADP at the moment. I would rather wait for a dip in the market before considering it.Disclaimer: I do not hold ADP in my DividendStocksRock portfolios.

4096187,63883,2017-08-08T06:15:52-04:00,"Shares of ADP recently spiked on news that activist investor Pershing Square had acquired an 8% stake.
        Activist investors can often boost share prices in the short-term, but their long-term track records are spotty.
        ADP has done a fine job managing itself. It is a Dividend Aristocrat, and has raised its dividend for 42 years in a row.","Published by Bob CiuraShares of Automatic Data Processing (ADP) are up 6% since July 27th, when reports surfaced that activist investor Pershing Square Capital Management was building an investment stake in the company.On August 4th, ADP confirmed that Pershing Square had purchased 8% of the company, mostly through derivatives. Separately, the company noted that Pershing Square wants five out of 10 board seats, as well as a new CEO.The involvement of an activist investor could have significant implications for ADP investors. The company is highly regarded for its dividend growth history.It has increased its dividend for 42 years in a row, including a solid 8% dividend raise in 2017.ADP is a Dividend Aristocrat, a group of 51 stocks in the S&P 500 Index with 25+ years of consecutive dividend increases. You can see all 51 Dividend Aristocrats here.This article will discuss why long-term ADP investors may not be cheering the news.Business OverviewA peek into Pershing Square’s stock holdings reveals a concentrated portfolio, consisting of just six positions as of March 31st.Pershing Square is not a highly diversified fund. This is why ADP investors should pay particularly close attention as these events unfold. Pershing Square makes big bets on companies it feels strongly about, then acts aggressively to see its desired changes materialize.It is unclear what specific changes Pershing Square wants to make. One could easily argue that no changes are even necessary at this time, because ADP is a very high-quality business.ADP provides administrative services such as payroll, benefits administration, and human resources management, to companies of all sizes. Its clients find great value in these services, because outsourcing these functions allows them to focus on growing their businesses.ADP has two core operating segments:The company is highly diversified. It has approximately 700,000 clients.ADP management does not appear to view Pershing Square’s investment favorably. In a press release, the company stated:Given Pershing Square's spotty recent track record, ADP investors might prefer the company to remain in control under its current leadership.Growth ProspectsADP has done a great job on its own. It has a long track record of raising dividends each year, thanks to its steady earnings growth.From fiscal 2013-2017, ADP grew earnings-per-share by 56%.Fiscal 2017 was another strong performance. Total revenue and adjusted earnings-per-share increased 6% and 13%, respectively, for the year. Organic revenue, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange, rose by 7% for the year.Source: FY17 Earnings Presentation, page 4Both operating segments grew last fiscal year. Revenue from Employer Services and PEO Services increased 4% and 13%, respectively.ADP’s two business segments complement each other well.The Employer Services business is not growing as quickly, but it carries stronger margins. For the fiscal year, Employer Services generated a 30.6% operating margin, compared with a 12.9% operating margin for PEO Services.On the other hand, the PEO Services segment is a high-growth business. For fiscal 2018, ADP expects the Employer Services segment to grow revenue by 2%-3%, and a 50-75 basis-point reduction in segment operating margin.Meanwhile, PEO Services revenue is expected to increase 11%-13% revenue growth in fiscal 2018, and segment margin is expected to expand by 25-50 basis points for the year. Source: FY17 Earnings Presentation, page 6A key growth catalyst for ADP is that regulation continues to increase. The complex regulatory and compliance environment makes ADP’s services extremely valuable.This also helps provide ADP with steady growth. The company expects a 5%-7% increase in new global bookings in the upcoming year.ADP is focusing on its Human Capital Management, or HCM, business, after its 2014 spin-off of CDK Global. The HCM business includes software and service-based products, which help clients become more efficient in recruiting, payroll, and management abilities.Competitive Advantages & Recession PerformanceADP’s competitive advantages include a global business model, and industry reputation. As previously mentioned, the burden of regulatory compliance provides a high floor underneath ADP’s profits.As a global industry leader, ADP has scale and financial resources that smaller competitors cannot match. It has hundreds of thousands of clients, thanks to its strong brand in the industry.Since payroll and benefits are such important services to businesses around the world, ADP has a sizable economic moat.These competitive advantages allow for resilient earnings growth, even during recessions. For further evidence of this, consider ADP’s performance during the Great Recession:ADP grew its earnings-per-share in 2008 and 2009, which is highly impressive. It continued to grow earnings after the recession ended.The ability to grow earnings consistently, even during recessions, bodes very well for ADP’s dividend.Dividend AnalysisADP is a very strong dividend growth stock. It has increased its dividend each year for more than four decades. It typically raises its dividend in the mid-to-high single digit range.After the 2017 dividend increase, ADP has an annualized dividend payout of $2.28 per share. This represents a dividend yield of 2%.The dividend payout appears to be highly secure.ADP generated adjusted earnings-per-share of $3.70 in fiscal 2017. Based on this, ADP carries a payout of 62%. This is a healthy payout ratio, and leaves room for continued dividend growth.Another positive for the dividend is that ADP has a strong balance sheet. It has $2.78 billion of cash and cash equivalents, compared with $2 billion of long-term debt.A reasonable forecast for future returns is 10%-12% annualized, based on 8%-10% earnings growth, plus the 2% current dividend yield.ADP isn’t the cheapest stock around, with a price-to-earnings ratio of 30, based on fiscal 2017 results. However, the company could still generate satisfactory returns, based on earnings growth and dividends.Final ThoughtsADP seems to fit the bill as a high-quality dividend growth stock. It has a strong business model, and a leadership position in the industry.News that Bill Ackman’s Pershing Square had purchased an 8% stake in the company sent the share price higher. That said, it is not clear how the activist investor would improve ADP’s long-term prospects.ADP isn’t broken, and doesn’t appear to need fixing. It has delivered consistent dividend increases for 42 years in a row. As a result, investors should pay close attention to what direction Pershing Square intends to take the company."
4113253,55512,2017-10-12T17:11:27-04:00,"Bill Ackman is aggressively challenging ADP.At the same time, he believes in ADP and think it can double.But based on Ackman's history, and ADP's current price, is it time to invest alongside?","Back in August, Bill Ackman built a $2.3B position in Automatic Data Processing (ADP). According to Pershing Square's Q2 letter, here's how Ackman views the company:Furthermore, at the Great Investors Best Ideas ""GIBI"" Conference in Dallas, Ackman also added that he thinks it's a quality business that's not capital intensive and enjoys secular tailwinds. He sees lots of growth ahead because they are able to automate employees. Ackman thinks the stock's a double.Should you follow Ackman? Well, before we do a more direct analysis, I think we need to dig deeper into what he really thinks and what's he's planning on doing. He's an activist after all.First, Ackman claims that ADP hasn't been transparent:And...There's more to this. He's totally unimpressed with CEO Carlos Rodriguez. In several media appearances, Ackman throws Rodriguez under the bus. He's very aggressive.Second, we can look at how Ackman is going after the company. Specifically, he's looking to get as many as three board seats. Ackman's proxy fight has been messy and hands-on too:Although Ackman thinks the business is simple and easy to understand, he's simultaneously looking to:So, Ackman likes the company and sees huge potential. However, he's being very aggressive in his activism. This isn't a simple buy and hold by a friendly hedge fund or white knight.I also want to point out that Pershing has underperformed the S&P 500 (84% for S&P 500 versus 22.8% gross for Ackman). Furthermore, you can see how fees have destroyed performance (gross return of 22.8% versus 7.1% net of fees). It looks like this:The short answer is yes!I agree with Ackman that ADP is a great company. The business model is strong. ADP has been around since 1949 and currently has about 700K clients, in more than 100 countries.About 80% of their business is employer services and the other 20% is professional organization service. ADP helps with human capital management, e.g., payroll, benefits administration, HR tools, and more.But a strong company doesn't mean we've got a strong buy.I first want to focus on the dividend history and performance in relation to the S&P 500. Here's a view from F.A.S.T. Graphs:The yield right now is about 2%, which might be a bit low for some investors. However, dividend growth has averaged over 12%. That said, the payout ratio has ballooned from the middle 20% range to over 60%.ADP got ahead of itself in terms of dividend growth because earnings during this time have only grown around 8%. Therefore, I expect that we might continue to see middle to upper-middle single digit dividend increases; perhaps in the 6-8% range.While earnings growth over the last few years has been 10-11%, I suspect management might wish to bring down the payout ratio. I admit I don't have a crystal ball. Maybe they will keep pushing hard? If they want to be aggressive, then it's possible dividend increases will land in the 8-10% range but that will keep the payout ratio at 60% or above.Taken together, I think the conservative range is a 6-8% increase and in the aggressive range, a 10-12% increase is possible. So, the next increase is likely to land in the 6-12% range.The key point here is that earnings absolutely support an increase and the dividend is extremely safe based on that, plus their excellent dividend history.First, let's look at earnings over 20 years:This is a very strong company with a great earnings history. The average growth is nearly 8%. Earnings are not ""lumpy"" or messy, including the Dot-Com implosion and the Financial Crisis.You can also see that ADP trades at a high P/E with an average of almost 26 over the last 20 years. There's almost always a P/E premium with ADP, especially since 2012 when price really took off.Now, let's bring this all together and look at price and dividend yield over these past 20 years. The story gets very interesting.As you can see, the best time to buy would have been between 2008 and 2010. No surprise there, of course. In 2011, there were a couple of chances to buy with a P/E below 20, then in 2012 for a short time. But really, since 2012, ADP has been on a rocket to the moon.So, even as earnings have grown by over 7% in 10+ years and dividend growth has been over 8%, the dividend yield just keeps dropping:It's all about the price. It's all about valuation. Price is far ahead of value. The P/E ratio today is above 30, which compares to 25 over the last 20 years. There's growth in earnings and there's growth in the dividend payout ratio. Yet even with earnings growth and dividend payout growth, it's simply not enough to push up the yield.I think Bill Ackman is right that this is a great company. However, I don't see how any sort of activism can provide the gains necessary for a doubling of ADP. Well, to be perfectly clear, I don't see it in the short run, that's for sure.Furthermore, Ackman has gravity and regression to mean working against him. The 30 P/E is in nosebleed territory, especially compared to the 20 years that I'm looking at. This tells me Ackman is too optimistic.While I wouldn't think of shorting ADP, it's not a buy at this price. I'm not going to get interested in ADP unless it drops below $100 between now and the middle of next year. It's a great company and I'd love to be a partner. But I will be prudent and I will be patient. Again, this is not a short or a sell. If I owned ADP, I'd hold and enjoy the safe and growing dividend."
4041857,23452,2017-02-02T05:27:14-05:00,A comparative quantitative analysis using a unique free cash flow ratio.Explains why both companies can be considered “Trump Plays”.Shows why both companies are ideal conservative investments for the long-term investor.,"On February 1, 2017, Seeking Alpha's News Editor Niloofer Shaikh reported the following: Automatic Data Processing Beats By $0.06, Misses On Revenue.I am an investor in Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) and Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) as I believe both to be pure Trump plays. Both companies operate similar and unique business models that tend to do very well in inflationary environments, which I believe will soon be upon us. I say this because there should soon be a great demand for the products that will be used in the infrastructure build out that President Trump is planning. Oil pipelines, the Mexican Wall and bridge renovations, among other things, will spur demand for the underlying raw materials that President Trump will probably also insist should come from the US.If the products needed are indeed made in the US, then higher labor costs and limited raw materials will be the norm. This will cause inflation, as it will eliminate cheaper foreign imports from the equation. Interest rates tend to rise substantially in such an environment, as the Federal Reserve does not like it when inflation passes 2% and raises interest rates in order to combat it.Both ADP and Paychex have unique business models that would shine in such a scenario, as one of the most margin-friendly parts of the payroll business are the ""future tax escrow accounts"" that each manages for its clients. Each collects the future tax payments from its clients and then generates interest revenue from the escrow in those accounts, until the taxes need to be paid to the various tax authorities. As interest rates rise, both companies generate more revenue from those escrow accounts. Here is ADP's Escrow information and forecast going forward:Client Funds Extended Investment Strategy Fiscal 2017 ForecastIt may seem like the interest rate revenue being generated from these accounts is small right now, but as interest rates rise, the interest revenue can grow substantially.Earnings AnalysisADP actually had good results for this past quarter as the PowerPoint slide below shows.But what caused the selloff in the company's shares was the 2017 guidance that management gave. Management surprised everyone when it forecast ""Worldwide New Business Bookings"" to be flat versus previous estimates of ""4% to 6%.""That was a real shocker, as it is very rare for ADP to hand out such guidance. During the conference call, management explained that this happened because potential clients put on hold any plans to make any moves until each could see what President Trump's plans were and whether he could implement them or not. So it's ironic that we have a pure Trump play that needed to adjust forward guidance because its customers are concerned about President Trump's plans. It sure proves that uncertainty is abounding, and since Wall Street hates two things more than anything else:1) Uncertainty2) SurprisesWe may just get both in droves going forward with a Trump Administration.Having said that let us now analyze both companies so we can demonstrate why I believe both can be considered very solid conservative investments for the long-term investor.In this article, I will present a real-time quantitative analysis of both companies employing a unique ratio that will demonstrate the power of free cash flow in the investment process and then give an opinion on how an investor should act based on my results.When analyzing almost any company, concentrate on its free cash flow generation, as that is where the rubber hits the road when it comes to finding out the truth. Before I show you the long-term Datafile for ADP. Let us first do a TTM (trailing-twelve month) analysis of its Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow and then compare it to its current price.Here are the two ratios that we will be using in our analysis, and for those new to this type of analysis, one can get a good introduction by reading my analysis of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) by clicking here.Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/[(net income per share + depreciation per share) + (capital spending per diluted share)]Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - [((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding)]ADPMarket Price Per Share = $95.00Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current LiabilitiesTotal Current Assets = $30,124,000,000Total Current Liabilities = $26,719,300,000Working Capital = $3,404,900,000Long-Term Debt = $2,007,700,000Diluted Shares Outstanding = 455,300,000Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding)Sherlock Debt Divisor = $95.00 - (($3,404,900,000 - $2,007,700,000)/ 455,300,000)Sherlock Debt Divisor = $95.00 - $3.07 = $91.93Since ADP has less Long-Term Debt vs. Working Capital, we therefore must reward it and use the $91.93 result as the new numerator in all our calculations.Price-to-Bernhard/Buffett Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/[(net income per share + depreciation per share) + (capital spending per diluted share)]Sherlock Debt Divisor = $91.93Net Income per diluted share = $1,524,600,000/455,300,000 = $3.35Depreciation per diluted share = $390,600,000/455,300,000 = $0.86Capital Spending per diluted share = $-161,600,000/455,300,000 = $-0.35$3.35 + $0.86 + ($-0.35) = $3.86Price-to-Bernhard/Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = $91.93/$3.86 = 23.82Now if you go to my Friedrich Legend (on what is considered a good or bad result), you will notice that our result of 23.82 is an average result.We last ran our Datafile for ADP on February 1, 2017, and our Friedrich Algorithm gave a recommendation to our subscribers to hold it.Here is the chart of our Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow ratio results for ADP:The Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Ratio considers a stock a bargain when it trades under 15 times and overbought when it trades over 30 times. Therefore, from the current results in the chart above, ADP comes in as a ""HOLD.""Let us now compare those results to its main competitor Paychex.Here is our Price-to-Bernhard Buffett Free Cash Flow Analysis for Paychex.PaychexMarket Price Per Share = $58.52Working Capital = Total Current Assets - Total Current LiabilitiesTotal Current Assets = $4,215,700,000Total Current Liabilities = $3,784,100,000Working Capital = $431,600,000Long-Term Debt = $0Diluted Shares Outstanding = 362,600,000Sherlock Debt Divisor = Market Price Per Share - ((Working Capital - Long-Term Debt)/Diluted Shares Outstanding)Sherlock Debt Divisor = $58.52 - (($431,600,000- $0)/ 362,600,000)Sherlock Debt Divisor = $58.52 - ($1.19) = $57.33Since Paychex has less Long-Term Debt vs. Working Capital, we therefore must reward it and use the $57.33 result as the new numerator in all our calculations.Price-to-Bernhard/Buffett Ratio = Sherlock Debt Divisor/[(net income per share + depreciation per share) + (capital spending per diluted share)]Sherlock Debt Divisor = $57.33Net Income per diluted share = $778,000,000/362,600,000 = $2.15Depreciation per diluted share = $194,400,000/362,600,000 = $0.54Capital Spending per diluted share = $-96,000,000/362,600,000 = $-0.26$2.15 + $0.54 + ($-0.26) = $2.43Price-to-Bernhard/Buffett Free Cash Flow Ratio = $57.33/$2.43 =23.5923.59 is considered an average result for this ratio by our Friedrich Investing System and also comes in as a ""HOLD.""Going forward, it is very rare for a company like ADP to give such strange guidance, as it along with Paychex are run as very conservative operations. Both companies' Price to Bernhard Free Cash Flow charts as well as each corresponding Friedrich Datafile and chart show a pattern of consistency that is very rare these days in our opinion.I am not worried at all about ADP's lowered guidance, as I am quite confident that we will see higher interest rates soon, and once that happens, both ADP and Paychex should do very well. Both are ""Holds"" for now but if someone is looking for a safe way to play the Trump agenda, then these two companies should surely be included in your watchlists.In conclusion, it is my belief that free cash flow analysis is the ultimate tool when analyzing companies, and my hope is that you may add these ratios to your own investor toolbox in order to help you in your own due diligence.

Its current yield of 2.31% is 3rd lowest in the portfolio, after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at 1.65% and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at 2.30%. ADP provides 1.9% of the portfolio income.I remain long ADP because:This article updates an October 3, 2016 review of ADP. At the time of the review, ADP's price of $88.20 was 8% off its 52-week high of $96, which at that time was also its all-time high price.As of May 19, 2017, the price was $98.62, an 11.8% increase in the 7.5 months since the previous article. In the interim, ADP made a new all-time high price of $105.68 on April 27, 2017. The current price of $98.62 is 6.7% off the 52-week (all-time) high price of $105.68, and 16.9% above the 52-week low price of $84.36 on May 19, 2016.This graph shows the price action for the past year, with support in the $84-$86 range and resistance in the $105 area:(Graph from Seeking Alpha)This graph shows ADP's strong 10-year price appreciation:(Graph from Seeking Alpha)The story told by the two graphs is that ADP has had significant, relatively steady price appreciation since the bear market of 2008-09, and that in the past two months the stock has encountered resistance around $105.(Logo graphic from The Cerbat Gem)A leader in human resource servicesADP began in 1949 as Automatic Payrolls, Inc., a way for companies to outsource their payroll bookkeeping. Today, ADP provides payroll services for 650,000 companies in 110 countries. The company is a global provider of cloud-based Human Capital Management, or HCM, solutions that bring together HR, payroll, talent, time, tax and benefits administration. ADP is a leader in business outsourcing services, analytics and compliance expertise.An April 2017 Corporate Overview discloses that ADP pays 26 million workers in the U.S., one-sixth of the nation's workforce, plus an additional 13 million workers in other countries. ADP electronically moved $1.7 trillion in client tax, direct deposit, and related client funds in fiscal 2016 within the U.S. The company processed nearly 60 million W-2s in 2016 within the U.S.The ""ADP Employment Report"" provides government, economists and market analysts with a snapshot of U.S. employment statistics. ADP is now beginning to monetize this wealth of data because they can provide ""real time"" data about job trends in the U.S.One quick way to assess the scope of ADP's business is to click on the ""Services and Products"" page of their exceptional website. They offer Human Resource, Payroll and Management solutions for a:A major part of ADP's work in recent years has been assisting companies deal with compliance with changing health reform legislation.42 years of dividend increasesThe list of Dividend Champions (25+ years), Contenders (10+) and Challengers (5+) maintained by David Fish indicates that ADP ranks 57th among U.S. companies in the number of consecutive years of dividend increases at 42. David indicates the following annual dividend growth rates for ADP:Since 2000, the lowest year-over-year percentage increase was 3.0% in 2010 and the highest increase was 26.1% in 2008. The increases for the 2 years prior to that (2006 and 2007) were 19.4% and 24.3%. This means ADP significantly ramped up its payout in the three years leading up to the Great Recession, but was able to continue its uninterrupted streak of dividend increases during and after the recession.The ""Chowder Rule"" number for ADP is 13.2, which is derived from a combination of the 5-year dividend growth rate of 11.0% plus the current yield of 2.2%.Conservative managementPresident and Chief Executive Officer Carlos Rodriguez and Chief Financial Officer Jan Siegmund take part in the quarterly earnings calls. ADP's fiscal year ends in June, so the most recent call was the Q3 2017 call on May 3, 2017. A replay of the webcast is available at the ADP website. A copy of the transcript is available from Seeking Alpha.From a review of ADP's expansion from 1949 to 2017, it's obvious that the company's management has been visionary and opportunistic. That growth has been fueled by solid financial practices and by the measured, step-by-step development of their business model. S&P gives ADP a credit rating of AA.The equity market value as of May 19, 2017 was: 446.5 million shares @ $98.62 = $44.034 billion. Total debt is $2.003 billion. Market equity + debt = $46.037 billion. On this basis, debt is 4.35% of capitalization. Finviz shows book value as $9.19 per share, which is usually the starting point for calculating debt as a percentage of capital: 446.5 million shares @ $9.19 = $4.103 billion. The book value of $4.103 billion plus debt of $2.003 billion = $6.106 billion. On this basis, debt is 32.8% of capitalization, which is roughly equal to the 32% debt shown by F.A.S.T. Graphs (below).Like many other technology companies, ADP is transitioning from older, ""legacy"" business platforms to leverage investments in their strategic cloud platforms, Vantage and Workforce Now.Q3 2017 net earnings grew by 10% to $588 million. Diluted EPS grew by 12% to $1.31, which saw a benefit from fewer shares outstanding from Q3 2016. Management is disappointed with new business bookings, and this is a metric to watch in coming quarters.The company expects adjusted diluted EPS to grow 13% to 14% in FY 2017 (which ends June 30). This is an increase from earlier guidance of 11% to 13%, partly impacted by a lower tax rate.Management expects to end FY 2017 with share repurchases of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, which includes any repurchases required to offset dilution related to employee benefit plans.Steady long-term growthThis table from BetterInvesting.org shows the steady upward movement of ADP's stock price and dividend over the past 5 years. It also shows a trend of P/E expansion, from an average P/E of 15.85 in 2012 to an average P/E of 24.05 in 2012. The payout ratio has grown from 54.8% in 2012 to 67.5% and 64.0% in 2015-16. The high yield has been dropping fairly steadily over this time, too.(Table from Better Investing)The F.A.S.T. Graph below reveals strong price appreciation, particularly since mid-2011. The upward price movement accelerated in the fall of 2015 and again in late 2016. I believe ADP qualifies for Chuck Carnevale's description of a stock that consistently is given a premium valuation by the market. I like to buy a stock when the (black) price line is in the dark green area. ADP came close to this area only at the depth of the 2008-09 bear market.F.A.S.T. Graphs also shows strong long-term growth in earnings and dividends, with dividends growing slightly faster than earnings. F.A.S.T. Graphs estimates EPS growth of 14%, 7% and 14% for each of the next 3 years. Finviz estimates annual EPS growth of 11.39% for the next five years. The recent price appreciation reflects support from the broad bull market and perhaps also the market's expectation that ADP will resume its historic earnings growth.(Graph from F.A.S.T. Graphs)Simply Safe Dividends shows that ADP has a dividend safety score higher than 97% of the companies in their database. The growth score is a very strong 84, and the yield is slightly above average (for the companies in their universe).(Data from Simply Safe Dividends)Pick your priceADP receives a moderate amount of attention on Seeking Alpha. In the past year there have been 17 regular articles. There were two each by William Stamm, including his March 20 article, ""ADP: Great Long-Term Total Return But Is It Too Expensive?"" and Charles Fournier, including his February 3 article, ""Automatic Data Processing: Too Expensive.""I would be happy to add a few shares of ADP, but I agree with Bill and Charles about the high valuation. I would rather buy on a pullback. My target price for adding some shares is $91.20, which would be a 2.5% yield at the current dividend, and slightly below my cost basis of $92.59. I've set an alert at Custom Stock Alerts to be notified if and when ADP reaches a 2.5% yield.At the time of my October 3 article, ADP's Price/Earnings ratio was 26.3 and the yield was 2.4%. Now, the P/E ratio is 27.0 and the yield is 2.3%.If you wanted to add some shares of ADP, what would be your target price?If the Volkswagen bus in this picture is extant and has made its way into your possession, it's probable that you could pick your price if you offered to sell it to ADP.(Photo from ADP History at company website)In an unrelated incident, ADP used a restored 1970 VW bus in a 2008 national advertising campaign. Amber Peebles, President of Athena Construction Group, was contacted by ADP regarding their ad campaign. She was asked, ""What do you do when you are not working?"" She mentioned her restored VW bus.

4031958,102327,2016-12-21T11:19:57-05:00,ADP is a dividend aristocrat doing a good job of growing earnings and dividends.ADP's recent price run up has made it too expensive.Option contracts can bring the price of ADP down to fair value.,"Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is a company offering payroll, HR, and administrative services to a wide range of companies. Its dividend and earnings growth make it a valuable investment partner, if only the price was lower. The recent run up in price has pushed it out of fair value range.Is ADP a good investment partner?I recently had a discussion with my brother about how his daughter was doing. She works in sales for ADP at an office near Orlando. According to my brother, she leads her office in sales and regularly exceeds her sales quotas. Seems ADP, at least in her sales office in central Florida, is doing quite well. I had over the years some interest in ADP, in part because several places I have worked over the years use some of its services, but this conversation about my niece convinced me to look deeper into the company.Taking a closer look at ADP to determine if it is a good investment partner, I first came across this article on SA by Charles Fournier. Charles provides a good in-depth analysis of ADP, but for my purposes the main takeaways are: the dividend is $2.28, the projected growth in the EPS (for ongoing operations) for next year is 11%-13%, and based on EPS (and EPS growth), Charles thinks ADP is at a value with a price of $92 or so.This slide, taken from the 2016 annual report, shows the growth that ADP has had from 2012 to 2016 fiscal years. Revenues have grown at a CAGR of 5.57% to nearly $11.7 billion. Total Earnings have grown at a CAGR of 4.61% to approximately $1.49 billion. Assets have grown at a CAGR of 7.22% to $43.67 billion. EPS from continuing operations has increased at a CAGR of 6.08% to $3.25. The EPS change reflects both an increase in earnings and a modest decrease in shares outstanding. The growth show with these numbers is evidence that its not just my niece's office that is growing. Long-term debt grew a lot during 2016 but was only 20% of the value of the assets added that year.From this presentation on the ADP website, this slide shows projections for fiscal 2017.The latest earnings release didn't contain any startling new information, but a beat on EPS is always a good sign. This more detailed report from the ADP website confirms that the 1Q numbers are on target or better to hit the 2017 forecasted growth revenue of 11-13%. Taking into account various business sales that were arranged in the 1Q as well as actual operations, ADP now forecasts full-year earnings per share from continuing operations to grow 15% to 17% compared to the prior forecast of 6% to 8% growth and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 11% to 13% compared to the prior forecast of 10% to 12% growth. These numbers look to me like what SA contributor Chowder calls a beat and raise. ADP in the 1Q of its 2017 fiscal year beat on earnings expectations and raised guidance on both revenue and earnings. While Charles Fournier couldn't see a reason for the price run up starting in early November, it looks to me like the earnings report with its beat on EPS and raising guidance is the likely reason for the price run up.Checking the CCC List, confirms the dividend of $2.28 and gives 10.5% as the lowest DGR value for use in the DDM calculation. With a 42-year history, ADP has a history of dividend increases more than long enough to satisfy the most demanding dividend growth investor.Between Charles' article, information on the company website and ADP's entry in the CCC List, it seems clear to me that ADP would make a good investment partner to help me achieve my dividend growth goals. It's now a matter of if the market is currently offering shares of ADP at an attractive price.What's a good price?To figure out a good price, I do a DDM calculation using my Excel based DDM calculator (pictured above, you can see the web-based calculator I based it on here and read a discussion on how the formulas were developed here).Often, for higher yield stocks, I use a terminal rate of 0% but for ADP, I think a 3% value works better. The growth phase growth rate is less than the bottom of the projected range of EPS growth for next year, so it's likely that the payout ratio will be stable over the next 5 years, so that argues that the terminal growth rate should be higher than 0%. Using those figures gives me a target price of about $96. Using $96 as the entry point brings the yield to 2.38% which is its 4-year average. Since the current market price is a bit over $102, ADP is currently around 6% overvalued.Can options help?Options available with the February expiration date, with 59 days left till expiration look to offer some help at getting shares at my target price.The $95 put contract offers an attractive premium with a bid of $0.75. That is more than the pro-rated dividend payment for the length of this contract, and with a Delta of -0.17, an investor who writes this contract will likely not get the shares assigned. So while this won't likely get you the shares, it will give you more money than owning the shares, and give you an opportunity to write a similar contract again.If you wanted to do a buy-write trade, the $8 premium on the $95 strike would bring the cost basis down below my $96 target, and if the shares got called away, would still yield a small profit. To do this deal, I would like to see a catalyst that would pull the price of ADP down.For a covered call, the $110 looks attractive with a bid price of $0.30. The spread between the bid and ask prices is pretty wide at $0.30, so a limit order is the way to go. I would open with a limit order price of $0.45 or so. With a Delta of 0.14, the chances that the call writer will keep the shares are around 85%.ConclusionADP is a solid company offering administrative, payroll and HR services to companies. It has an excellent record of growing both earnings and dividends. It may have been a good time to buy when the latest earnings report came out on November 2nd and my opinion is based on Chowder's recommendation of always buying on a beat and a raise (no matter what the valuation). Now, more than a month after that report, the problem is that the price has now gone too high. Option trades can provide the help to get the right price or add to your cash flow for this stock.Note: I hope you all got something out of this article. I do appreciate the time you took reading it.

For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article "" The Good Business Portfolio: Update To Guidelines and July 2016 Performance Review"". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return and growing companies that keeps me ahead of the Dow average.I have been writing articles on dividend kings and single symbol letter companies to find some new investment ideas for the portfolio. Each study found 2-3 interesting companies, but now it's time to spend some time on the other companies in the portfolio to see if any should be sold to make room for better investments. So far there is one sell Cabela's (NYSE:CAB) and one trim Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) using covered calls to gain a couple of points. Also reviewed were Omega Health Investors (NYSE:OHI) as buy more, Texas Instrument (NASDAQ:TXN) as hold, Digital Reality Trust (NYSE:DLR) as buy more and Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) as hold.This article is about Automatic Data processing Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) that is 4.7% of The Good Business Portfolio. The position is above a full position of 4%. The question is should the portfolio buy/hold/sell ADP. Automatic Data processing Inc. provides a large range of data processing and human resource services. Fundamentals of Automatic Data processing Inc. will be looked at in the following topics to help make the decision to hold or sell. The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines, Total Return And Yearly Dividend, Last Quarter's Earnings, Company Business Overview, and Takeaways And Recent Portfolio Changes.Good Business Portfolio Guidelines.Automatic Data processing Inc. passes 10 of 11 Good Business Portfolio Guidelines. These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. Some of the points brought out by the guidelines are shown below.The Good Business Portfolio is based on the fact that it does not follow any one type of investment income, growth, value, and total return. Automatic Data processing Inc. is intended to be in the steady income group.Automatic Data processing Inc. is a large-cap company with a capitalization of $41.1 Billion. This size will allow Automatic Data processing Inc. the ability expand its business as more and more workers return to the work force. The next biggest company in this sector is Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) at half the size of ADP and does not have the wide broad range of products of ADP.Automatic Data processing Inc. has a dividend yield of 2.5% which is about average for the market. The ADP dividend has been increased for 42 years making it a dividend aristocrat and its dividend is very safe. Automatic Data processing Inc. is therefore a good choice for the dividend income investor. After paying its average dividend there is still cash remaining for investment in business expansion.Automatic Data processing Inc. last quarter earnings should increase when interest rates are increased, allowing the company to make money on the payroll float. Automatic Data processing Inc. has a yearly positive total cash flow of $1.8 Billion. This good cash flow makes the dividend very safe with room for increases each year.I also require the CAGR going forward to be able to cover my yearly expenses. My dividends provide 3.2% of the portfolio as income and I need 1.9% more for a yearly distribution of 5.1%. Automatic Data processing Inc. has a good three-year CAGR of 11.0% easily meeting my requirement. This good future growth for Automatic Data processing Inc. can continue the uptrend benefiting from the increased float from higher interest rates and the growth of the working population.Looking back five years $10,000 invested five years ago would now be worth over $22,600 today. This makes Automatic Data processing Inc. a good investment for the growth investor looking back, that has future growth as the work force increases and new products are introduced.Automatic Data processing Inc. S&P Capital IQ rating is two stars or sell with a target price of $85.0. Automatic Data processing Inc. is 5% over priced at present compared to the target. ADP is a fair buy at the present price for the patient long term investor that wants a steady income, but waiting for a better entry price is up to your goals.Total Return And Yearly DividendThe Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the Good Business Portfolio. Automatic Data processing Inc. beat the Dow baseline in my 46.6 month test compared to the Dow average. I chose the 46.6. month test period (starting January 1, 2013 and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2013, and other years that had fair and bad performance. The total return of 73.43% makes Automatic Data processing Inc. appropriate for the growth investor. YTD total return for Automatic Data processing Inc. is good at 11.41%, above the market by 4% short term. Automatic Data processing Inc. Has increased its dividend for 42 years and presently has a yield of 2.5% which is good for the income investor. Automatic Data processing Inc. just declared its dividend increase and the quarterly dividend was increased from $0.53 to $0.57 or about 7.5%.DOW's 46.6 month total return baseline is 44.00%As seen in the 5 year price chart below Automatic Data processing Inc. has a good chart over 2012-2016 YTD, that shows a great total return in a good year like 2013 and moderate growth from there to date with growth to come as the interest rates increase.ADP data by YChartsLast Quarter's EarningsFor the last quarter on November 2, 2016 Automatic Data processing Inc. reported earnings that were well above expected at $0.86 compared to last year at $0.68 and expected of $0.75. Total revenue was higher at $2.92 Billion and higher than a year ago by 7.7% year over year that was in line with expected revenue. This was a good report with bottom line increasing as top line top line increased showing the growth of the business. The next earnings will be out early February 2017 and estimated at $1.28 compared to last year of $1.17 . This leaves cash available for dividend increases and business expansion.Business OverviewAutomatic Data Processing, Inc. is a provider of human capital management (NASDAQ:HCM) solutions to employers, offering solutions to businesses of various sizes. The Company also provides business process outsourcing solutions. Its segments include Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization (NYSE:PEO) Services. The Employer Services segment offers a range of human resources (NYSE:HR) business process outsourcing and technology-enabled HCM solutions. These offerings include payroll services, benefits administration, talent management, HR management, time and attendance management, insurance services, retirement services, and tax and compliance services. ADP TotalSource, ADP's PEO business, offers small and mid-sized businesses a HR outsourcing solution through a co-employment model. As a PEO, ADP TotalSource provides HR management services while the client continues to direct the day-to-day job-related duties of the employees.Over all Automatic Data processing Inc. is a good business with 11% projected revenue growth as the interest rates go up. The good cash flow provides ADP the capability to continue its moderate growth. The economy is showing moderate economic (about 2%) growth right now and the FED may raise rates in December 2016 but is dependent on the United States economy. I believe the FED, when it does raise rates it will be a one and done, they don't want to trigger a slowdown in the economy. As employment increases with the economy ADP should grow with it.At the last earnings call Mr. Carlos A. Rodriguez (Chief Executive Officer) said ""Our results this quarter reflect the strength of our business model and give us momentum as we stay focused on delivering an outstanding client experience through great service and innovative solutions, many of which are receiving a wealth of external recognition. Recently, we shared that ADP was named a Leader in Payroll Business Process Outsourcing by Gartner for the fifth consecutive year. Gartner's study analyzed vendors across all regions, employer sizes and service delivery models, evaluating both their ability to execute and completeness of vision"".Takeaways and Recent Portfolio ChangesAutomatic Data processing Inc. is an investment choice for the income investor and moderate growth investor with its 2.5% yield and great total return. Automatic Data processing Inc. is 4.7% of The Good Business Portfolio and its position will be held as we watch to see what the rates going forward are. ADP will benefit from the rate increases as it makes money on the customer float. ADP is a solid, moderate income producer with potential for upward earnings growth as the company introduces new products.Trimmed Cabela's from 3.7% of the portfolio to 3.5%, they have received a bid of $65.50 cash for their shares, which to me is a fair price. I want to take a bit off the table in case the deal does not go through. I also would like to deploy the proceeds to increase the dividend paying companies in the portfolio. The last earnings report was not good and it may be time to take a good profit while I can in case the deal does not go through. Management is spending too much money to keep revenue up causing earnings to decrease.Sold covered calls (December 2nd $58.0 strike price) on a portion of the HOG position to make some money while I wait for the buyout or something to make me want to trim the position.Sold covered calls (December 9th $54.5 strike price) on a portion of the HOG position to make some money while I wait for the buyout or something to make me want to trim the position.Increased position in Digital Investors Trust to 1.00% of the portfolio to take advantage of the recent dip to add to the position of a long term growth company.Increased Omega Healthcare Investors from 4.7% of the portfolio to 4.8% of the portfolio, I needed a little more income and OHI will give that to the portfolio. The portfolio will fill in the open portfolio slot with Kellogg (NYSE:K) when cash is available followed by PepsiCo Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) when the next slot is open.The Good Business Portfolio generally trims a position when it gets above 8% of the portfolio. The four top positions in The Good Business Portfolio are, Johnson and Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is 8.2% of the portfolio, Altria Group Inc. (NYSE:MO) is 7.4% of the portfolio, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is 7.6% of portfolio and Boeing (NYSE:BA) is 8.7% of the portfolio, therefore JNJ and BA are now in trim position with Home Depot and Altria getting close.Boeing is going to be pressed to 10% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on individual 787 plane costs at $151 Million in the third quarter. The recent earnings blew away the estimate of $2.63 and came in at $3.51. BA has just received a large order for 15 747-8 planes which will help keep this line open. BA is a long term buy and has a backlog of over 7 years.JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because it's so defensive in this post BREXIT world. Earnings in the last quarter beat on the top and bottom line but Mr. Market did not like growth going forward. JNJ is not a trading stock but a hold forever, it is now a strong buy as the healthcare sector was under pressure from the election.For the total Good Business Portfolio please see my recent article on The Good Business Portfolio: 2016 Second-Quarter Earnings and Performance Review for the complete portfolio list and performance. Become a real time follower and you will get each quarters performance after the earnings season is over. Third-quarter earnings and performance with be available in a few weeks after HP Inc.

If you have an interest please look for them in my list of previous articles.Of course this is not a recommendation to buy or sell and you should always do your own research and talk to your financial advisor before any purchase or sale. This is how I manage my IRA retirement account and the opinions on the companies are my own."
4031265,102551,2016-12-18T16:42:48-05:00,Automatic Data Processing Inc. has increased its dividend each year for 42 years making the company a dividend aristocrat.While ADP has aptly rewarded shareholders over the years it is expensive at current levels.I would be prepared to add to my existing ADP holdings if the price drops below $92.,"IntroductionAutomatic Data Processing (NASDAQ: ADP) was founded in 1949. It is a:It serves more than 610,000 clients in over 112 countries.ADP is currently a Dividend Aristocrat which is an exclusive group of companies in which the dividend has increased for at least 25 consecutive years. As recently as November 8, 2016, ADP's board of directors approved a $0.04 increase in the quarterly cash dividend ($0.53/quarter to $0.57/quarter) for an annual rate of $2.28 per share. This increased cash dividend marks the 42nd consecutive year in which ADP has raised its quarterly dividend. The next quarterly dividend will be distributed on January 1, 2017 to shareholders of record at December 9, 2016.The following analysis has been prepared using ADP's 2016 10-K, Proxy Statement, the Q1 2017 ADP Earnings Call and Webcast presentation on November 2, 2016, and data from Morningstar, Inc.Q1 Fiscal 2017 ResultsOn November 2, 2016, ADP highlighted the following 4 key items in its press release:Fiscal 2017 OutlookADP's two reportable business segments are:RevenueManagement's 2017 forecast calls for consolidated revenue to grow 7- 8%.EO is projected to grow its revenue 4-5%. This business segment offers:Professional Employer Organization Services is projected to grow 14 - 16%. This business segment serves approximately 9,700 clients with comprehensive employment administration outsourcing solutions through a relationship in which employees who work at a client's location are co-employed by ADP and its client.Margin ExpansionManagement expects Adjusted EBIT to increase approximately 50 bps with this increase allocated as follows:EO: approximately 50 bps; PEO: approximately 75 bps""Adjusted"" results exclude charges related to ADP's Service Alignment Initiative and an anticipated gain on the sale of COBRA and CHSA businesses in fiscal 2017 as well as charges related to workforce optimization, the gain on the sale of a building, and the gain on the sale of the AdvancedMD business during fiscal 2016.In addition, this includes the projected repurchase of $1-$1.4 Billion of ADP shares.Worldwide New BookingsFiscal 2016 results amounted to $1.75 Billion. This is expected to grow between 4-6 % ($1.82-$1.855 Billion).U.S. Pays per ControlThe ""pays per control"" metric is one in which ADP measures as the number of employees on its clients' payrolls based on a same-store-sales basis utilizing a representative subset of payrolls ranging from small to large businesses that are reflective of a broad range of U.S. geographic regions.The target is approximately 2.5% compared to a 2.5% increase in fiscal 2016.Adjusted Effective Tax RateThis is expected to drop to 32.7% from 33.3% in fiscal 2016.Projected Revenue from Client Funds held on deposit2016 EPSDiluted EPS from continuing operations (GAAP) for fiscal 2016 was $3.25 (a 12% increase from fiscal 2015).Factoring in the following adjustments:ADP achieved adjusted EPS from continuing operations (non-GAAP) of $3.26.2017 EPS ProjectionsDiluted EPS from continuing operations (GAAP) of $3.74-$3.80 (15-17 % increase)Factoring in the following adjustments:Adjusted EPS from continuing operations (non-GAAP) of $3.62-$3.68 - an 11 to 13% gainHistorical MetricsP/EADP's historical P/E for 2008 - current is as follows:2008: 16.812009: 15.982010: 19.202011: 21.022012: 20.412013: 28.252014: 26.222015: 28.33Current: 29.57DividendADP's historical dividend for 2008 - current is as follows:2008: $1.202009: $1.332010: $1.382011: $1.482012: $1.622013: $1.792014: $1.932015: $2.00Current: $2.28Trailing Dividend YieldADP's historical trailing dividend yield for 2008 - current is as follows:2008: 3.05%2009: 3.11%2010: 2.98%2011: 2.73%2012: 2.85%2013: 2.21%2014: 2.31%2015: 2.36%Current: 2.19%ConclusionI am of the opinion the markets are currently in a period of irrational exuberance. I see absolutely no reason for the dramatic increase in ADP's valuation of around $90 just prior to the US Presidential election and the current value just north of $100.I am, therefore, taking the position that at some stage in 2017 we will see a reversion to the mean and the current P/E of 29.57 will likely drop back to the 25 level (hopefully lower).Using the projected adjusted EPS range provided by management, I would be prepared to add additional ADP shares to those currently held and acquired at an average cost of $40.626 should ADP shares drop below $92 ($3.68 projected adjusted EPS x 25 P/E).Using a price of $92 and the current annual dividend of $2.28 we end up with a dividend yield 2.48% which comes closer to historical levels.Naturally, any price below $92 would warrant a ""strong buy"" from my perspective."
4056468,85096,2017-03-20T09:15:05-04:00,Automatic Data Processing total return greatly over performed the DOW average for my 50.5 month test period by 33.27%.Automatic Data Processing is a very large provider of data processing services for the payroll and human resources sector with expansion and growth as the workforce grows with the economy.Automatic Data Processing has increased its dividend for 9 of the past ten years and presently has a yield of 2.2% which is average.,"This article is about Automatic Data Processing (ADP) and why it's a buy for the long term total return investor. ADP is 4.51% of The Good Business Portfolio and will be held to watch it grow over time. ADP has in the last 50.5 months had a great total return above the DOW average. Automatic Data Processing is one of the largest human resource service companies in the world and is growing as it develops a cloud based system for its services.Fundamentals of Automatic Data Processing will be reviewed in the following topics below The Good Business Portfolio Guidelines, Total Return and Yearly Dividend, Last Quarter's Earnings, Company Business and Takeaways And Recent Portfolio Changes.I use a set of guidelines that I codified over the last few years to review the companies in The Good Business Portfolio (my portfolio) and other companies that I am taking a look at. For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article ""The Good Business Portfolio: Update To Guidelines and July 2016 Performance Review"". These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, total return and growing companies that hopefully keeps me ahead of the Dow average.Good Business Portfolio Guidelines.Automatic Data Processing passes 11 of 11 Good Business Portfolio Guidelines. These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. Some of the points brought out by the guidelines are shown below.Automatic Data Processing has a dividend yield of 2.2% which is average for the market. The dividend has been increased for 9 of the last ten years and its dividend is very safe. Automatic Data Processing is therefore a choice for the dividend growth investor. The average 5 year payout ratio is good at 62%. After paying the dividend this leaves cash remaining for investment in expanding the present business and buying bolt on companies.Automatic Data Processing is a large-cap company with a capitalization of $47 Billion. The large size of Automatic Data Processing gives it the muscle, plus its cash flow to increase the business going forward. Automatic Data Processing 2017 estimated total yearly cash flow at $1.8 Billion is strong allowing the company to have the means for company growth. I also require the CAGR going forward to be able to cover my yearly expenses. My dividends provide 3.1% of the portfolio as income and I need 1.9% more for a yearly distribution of 5.0%. The three-year forward CAGR of 12.0% (S&P Capital IQ) more than meets my requirement. This high CAGR is conservative considering the forward economy growing strongly as President Trump lowers the corporate tax rates.Looking back five years $10,000 invested five years ago would now be worth over $24,600 today. This makes Automatic Data Processing a great investment for the total return investor looking back that primarily wants good future growth with fair average income.Automatic Data Processing S&P Capital IQ rating is two stars or sell with a target price of $89.0. Automatic Data Processing price is presently 18% above the target. ADP is over priced at the present price and is a fair investment for the long term investor who wants above average good growth potential.One of my guidelines is would you buy the whole company if you could, the answer is yes. The Good Business Portfolio likes to embrace all kinds of investment styles but concentrates on buying businesses that can be understood, makes a fair profit, invests profits back into the business and also generates a fair income stream. Most of all what makes ADP interesting is the good labor numbers recently released and the hope of reduced corporate taxes.Total Return And Yearly DividendThe Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of the Good Business Portfolio. Automatic Data Processing total return greatly over performs the Dow baseline in my 50.5 month test compared to the Dow average. I chose the 50.5 month test period (starting January 1, 2013 and ending to date) because it includes the great year of 2013, and other years that had fair and bad performance. The great total return of 92.89% makes Automatic Data Processing a good investment for the total return investor and also provides a steady average increasing income. Automatic Data Processing Has increased its dividend for 9 of the past ten years and presently has a yield of 2.2% which is average for the income investor.DOW's 50.5 month total return baseline is 59.62%As seen in the 5 year price chart below Automatic Data Processing goes up and to the right at a good slope. In a good year like 2013 the market that was up 27% and ADP beat it at 40%.ADP data by YChartsLast Quarter's EarningsFor the second fiscal quarter on February 1, 2017 Automatic Data Processing reported earnings that beat expected by $0.07 at $0.87 compared to last year at $072. Total revenue was higher at $2.99 Billion up more than a year ago by 6.4% year over year and missed expected revenue by $30 Million. This was a good report with bottom line and top line beating expected. The next earnings report will be out in early May 2017 and is expected to be $1.23 compared to last year at $1.17. The company revenues and earnings comparison for the second fiscal quarter 2017 compared to last year are shown in the slide below from the second fiscal quarter earnings report slides.Source: Second fiscal quarter Automatic Data Processing earnings slidesBusiness OverviewAutomatic Data Processing is one of the largest data processing human resources service companies in the world. The company grows by developing new methods of providing services and buying bolt on companies with its good cash flow.As per Reuters ""The Company also provides business process outsourcing solutions. Its segments include Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services. The Employer Services segment offers a range of human resources (HR) business process outsourcing and technology-enabled HCM solutions. These offerings include payroll services, benefits administration, talent management, HR management, time and attendance management, insurance services, retirement services, and tax and compliance services.""ADP is growing its business with good organic growth and good retention rates as seen in the quote below from the second fiscal quarter earnings announcement.From the February 2, 2017 earnings call transcript Carlos A. Rodriguez (Chief Executive Officer) said.Over all Automatic Data Processing is a good business with 12% CAGR projected growth as the need for more human resource services increases going forward. The good cash flow provides ADP the capability to continue its growth by buying bolt on companies and developing new applications in cloud computing. As seen in the slide from the second quarter's earnings call ADP has good projected growth in both top line and bottom line.Also as a tail wind we have President Trump wanting to lower corporate taxes. As the corporation tax rate is lowered earnings of Automatic Data Processing business should increase. They are now paying 34% (5 year average) close to the maximum of 35%.The economy is showing moderate economic (about 2.3%) growth right now and the FED has raised rates in March 2017 with future rate increases dependent on the United States economy. The FED projects for 1-2 more increases in 2017. I feel when it does raise rates it will be less, maybe just one more, they don't want to trigger a slowdown in the economy.Takeaways and Recent Portfolio ChangesAutomatic Data Processing is an investment choice for the total return investor with its average yield of 2.2% and it's strong beat of the DOW total return. Automatic Data Processing will be held by the The Good Business Portfolio looking for earnings growth in the near future as the economy improves and interest rates are increased. The bolt on companies that have recently been bought should start to increase revenues and profits within this fiscal year. If you already own ADP the company is a good hold long term but is a bit pricy for the new investor. If you are a real long term (5 years or better) investor ADP is a buy and you can sleep well at night.Trimmed Boeing (BA) from 10% of the portfolio to 9.4%. Great Company but you have to be diversified.Trimmed Harley Davidson (HOG) to 4.4% of the portfolio. Growth looks likely to be negative again this year.Increased position in Omega Healthcare Investors (OHI) to 5.5% of the portfolio, I could use a little more income.Sold covered calls April 20th $58.5 strike price on a portion of the HOG position to make some money while I wait for Harley sales to start to grow again.Sold covered calls April 13th $58.0 strike price on a portion of the HOG position to make some money while I wait for Harley sales to start to grow again.Added to position of Ingersoll-Rand (IR) now at 4.1% of the portfolio a full position. S&P recently raised IR target price to $86 from $80.Added to position of Digital Reality Trust (DLR) now at 1.1% of the portfolio. I feel the computer industry facilities business has nowhere to go but up and DLR pays an above average dividend. I wrote an article on Digital Reality Trust in September of last year if you are interested.The Good Business Portfolio generally trims a position when it gets above 8% of the portfolio. The four top positions in The Good Business Portfolio are, Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) is 8.3% of the portfolio, Altria Group (MO) is 8.2% of the portfolio, Home Depot (HD) is 8.1% of portfolio and Boeing is 9.4% of the portfolio, therefore all four are now in trim position.Boeing is going to be pressed to 10% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on 787 deferred plane costs at $251 Million in the fourth quarter a $64 Million increase from the third quarter. The fourth quarter earnings were good with Boeing beating the estimate by $0.14 at $2.47. S&P Capital IQ also raised its one year target to $191.JNJ will be pressed to 9% of the portfolio because it's so defensive in this post BREXIT world.

4012998,63883,2016-10-18T20:03:28-04:00,,"Originally Published October 17th, 2016.By Bob CiuraAutomatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) traces its roots all the way back to 1949, when it was started by a 21-year old entrepreneur named Henry Taub. ADP began with a single client, and in the decades since, has grown to an industry leader in payroll processing services.ADP currently has more than 600,000 clients spread across the world. The stock has generated strong total returns over the last decade. The image below shows an investment in ADP vs. the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) over the last decade.ADP has a long history of paying and raising its dividend. The company has increased its shareholder payout each year for the past 41 years.This streak qualifies ADP as a Dividend Aristocrat. In fact, ADP is the only Dividend Aristocrat in the information technology sector. Rapidly advancing technology makes building a durable competitive advantage in the IT sector difficult. ADP is the exception, not the rule.Being a Dividend Aristocrat matters. ADP's excellent performance over the last decade is not an exception. The Dividend Aristocrats Index has outperformed the S&P 500 by 3.1 percentage points a year on average over the last decade, according to S&P.ADP's most recent dividend increase was 8.1% in November 2015. ADP's new annualized dividend of $2.12 per share represents a 2.4% current dividend yield. It has been four quarters since the last increase. Since the company typically raises its dividend each year in the fourth quarter, another raise is likely next month.ADP maintains a target payout ratio of 55-60% of earnings. This is the percentage of profits that the company seeks to distribute to shareholders as a dividend. Last year, ADP's declared dividends of $2.08 per share represented 64% of its diluted earnings for the year. That is slightly above its target payout ratio, but the company is likely to generate enough earnings growth to justify a dividend increase this year. Therefore, investors should expect a mid-single digit dividend increase in the coming month.Keep reading this article to learn more about the investment prospects of ADP.Business OverviewADP operates two separate reporting segments, which are Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization Services. The Employer Services business is ADP's largest, and constitutes more than 80% of annual earnings.ADP provides administrative tasks like payroll services, benefits administration, and human resources management to companies of all sizes. ADP's clients utilize these services because outsourcing these functions allows them to focus on their core business activities. With hundreds of thousands of clients, ADP is highly diversified. No single customer represents more than 2% of ADP's annual revenue.Moving forward, ADP will concentrate solely on its Human Capital Management business, as a result of its 2014 spin-off of CDK Global (NASDAQ:CDK). The HCM business is comprised of software and service-based products designed to help clients streamline their recruiting, payroll, and management functions. Specifically, ADP will invest mostly in cloud-based software, to fuel future growth.While ADP is in the information technology sector, it's important to note that its business is service related; not based on technology. Both small and large businesses will continue to need payroll processing and help with ever-increasing regulatory burdens, regardless of how quickly technology advances.And make no mistake… The amount of regulations that both small and large businesses must keep up with is only increasing - and that's good news for ADP.Source: NASDAQ 33rd Investor Program Presentation, slide 15Growth Prospects & Competitive AdvantageADP had a very successful company performance last year.Despite the HCM business being highly competitive, with new and established industry players vying for market share, ADP retained 91.4% of its customers last year, which set a record for the company.This helped fuel 7% revenue growth last year and adjusted 14% growth in earnings per share.Source: ADP 4th Quarter 2016 Presentation, slide 4ADP also managed to grow new business bookings by 13% in 2016, a promising indication of future growth potential. Analysts, on average, expect ADP will generate $3.50 per share of earnings in the current fiscal year.This projection would represent 7.7% earnings growth this year. Analyst forecasts are in line with management's internal projections. ADP anticipates 7-9% revenue growth along with 6-8% earnings growth this fiscal year.The company is expecting strong growth in fiscal 2017 as well, as the image below shows:Source: ADP 4th Quarter 2016 Presentation, slide 6Looking at the company's growth in 2016 and expected growth in 2017, a long-term earnings per share growth rate of 7% to 9% is certainly reasonable and in line with current trends.One of the fundamental tailwinds ADP will look forward to is an increasingly complex regulatory environment, both in the U.S. and internationally. Among ADP's core functions is to help its clients navigate the changing regulatory landscape. This has been a driving force behind ADP's impressive growth in recent years.Over the past five years, ADP has increased revenue and earnings per share by 31% and 34%, respectively. This is solid growth for an established blue chip dividend payer like ADP.ADP's solid growth is also the result of its competitive advantage, which is its scale and excellent reputation among its customers. As a global company, ADP has the resources to work with companies that have employees across multiple nations. This is an ability that smaller companies do not possess. ADP is the largest publicly traded HCM business in the world. You want a trusted and established business to handle your benefits, health care, and payroll. The company's reputation and brand add to its competitive advantage.Recession PerformanceAnother quality ADP possesses that makes it an appealing long-term dividend investment is its recession-resistant business model. Even when the global economy enters recession, employers still need the payroll and human resource management services that ADP provides. This sufficiently insulates ADP from the ravaging effects of a deep recession, such as the one the U.S. experienced in 2008 and 2009.For example, in 2008 ADP grew earnings per share by 20%. This was a notable achievement, as it was very rare for any large company in the S&P 500 to post such a high rate of earnings growth. Then, ADP grew earnings by 8.6% in 2009. From 2007-2010, ADP generated 31% earnings growth. The company's earnings per share over the great recession are shown below:Valuation & Expected Total ReturnsADP's future shareholder returns will be a function of its earnings and dividend growth, along with any changes in its valuation. The current dividend yield of 2.7% plus 7% to 9% expected earnings growth leads to an implied future return of 9.7% to 11.7% per year, before changes in the valuation multiple.Since 2000, ADP stock has traded for an average price-to-earnings ratio of 24. The company is currently trading for a price-to-earnings ratio of 26. The company appears a bit overvalued given its historical price-to-earnings ratio.The S&P 500 is currently trading for a price-to-earnings ratio of 24.6. ADP is trading a bit above the S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio. This should be expected, as the company's solid growth prospects and stability command a premium over the 'average' S&P 500 stock.Considering the above, ADP is likely trading around fair value in today's market given the elevated level of the S&P 500.Final ThoughtsADP is a highly profitable company with a strong business model and many competitive strengths. It also has a strong balance sheet, and garners an excellent 'AA' credit rating from Standard & Poor's. This provides investors with a considerable safety.Because ADP's future earnings growth forecasts are roughly in line with the S&P 500's, investors may want to wait for a better valuation before buying ADP stock. Compression of ADP's valuation multiple would negatively impact future returns for shareholders who buy at the current price.ADP currently has a slightly below-average ranking using The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing. The company's fairly high valuation multiple holds the company back from ranking higher.While value investors may quibble with ADP's current valuation, ADP is a high quality business that will very likely continue to reward shareholders with rising dividends. The company makes a compelling long-term hold in a dividend growth portfolio - especially for investors looking for exposure to the notoriously fickle information technology sector."
4012651,82326,2016-10-17T19:30:17-04:00,"ADP offers businesses the ability to outsource tasks that are not their core competencies and focus on what is important.This is a service that businesses are willing to pay for and, given efficiencies of scale, often should be paying for.ADP has 41 years of consecutive dividend increases under its belt and will prioritize ongoing increases in coming years.The balance sheet is one of the most conservative we have seen for a company of this size. It has a net cash position.The combination of dividends and buybacks should continue to buoy the stock and offer investors a solid return.","Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), for those not familiar with the name, is a long-standing provider of business outsourcing solutions. The company operates through the Employer Services segment which includes services such as payroll, benefits admin, talent management, HR services, etc. It also operates the Professional Organization Service segment that includes services such as HR guidance, 401(k) administration, benefits, etc. The company seeks to be a full service and fully global provider of outsourcing solutions and has been very effective at accomplishing this goal since its beginning in 1949. ADP is one of just 50 dividend aristocrats in the S&P 500 that have paid and increased their dividend for more than 25 years.ADP has a 41-year history of consecutive dividend growth and during its 2016 Fiscal Year ADP returned $2.1B of cash to shareholders via dividends and buybacks. Given a market cap of about $40B, this is a substantial amount. On the last earnings call, management actually called out the company's aristocrat status and made a point of mentioning that ""ADP's leaders and associates are making the investments to lay the foundation for ADP to join the dividend royals in nine years, And that's a list of just 17 companies that have paid and increased their dividend for more than 50 years."" This clearly indicates that ADP has no intention of discontinuing dividend growth for another decade, and we think they are in a great position continue this growth.ADP is looking for a solid year for fiscal 2017, anticipating 7% to 9% in revenue growth (inline with its long-term revenue growth target), margin expansion and 10%-12% of increased EPS. These numbers are very supportive of a solid dividend hike in 2017.Source: ADP Investor PresentationUse of Cash: The use of cash test provides a visual overview of the various cash uses that a company has been allocating cash. It shows the relative size of the cash uses versus the outstanding cash balance available to the company. It is a quick and simple way to view how the company has used its cash over the past 10 years and is indicative of what the company may do in the next 10 years with its cash reserves. We examine dividend payments to all shareholders (including payments to preferred dividend holders) as well as net repurchases which include equity issued via stock option plans, etc., as well as interest payments on debt. This offers a more wholesome view of how the company allocates capital.Source: HereNot only has ADP increased its dividend every year but it has also completed buybacks. The use of cash profile is remarkable. The very conservative balance sheet means debt service obligations are at a minimum while dividends and buybacks are still a conservative amount of the company's cash flow.In the last fiscal year alone, ADP paid more than $900M in dividends and returned about $1.2B through buybacks. This is in-line with the ADP's stated longstanding commitment of returning cash to shareholders via dividends and repurchases. When it comes to using its cash, ADP will first reinvest in the business organically, then via tuck-ins the dividend is in third place for capital allocation, and finally ADP will continue repurchases at least at a level to offset the employee benefits dilution.Source: ADP Investor Presentation10-Year Dividend Yield and Payout Ratios: Higher dividends are great but not if they come at the expense of dividend sustainability. Assessing the payout ratio is a key metric in determining the sustainability of a dividend and is calculated as dividend per share dividend by earnings per share (DPS/EPS).Source: hereOver the past decade ADP has had very healthy dividend growth partially at the expense of a rising payout ratio, which happens when dividends per share rise faster than earnings per share. Over the past 10 years DPS have risen at a 10% CAGR while earnings have only risen at 5%.While this is a trend that clearly cannot continue forever, we expect ADP will see earnings growth that will help to support the rising dividend. The payout ratio has crept up to 70%, which means most of the income is being allocated to the dividend. This is likely one of the reasons we saw repurchases decline in fiscal year Q4.Long-Term Dividend Growth: It is important to view dividend sustainability across market cycles. Following the prolonged bull market we have seen in recent years it is necessary to look a bit further out to get a more balanced view of dividend sustainability.Source: hereAs one of the dividend aristocrats ADP clearly has a great history of returning capital to shareholders. In fact, the company has paid rising dividends for 41 consecutive years and has a stated goal of becoming a Dividend Royal, joining just a handful of other companies that have paid consecutively increasing dividends for the past 50 years.While dividend growth has slowed over the decades, it is still consistently above 5%, and we would expect it to grow in the 7% to 9% region for upcoming years, which is consistent with the company's stated long-term revenue growth objectives. Given the strong margins ADP has they have torque on the revenue line which further supports dividend increases.Credit risks: One of the largest risks to dividend sustainability is a leveraged company facing large debt payments and/or putting its credit ratings at risk, which would lead to higher interest charges.Source: hereFrom a credit perspective ADP has a very clean balance sheet with only $2B of debt outstanding and nothing due before 2020. These tranches both carry low interest rates at 2.3% for 2020 and 3.4% for 2025. Given that ADP carries a net cash position (ie. cash and cash equivalents greater than debt) we see no issue with repayment when it does eventually come due.In fact, in order to support higher dividend growth in the future we would be happy to see ADP tap its balance sheet and spend more on furthering organic growth and revenue growth via tuck-ins.Leverage and interest coverage ratios are not worth looking at given how conservative the balance sheet is. We would note the company has an Aa3 credit rating from Moody's which is one of the reasons it can access the capital markets so cheaply, sourcing low coupon bearing debt. ADP will continue to prioritize its credit rating on its balance sheet, but it has some room to work with - we doubt it will be a problem.Summary: ADP offers businesses the ability to outsource tasks that are not their core competencies and focus on what is important. This is a service that businesses are willing to pay for, and given efficiencies of scale, often should be paying for. Which is exactly why the revenue is so sticky and why ADP should continue to grow in the upper single-digit range. ADP has 41 years of consecutive dividend increases under its belt and will prioritize ongoing increases in coming years. The balance sheet is one of the most conservative we have seen for a company of this size. It has a net cash position. The combination of dividends and buybacks should continue to buoy the stock and offer investors a solid return.Thanks for reading our article all the way to the bottom!

4042490,102551,2017-02-03T12:19:32-05:00,"ADP announced Q2 results on February 1, 2017.Revenues increased 6% to $3.0B, 7% on a constant dollar basis.Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 20% to $0.87, 19% on a constant dollar basis.Fiscal 2017 share repurchases of $1.2B - $1.4B to be funded by existing balance sheet cash vs. prior forecast of $1.0B - to $1.4B.ADP’s stock price is still too rich for my liking. I will wait for ADP to drop to $92ish.","IntroductionAutomatic Data Processing, Inc. (NAQSDAQ: ADP) released its Q2 2017 results on February 1, 2017. I periodically review the financial status of the companies in which we own shares hence the reason for today's post. This post will be relatively brief since I recently reviewed ADP in my Automatic Data Processing Inc.: A Wonderful Company. Less Than Wonderful Valuation post.Q2 2017 Financial ResultsFull details can be found in ADP's February 1, 2017 Earnings release. Highlights are provided below.Source: 2Q Fiscal 2017, ADP Earnings Call & WebcastWhen I think of ADP, I think of all the client money it has on its books ""In Trust"" on which it generates interest income. Regrettably, our interest rate environment has been low for several years and ADP must invest in predominantly AAA/AA rated investments (safety and liquidity is paramount). As a result, the interest income ADP generates is, in the great scheme of things, nice but not that significant.Outlook for Remainder of Fiscal 2017While there is talk of interest rates increasing, which would be nice for ADP, I don't think the increase will be sufficient to move the bottom line for ADP in FY2017.In January 2017, ADP made a small acquisition. It acquired The Marcus Buckingham Company, Inc. for total cash consideration of ~$0.070B, and contingent consideration of up to $0.035B. This contingent amount is payable over the next 3 years, subject to the achievement of specified financial metrics and/or other conditions.ADP now expects full year revenue growth of about 6% compared to its prior forecast of 7% - 8% growth. This revenue forecast continues to include about 1% of pressure from the disposition of its CHSA and COBRA businesses.ADP continues to expect full year diluted EPS from continuing operations to grow 15% - 17%, and adjusted diluted EPS growth of 11% - 13%. This earnings growth forecast still assumes an adjusted EBIT margin expansion of about 50 bps.Source: 2Q Fiscal 2017, ADP Earnings Call & WebcastThe share repurchases forecast has now being revised to assume $1.2B - $1.4B which will be funded by existing balance sheet cash. The previous forecast was for repurchases to be in the range of $1.0B - $1.4B.ValuationADP's shares have dropped about $5 subsequent to its Q2 2017 earnings announcement. When I last wrote about ADP, shares were trading about $5 higher than the current price of $96.32.So, is ADP now an attractive buy?I enclose earnings estimates which I generated from TD WebBroker and from the most recent ValuEngine report. The mean FY2017 and FY2018 non-GAAP estimated EPS from multiple analysts is $3.66 and $4.65, respectively. While some analysts have provided estimates for 2019, I don't know how anybody can accurately predict what is going to happen that far in the future. Even the 2018 estimate seems like it is a bit of a shot in the dark to me. I, therefore, give little credence to estimates that far in the future and will rely on the FY2017 estimate of $3.66 to determine what I consider a reasonable price to pay for ADP.Source: TD Bank WebBrokerSource: ValuEngineGoogle Finance currently reflects a PE just under 29. If I use the current price of $96.32 and the estimated $3.66 FY2016 EPS from the analysts, the projected PE for FY2017 drops to 26.32.I generally like to acquire shares in companies when the PE is sub 20. I can't, however, recollect a time in all the years we have owned ADP when the PE got that low other than when we were all presented with a wonderful buying opportunity during the Financial Crisis.So, if I use the estimated $3.66 EPS and a PE of 25, I get a price of $91.50 (call it $92ish) where I would be prepared to acquire additional ADP shares.Now let's look at ADP from a dividend yield perspective. ADP increased its quarterly dividend from $0.53/share to $0.57/share with its beginning of January 2017 payment. ADP's Board has declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.57/share payable April 1, 2017 to shareholders of record on March 10, 2017. If we presume ADP sticks with its pattern of only increasing its dividend once a year, we get an annual dividend of $2.28. Using the current price of $96.32 we get a dividend yield of 2.37%. If ADP's shares were to drop to $92, the annual dividend yield would increase to 2.47%.This dividend yield alone might be enough to dissuade investors from buying ADP shares. Had I thought that way years ago I would undoubtedly be kicking myself today. I can categorically tell you that ADP's dividend growth over the years now brings a smile to my face. Sometimes you can't be too rigid in your thinking and say, I will not buy anything unless the dividend yield is at least 5% (for example). I think investing is an art as opposed to an exact science.Final ThoughtsWhen I wrote my Automatic Data Processing Inc.: A Wonderful Company. Less Than Wonderful Valuation post in December 2016, I thought ADP was too expensive. I still think it is too expensive.I will wait for a pullback to at least $92 and will reassess the situation at that time to determine whether there is any reason why I should change my mind not to buy more shares at that price.Please click the + icon next to my user name and follow me at, Financial Freedom is a Journey, as I work to keep you informed on further developments in the world of dividend stocks."

What's on your watch list?ADP is a leader in HR, HCM and PEO.Why ADP is worth a look.I rank ADP 6th among the 37 equities in my retirement income portfolio.Brief portfolio update and 3rd Quarter review.","What's on your watch list?Valuations, in general, are elevated, but at some point, we will have a bear market. This is a good time to review your watch list with an eye toward adding high quality companies. Sometimes, broad market downturns provide an unusual opportunity to pick up shares of companies that otherwise trade at premium valuations, such as Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP).ADP serves 650,000 clients worldwide, has 56,700 employees, pays 25 million workers in the U.S. (1 in 6), and 13 million in other countries, electronically moved $1.7 trillion in client tax, direct deposit, and related client funds in fiscal 2016 within the U.S., processed nearly 60 million W-2s in 2016 in the U.S., and is the largest provider of human resource services in North America, Europe, Latin America and the Pacific Rim. Still, ADP has only a 10% market share of the human resource and human capital management business. A brief overview of ADPADP describes itself as ""the most comprehensive global provider of cloud-based Human Capital Management solutions.""In 1949, Henry Taub (1927-2011) founded Automatic Payrolls in Patterson, N.J. It was 5 years before the company had its first full-time salesperson.In 1950 (above), equipment included an Underwood bookkeeping machine, Friden calculators, and an Addressograph to print checks.The idea of outsourcing payroll was new and success depended on earning the trust of each customer. By 1956, the company served 200 clients. By 1957, operations from manual bookkeeping machines moved to automated punch card accounting. In 1959, the company changed its name to Automatic Data Processing, and it became a public company in 1961, by selling 100,000 shares at $3.00.In the 1960s, ADP began acquiring other payroll services companies, and added payroll processing centers in Boston, Miami, Philadelphia, Baltimore and the West Coast.ADP began the 1990s with more than 200,000 clients, nearly 20,000 associates, and annual revenue of $2 billion. In addition to payroll services, ADP was the leading provider of processing services to the retail auto and truck industry, and processed claims for most major casualty insurance companies.In 1998, before Software-as-a-Service or ""cloud"" had taken hold in business language, ADP introduced EasyPayNet, a service that allowed companies to upload payroll information to ADP over the Internet and access it from any computer. In 1999, ADP pursued a new business opportunity with small businesses, the Professional Employer Organization (PEO). A PEO provides an outsourcing solution that delivers human resource expertise and superior benefits packages, which most smaller businesses normally could not obtain by themselves.In 2009, ADP introduced its RUN powered ADP mobile app, to provide access to its small business payroll platform from mobile devices. In 2014, ADP celebrated 65 years in business, served 620,000 customers in 125 countries, and counted 15 years of having cloud-based software.HR, HCM, PEOThe ""Business Overview"" section of the 2016 Annual Report (pp. 3-4) describes four categories of customers: 1) small, 2) mid-sized, 3) large, and 4) companies in multiple countries. ADP says their business strategy is based on three ""strategic pillars"":ADP organizes its business around two reportable segments:Employer Services includes:Professional Employer Organization Services include:ADP's PEO business, called ADP TotalSource, serves approximately 9,700 clients with comprehensive employment administration outsourcing solutions through a relationship in which employees who work at a client's location (referred to as ""worksite employees"") are co-employed by ADP and the client. ADP TotalSource is the largest PEO in the United States based on the number of worksite employees, serving approximately 439,000 worksite employees in all 50 states.The 2016 Annual Report (pp. 4-7) gives a concise yet thorough description of the products and services offered by ADP. I won't reproduce that information here, but if you are considering an investment in ADP, those pages will help you make sense of the many acronyms and terms used in their industry.From their 2016 Annual Report (for continuing operations):There's a general uptrend in most metrics and a slight, steady reduction in shares outstanding. The most notable data point for me in this table is the large increase in debt during 2016. This statement was included in the annual report:Note 8 to the Financial Statements indicates that interest is payable semi-annually. $1 billion of 2.25% notes due in 2020 were issued, for an effective interest rate of 2.39%. $1 billion of 3.375% notes due in 2025 were issued, for an effective interest rate of 3.48%. (The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes and amortization of the discount and debt issuance costs.) Two key leaders of ADP's executive management team are CEO Carlos Rodriguez (left) and CFO Jan Siegmund (right).Carlos Rodriguez has been President and Chief Executive Officer since November 2011. For several months prior to his appointment, he served as Chief Operating Officer. Rodriguez joined ADP in 1999 through ADP's acquisition of Vincam. At ADP, he has served as President of National Account Services and Employer Services International. While President of ADP TotalSource, it became the fastest growing and largest Professional Employer Organization in the industry. Rodriguez spent several years as President of ADP's Small Business Services (SBS), which included ADP's small business payroll services, ADP TotalSource and ADP Retirement Services. Under his leadership, SBS launched ""RUN Powered by ADP"" payroll management service, which has become one of ADP's fastest growing product platforms. He holds master of business administration and bachelor of arts degrees from Harvard University.Jan Siegmund has been Corporate VP and Chief Financial Officer since November, 2012. He was ADP's Chief Strategy Officer and President of the Added Value Services Division from 2007 to October 2012. AVS included tax, compliance services and insurance. He had responsibility for ADP's strategy, product management, marketing and corporate development. Siegmund joined ADP in 1999 as VP-Corporate Strategy. In 2000, he became Senior VP for Strategy and Business Development for ADP's Brokerage Services Group. He has led ADP's Strategy, Marketing, Product Management, Government Affairs, and Corporate Development group. He helped shape ADP's new growth strategy. Prior to ADP, Siegmund spent six years with McKinsey and Company leading consulting engagements primarily in the financial services industry. He holds a doctor of philosophy degree in economics and a master of science degree in industrial engineering.The most recent earnings call was for the Q4 FY 2016, on July 28. The transcript is available from Seeking Alpha here. Another helpful webcast is a December 1, 2015 NASDAQ Investor Conference, which features a 32-minute presentation by CFO Jan Siegmund.ADP is worth a lookThough often overvalued, ADP is worth a look, and (depending on your investment goals) it may be worth a spot on your watch list.As pointed out by CFO Jan Siegmund in the aforementioned NASDAQ Investor Conference, ADP is in the upper quartile of S&P 500 companies and it offers a steady ""mid-single digit"" annual growth. Siegmund said the company target is 8%. The company has raised its dividend for 41 consecutive years. These factors alone, in my mind, make the company worth a look.ADP's 41-year record of dividend increases puts it at number 57 on David Fish's sequential list of Dividend Champions. David cites the following dividend growth rates for ADP:David gives ADP a ""Chowder Rule"" number of 12.9 (combining the 5-year DGR and the current yield).F.A.S.T. GraphsF.A.S.T. Graphs reveals what Chuck Carnevale calls a ""premium valuation"" stock. Note that the price touched ""undervalued"" territory (the dark green area) very briefly during the Great Recession. In the current era of high valuations, it may be helpful to revisit Chuck's August 28, 2015 article, ""Understanding Fair Valuation: A Common Sense Approach To Long-Term Investing Success."" Here's one paragraph:Here are some insights gleaned from F.A.S.T. Graphs:Better InvestingBetter Investing's Company Research sheet (with data provided by Morningstar) gives us another look at ADP, which reveals several noteworthy items:Here are the four most recent Seeking Alpha articles about ADP:I rank ADP #6 in my 37-equity portfolioI was first introduced to Automatic Data Processing through Better Investing magazine in the early 1980s. My investment club did a formal study of ADP at least once and I looked at it many times through the years. It always seemed to have a premium valuation and I never made a purchase. In retrospect, using F.A.S.T. Graphs and the Better Investing company research sheet, the best time to buy ADP would have been between 2008-2012.Several weeks ago, I decided to include ADP in my retirement portfolio at a 2.5% allocation. The company's strong history was the primary factor, highlighted by their 41-year history of dividend increases and their AA credit rating.On September 5, I made an initial purchase of 100 shares at $89.76. Why? There have been a few occasions through the years when I made a purchase even though I was convinced I was overpaying, such as when I bought 3M (NYSE:MMM) in July, 2014, at $143.12, or when I bought Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on September 9, 2016, at $104.78.Sometimes I have bought a 1/4 or 1/3 position in a stock, only to see the price immediately begin to escalate, thus thwarting my effort to fill the position. Remembering these experiences, I recently took full positions in several other premium valuation stocks, with the full awareness that I was not getting bargains. However, I have conviction about their long-term merit: 175 shares of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) on September 9, 2016 at $42.95; 35 shares of WW Grainger (NYSE:GWW) on two occasions in September, 2016, for a cost basis of $228.55, 80 shares of Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) on September 9, 2016, at $71.06. If they go down in price--which I fully expect, particularly when a broad market decline comes--I will happy buy more shares when cash is available.Third Quarter UpdateThe 37 equity positions comprise 65.9% of the portfolio.In addition to these equities, I'm holding 4 exchange traded funds. Together, they comprise 7.2% of the portfolio:My goal is to add shares of three more ETFs: the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index ETF (NYSEARCA:VTI); the Vanguard Mid-Cap Value Index ETF (NYSEARCA:VOE); and the Vanguard High Dividend Yield Index ETF (NYSEARCA:VYM).I'm holding 6 non-leveraged closed-end funds. All except BIF write options to generate additional income. Together, they comprise 5.9% of the portfolio:I'm holding 8 preferred stocks. Together, they comprise 13.0% of the portfolio:I'm holding 2 bonds. Together, they comprise 2.0% of the portfolio:The portfolio value as of September 30, 2016 was $375,195, up from $308,882 at 12/31/15, for a gain of 21.5% year-to-date. The current yield is 3.8% and the cash portion of the portfolio is 5.2%.I look forward to our conversation. What's on your watch list?I'm not advocating the purchase or sale of any security. I offer this update as the journal of my effort to design and build a retirement portfolio that puts a priority on relative safety, a history of dividend growth and solid future prospects. Your goals and risk tolerance may differ, so please do your own due diligence."
4002735,46271,2016-08-29T08:02:31-04:00,"Automated Data Processing's dividend history is impressive.
        Return on equity improved significantly mainly due to increasing financial leverage.
        Dividend coverage ratio is high.","Automated Data Processing (NYSE: ADP) is a favorite among dividend aristocrats because it has more than four decades of dividend increases. Also, the stock substantially outperformed the S&P 500 since 1990. ADP is up 1500% while SPY is up 400%. After the incredible performance, I still believe that investors should maintain a long position or initiate a long position in ADP at current levels.ADP is one of the largest providers of human capital management solutions. ADP offers fully integrated systems that enable companies to outsource their HR, time and attendance management, payroll and benefits. Moreover, ADP earns revenue from the interest on funds that it temporarily holds for its clients.Reasons to invest in ADPDividend historyADP's dividend history is impressive. The stock has continuously increased its annual dividend payment since 1974. It is evident that ADP cares about its investors. Recently, ADP declared a $0.53 quarterly dividend (or $2.12 on an annualized basis), yielding a modest 2.4% dividend.DuPont ROE analysisAnother reason why investors should consider a long position in ADP is that return on equity is improving significantly. While ROE measures the efficiency of a company to generate net income using shareholder's equity, we could apply the DuPont ROE analysis to determine the cause for the improvement in the ROE. Operating efficiency, net asset efficiency, and financial leverage directly impact the return on equity. For this analysis, I used the annual financial statements of 2016, 2015 and 2014. The assets and equity are the average amounts at the beginning and the end of the period.ROE has been robust over the past three years probably because the industry is still in the growth stage. However, ROE increased from 25.3% in 2015 to an outstanding 32.1%. The operating efficiency (tax burden and interest burden) decreased slightly. Net asset efficiency (profit margin and asset turnover) remained unchanged. However, financial leverage increased remarkably from 5.68 to 8.26.Presently, the rise in financial leverage should not be a concern because the industry is still in the growth phase.Using the ROE, we can determine ADP's annual growth. For 2016, the company grew by 11.2%, an improvement from a growth of 8.1% in 2015 and 6.0% in 2014. The growth comes despite a small increase in the plowback ratio. Nonetheless, the plowback ratio remains low giving ample room for further growth in the interim.Dividend coverageTo determine the sustainability of the dividend payment, I look at the dividend coverage ratio expressed by the net cash flow from operating activities over the annual dividends paid. In brief, the dividend coverage ratio has remained relatively unchanged since 2014 at 1.97. Investors need to keep a close eye on this ratio because falling below 1.50 will raise a yellow flag.Analyst CoverageOn July 2016, Bernstein classified ADP as outperform giving a price target of $110 representing a 22% upside potential.Risks in the investmentA risk that could impair ADP's earnings is new entrants to the market. Simple Safe Dividends mentions that Zenefits has been trying to enter into the industry in his article. Zenefits gives free software that automates payroll and health insurance for small businesses, and experts regard Zenefits as a potential disruptor. However, the company has encountered many challenges recently as Ms. Suddath and Mr. Newcomer from Bloomberg point out. Another possible challenger in the sector could be Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE: PAYC). Investors need to be on the lookout for other companies trying to enter the industry.In briefADP has an impressive dividend history, the company continues to grow on a YOY basis, there is no issue with dividend coverage, and analysts favor it. Investors should consider exposing their portfolios to ADP on the first opportunity."
3991179,89805,2016-07-25T11:55:12-04:00,"ADP has one of the most reliable dividend payments in the market thanks to the company's high recurring revenue, strong client retention rates, low capital intensity, and mission-critical solutions.
        ADP has raised its dividend for more than 40 consecutive years and continues to have above-average dividend growth potential.
        Is ADP an attractive investment opportunity today for conservative dividend growth investors?","With more than four consecutive decades of dividend increases, Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is one of my favorite dividend aristocrats.The company's excellent dividend growth track record is the result of its reliable business model.ADP benefits from providing mission-critical services, generating a high percentage of recurring revenues, maintaining a strong client retention rate, running asset-light operations, and throwing off loads of free cash flow each year.Although ADP's stock has nearly doubled the market's performance over the last decade, the company has plenty of room for continued growth.Not surprisingly, ADP scores extremely well for Dividend Safety and Dividend Growth and is the type of business I like to own in our Top 20 Dividend Stocks portfolio. Let's take a closer look at the business.ADP has been in business for more than 65 years and is one of the largest providers of human capital management (NASDAQ:HCM) solutions in the world.ADP offers a wide range of cloud-based software solutions and services, which companies use to pay, recruit, staff, manage, and retain employees.According to the company's annual report, over 50 million people around the globe depend on ADP for accurate pay, reliable benefits administration, effective performance management, or other human resource services.The company generates most of its revenue from providing payroll services (handles the preparation of employee paychecks, pay statements, journals, and summaries) but has meaningfully expanded its suite of products over the last decade to cover most of the HCM spectrum.The HR Business Process Outsourcing market has been a major focus. In this market, ADP offers fully integrated outsourcing solutions that enable companies to outsource their HR, time and attendance management, payroll, and benefits administration functions to ADP.Overall, ADP provides HCM solutions to more than 630,000 businesses, which range from single-employee companies to some of the world's largest enterprises. In fact, ADP serves over 80% of Fortune 500 companies, over 90 Fortune 100 companies, and more than 440,000 small businesses. No client accounts for more than 2% of total revenue.By geography, approximately 81% of ADP's sales are generated in the U.S., 11% in Europe, 4% in Canada, and 4% in other countries.ADP's primary competitive advantages are derived from its scale and long-standing customer relationships.The company has the most complete suite of products and services in the HCM market. ADP also boasts the broadest market coverage by geography and client size. In fact, ADP services 104 countries and covers 99% of multinational employees.As a result of its scope, ADP can offer a more complete suite of cloud-based HCM solutions to expand its existing client relationships. It is also uniquely positioned to serve larger clients with operations spread around the world. This is no small task thanks to the different regulations, languages, and integration issues from one country to the next.With more than $10 billion in annual revenue and little capital required to run its business (capital expenditures were just 1.4% of sales last year), ADP also has the luxury to reinvest heavily in the latest solutions and technology.The company has spent several decades building out the depth and breadth of its solutions and invested $767 million in systems development and programming during fiscal year 2015 to further improve its offerings. These investments have helped the company transition more than 80% of its customers to cloud-based software and get 5 million people using its mobile app.ADP can also acquire smaller companies with solutions or technologies it can use to further broaden its suite of HCM solutions.As ADP becomes more ingrained with clients, switching costs rise because users are trained to use more of ADP's software solutions.Additional switching costs are created by many of the challenges ADP solves for clients. ADP manages complex regulatory environments for many businesses to make sure they remain compliant with the law.ADP handles employment taxes, tax credits, unemployment claims, workers compensation, and healthcare reform issues. Its clients must comply with each regulation to remain in business and avoid fees, increasing their dependence on ADP's expertise and ability to manage complex transactions.Over the years, ADP has established a relationship built on trust and reliability with clients. After all, ADP handles some of the most sensitive information about its clients' employees (e.g. tax statements, social security numbers, healthcare information).Building up the necessary security systems and technology infrastructure to safeguard this data takes many years of heavy investments, but winning clients' trust takes even more time.As a result, ADP enjoyed a 91.4% client retention rate in fiscal year 2015. Client retention is estimated at approximately 12 years in Employer Services and 7 years in Professional Employer Organization Services, highlighting the important role ADP plays for its clients.Long-lasting relationships with hundreds of thousands of businesses have provided another advantage that will likely become increasingly important over the coming years - big data analytics.Big data is transforming virtually every industry today, and human capital management is no exception. Companies are constantly looking for ways to better identify talent, hire the right people, retain them for longer, and make them more productive.ADP has more employee records than all of its competitors, providing it with a treasure trove of data that can be used for more detailed and insightful benchmarking for clients.Management is also opening up the company's platforms via APIs to add further value for clients. This action allows clients to integrate ADP's HCM platforms with the rest of their enterprise suite. Third-party developers can also create applications that exchange data with ADP's core HCM systems to further improve productivity and gain new insights.While data and analytics could further solidify ADP's market position and provide new growth opportunities, the HCM market is still very attractive as it stands today. The market is estimated to be $110 billion in size, which gives ADP a market share of approximately 10%.The HCM market is also growing at a mid-single digit rate, providing plenty of opportunity for ADP's sales team of 5,500 employees to continue expanding the company.Increasing regulations are further helping growth for the industry and ADP. For example, ADP recently launched the ADP Health Compliance product line, which assists mid and large companies in complying with the requirements of the Affordable Care Act in the U.S.A final unique element about ADP's business is its holding of client funds. ADP holds over $21 billion of client funds that are primarily used to pay clients' employees as part of ADP's payroll processing services.ADP invests these funds predominantly in AAA/AA-rated fixed-income securities to earn interest income until the funds need to be paid out. This is very similar to insurance companies investing their float, which is one of Warren Buffett's favorite qualities in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio of high-yield dividend stocks.Declining interest rates have limited the amount of high-margin interest income ADP can earn. The company generated $378 million in interest last year, earning a 1.7% rate.However, for every 25 basis points that short-term and intermediate-term interest rates change, ADP sees a $12 million impact to earnings (close to a 1% impact to net income). In other words, ADP would likely enjoy a moderate boost to earnings growth if interest rates were to ever rise.Overall, Automatic Data Processing appears to be a wonderfully positioned business with numerous strengths. The company provides mission-critical services, is a trusted partner with clients, requires little capital, enjoys high recurring revenue and client retention, and has a long runway for growth in a large and fragmented market.It's difficult to identify many risks that could impair ADP's long-term earnings power. The company's continual investments in programming and people help it maintain its leading market position.However, new entrants are always looking for ways to deliver a similar quality of service at a lower price and in a more user-friendly format. As the pace of technology advancements accelerates, this could become increasingly true.Zenefits, which gives away free software that automates payroll and health insurance for small businesses, has been the big name mentioned as a potential disruptor in the space (the startup launched in April 2013 and was valued as much as $4.5 billion last year). However, the company has hit a wall of challenges that have severely disrupted its growth path.Technology advancements could make it easier for new entrants to try and disrupt the industry's pricing structure. However, given clients' need to make sure their businesses remain 100% compliant and fully functional, any such change is likely to be gradual in my view. ADP has the resources to remain relevant - either by building or buying the technology or capabilities it needs to maintain its dominant market positions. It also has something very important that new entrants lack - trust (many of its customer relationships span decades).Changing laws and regulations could also pose a challenge. After all, ADP primarily makes money because its clients do not want to internally deal with complex tasks that don't add direct value to their businesses.While there is not much ADP can do to combat this risk, the company has increasingly diversified its business across an entire suite of HCM solutions, which helps reduce the risk of any single product line bringing down the firm.We analyze 25+ years of dividend data and 10+ years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend.Our Safety Score answers the question, ""Is the current dividend payment safe?"" We look at factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios, debt levels, free cash flow generation, industry cyclicality, ROIC trends, and more. Scores of 50 are average, 75 or higher is very good, and 25 or lower is considered weak.ADP's Dividend Safety Score of 90 suggests that the company's dividend payment is extremely safe. ADP's strong safety rating begins with its payout ratios.Over the last four quarters, ADP's dividend payments have consumed close to 60% of the free cash flow and earnings the company has generated.As seen below, ADP's payout ratios have about doubled over the last decade but have remained remarkably consistent in recent years. Stable payout ratios can indicate a predictable business, and ADP is no exception.While a payout ratio north of 60% would start to give me pause when dealing with a cyclical business, it is a perfectly healthy level for ADP. The company's high recurring revenue and asset-light business model provide very stable earnings each year.Source: Simply Safe DividendsSource: Simply Safe DividendsAs I mentioned earlier, ADP provides essential services that businesses need regardless of how the economy is doing. Payroll still needs to be processed, HR activities must continue, and regulations still need to be complied with.As a result, ADP performed well during the last recession. The company's sales actually grew by 1%, free cash flow per share remained relatively stable, and ADP's stock beat the S&P 500 by nearly 30% in 2008.Changes in employment levels can impact near-term growth trends for the company, but expansion of HCM offerings outside of payroll services provides diversification and opportunity to expand existing client relationships.Source: Simply Safe DividendsADP's strong Dividend Safety Score is further aided by the company's remarkable free cash flow generation. Free cash flow fuels sustainable dividend payments and dividend growth.Software-focused businesses such as ADP generate wonderful cash flow once they have achieved scale. As I previously mentioned, ADPs' business requires very little capital to run and benefits from strong client retention rates and pricing power.Source: Simply Safe DividendsIn my opinion, return on invested capital is one of the most important financial ratios to understand. The metric can be a good indicator of a company's economic moat and ability to grow earnings and pay higher dividends.Since ADP's operations require little capital to operate, the company has enjoyed strong returns on invested capital north of 20% most years. This is a clear sign of ADP's moat and allows the company to compound its earnings at a faster rate than most businesses.Source: Simply Safe DividendsADP's balance sheet is important to analyze as it relates to dividend safety because companies will make debt payments before issuing dividends. Firms with too much financial leverage can be more likely to cut their dividend if they fall on challenging times.In ADP's case, its balance sheet is a definite strength. The company has historically remained debt-free but recently took on $2 billion of debt, which will be used to repurchase shares.As seen below, ADP still maintains more cash ($3 billion) than total book debt ($2 billion), providing it with plenty of flexibility to continue paying and growing its dividend.Source: Simply Safe DividendsOverall, ADP's dividend payment is very safe. The company maintains reasonable payout ratios, provides non-discretionary services, generates substantial free cash flow, benefits from high recurring revenue and client retention rates, and has a balance sheet with more cash on hand than debt.Our Growth Score answers the question, ""How fast is the dividend likely to grow?"" It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth-centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios. Scores of 50 are average, 75 or higher is very good, and 25 or lower is considered weak.ADP's Dividend Growth Score of 79 suggests that the company has above-average dividend growth potential. ADP began paying dividends in 1974 and last increased its dividend by 8% in November 2015, marking 41 years of consecutive dividend increases for the company.The company's dividend has grown by 13.8% per year over the last 20 years, although growth has come in closer to a high-single digit rate more recently.Source: Simply Safe DividendsLooking ahead, ADP's management team targets a payout ratio of 55-60% and expects the company's earnings growth to remain at a double-digit rate longer term.Since the company's payout ratio is sitting near 60% today, future dividend growth will likely be fueled by earnings growth. I expect ADP's dividend to continue compounding by at least 7-9% per year over the medium-term.Shares of ADP trade at a forward-looking P/E multiple of 29.3 and offer a dividend yield of 2.2%, which is slightly below the stock's five-year average dividend yield of 2.55%.It's hard to argue that ADP is a bargain today. If anything, the stock seems somewhat overpriced - the market is clearly rewarding the company's predictability (high recurring revenue, strong client retention rates, and mission-critical services) and ability to deliver reliable earnings growth.Over the longer term, ADP's management targets 7-9% annual revenue growth and 12-14% annual earnings per share growth with an objective to deliver a total shareholder return in the top quartile of the S&P 500.If the company continues delivering on its promises, ADP's stock certainly has potential for double-digit annual returns over the long run. However, the current multiple seems to provide little margin for error.Automatic Data Processing is a wonderful business. Few companies have a more dependable business model and dividend growth track record than ADP, and the future continues to look bright thanks to the large and highly fragmented nature of the HCM market.The stock doesn't look cheap today but should be watched by income investors seeking long-term dividend growth and capital appreciation."
3989727,100856,2016-07-20T07:49:46-04:00,"Automatic Data Processing never seems to be on sale, due to its quality.
        The firm is virtually unassailable, and the market seems to know this.
        Patience is recommended here, and much more of it is needed in this case.","Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is currently trading in the mid-$90 range with a price-to-earnings ratio of 29.94, a forward P/E ratio of 25.75, and offers a dividend yield of 2.23% with a payout ratio of 60.60%. The five year average P/E ratio for ADP is 23.7, while the broad market's current P/E ratio is 19.3.Earnings per share for the past twelve months is $3.17, and the EPS growth over the next five years is anticipated to be 10.40%, leveling off to 5.80% thereafter. Using a discount rate of 11% (the stock market average), I estimate fair value for Automatic Data Processing to be $78.37, meaning that the stock is currently overvalued by 21%.Company OverviewGiven its five year average valuation, the opportunities to buy Automatic Data Processing at fair value are few and far between. This is because this business process outsourcing - or BPO - company is the dominant force in its sector. Automatic Data Processing take care of various functions on behalf of many firms globally, such as computing, employee benefits, human resources, payroll, and tax reports.It has grown from the firm Henry Taub launched in 1949 as Automatic Payrolls, Inc. in Paterson, New Jersey, to a dominant global BPO provider which services 620,000 organizations in over 125 countries, has 90% of Fortune 100 companies - and 80% of Fortune 500 companies - as clients, and currently has a market capitalization of $43.31 billion.The company is very profitable, with net income between 2011-2015 staying within the parameters of $1.25 billion and $1.5 billion. Furthermore, Automatic Data Processing also boasts a forty-one year streak of paying its shareholders consecutively rising dividends, making the firm a Dividend Aristocrat.Competitive AdvantageThe company benefits from two clear advantages: the fact that payroll and human resources are two areas that they cannot afford to cut costs with, and the size of their operations. Switching the providers of these services can be a costly affair, meaning that such companies will stick with Automatic Data Processing for the long-haul. In addition, no competitor can match the global reach that Automatic Data Processing possesses. The closest U.S. competitor they have is Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), and their net income between 2011-2015 was between $548 million and $756.8 million, which is almost half that of Automatic Data Processing for the same period.Final ThoughtsIt is easy to see why Automatic Data Processing would be an ideal candidate for long-term investors. However, it is clear that Mr. Market agrees, hence its current valuation. And since valuation matters, I cannot recommend the company as a buy at this time, in spite of how excellent it is. A 21% overvaluation is something that cannot be overlooked.I do recommend keeping an eye on it for a fall in share price, but more patience than usual will be required for this particular stock. As its five-year average P/E ratio suggests, this is not a stock that goes on sale often. Nonetheless, it is one that I reckon will reward such patience in the long-run.DISCLAIMER: I am not a financial professional and accept no responsibility for any investment decisions a reader makes.

Its business has low capital requirements, and the resulting strong free cash flow generation has enabled it to raise its dividend in every year for 40+ years. Shares currently yield ~2.4%.Alternative options remain within the company for free cash flow use, but the potential for share repurchases and tuck in acquisitions pose a minimal threat to the growth of future dividends, from our point of view. The firm recently raised $2 billion in debt to buy back shares, for example, and share repurchases have averaged over $1.1 billion over the past three fiscal years (2014- 2016).Looking forward, ADP is targeting a 55%- 60% dividend payout ratio and a dividend yield of 2%-3%. We expect ADP's dividend to continue to grow on an annual basis for the foreseeable future. Investors have come to expect annual growth from ADP's dividend payout, and ADP should continue to deliver, in our view.Let's dig in to the remainder of ADP's investment thesis as we work to uncover the true attractiveness of its stock. There is so much more to consider than the size of its yield!Automatic Data Processing's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Automatic Data Processing is one of the world's largest providers of business outsourcing solutions. The firm offers a wide range of easy-to-use human resource, payroll, tax and benefits administration solutions from a single source. It has 620,000 clients in 125+ countries. The company was founded in 1949 and is based in New Jersey.• In the US, the human capital market is a $50 billion market growing at a nice mid-single-digit pace. The market is ~$90 billion on a global basis. ADP has the potential to cover 95%+ of all multinational employees, offering further growth potential.• ADP has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 12.9% in coming years. The firm's intrinsic value considers 'funds held for clients.' Investors should be cognizant that future methodology changes impacting how we account for such a balance can impact our estimate of the firm's fair value.• In fiscal 2017, ADP is expecting material growth throughout its business. It anticipates growing total revenue 7%-9%, boosted by worldwide new business bookings growing 4%-6%. Diluted earnings per share guidance has been set at a growth range of 6%-8% from $3.25 in fiscal 2016.• ADP boasts a large, recurring revenue base resulting in strong, consistent cash flow generation. The firm's business model has low capital requirements. It has minimal long-term obligations and has been paying dividends continuously since 1974.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Automatic Data Processing's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 77.9%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Automatic Data Processing's free cash flow margin has averaged about 12.2% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Automatic Data Processing, cash flow from operations increased about 19% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 19% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisWe think Automatic Data Processing is worth $98 per share with a fair value range of $78-$118.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them. Our near-term operating forecasts, including revenue and earnings, do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 5.5% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 0.8%.Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 17.3%, which is above Automatic Data Processing's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Automatic Data Processing, we use a 9.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $98 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future were known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Automatic Data Processing. We think the firm is attractive below $78 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $118 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Automatic Data Processing's fair value at this point in time to be about $98 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Automatic Data Processing's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $122 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $98 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

3984907,96536,2016-06-28T11:25:28-04:00,"ADP is a well-known company with a strong competitive position, long track record and trusted brand.ADP has grown its dividend for 41 years and presents an intriguing dividend-growth investing opportunity.But payout ratio represents a high percentage of earnings, and dividend growth may be at risk if revenue growth can't resume.","Automatic Data Processing Inc (NASDAQ:ADP) provides technology-based outsourcing solutions to help manage HR, payroll, tax, and benefits administration from a single source. Over the last 60 years, ADP has grown into a trusted brand, with almost $10B in revenue and 570,000 clients (source).In fact, if you've ever worked at a company on payroll, then there's a good chance you've received a pay stub from ADP. Personally, I've had multiple jobs where ADP took care of the payroll, as well as other various HR functions. They are a well-known industry provider with about $39.5B in market capitalization.Given this proven track record, the massive scale of ADP, as well as the switching costs of changing HR administration providers, I'm intrigued to see if their perceived strength is reflected in the financial statements. Will we see consistently strong margins confirming a strong competitive advantage? And what does the dividend record look like?We'll get to all of that in a second. But first, here's a price chart of ADP (not including dividends) to show you how the stock has performed over the last 10 years. I think it's good perspective:With that in mind, let's take a closer look at the historical financial results (source). I'm curious to see if the financial trends and business model support this ongoing price appreciation.ADP: Processing the Historical Financial DataFirst, let's start at the top line. This is a good way to get a look at market demand for ADP's services. Given the large-cap business, and the relatively slow-changing nature of their business, I would expect revenue growth to be slow and steady. Let's see what the numbers say:As you can see, the top line numbers fit the bill. ADP is a mature business, so rapid growth isn't to be expected. And while they've slowed a bit lately, it's still positive over the period. To their credit, ADP is trying to expand their business model with their PEO Services segment, which strives to provide a completely outsourced HR solution. This segment currently makes up about 33% of revenues, and is growing at 16% year-over-year vs. the core Employer Services segment's 5% growth (source). It will be interesting to see if this can keep driving sales.Another hypothesis I have about the ADP business model is that the company has a trusted brand, which allows it to charge a modest premium for services. This should show up in healthy gross margins. You can see in the graph below that they've been quite consistent. The steady operating margins also further drive home the point that the business is well run, and likely has staying power.Another angle we can use to try and further judge ADP's competitive advantage is to look at earnings quality. One of my favorite ways to measure earnings quality is by comparing net income to operating cash flow. If the latter is higher than the former, it's indicative of high quality earnings because companies are actually collecting the cash, and not relying on accounts receivables or billings to boost EPS. This is what we should expect from a company like ADP that provides a core business services and generates recurring revenue from clients.So now, you're probably wondering, what's the company doing with all of this cash? Well, since ADP is an asset-light business, capital expenses only average about 20-30% of operating cash flow, which leaves a lot of money left over to distribute to shareholders. Over the last 10 years, ADP has used both dividends and share buybacks to help return value to shareholders.First, let's take a look at dividends. You can see they've grown steadily, along with payout ratio. The current yield is just under 2.5%, but the historical growth rate and 41 year track record makes this more appealing.While ADP has a bit more wiggle room on their payout ratio, I think it's starting to get a little high for comfort. This number looks slightly stronger on a cash flow basis. But without top line growth resuming, dividend growth could be challenging.However, the other lever ADP has to increase returns for owners, is share buybacks. By reducing the share count, ADP can grow the distribution per share, without spending more cash on dividends overall. Here's a look into how shares outstanding have consistently declined over the last 10 years:Finally, the company has a strong working capital position, with almost $17B in net current assets. While ADP did recently take on some debt, the interest expense is currently less than 2% of operating income. Thus, I'm not yet worried. But should this number keep creeping higher, and should debt only be used to fund buybacks, it would become a concern. At present though I'm comfortable with this leverage.On the other hand, one possible dark spot on ADP's track record is the lack of book value per share growth. As an equity owner, I'd like to see my ownership stake increasing over time. Unfortunately with ADP, this hasn't been the case. See for yourself in this graph:I understand this to a degree, as ADP pays out a large percent of earnings as dividends. But this, combined with the recent debt increase, has reduced book value per share. I'm willing to give ADP a pass for now, but will be watching this carefully in the quarters to come.Other risks to ADP might include new, lower-cost solutions. Faster and nimbler cloud-based competitors could start to infringe on market share. That said, ADP has a large install base with little incentive to switch providers.I'm also a bit skeptical of the share buybacks at current prices. I don't necessarily have a better idea of what management should do with the money, but buying back shares at all-time highs seems somewhat questionable. So, given this mixed picture, is an investment in ADP warranted?Conclusion: Starting a Small Position in ADPADP isn't a perfect investment. But for me, I think the pros outweigh the cons. Given my longer-term time horizon and willingness to dollar cost average, I'm comfortable having this as a small piece of my portfolio. Plus, the company has an impressive track record, and the PEO Services segment could present additional growth opportunity and further support the dividend.To that point, I'll keep a close eye on the metrics above to see how dividend growth might be sustained. I'll be especially careful about revenue growth, which I believe is necessary to sustain further dividend growth in-line with historical results.But that's just my opinion. Do you think ADP is a good dividend investment for you? Or are you turned off by bumpy earnings and lack of equity growth?"

Automatic Data Processing is the nation's largest provider of business outsourcing, serving nearly 650,000 customers. The company was founded in 1949 and is a global company with customers in over a hundred countries. The company operates in two units, the Employer Services and the Professional Employer Organizations. The Employer Services unit accounts for 75% of total revenue. Automatic Data Processing is a very consistent dividend payer. The company currently ranks 27th in yield within the large cap technology sector. The payroll firm also announced financial results last Wednesday. Automatic Data Processing earned $0.86 per share for the quarter. The solid results bested analyst expectations of $0.76 per share. Revenue was a solid $2.9 billion, also surpassing expectations. The firm's Q3 revenue was 7.5% this year compared to the same quarter last year. The Employer Services Unit maintained solid growth of 6% while the faster growing, albeit smaller, Professional Employer Organization Unit, had a 13% rise in total sales. Management of the firm raised fiscal year 2017 to a range of $3.61-3.68 versus prior consensus of $3.62. Revenue guidance was set at about 8%, inline with 2016 growth. The firm broke down the projected revenue growth; 5% in the Employer Services Unit and a more robust 15% in the Professional Employer Organization segment.Automatic Data Processing has maintained a solid three-year growth rate of dividends of 7 percent. The New Jersey based company has paid dividends on a consecutive basis for 42 years, making the firm a dividend aristrocrat.

It also offers its ADP Vantage HCM now program for larger size businesses. Much of Automatic Data Processing's growth each year comes simply from a growing numbers of employees in their system. As Automatic Data Processing charges a flat fee for service, additional fees are added as more employees join the program. The better growing Professional Employer Organization model offers double-digit revenue growth potential for the company. It's different than the Employer Services Unit as it has employees assigned to ADP. Thus it is more of a dual contract arrangement for the employee. It is also a methodology for companies using Automatic Data Processing to offshore their human resources. Automatic Data Processing offers multiple other products associated with payroll including 401k administration and healthcare benefit plans to generate additional revenue.On the negative side of the ledger, ADP's retention rate has been falling since 2013. It was 91.3 in 2013 and now resides at 90.5 Although retention rates stabilized in the low 90s for now, the firm has had multiple quarters of negative retention rates. Part of this could be due to the firm's efforts to move clients to its Workforce Now platform, which is cloud-based. Although Automatic Data Processing is one of the premier companies within the technology sector, valuations are stretched. Based upon analyst expectations of $3.66 per share in earnings for 2017, ADP trades at a rich 25 times earnings. Compare that to the forward P/E ratio for the S&P 500, at 16.6. This P/E ratio is based on a forward 12-month S&P 500 EPS estimate ($130.76).

These guidelines are only used to filter companies to be considered in the portfolio. For a complete set of the guidelines, please see my article ""The Good Business Portfolio: All 24 Positions."" These guidelines provide me with a balanced portfolio of income, defensive, momentum, and growing companies that keeps me ahead of the Dow average.Automatic Data Processing Inc. is a large-cap company with a capitalization of $42.0 billion. The large size of ADP gives it the muscle plus its cash flow to increase the business going forward. The foreign part of ADP, about 20% of the company, has growth opportunities for expansion of the business. The nearest competitor is Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) at a capitalization of $19.6 billion, about half the size of ADP.Automatic Data Processing Inc. has a dividend yield of 2.50% which is average for the market. The dividend has been increased for 41 years in a row making ADP a dividend aristocrat and its dividend is very safe. ADP is therefore a good choice for the dividend growth investor. The average payout ratio is good at 60% over the past five years. After paying the average dividend this leaves plenty of cash remaining for investment in new company purchases and business expansion.The company's cash flow is good at $1.65 billion which leaves enough cash after paying its average dividend for normal business expansion. ADP has good balance between paying a dividend and keeping enough cash to expand the business.I also require the CAGR going forward to be able to cover my yearly expenses. My dividends provide 3.1% of the portfolio as income and I need 1.9% capital gain in addition for a yearly distribution of 5%. Automatic Data Processing Inc. has a three-year CAGR of 12%, well above my overall requirement. Looking back five years, $10,000 invested five years ago would be worth $22,700 today (from S&P Capital IQ). This makes Automatic Data Processing Inc. a good investment for the dividend growth investor with the average dividend and steady, above average growth.S&P Capital IQ has a three-star rating or hold on the stock with a price target of $85.00. This makes ADP fairly priced at present. In the long term its above average CAGR of 12% and its business in the rising employee market make the company a good investment that pays a good dividend and has moderate steady growth to let you sleep well at night.Total Return and Yearly DividendThe Good Business Portfolio Guidelines are just a screen to start with and not absolute rules. When I look at a company, the total return is a key parameter to see if it fits the objective of The Good Business Portfolio. Automatic Data Processing Inc. had slightly lower total return than the Dow baseline in my 39.5-month test period. I chose the 39.5-month test period (starting January 1, 2013) because it includes the great year of 2013, the moderate year of 2014, the small loss year of 2015 and the slightly positive year of 2016 YTD to see how the company does in good and bad markets. I have had comments about why I do not compare the total return to the S&P 500 average. I use the Dow average because the Good Business Portfolio has six Dow companies in it and is weighted more to the Dow average than the S&P 500. Modeling the Dow average is not an objective of the portfolio but just happened by using the 10 guidelines as a filter for company selection. The dividend is at 2.50% and has been increased for 41 years. This slightly underperforming total return and average dividend makes Automatic Data Processing Inc. appropriate for the dividend growth investor. YTD total return is 6.6% beating the Dow after the first interest rate rise, and more is yet to come as rates rise slowly.Dow's 39.5-month total return baseline is 34.14%.Last Quarter's EarningsFor the last quarter ADP reported earnings on February 3, 2016 that met expectations at $0.72 compared to last year's $0.70 vs. an expected $0.72. Revenue increased 5.6% to $2.81 billion. This was a fair report showing the result of a slowly improving economy. Earnings for the next quarter will be released in late April and are expected to be at $1.18 compared to the last year's $1.04. Management guided forward for 12%-14% earnings growth for the next fiscal year. ADP also is returning value to shareholders by its repurchase of $750 million shares.Business OverviewAutomatic Data Processing, Inc. is a provider of human capital management solutions and business process outsourcing. The company operates through two segments: Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services. The Employer Services segment offers a range of business outsourcing and technology-enabled HCM solutions. These offerings include payroll services, benefits administration, recruiting and talent management, human resources management, insurance services, retirement services and payment and compliance solutions. The company's PEO business, ADP TotalSource, offers small and mid-sized businesses human resources (HR) outsourcing solution through a co-employment model. ADP TotalSource includes HR management and employee benefits functions, HR administration, employee benefits and employer liability management into a single-source solution. The 12% projected growth each year and the opportunity to buy other companies allows ADP the capability to continue its strong growth up cycle. Also the business grows with the economy, which is growing slowly and with interest rates being raised by the Fed, this should help the bottom line as ADP makes more money on its float in the payroll business.Takeaways And Recent Portfolio ChangesAutomatic Data Processing Inc. is a good Dividend Growth choice considering its 41 years of dividend increases and average dividend of 2.5%. Also it has a 12% CAGR going forward, a very strong growth prospect. The Good Business Portfolio has a full position of 4.61% of the portfolio and will let it grow until it hits 8% of the portfolio, and then it's trim time. If you don't already have a position in the human resources sector, ADP may be worth a position for the dividend growth segment of your portfolio.Bought Some more Omega Health Investors (NYSE:OHI), now at 3.7% of The Good Business Portfolio. I intend to keep adding to OHI until it's 4% of the portfolio and watch it grow. The dividends are being reinvested in shares of OHI. OHI just increased its dividend by $0.01/quarter or 1.8% for a yearly increase of 7.2% if these quarterly increases continue. From the last earnings report OHI has a FFO of $0.72 giving it the ability to increase the dividend for many quarters to come.Trimmed NVS to 0.8% of the portfolio. Its growth and projections going forward do not look promising.Started a small position in Hormel Food Corporation (NYSE:HRL) at 0.3% and will see what the next quarter brings before increasing the position.The Good Business Portfolio generally trims a position when it gets above 8% of the portfolio. Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is 8.4% of portfolio, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is 8.4% of the portfolio, Altria Group Inc.(NYSE:MO) is 7.4% of the portfolio, Boeing (NYSE:BA) is 7.9% and L Brands (NYSE:LB) is 6.3% of the portfolio, therefore HD and JNJ are now in trim position with Altria Group Inc., L Brands Inc. and Boeing getting close. Boeing is going to be pressed to 10% of the portfolio because of it being cash positive on individual 787 plane costs, announced in the last quarter earnings call.See my recent article on 2015 fourth-quarter performance for the complete portfolio list and performance. Become a follower and you will get each quarter's performance after the earnings season is over.I have written individual articles on CAB, JNJ, EOS, LB, GE, IR, MO, BA, Omega Health Investors and HD that are in The Good Business Portfolio and other companies being evaluated by the portfolio. If you have an interest please look for them in my list of previous articles.Of course this is not a recommendation to buy or sell and you should always do your own research and talk to your financial advisor before any purchase or sale. This is how I manage my IRA retirement account, and the opinions on the companies are my own."
3981435,67985,2016-06-11T18:52:28-04:00,"Interest earned on client funds held is important to the company as it generates substantial cash flows given the low costs associated with the earning of such funds.An unprecedented low interest rate environment has dramatically reduced the company's interest earned on client funds.Investors once expected the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates four times in 2016 but now expect interest rates to be raised once.Without a more significant rise in interest rates, the company will have to rely on average balance of client funds growth to increase interest earned on client funds.We recommend investors wait to purchase the company's shares, as they trade at a price-to-earnings ratio above their historical mid-to-upper teens.","Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is the largest global provider of payroll outsourcing services and offers a wide range of human resource, payroll, tax and benefits administration solutions to businesses of every size. The company also sells other outsourced human resources services, such as payroll tax administration, retirement plan administration, health benefit administration, and workers' compensation insurance services. In addition, ADP earns revenue from interest on funds that it temporarily holds for its clients (the time between the transfer of money to ADP and the time a direct deposit is made or that checks are sent to and cashed by employees). While the company has a client base of hundreds of thousands of U.S. clients, in recent years it has sought to diversify this base by making a significant effort to expand its international business. Further, ADP also offers an increasing number of cloud-based solutions to compete against startup companies that offer similar services. In addition to pursuing growth through global expansion, ADP is experiencing growth from providing services to help its clients comply with the legal requirements of the Affordable Care Act (""Obamacare"").Economic downturns pressure ADP's earnings because higher unemployment reduces demand for its payroll services. Such downturns also result in falling interest rates that adversely affect the company's revenue earned from interest on held client funds. While ADP's revenues from interest earned on client funds held currently account for no more than about 5 percent of total revenues, such revenue is important to the company nonetheless. The interest earned on client funds is important to the company given that it generates substantial cash flows because there is little cost associated with the earning of such funds. ADP used to generate more income from the interest on client funds, but unprecedented cuts to interest rates due to the 2008-09 recession have dramatically reduced such funds since then.Since 2008, an ultra low interest rate environment has been in place. At the end of 2015, investors widely believed that the U.S. Federal Reserve (""the Federal Reserve"") would raise interest rates four times in 2016. Now, however, investors see the Federal Reserve raising rates once in 2016 given their concerns regarding slow economic growth. Any increase in interest rates in 2016 should have a positive effect on ADP's interest earned on client funds since it will help increase returns on investments. The projected single rate hike, however, will likely not be significant enough to increase interest earned to pre-2008 recession levels. Until interest rates rise in a more significant manner, ADP will have to rely on growth in the average balance of client funds to help growth of interest earned on client funds. We believe that rising interest rates given projected Federal Reserve rate increases in 2016 will not have enough of an impact on ADP's interest earned on client funds to recommend buying ADP's shares now. We believe further, as noted below, that ADP's shares are trading near 52-week highs and are highly priced given the historical price-to-earnings ratio for the company's shares. As such, we believe a potential investor should wait to buy ADP's shares until the share price pulls back to a level near its historical price-to-earnings ratio.Third quarter fiscal 2016 earningsIn late April 2016, ADP announced earnings from continuing operations of $1.17 per share, a 13.6 percent increase from the year-ago quarter. Total revenues were $3.25 billion, a 7.4 percent increase from the year-ago quarter. Revenues for the employer services division increased 5 percent from the year-ago quarter to $2.58 billion. Revenues for the PEO services division increased 16 percent from the year-ago quarter to $866.3 million. ADP's combined worldwide new business bookings (annualized recurring revenues expected from new orders) increased 13 percent from the year-ago quarter. Interest on funds held for the company's clients increased about 2 percent to $103 million. The company's average client funds balance increased 2 percent from the year-ago quarter to $26.7 billion while the average interest yield was 1.5 percent.ADP expects fiscal 2016 revenue growth to be about 7 percent from fiscal year 2015. The company expects earnings per share to increase about 12 percent from fiscal 2015 year. Further, the company expects interest on funds held for clients to remain flat from year-ago levels at $378 million.Our viewADP has been engaged in a strategy of increasing its offering of global services outside the U.S. to increase its growth rate as the company participates in a saturated U.S. market for large-company employer solutions, and competition exists from established companies and emerging participants for small and mid-sized clients. While the company should benefit from improving unemployment levels, ongoing underemployment is likely to continue.ADP's results are also being adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar. ADP will, however, continue to benefit due to compliance issues arising from the Affordable Care Act. The company, which is improving its execution to allow it to have a high rate of client retention, will continue to experience a volatile economic environment and increasing competition from Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) and Equifax (NYSE:EFX). To combat competition, ADP has been increasing its service and support resources to meet with rising demand. Increased investment in service and support will drive growth in the long term, but in the near term will adversely effect earnings. The company, however, with its higher revenue per client and lower cost of operations allow it to compete more effectively against competitors. We should note that in the past year, ADP in an uncharacteristic move, issued $2 billion in debt to fund share buybacks. The Moody's Investors Service downgraded the company's debt and stated the debt issuance represented the company's ""… first-ever debt-funded buyback, which represents an abrupt shift away from the company's historically conservative financial practices. … Future long-term debt issuances could diminish ADP's financial flexibility, including its ability to pursue prudent strategic opportunities and to defend its market share against emerging competition."" With respect to ADP's debt issuance, we agree with Moody's outlook, but we also note that we never like to see a company issuing debt and engaging in share buybacks when its shares are trading near 52-week highs.ADP's stable business, recurring revenues from an established client base, solid free cash flow and dividend that increases annually have long made the company's shares attractive to investors. Although interest rates are not likely to rise sufficiently to boost earnings in the near term, there is plenty to like about an investment in ADP's shares if an investor can buy at a value-oriented price. With that said, we recommend that potential investors wait for a strong overall market selloff to purchase the company's shares. ADP's shares currently trade near their 52-week high with a price-to-earnings ratio of about 26. Earnings estimates for fiscal year 2016 are $3.24 per share and for fiscal 2017 are $3.69 per share. The forward price-to-earnings ratio based on fiscal 2017 earnings is about 23.60. The shares are expensive given the company's historical price-to-earnings ratio being in the range of the mid-to-upper teens. We believe that investors should wait for ADP's share price to fall within the range of $66.45 to 73.80 (an 18 to 20 price-to-earnings ratio based on 2017 fiscal year earnings) before initiating a full position.Click ""follow"" next to our contributor name at the top of this article to follow our upcoming articles on ADP and more."
3805176,63883,2016-01-12T11:01:14-05:00,ADP has paid increasing dividends for 41 consecutive years.See the company's historical dividend yield over the last ~30 years.ADP's management thinks fair value is a P/E ratio of 18.3 to 30. Do you agree?,"ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) was founded in 1949 in Patterson, New Jersey. The company provides businesses of all sizes with payroll, tax, and human resource services and software.ADP has grown rapidly since 1949. The company now processes payroll for 1 in 6 (24 million total) workers in the United States, and another 12 million internationally. Over the last decade, ADP stock has compounded investor wealth at 13.2% a year.This article examines ADP's dividend, competitive advantage, growth prospects, recession performance, and valuation.ADP Dividend AnalysisADP has increased its dividend payments for 41 consecutive years, making the company a Dividend Aristocrat. The image below shows the company's quarterly dividend history since 1983.The company currently has a payout ratio of ~60% and a 2.7% dividend yield. ADP's dividend yield is 0.5 percentage points above the S&P 500's dividend yield of 2.2%.The company's payout ratio is generous without being overly aggressive. ADP's management is targeting a payout ratio in the 55% to 60% range. This means dividends are likely to grow in line with earnings-per-share going forward.ADP's payout ratio wasn't always so high. The company has expanded its payout ratio from 33% in 2005 to the 55%+ since 2010. With that in mind, take a look at the company's long-term dividend yield history below:The effects of the company's payout ratio hikes are evident in its dividend yield history. ADP's average dividend yield since 2010 is 2.4%. As mentioned above, the stock currently has a 2.7% dividend yield.Business Segment Overview: PEO & Employer ServicesADP operates in two primary business segments. Each segment is shown below along with percentage of total earnings generated for ADP in its 1st quarter of fiscal 2016:Both segments provide payroll, human resources, and compliance services to ADP's customers. The PEO Services segment operates by creating a shared tax ID number with its small and medium sized business customers.The Employer Services segment manages payroll (and other human resources and compliance activities), but does not create a shared tax ID number for its clients. That is the primary distinction between the two segments.Competitive AdvantageImagine the agony a business goes through when finding the right compliance and payroll processing company…ADP operates in a field where cutting corners can cost companies dearly. As a result, the human resources and payroll industry is not about commodity pricing, but rather quality service.ADP is the Human Resources provider for over 80% of Fortune 500 companies. ADP's market dominance is not confined to the U.S. The company is also the number one outsourced human resource provider in Europe.Another competitive advantage for ADP is its global scale. The company can manage the payroll for virtually all employees of multi-national corporations. This is a key selling point that smaller rivals cannot match.ADP's size gives it the ability to better serve the largest multi-national companies in a way that reduces the complexity of their operations by having only one payroll provider globally.The fundamental reason for ADP to exist (payroll taxes and government compliance) gives the company a very long expected life. ADP is not going anywhere anytime soon.ADP's Growth Prospects & Expected Total ReturnsADP is one of the largest companies in a very large industry. The human resources, compliance, and payroll industry is growing - and ADP is growing faster than the industry. Source: NASDAQ 33rd Investor Program Presentation, slide 10There are a two primary growth drivers for the industry in general and ADP in particular:As the global economy grows, more businesses will need more payroll processing and human resources services.On top of this, growing regulatory burdens - both in the United States and internationally - incentivize businesses (especially small businesses) to outsource payroll services. Source: NASDAQ 33rd Investor Program Presentation, slide 15These two growth drivers combined with expanding services from ADP will drive above-average growth for ADP going forward. The company's management is targeting long-term total returns of 14% to 17% (!) a year from the following sources: Source: NASDAQ 33rd Investor Program Presentation, slide 22Obviously, returns in the mid-teens would be exceptional. Can the company really grow at this rate? Each of management's expected growth drivers are compared to historical or current results below.Expected dividend yield of 2% to 3%ADP currently has a 2.7% dividend yield. There is no question that management's expected dividend yield is in line with current numbers.Expected share repurchases of ~1% a yearThe company has reduced its share count by 2% a year over the last decade. Again, this estimate appears very reasonable.Revenue growth of 7% to 9%ADP has grown its revenue 2.3% a year over the last decade. I find it difficult to believe that ADP will be able to grow its revenue at 3x to 4x its historical rate over the last decade over a longer period of time. With that said, the company's performance in recent years has been stronger. As a result, I believe a more reasonable (given historical numbers) revenue growth estimate is 3% to 7% per year.Margin expansion of 4% per yearCan any company expand its margins at 4% a year consistently? I certainly don't think so. Margins can only expand so much in a competitive environment. ADP's net profit margin in 2005 was 12.4%. In 2015, it was 12.6%. A better margin expansion estimate is 1% to 2% per year.With the above adjustments above, investors in ADP should expect total returns of 7.7% to 12.7% a year from the following sources:Valuation - Is Now the Time to Buy ADP?With a payout ratio range of 55% to 60% and a dividend yield range of 2% to 3%, this means management is estimating a fair price-to-earnings ratio of 18.3 to 30.Based on ADP's expected total returns, shareholder friendly management, stability, and competitive advantage, I believe a fair price-to-earnings multiple for the company is around 20.ADP is currently trading for a price-to-earnings multiple of 26.2. This is near the higher end of management's price-to-earnings ratio estimate, and above my estimate of fair value. For comparison, the S&P 500 is currently trading for a price-to-earnings ratio of 20.3.For investors looking to initiate or add to a position in ADP, I would wait until the company is trading below a price-to-earnings ratio of 20. A price-to-earnings ratio below 18 would make ADP a bargain.ADP's Recession PerformanceADP performed very well during the recession of 2007 to 2009. The company's revenue per share and earnings per share increased each year from 2007 to 2009.Despite economic downturns, businesses must pay employees and keep up with government regulation.As a result, ADP is fairly well insulated from the effects of recessions. The company's earnings-per-share through the Great Recession are shown below:Final ThoughtsADP has good future growth prospects. The company is the dominant player in the payroll and human resources industry and offers shareholders safety due to its competitive advantages and conservative balance sheet.The downside to the company is that it appears to be somewhat overvalued at this time. As a result, ADP does not rank particularly well using The 8 Rules of Dividend Investing."
3761366,93496,2015-12-17T01:41:30-05:00,"ADP is a steady, profitable, high-dividend, human capital management company with a clear path to a higher stock price.ADP’s peer, Paychex, offers a similar investment opportunity with an even higher dividend.Each 25 basis point interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve will add roughly $12 million to ADP’s annual earnings from continuing operations.ADP’s cloud-based software competitors (e.g. Paycom and The Ultimate Software Group) have more risk, but also have the potential for significantly more reward.","Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is an attractive stock to own. It's a stable, highly profitable, human capital management (HCM) company with a large and growing dividend. However, because of ADP's large business with large companies, an important subplot within the HCM industry is easily overlooked. Specifically, as the benefits of cloud-based solutions have become obvious in recent years (i.e. they're cheaper and more convenient), a high-stakes race has emerged to capture as much small company, cloud-based, HCM new business as quickly as possible. In addition to being cheaper and more convenient for customers, cloud-based HCM solutions are also very profitable for providers (i.e. they're high margin, and once you've captured the business it is unlikely to leave). As a result, companies like Paycom (NYSE:PAYC) and The Ultimate Software Group (NASDAQ:ULTI) are spending enormous amounts of money to capture new business now because they know the heavy spending will be unnecessary in the future and the business will eventually turn into an impressive cash cow.We like ADP: It's stable, profitable, has a high dividend, and it's not overvalued.If you're not familiar, ADP provides a range of software and services to help companies recruit, staff, pay, manage and retain employees. And as the following chart shows, ADP's revenues and profits are very large and fairly stable:A big reason for the stability is the high customer retention rate. For example, ADP's worldwide client revenue retention was 91.4% in fiscal 2015 (Annual Report, p.26). This steady stream of business helps reduce the company's volatility, and it also helps the company pay a healthy dividend (i.e. ADP has an above average 2.5% dividend yield).Additionally, ADP's stable business generates lots of free cash flow (FCF), so it can continue to increase the dividend as well as repurchase shares. The following chart shows ADP's free cash flow over the last several years:Specifically, in fiscal 2015, ADP paid dividends of $927.6 million and returned $1,557.2 million in cash through its share buyback program (ADP Annual Report, p.20). The company also has a track record of increasing its quarterly dividend for 40 consecutive years.ADP is able to increase the amount of cash returned to shareholders because it is growing at only a moderate pace. Sources of growth for ADP include economic growth (ADP generally grows as the economy grows), international growth (the company is working to expand outside the US), and rising interest rates (management estimates that a change in both short- and intermediate-term interest rates of 25 basis would result in approximately a $12 million impact to earnings from continuing operations) (Annual Report, p.33). However, ADP would not be returning any cash at all to shareholders if it had the same aggressive growth opportunities as some of its smaller competitors (more on this later).A basic discounted free cash flow model suggests the market is expecting ADP to grow at an annual rate of about 4.4% (we divided fiscal 2015 FCF by the WACC [8.4%] minus the growth rate to back into the current share price). A 4.4% growth rate is not unrealistic given the company's growth opportunities. And realistically, ADP will likely achieve a higher growth rate given its current trajectory. For example, analysts surveyed by Yahoo Finance expect earnings to grow at an annual rate of 10.4% over the next 5 years, and management has already provided guidance for 7-8% revenue growth in 2016 (ADP Earnings Release).We like Paychex for the same reasons as ADP, plus it has a bigger dividend.Like ADP, Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) is an HCM company with large and fairly stable profits. And while Paychex's market capitalization is smaller than ADP's ($19B vs. $39B), the following chart shows Paychex's profit margin is higher:Like ADP, Paychex also generates an impressive stream of FCF that can be used to grow the business or return to shareholders (i.e. share repurchases and dividends).For example, Paychex used its FCF to repurchase shares ($182.4 million in FY 2015) and pay dividends ($551.8 million in FY 2015) (source: Google Finance). And specifically, PAYX's dividend payments amount to an impressive 3.2% dividend yield (significantly higher than ADP). For investors interested in a stable, high dividend yield, Paychex is worth considering.However, also like ADP, if Paychex had better organic growth opportunities, then it would be using all of its FCF to grow the business instead of returning it to shareholders. In fact, Paychex explains that it seeks inorganic growth through ""strategic acquisitions"" (Annual Report, p.22). This is in contrast to ADP's strategic goal to grow organically (one of ADP's three strategic pillars is to ""grow a complete suite of cloud-based HCM solutions,"" Annual Report, p.3). Paychex's interest in strategic acquisitions may include aggressive growth cloud-based competitors like Paycom and The Ultimate Software Group, but more on these companies later.A basic discounted free cash flow model suggests the market is expecting PAYX to grow at an annual rate of about 4.9% (we divided fiscal 2015 FCF by the WACC [9.1%] minus the growth rate to back into the current share price). A 4.9% growth rate is not unrealistic given the company's growth opportunities. Somewhat similar to ADP, Paychex's growth opportunities include economic growth, aggressive sales initiatives, strategic acquisitions (Paychex, not ADP), and rising interest rates. And realistically, Paychex may achieve a higher growth rate given its current trajectory. For example, analysts surveyed by Yahoo Finance expect earnings to grow at a rate of 9.5% over the next 5 years, and management has already provided revenue and earnings growth guidance of 7-8% and 8-9% respectively, for fiscal year 2016 (Q1'16 Earnings Release, p.3).If you like more risk, ADP's cloud competition may offer a lot more reward.ADP and Paychex are experiencing increased HCM competition from cloud-based software companies such as Paycom. Unlike ADP, Paycom's solution requires no customization and it is maintained in a single database for all HCM functions. This is particularly attractive to newer (and usually smaller) companies because they're not bogged down by legacy systems and databases that they must maintain. To many companies, Paycom is simply a better, more cost-effective solution. And to drive home this point (and attract more business) Paycom has been spending very aggressively on sales and marketing.The following chart shows Paycom's increased spending on ""Sales & Marketing,"" as well as the resulting increase in revenues and net income. For example, spending on ""Sales & Marketing"" has increased from $22 million in 2011 to $29 million in 2012, $43 million in 2013 and $64 million in 2014 (Paycom's 2014 Annual Report, p.37). The reason for the aggressive increase is because it increases revenues. Over the same period, revenues have grown at roughly 40% per year.And while net income has been minuscule over this period, it will likely increase dramatically in the future for two reasons. First, as revenue continues to grow, economies of scale will help minimize the drag caused by fixed costs. But more importantly, when the heavy spending on ""Sales & Marketing"" eventually ceases, the revenues will remain high (because the business retention rate is so high), and Paycom will likely turn into a highly profitable cash cow.Paycom currently trades around $38 per share, but it could be trading as high as $103 per share just over five years from now. For example, if revenues continue to grow at 40% for the next five years (management is already forecasting 47% growth for this year), then revenue could be as high as $845 million in 2019. Assuming the company significantly reduced its ""Sales & Marketing"" thereafter in order to simply focus on existing customers, then net income could be as high as $217 million in the following year assuming a 25% net profit margin. Assigning the same 28 times multiple that ADP currently receives, would give Paycom a market price of around $103 per share (roughly 171% higher than its current market price). Obviously, we've made some very broad assumptions here, but the point is that Paycom's stock has very significant upside potential.The Ultimate Software Group is another cloud-based HCM software company that has been spending very heavily on sales and marketing in order to capture business and grow revenue. The following table shows the big increases in ""Sales & Marketing"" that have caused revenues to increase around 23% per year.We value ULTI using management's 2015 and 2016 revenue growth guidance (22% and 23%, respectively) combined with a 17.5% growth per year for the following three years and then 2.5% each year thereafter to come up with possible 2020 revenue and net income of $1.3 billion and $316 million, respectively. And using the same 28 times multiple that ADP currently receives, suggests that ULTI could trade as high as $309 per share, giving it roughly 55% upside versus its current market price. Again, we are making some very big assumptions, but the point is that Ultimate Software stock has some very significant upside potential.Worth noting, Ultimate Software and Paycom may be attractive buyout targets for larger industry players (for example Paychex) because all three of the companies generate lots of free cash flow and have little-to-no debt on their balance sheets. Plus, both PAYC and ULTI have relatively small market capitalizations. We are not interested in investing in Paycom or Ultimate Software simply as potential buyout targets; however, they are both somewhat attractive in this regard, and if they do get bought out, it will likely be at a large premium to their current stock prices.Conclusion:We like ADP. It's a steady growth business, it's not over-valued, and it offers an above-average dividend. We also like Paychex for most of the same reasons as ADP, plus it offers an even higher dividend yield. However, we believe some of the smaller cloud-based software competitors have much more upside potential than ADP and Paychex, albeit with more risk. The four companies mentioned in this article are just some of the players in this industry that are racing to capture new business market share as quickly as possible because of the high margins and high retention rate. We've reserved our favorite player in the space for those that follow us at Blue Harbinger; however, this excerpt from our November 28th Blue Harbinger Weekly will give you a pretty big hint:Overall, we believe Human Capital Management is a steady growth industry that will benefit from a secular trend towards cloud-based solutions. Additionally, because of the amount of client payroll cash some of these companies keep on their books, a rising interest rate environment will be a helpful tailwind."

And here are the reasons why:ADP is a growing company in perspective niche marketADP's main source of revenue is human capital management (HCM) business, which is considered to be one of the fastest growing fields in the human resources industry. It provides services like benefits administration, time and attendance management, payment and compliance solutions and others. According to IDC Research, global revenue for HCM applications will grow from 9.2 billion in 2012 to 13.5 billion by 2017 with an overall growth rate of 8%:Source: IDC ResearchThanks to the continuous growth of the industry, ADP managed to successfully gain momentum there and now has over 630,000 clients in over 100 countries. And according to its filings, those numbers will continue to increase.ADP is one of the leaders of innovation in its industryTo stay competitive, ADP heavily invests in Big Data. Last year, it launched DataCloud, which gives organizations access to the data they need to boost business and workforce management goals ranging from workforce productivity and talent development to retention and the identification of flight risks. Considering the potential of Big Data industry, investing in this field will benefit the company in the future.Being a service provider requires you to have a great service itself. ADP management very well understands this and in the last few years strongly improved its main platforms and simultaneously increased the number of its Cloud and Mobile users:Source: Investors PresentationUnderstanding your clients and improving your infrastructure to gain the competitive advantage in the industry is another reason why ADP will continue to grow higher.ADP has great financials, dividends and outlookOver the last few years, ADP managed to have a sustainable revenue growth at ~7% annually. Thanks to its strong consistent operating cash flow generation, it managed to efficiently reinvest in the business and outperformed the market. Each year it slightly increases its net income, its cash is greater than the debt of the company and a positive free cash flow is signaling that ADP has enough resources to continue to finance its growth and create additional shareholder value along the way.Source: gurufocusThe company also pays dividends and has a track record of increasing them in the last few years. Its dividend yield is around 2.30% and ADP tries to have a payout ratio of 55% to 65%.For fiscal 2016, ADP expects to remain its 7% revenue growth, but is very enthusiastic about new business booking and expects at least 12% growth compared to prior forecast of 10%. Historically, most of the time, the company beat its guidance by a strong margin. And this year shouldn't be an exception.Based on ADP's financial condition, I'm very bullish about the company. It has a strong track record of outperformance and its revenue grows at a stable pace. And if something goes wrong, you still receive your cash in form of dividends, which is another advantage of investing in this company."
3982620,36431,2016-06-17T04:30:00-04:00,"ADP is king of the payroll industry.A strong balance sheet and over 40 years of dividend increases makes it a great dividend growth play.The company's float will benefit from rising rates, dropping right down to the bottom line.Valuations make ADP stock less attractive than the underlying business at this time.","Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) has been in business since 1949, and along the way, has established an enviable franchise and deeply entrenched itself into the business world. Besides payroll processing services, the company also operates in the benefits administration field, insurance, human resources management, and other business-related services.The company is also able to invest client funds and take advantage of its float to generate extra interest income. This makes it a solid play on rising rates, but more on that later.One out of every six (non-governmental) employees in the US have their paychecks processed by ADP. Not only does it have the largest size-and-scale by far in its core business based on sales, but the company also has an estimated client retention rate of close to 95% for large businesses, and an equally impressive retention rate of 80-85% for small business clients. The evidence of a moat clearly exists, and I think the numbers can back this up.Excess returns and lots of free cash flow - a recipe for successThe below chart demonstrates ADP's long track record of consistently generating high returns on invested capital and equity.ADP Return on Invested Capital (TTM) data by YChartsHowever, it should be noted that the firm has taken on a significant amount of financial leverage in the last few years, which has exaggerated these returns to an extent.ADP Assets To Shareholder Equity (Annual) data by YChartsTTM leverage is even higher, coming in at around 11.35, in fact. The impressive TTM ROE above residing north of 30% would be more around the historical 17.5-20% range if we dropped the assets/equity ratio back down to the more conservative 4.75x-5.25x range that was common before 2014.This is something to pay attention to, especially since margins have steadily dropped over the last decade, so I think the ""improvement"" in ROE over the last couple of years is mostly due to more leverage, not better performance.ADP Profit Margin (TTM) data by YChartsTo sum things up, I think the company is still clearly able to generate impressive returns on equity and returns on invested capital, even with half the leverage, but I don't like the recent reliance on higher leverage as a way to compensate for lower margins. Luckily, I believe there will be a catalyst for margin recovery.Higher rates = higher margins?Research at Morningstar estimates that a 5% pop in ADP's operating margins would occur for every 50-basis point increase in rates. That's definitely encouraging, and if the Fed does decide to hike rates this year, the company's bottom line could see margins inflate as a result.One great aspect related to ADP's core payroll business, besides its stickiness, is the investable float it generates. Obviously, the current low rate environment has thrown water on the company's margins, but if we are heading into an environment of rising rates going forward, it appears margins can flourish once again.This concept is also something to keep in mind when looking at the company's long-term margins mentioned earlier in the article. Improving margins will likely lead to increasing return on equity. Not only that, ADP has a very strong balance sheet, which makes the abnormally large jump in leverage over the last few years less concerning.Strong balance sheet backed by strong cash flowsOperating within the context of a wide-moat franchise allows ADP to throw off a large amount of cash.Created by Joseph Harry, data from MorningstarThe company consistently coverts double-digit amounts of its revenues into free cash flow. Free cash flow stabilizing over the last decade (despite a decline in margins) is most likely attributable to the underlying stickiness of the firm's client base and recurring revenues.Created by Joseph Harry, data from MorningstarCash from operations has been relatively constant, but due to low capex requirements, ADP has been a reliable cash cow.Back to the balance sheet, we can see that debt is a minority portion of the firm's capital structure.ADP Debt to Equity Ratio (Quarterly) data by YChartsThe company maintains more cash than long-term debt, and in conjunction with its strong cash flows, it looks like ADP has plenty of financial flexibility.ADP has raised its dividend for over 40 years. The payout ratio has also climbed notably, however, from the 25-35% range it resided in pre-financial crisis to around 60%. This is another trend to watch going forward, but rising rates and margins could also help alleviate the burden some.ConclusionWhile global uncertainties (especially Brexit) create a cloud of uncertainty over the Federal Reserve's future rate hikes, there's still a viable chance rate increases are in the future forecast. ADP probably doesn't need huge hikes going forward to significantly benefit margin-wise. The only problem is valuations.Shares of ADP currently trade at over 26 times earnings and close to 24 times forward earnings. That's a little too rich for my blood. I think closer to 20-22 times earnings would be very intriguing, though. I'd also prefer to wait for at least some sign of recovery in the company's margins, and rising rates might help this scenario come into play. I view ADP as a good way to gain exposure to a rising rate environment without having to invest in a bank.If you enjoyed this article and would like to receive further updates and articles in the future, please feel free to hit the ""+Follow"" button at the top of the page by the author's name."

For those who work for major corporations, you might recognize Automatic Data Processing as the company that processes your paycheck. Well, over the last five years, ADP has grown well beyond payroll services. Today, ADP fancies itself as a full-service ""human capital management"" company.As impersonal as that may sound, ADP has turned itself into the #1 choice for Fortune 500 companies when it comes to payroll benefits, talent recruiting, HR, insurance services, retirement services and compliance. ADP is all about economies of scale. It operates in 104 countries and is big enough to offer solutions for employers of all sizes. That arrangement has worked out pretty well. ADP has 630,000 clients in 100 countries, and the company does payroll for 1 in 6 workers here in the US.ADP's repeatable, consistent and somewhat automated business unsurprisingly makes it an excellent dividend payer. ADP started paying dividends back in 2016 and has averaged a compound annual dividend growth rate of 14% since then. That's a very good track record. This article focuses on ADP and its dividend growth prospects going forward.Growth prospectsCourtesy of ADP Investor Relations.""Human capital management"" is becoming more and more complicated in the world. This is especially true in the United States, where the 'Affordable Care Act' has complicated health insurance regulation and requirements. Even without the ACA, labor compliance is very complicated and is becoming more so, as are retirement benefits and insurance services. It should, therefore, come as little surprise that 'human capital management' is growing at twice the rate of global GDP. This is a good industry to be in and ADP is definitely the best house on this block.Courtesy of ADP Investor Relations.As you can see above, ADP plans on 7-9% revenue growth for the long term. That's not bad given the current economic climate and the capital-light nature of this business in general. ADP will achieve this goal through leveraging its global business and developing its HR outsourcing solutions, whereby ADP will take care of compliance and some of the more mundane HR operations. This way, the client company's HR staff can focus more on strategic matters. This 7-9% revenue growth should be accompanied by 4% margin expansion and 11-13% EPS growth.Cash flow and dividendsDividend-to-EPS ratio.Over the last ten years, ADP has managed a dividend growth rate of 13.4%, but as you can see, dividends have been growing faster than earnings. Ten years ago the dividend was only 38% of earnings. Now it's 60%, and ADP is running out of cushion. More important is the dividend-to-free cash flow ratio, which now stands at 73%. In a couple years, ADP's dividend growth will have to match cash flow growth. I suspect that will mean high single-digit dividend growth from now on. That isn't bad, but it's significantly less than the dividend growth investors have been accustomed to over the last ten years.Is ADP a buy?Courtesy of SharpCharts.comIs ADP a buy right now? I don't believe so. ADP is a great business. It has a low capital intensity, high barriers to entry, an excellent balance sheet and lots of dividend growth; something Warren Buffett might like. However, prices are just too darned high. Over the last ten years, ADP has averaged a valuation of 22.3 times trailing earnings, but shares right now trade at 27.4 times, so this stock is considerably overvalued, in my opinion.But if you've been long ADP for a while, as I have, then you've enjoyed outsized dividend increases for years and will continue to for years to come. I believe that Automatic Data Processing belongs on many a dividend investor's watch list, at the very least."
3477066,48411,2015-08-30T20:30:06-04:00,"I applaud ADP for being opportunistic with debt-funded share buybacks into low-cost borrowing environments.In fact, this move is long overdue.I still think ADP needs to get and stay aggressive with M&A into a secular space in its very early stages.Nice move ADP.","Well, well, well. It looks like I was right on Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) despite the ratings agencies and the ADP balance sheet cheerleaders whining. ADP is out with news of a massive $2 billion debt raise that will be used specifically for buying back stock. The purchases, which will be made over the next 12-24 months and should encompass ~5% of the outstanding float, should take place at attractive prices as I believe we're about to enter into a low/no/slight negative GDP period which should see the business cycle roll over on some of the lofty valuations that have been put in over the last few years. I'm not saying we're looking at a multi-year bear from a macro standpoint but that we could see ADP buying back shares at completely opportune timing. I applaud ADP for taking good advice.Now, you might be saying, ""but Dallas, you didn't recommend ADP go out and buy back shares, you recommended ADP get aggressive with M&A"". Isn't this M&A? What is M&A? M&A is using debt/balance sheet capacity to pull growth forward. To create pro forma balance sheet and income statement expansion. Isn't ADP doing just that? Again, I think this is as good as M&A and frankly it might be better. ADP is going to know its worst case return on invested capital in this instance, it's going to know its capital recycle rate on the other side of reinvesting model generated cash flows back into its model but into a much smaller share float (ADP also has an outstanding buyback approved for up to 5% of the float before announcing its debt-funded buyback), it's borrowing at what could prove out to be once in a lifetime costs, and it has no execution or integration risks in that this isn't true M&A.What this also does is this keeps ADP relevant if I'm an investor. I detailed in a prior research note that ADP's stock has been stuck in a range as its competitors, although much smaller competitors so not directly comparable, have seen their equity prices move much higher and much further to the right. A quick look at Paycom (NYSE:PAYC), Paylocity (NASDAQ:PCTY), Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), etc., will evidence this. Outside of a nice but not so nice that I have to be invested ~2.5% dividend what reason do I have to want to own ADP shares? Yes, ADP offers a strong balance sheet and an incumbent advantage but it that isn't moving the stock and the dividend isn't keeping my account balance growing what reason to I have?I don't have one is the answer and that's why ADP hasn't grown its equity TTM. PLUS, and this is meaningful, ADP has new and capable competition (possibly) coming to the public markets. Square is expected to IPO in the immediate term, as covered by Don Dion, to which I've opined before should 1) help square take even more market share from ADP as well as 2) bring even more attention away from ADP as an investment in the public markets. I also expect a near-term IPO of Zenefits which too should compete with ADP for investor eyeballs and dollars.All in I love this move by ADP and I love that ADP didn't use cash on hand to execute it. I still believe ADP needs to come aggressive with M&A (maybe buying both Paycom and Paylocity - that would be my recommendation) but the huge share buybacks are a start to changing the direction of the company's equity value prop. I also like that the buybacks will stretch per share valuation metrics AND will make slow growth appear much faster than it is. I'm totally behind this move and think that the overreaction by the ratings agencies, the ADP balance sheet cheerleaders, and the no-growth ADP apologists have been well overdone. Nice move ADP.Good luck everybody."
3518626,41961,2015-09-17T17:14:54-04:00,"ADP has proved to be a consistent, solid performer over an extended period of time, delivering superior investor returns.The stock offers a solid 2.5% yield, which is likely to experience solid growth going forward.I have high conviction in the long-term success of the company's business model, and I'm accumulating the shares regularly on a quarterly basis.","I'm developing a passive income stream from dividends to generate financial independence. I'm proceeding down the path of steadily accumulating a set of high quality, dividend-paying stocks. My strategy is quarterly accumulation of 30 stocks through a low-cost brokerage, with a few thousand dollars invested across all these stocks at a time. Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) is one of the businesses in my dividend portfolio that I am accumulating.Purchase HistoryI started accumulating ADP in very small amounts in late 2014 as part of my accumulation strategy. Most recently, I purchased the stock as part of my dividend accumulation portfolio in July 2015.The stock has a long-term track record of delivering excellent returns for its investors. In fact, a $10,000 investment in ADP made in 1983 would be worth $754,000 today, This reflects a return over time of close to 14% annually. ADP's strong position in the payroll processing market makes for rising total return and dividend income.I'm very interested in generating a sustainable long-term income stream, and so I want solid dividend growth prospects. ADP offers a dividend yield of just under 2.5%. More impressively, the company has seen a dividend growth rate of almost 14.7% annually over the last 25 years, according to longrundata.com.Solid, rather than stellar organic growthADP reported a reasonable Q2 result. Organic revenues were up some 5% year on year compared to the same quarter of the prior year, while full-year revenue was up 7% in fiscal 2015. Employer services revenue, which is the bulk of ADP's business and almost 75% of revenue was up some 2% the corresponding year. PEO, or Professional Employer Organizing, a high growth area within ADP that accounts for close to 25% of revenues, grew some 16% year over year.While reported revenue growth wasn't terribly stellar, what was interesting to see was the volume of worldwide new business bookings, which grew 18% year over year. This speaks to a robust pipeline, which should convert to revenue and show up in ADP's results over the next few years.Depressed interest rates holding back interest incomeInterest on funds held remained flat in the quarter vs. year on year at $95M in the quarter. While cash balances increased some 4% over the prior corresponding year, the average interest rate yield held back ADP's contribution from this portion of the business. With the US about to embark on a rate rising cycle, I expect this portion of the business to provide a more meaningful contribution to ADP's revenues over time.ADP's customer stickiness will drive new revenuesWhile the growth in ADP's core payroll processing business is slowing down, the high level of stickiness that the company has with its customer base will make it possible to keep rolling out value enhancing services. Payroll processing is a service that is difficult to displace, and one which larger businesses are loathed to tinker with if there is no reason to do so. Using payroll processing as a base to launch other employer outsourcing is a strategy that should provide ADP with new growth opportunities, even if its core business doesn't reignite exceptional growth. The predictability of the core business makes ADP of considerable interest to me as it makes product extensions all the more likely to work.ValuationADP currently trades at a P/E ratio of 27 and a forward P/E ratio of just over 23. The business is trading above its average multiples over the last five years such as price to earnings, price to cash flow and price to sales. Morningstar has ADP stock at three stars currently.Like other purchases I've made, ADP stock trades below where I have recently purchased it. My November 2014 purchase was done at $85, while my March 2015 purchase was done at $86.3. My June 2015 purchase also was done at $85.15, and the July 2015 purchase was done at $81.92. I'm comfortable accumulating ADP on a quarterly basis for the long term."

Strong, very pointed words that frame ADP as an old, increasingly agitated by change, dinosaur in a fast moving SMB payroll space that needs technology in order to be able to compete with upmarket competitors. I find this tactic, while borderline mudslinging, to be highly effective and have deployed it before with success in my consulting business.Zenefits goes on further within the filing to make claims that the ADP lawsuit violates California ""anti-SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation)"" statute, a law that prevents large companies from using defamation lawsuits and costly litigation to silence criticism from smaller competitors and watchdog groups and claims the protection of the First Amendment in its defense.Zenefits CEO Parker Conrad had the following to say about the real reason ADP caused a widespread, unwarned disruption of services to its SMB customers:Again, this strategy is brilliant in framing ADP as the old, white haired incumbent which is afraid of change or competing - something Zenefits' customer base of SMB's knows all too well. Zenefits, in what is turning into a perfectly executed quasi-smear campaign has changed the conversation from ""why did my payroll experience disruption"" to ""why would ADP do this to me? Why doesn't ADP care about the SMB?"". A move of absolutely brilliance.Finally, Zenefits has gone on to greatly detail it's take on the chronological order of events that took the company from integrated partner of ADP to counterparty in a defamation lawsuit. The full recap of the filing is extremely entertaining and a case study in shaping public perception.Now, what does all this mean for all the parties involved?:I continue to recommend an avoid or HOLD of range-bound, needing a shot in the arm ADP. I've opined recently that ADP desperately needs to get aggressive with M&A, particularly it should buy Paycom or Paylocity as the synergies are undeniable, or do something to change the status quo before I would consider investing. The bias for ADP is definitely to the sell side on anything but ideal reporting and ideal forward looking growth.I continue to recommend a buy of Paycom and Paylocity. My research on both tickers can be found on Seeking Alpha.Good luck everybody."

I expect we'll be hearing a detailed growth strategy with FQ4 reporting at the end of the month but I just don't see how the current strategy presented at the analyst day in early March will hold up or impress markets if simply reiterated.I believe ADP (which is modeled by analysts reporting to Thomson for lower full year revenues in 2016 than it reported in 2014) must answer the hot topic question from the analyst day with aggression and with clarity.What is the hot topic? Acquisition.The analyst community time and time again peppered ADP management with the question of why isn't the company doing more? Why isn't the company focused on the land grab in the space that only seems to be accelerating? Why is ADP allocating such large spend to R&D when it could be redirecting that spend to M&A and simply buying tech/growth?Are valuations a bit rich currently? Maybe. But I don't think they're outrageous considering the forward looking growth rate for HCM. I made this market growth case in a recent article on private startup Square which has decided even with its small size to find a way to participate in the evolving of the space. There's simply too much money on the table to not be as aggressive as possible and expand the core strategy. Something that ADP competitors get.I can hear ADP dividend collectors and balance sheet promoters now: ""But we can't compromise the balance sheet with debt, cash spend, or share based acquisitions! We can't do anything to upset the status quo!"" The one thing ADP can't do is what it's doing now. Allowing itself to slowly become more and more irrelevant as younger, more agile, less legacy-issue HCM companies eat its lunch.ADP does have a strong balance sheet. ADP does have an excellent credit rating. ADP does have C&CE. All the more reason for the company, which according to management is already setting aside $200-$300 million per year for M&A, to get even more aggressive. To be clear though, I'm talking about domestic M&A - not the fantastical fantasy Brazilian, Chinese and Euro M&A that management trotted out as the ""next big thing"" at the analyst day. The domestic markets have plenty of growth, zero negative FX impact potential and much easier to read forward-looking stability. Management needs to stop its focus on international right now.I know ADP likes to buy shares back as a way to allocate excess capital and I know ADP absolutely does not want to spend on what would equate to a new standalone segment. I think these are two excellent rules to operate by and I would agree with management there. Do NOT acquire anything that won't integrate with the existing HCM platform and do NOT acquire anything that isn't perfectly synergistic. Which is what either Paycom or Paylocity would be. Especially Paylocity.I guess the point to be made here is that the space is only becoming more competitive and ADP should be focused on how to land grab in an effort to be defensive. That's the thing that ADP management apologists and ""total return at all cost"" shareholders don't understand about what's happening in the space. Ignoring the massive growth downmarket in the lower SMB channels is going to cost ADP market cap. It obviously already has.It's also cost ADP competitive positioning. Positioning that becomes very, very hard to get back once an inception point is breached. I believe that inception point to be moving closer by the day. With new competitors entering the fast growth SMB segment and immature but mature enough companies (Paycom and Paylocity are two good examples) exampling to the low-market enterprise market that they have the infrastructure and the tech to service their needs, the market cap/competitive position drain will only accelerate.ADP is at a crossroads that it has never been at before. I hope management sees what the market does and make the necessary changes.I recommend an immediate term hold of ADP shares with a sell bias on anything but ideal reporting as to the forward looking growth strategy (at Q4/15 reporting). If the strategy doesn't include substantial plans to grow via M&A and/or an accelerated spending I recommend an immediate sell."

The company has the capability to cover ~95% of multinational employees, approximately a $90 billion industry. The company is expecting 10% growth in worldwide new business bookings in fiscal 2015, resulting in revenue growth of ~7%.

It has 620,000 clients in 125+ countries.• ADP's business quality ranks among the best of the companys in our coverage universe. The company has been generating economic value for shareholders with relatively stable operating results for the past few years. The recent price drop in shares was a result of the spin-off of CDK Global and not market-driven. Long-term technical and momentum assessments are less-informative in ADP's case.• ADP has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the company's free cash flow margin to average about 12.9% in coming years. The company's intrinsic value considers ""funds held for clients."" Investors should be cognizant that future methodology changes impacting how we account for such a balance can impact our estimate of the company's fair value.• In the US, the human capital market is a $50 billion market growing at a nice mid-single-digit pace. The market is ~$90 billion on a global basis. ADP has the potential to cover 95%+ of all multinational employees, offering further growth potential.• ADP boasts a large, recurring revenue base resulting in strong, consistent cash flow generation. The company's business model has low capital requirements. It has minimal long-term obligations and has been paying dividends continuously since 1974.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a company's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the company's economic profit spread. Automatic Data Processing's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 70%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.5%. As such, we assign the company a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate. Robust economic returns should be expected from the company.Cash Flow AnalysisADP's free cash flow generation is outstanding, and a large reason why its Dividend Cushion is so impressive. Companies that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Automatic Data Processing's free cash flow margin has averaged about 12.8% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the company's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Automatic Data Processing, cash flow from operations decreased about 5% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 47% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisLet's do a little data processing of our own. Here we outline the data that is our valuation assumptions and derive our fair value estimate of the company.Our discounted cash flow model indicates that Automatic Data Processing's shares are worth between $75-$113 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the company's LOW ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers.The estimated fair value of $94 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 30.2 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 10.6 times last year's EBITDA. ADP's current stock price is ~$84 per share, lower than our fair value estimate but in our fair value range. As such, we feel there is more upside potential compared to downside risk based on our fair value estimate.Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 2.7% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the company's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 7.3%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 19.5%, which is above Automatic Data Processing's trailing 3-year average.Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.5% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Automatic Data Processing, we use a 9.5% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisEach fair value estimate we provide comes with a margin of safety, within which we feel the company is fairly valued. Our discounted cash flow process values each company on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the company's fair value at about $94 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Automatic Data Processing. We think the company is attractive below $75 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $113 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the company, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Automatic Data Processing's fair value at this point in time to be about $94 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the company's current share price with the path of Automatic Data Processing's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the company's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the company's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $117 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $94 increased at an annual rate of the company's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Wrapping Things UpADP has its share of investment merits.The company is well-positioned to continue to take advantage of the human capital market, which is growing at a nice mid-single-digit pace, on average, though we note cyclicality will always be present. Its recurring revenue stream allows it to continually generate free cash flow, and its business model requires few capital requirements. Both of these dynamics allow ADP to have minimal long-term obligations and, in turn, continually pay a dividend, which it has done since 1974. We like its dividend prospects and think the payout is poised for years of growth.As an overall investment consideration, however, we're not rushing to add shares to the portfolio. The driving forces behind the Valuentum Buying Index result in ADP receiving a rating of 3.PerformanceIn the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of the Valuentum Buying Index, our stock selection methodology, has stacked up per underlying score as it relates to companies in the Best Ideas portfolio.

3266135,48411,2015-06-17T17:37:33-04:00,"The embarrassing ADP/Zenefits fiasco has devolved even further than at first reporting.ADP is now suing Zenefits, which is running a grass roots smear campaign against ADP.This conflict is not good for either ADP or Zenefits but it could be good for competitors of both - expect financial tremors at Q2 reporting for ADP.The longer this drags on, especially now with an expense associated with it, the worse off ADP will be - ADP needs to not engage Zenefits further.","Following up on an article written eight days ago, it appears the Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) and Zenefits fiasco has devolved to an even more exaggerated level.It appears now, as first reported by techcrunch.com, that ADP is suing Zenefits for defamation but contrary to first reporting is not rolling out a new in-house, owned competing service to the Zenefits offering. ADP does in fact offer a bundled solution that competes directly with Zenefits but according to ADP the service being alluded to by Zenefits founder Parker Conrad in a recent Zenefits blog posting is a third party platform, Optum Insight, which is offered by United Health Group.Of course, don't tell Conrad this - he's been more than willing to imply that ADP disrupted its services in an effort to ""spread fear, uncertainty and doubt about the new market entrant (source: blog.zenefits.com),"" with the new market entrant obviously being Zenefits. Conrad even went as far as referencing this as ""FUD,"" a commonly used, borderline conspiracy theory message board acronym resorted to when a better argument for a negative development is not at hand. Embarrassing to say the least.Conrad and Zenefits also have launched a full scale smear campaign (see the link above and associated hashtag below), which at this point is completely baseless, via social networks with Twitter being the central hub. Zenefits has asked those who ""agree that big companies should compete like everyone else, and small businesses should be able to use the latest technology"" to smear ADP with the hashtag ""#ADPeeved"" for an unstated duration.Still, despite the continued childish nature of the conflict and with these companies and their collective willingness to throw their filthy laundry in the public streets I do believe this feud will have a mid-term, even more noticeable effect on ADP than I had originally opined at first writing.Now ADP is going to be saddled with the legal expenses that come with its Zenefits lawsuit, a doing all its own. Now ADP is going to have to fight a SMB sentiment overhang, I'm speculating but fairly confident, stemming from the grassroots anti-ADP campaign being run by Zenefits. Now, ADP is going to have yet another variable to consider in its retention efforts when trying to fend off HCM upstarts Trinet (NYSE:TNET), Paycom (NYSE:PAYC) and Paylocity (NASDAQ:PCTY) which also fall into the ""small"" HCM segment. Now, ADP is going to have to answer questions - questions that it created on its own - about the security of its offering. If the real reason for the Zenefits divorce was a security breach why was ADP not better prepared?For a growing slower and less relevant incumbent these are issues that are distracting at best and impairing at worst. ADP needs to now more than ever be focused on market share aggregation in light of the slew of new entrants and fast growing competitors, not on mudslinging of Zenefits (outside of overtly false claims).I'm expecting ADP to report a slight financial tremor with Q2 reporting and it could see noticeable financial gyrations with Q3 reporting if this conflict escalates. I continue to see PAYC, PCTY, TNET and PAYX benefiting from this currently and more so the longer this drags on.Good luck everybody."
3269085,89805,2015-06-18T21:35:25-04:00,"Recurring revenue, 90%+ client retention, $100+ billion growing market, and rock solid balance sheet provide fundamental protection.40 years of consecutive dividend growth, a strong commitment to total return, and a spin-off of a non-core segment last year suggest management is shareholder-friendly.An entry point closer to $70 (currently trading at $84) appears to be more prudent for long-term dividend growth investors.","Summary:Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is a durable business that provides mission-critical software and outsourcing solutions. The company's high mix of recurring revenue (91% retention rate), participation in large and fragmented markets (10% share in $100+ billion market), strong balance sheet ($1.8 billion net cash), asset-light business model, and commitment to shareholders (40 years of consecutive dividend growth; targets total return in the top quartile of the S&P500) underscore its fundamental strength. With a Safety Score of 99 and a Growth Score of 82, ADP is one of the more attractive dividend stocks but appears to be at least fairly valued today.Business Description:ADP provides a range of solutions, via a software and service-based delivery model, which businesses of all sizes can use to recruit, staff, pay, manage, and retain employees. The company serves more than 490,000 clients (80% of total clients) via ADP's software as a service offerings, commonly referred to as ""the cloud."" As a leader in the growing HR Business Process Outsourcing market, ADP also offers fully integrated outsourcing solutions that enable its clients to outsource their HR, time and attendance management, payroll, and benefits administration functions to ADP. Altogether, ADP's offerings cover everything from recruitment to retirement and provide a sizeable base of recurring revenue -- with a 91.4% client retention rate, client retention is estimated at 12 years in Employer Services and 7 years in Professional Employer Organization Services, providing nice predictability.ADP's clients range from single-employee small businesses to some of the world's largest corporations, including 90 of the Fortune 100 companies. ADP claims to pay 1 in 6 private sector workers in the US and maintains the biggest data set of employment data, allowing it to deliver better HR insights and analytics to help clients run their businesses better.ADP previously had a dealer services business called CDK Global. It spun off this unit to shareholders last fall and used proceeds ($700M) to repurchase stock, focusing the company completely on human capital management (HCM).Sales MixBy segment: Employer Services 78% (e.g. payroll services, benefits administration, talent management, HR management, time and attendance management, etc.), Professional Employer Organization Services 22% (employment administration outsourcing solutions)By geography: United States 81%, Europe 11%, Canada 4%, Other 4%Shareholder Value Creation:The table below shows ADP's total return over several periods. The stock has beaten the market nicely over the last 12 months and outperformed by 4.5% per year from 2010 to 2014.Looking even longer term, ADP has created value for its shareholders. The orange line below shows ADP's total return relative to the market, indexed to 100 in 1994. In other words, when the orange line is rising, ADP is outperforming the broader market.ADP's management team targets a total shareholder return in the top quartile of the S&P500, and it has more than achieved this ambitious goal over the past ten years with solid outperformance:Dividend History:Before we dig into ADP's fundamentals, let's review its dividend history. As seen below, the company has increased its dividend for 40 years, compounding its dividend paid by 8% over the last five years.While a growing dividend is a critical part of the total return equation, it is even more important that the dividend growth is sustainable. The payout ratio shows us what portion of a company's earnings and free cash flow is paid out as a dividend. Lower payout ratios suggest the current dividend is safer and might have greater long-term growth potential. When a payout ratio rises, it means the company is growing its dividend faster than its underlying earnings or free cash flow.Looking below, we see ADP's EPS payout ratio has increased from 57% in CY10 to 68% in CY14 but remains close to management's targeted range of 55%-60%. ADP's free cash flow payout ratio has generally remained below the company's EPS payout ratio and is at an even healthier level (closer to 40% last fiscal year), suggesting ADP is in a healthy position.With moderate sales and earnings growth expected to continue far into the future and a reasonable payout ratio today, ADP seems to have a long runway to continue growing its dividend by 5%-10% per year.Long-term FundamentalsADP has maintained a strong return on equity over the past decade, even as its business model has been transitioning to the cloud. With a healthy client retention rate (91.4%) and a large base of recurring revenue, return on equity seems likely to remain in excess of 20%.Revenue has grown at a 7% CAGR over the last seven years and a 7% CAGR over the past three years, demonstrating nice consistency. Sales also held up well during the financial crisis, growing 1% in FY09 and FY10. These results underscore the stickiness and mission-critical importance of ADP's HCM software and services. While macro changes in employment levels can impact ADP's near-term growth trends, expansion of other HCM services outside of payroll can help ADP take more wallet share at each client, and healthcare reform/increasing regulation provides a tailwind.ADP's operating margin has remained steady for many years. Profitability actually improved during the financial crisis, highlighting the strength of ADP's business model. Going forward, margins should see some modest lift as ADP's recurring revenue base expands and if interest rates ever start to rise (ADP holds over $20 billion in funds for clients and makes interest income from bonds).As seen below, ADP has compounded its diluted earnings per share by 8% and 8% over the past seven and three years, respectively.All of ADP's earnings showed up as cash. Once they reach critical mass, software businesses require little incremental capex to maintain their revenue base, throwing off plenty of free cash flow. ADP's free cash flow per share has compounded at a rate of 7% over the past seven years and 3% over the last three years.ADP maintains a very strong balance sheet and has been managed conservatively for a long time. As seen below, the company has rarely carried any meaningful debt, and as of the most recent quarter had over $1.8 billion in net cash. This flexibility provides room for ADP to continue raising its dividend while investing to remain relevant far into the future.In addition to dividend increases, we see ADP has also been active buying back its own shares. In fact, ADP's total diluted shares outstanding have decreased at a 1% CAGR over the last five years. This capital allocation decision has proven to be a good one over the past decade as ADP has grown in value and each shareholder has happily increased his or her relative ownership stake. Management expects to continue reducing ADP's shares outstanding by approximately 1% annually going forward.Quarterly ResultsADP reported healthy results last quarter as sales and earnings grew 7% and 16%, respectively. Fiscal year-to-date, new business bookings have grown 11% and position ADP well to meet its full year goal of 10% bookings growth. Adjusted for the spin-off of ADP's dealer services business in 2014, sales growth has persisted in the mid-single digits over the last eight quarters, and earnings per share have increased around 10%.While ADP competes in a fairly mature market that will not grow much faster than GDP, the market is very large (over $100 billion in size) and fragmented (ADP has 10% market share), supporting continued growth.Management CommentaryADP's Fiscal 2015 OutlookADP now anticipates full-year fiscal 2015 revenue growth of approximately 7% compared with the prior forecast of 7% to 8% due to negative pressure from foreign currency translation which is expected to impact full year revenue growth by about two percentage points. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations is now expected to grow about 14% from $2.58 in fiscal 2014 compared with the prior forecast of 12% to 14%.This forecast anticipates at least 75 basis points of pretax margin expansion from 18.4% in fiscal 2014. ADP now anticipates an effective tax rate of 33.7% compared with the prior forecast of 34.2%. Worldwide new business bookings are still anticipated to grow about 10%.Looking AheadADP appears well positioned for the future. The nature of its business results in high switching costs with customers, which should provide a predictable revenue stream for years to come. While most software-oriented businesses have built-in switching costs in the form of training users to use a particular platform, ADP benefits from an extra kicker. More specifically, ADP manages complex regulatory environments for many of its clients to ensure they remain compliant with the law. ADP handles employment taxes, unemployment claims, tax credits, workers compensation, and healthcare reform issues. Its clients absolutely must comply with each regulation, increasing their dependence on ADP's expertise and ability to handle very complex transactions.In addition to regulatory compliance, ADP's clients need a trusted partner. ADP handles the most sensitive information about its clients' employees - tax statements, social security numbers, healthcare information, and more. Building up the systems to protect this information takes years of investment and iteration, but gaining clients' trust takes even more time.Beyond domain knowledge and trust, ADP offers significant global reach. The company operates in over 100 countries and is well positioned to meet the needs of multinational employers. Supporting multiple countries requires significant time and investment due to different regulations and integration issues. It would be impractical for smaller firms to pull it off. Perhaps not surprisingly, ADP serves 90 of the Fortune 100 companies.ADP's scale benefits extend beyond geographical advantages into perhaps an even more important category -- analytics. Big data is transforming different industries and quickly becoming a source of competitive advantage for firms that embrace it the best. In human capital management, the story is no different -- the firms that are able to identify and hire better people, retain them for longer, and make them more productive will ultimately win. ADP has more employee records than any of its competitors, generally 3-10x more records. This makes its benchmarking much better, more detailed, and more insightful for its clients.All of this data will prove to be increasingly value to ADP's platform as time goes on, but ADP also realizes that it will never be able to solve every problem for every client. To further solidify its positioning with clients, ADP opened up its platforms via APIs last year, enabling its clients to integrate its HCM platforms with the rest of their enterprise suite through those open APIs. This also allows third-party developers to create applications that exchange data with ADP's core HCM systems to further add value for clients. By focusing more on collaboration and integration, ADP helps ensure that it will remain part of the solution for a very long time.ADP spent almost two decades building out the depth and breadth of its product and has the financial firepower ($1.8 billion net cash) to build or bolt-on additional capabilities as needs change. These efforts have resulted in large recurring revenue base with high client retention (91%+). With a broad and deep HCM solution, a massive global sales team of 5,500 members, a highly fragmented market to keep penetrating (see image below), and an environment with increasing regulations (e.g., Affordable Care Act), there are enough factors to support management's goals of 7%-9% annual sales growth and 50-75 basis points of margin expansion.Safety ScoreOur safety score measures 20 fundamental factors covering a period of 10+ years to assess the safety of ADP's dividend. It is measured out of a total possible score of 100 and accounts for the company's performance during the financial crisis, the industry's cyclicality, long-term and recent trends in growth and profitability, dividend growth track record, debt levels, stock price performance, free cash flow generation, company size, and more.ADP achieved a ranking of 99, meaning it achieved a Safety Score in the top 2% of the 2,250+ dividend-paying stocks we analyze. The company's solid balance sheet, stable sales and earnings growth trends, consistent free cash flow generation, stable performance during the financial crisis, commitment to dividend growth, and several other factors contributed to ADP's stellar rating.Growth ScoreWhile the Safety Score is most concerned with the safety of a company's current dividend, the Growth Score is all about a company's potential to significantly grow its dividend in the years ahead. It assesses nearly 20 factors to gauge a company's dividend growth potential, including EPS and free cash flow payout ratios, free cash flow generation, short and long-term sales and earnings growth trends, trends in return on capital, dividend growth track record, and more.ADP's Growth Score came in at 82, placing it in the top 20% of all dividend-paying stocks. The company's above-average EPS payout ratio (60%) and more moderate historical dividend growth (8% five-year CAGR) lowered its rank, but ADP's solid profitability, consistent sales and earnings growth, 40-year commitment to growing its dividend, and lower free cash flow payout ratio all helped improve its rank.ValuationADP has been awarded a premium valuation, likely for several legitimate reasons. Investors generally assign higher multiples to predictable companies, and a business like ADP's with high recurring revenue, 90%+ client retention rates, mission-critical software services, a track record of 40 years of consecutive dividend increases, etc., certainly fits the bill.At $84 per share, ADP trades at 28 times trailing twelve months earning and has a 2.3% dividend yield. Relative to the universe of over 2,250 dividend stocks that we monitor, ADP has one of the safest dividends you can find (99 Safety Score) and above average growth potential (82 Growth Score). The current dividend yield is approximately in line with the universe average, ranking in the 49th percentile.Given the high quality nature of ADP's operations and its high probability of continuing to grow its intrinsic value, its current valuation is not crazy, especially in today's low interest rate environment. However, it seems prudent to wait for a better bargain, which could come about if investors' sentiment over interest rates reverses again to ""lower for longer"" (recall that ADP invests over $20 billion in funds held for clients in bonds -- falling rates have hurt high-margin interest income).A 10% pullback to $75 would start to make the stock look more interesting with a 2.6% dividend yield, but it would still trade at over 25 times trailing earnings. An entry price closer to $70 would be more appealing for long-term dividend growth investors."
3225956,88826,2015-06-01T07:37:01-04:00,,"Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) Investment HighlightsAutomatic Data Processing (ranked #25 on the top 50 dividend list) is the global leader in human capital management (HCM) with clients in 104 countries. Founded in 1949, the company offers payroll and HR business processing services and controls 9% of the $110 billion global HCM market. The company completed its spin-off of CDK Global late last year which exited it from dealer services and will help it focus on its core HCM business.ADP has been making a strong shift to cloud services, adding 490,000 clients to its cloud platform from 2012. The company's mobile application helps provide customer support and services to four million clients in 43 languages.The company benefits from high switching costs in the industry and a size advantage to service businesses of all sizes. Once a customer contracts for HCM services, it is difficult and costly to switch contractors, and ADP enjoys a 91.4% client retention rate.While the industry is fairly mature and only grows at roughly a compound annual rate of 6%, it benefits from an increasing regulatory environment. As regulatory burden increases, payroll and tax compliance become more complicated and more companies decide to outsource their HCM functions.ADP shows in its 2015 investor presentation that less than 20% of mid- and large-sized companies report preparedness for regulatory changes from the Affordable Care Act. A third of mid-sized businesses report paying non-compliance fees due to problems in in-house HCM and 72% of large companies outsource their payroll for tax compliance.ADP Company FundamentalsSales have increased at a CAGR of 6.2% over the last three years, slightly ahead of growth in the HCM market. While sales growth has slipped over the last year, the company has done a good job of controlling costs and operating income has not been affected.As the economy heads into its sixth year of recovery, a decline in the business cycle could limit share gains. An eventual recession in the U.S. will hit providers of HCM services as companies look to cut costs, but ADP should be relatively safe due to economies of scale. The company should be able to cut some costs and drive client retention on lower service costs.The majority of current assets and liabilities on the balance sheet are ""funds held for clients"" and ""client fund obligations"" related to funds held for payroll processing. ADP holds client funds and invests in AAA- or AA-rated bonds with short maturities and books interest on the funds as revenue. The low rate environment over the last few years has hit this segment of revenue and should rebound marginally when interest rates increase in 2016.ADP has been investing in its cloud and mobile services over the last several years, as well as a heavy pace of acquisitions over the last five years. Cash used for capital investment jumped last year to $85 million, an increase of 30% over the prior year. Still, the company has done a good job of generating cash flow, and capital spending should pay off with future growth.ADP Dividend and GrowthThe rapid rise in the share price has lowered the dividend yield to 2.2% from an average of 2.8% over the last five years. Management has increased the payout ratio to 66% of income from the five-year average of 59%, but has still not been able to keep the yield from falling.ADP has paid a dividend since 1974 and has increased it for 39 consecutive years. The per share amount has increased by a compound rate of 7.7% over the last five years. The buyback program was increased significantly over the last two quarters with a cash return of $1.3 billion through share repurchases over the last four quarters.The company has been relatively consistent with its share repurchase program, reducing the diluted share count by a compound rate of 1% a year over the last five years.The rapid rise in the shares, along with modest growth in the industry, may limit the cash return over the next year. The company is already paying out two-thirds of income as dividends, and buying back shares may not be an inexpensive use of cash.ADP Stock ValuationShares of ADP trade for 30 times trailing earnings, well above the average multiple of 21.6 times over the last five years. Analysts expect full-year 2015 earnings of $2.95 per share on a 10% drop in revenue to $11.0 billion. Sales are expected 7.7% higher next year with a 12.5% increase in earnings to $3.32 per share.Even if the company can meet expectations for 2016 earnings, the shares would still be trading for 25.8 times earnings. While the company may be better positioned for a U.S. economic downturn through its size and global diversification, a recession will hit sales. I am not saying that a recession is imminent, but the shares are priced expensively even on earnings expected years into the future.I like the long-term outlook for shares of ADP on a greater shift to HCM outsourcing by businesses and high client retention at the company. Cash flow should continue to grow at a stable pace into the future allowing for a total cash yield between 2% and 4% from the dividend and buyback. This long-term outlook is tempered by a very high valuation in the shares. I would set a target of $73 per share for any positions and avoid the shares until at least $75 per share."
3212866,41961,2015-05-26T19:27:23-04:00,"Automatic Data Processing has proved to be a consistent, solid performer over an extended period of time, delivering superior investor returns.I have high conviction in the long-term success of the ADP business model and am accumulating the company regularly on a quarterly basis.I expect ADP to deliver solid dividend income over the long term and recently made a purchase of the stock.","I am developing a passive income stream from dividends to generate financial independence. I'm proceeding down the path of steadily accumulating a set of high-quality, dividend-paying stocks. My strategy is quarterly accumulation of 30 stocks through a low-cost brokerage, with a few thousand dollars invested across all these stocks at a time. Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is one of the businesses in my dividend portfolio that I will be accumulating as part of my ""30 for 30"" (30 stocks for the next 30 years).ADP is a global leader in payroll processing and benefits administration. The company services more than 600,000 clients worldwide. The strength of ADP's competitive advantage is primarily attributable to the high switching costs inherent in moving payroll processing from one firm to another.ADP has a market capitalization of $40B with revenues of $12.2B. In 2014, the company generated net income of close to $1.4B. ADP currently trades at a forward P/E of 26 and offers a dividend yield of close to 2.2%.Basis for inclusion in my Dividend Accumulation PortfolioIn brief, I am primarily looking for companies that have dominant moats and strong returns on equity, greater than 15%. I'm also looking for a track record of dividend increases and an average dividend yield of 2%. A full explanation for my filtering criterion for my portfolio can be found here.ADP's market leading position and high switching costs provides the company with a strong moat. The company derives a return on equity of close to 23%, which it has generally derived for most of the last decade, beating my minimum requirement for inclusion in my dividend portfolio. ADP has steadily increased dividends every year for the last decade. The dividend yield meets my threshold for inclusion. The company thus meets all my criteria for inclusion with my Dividend Accumulation Portfolio.Consistent performer with great operating historyADP has been in business since 1959. The operating performance of the company has been quite strong over a consistently long period of time. ADP has increased revenues from $8.5B in 2005 to over $12.2B in 2014, representing an annualized growth of close to 4.7%. During this same period, operating income has increased from $1.6B to $2.3B, an annualized growth rate of 4.5%.ADP's total return performance over the last 10 years has been reasonable. An investor who invested $10,000 in ADP 10 years ago would have received returns close to $31,000, which is better than the performance of the S&P 500 over a similar duration. A $10,000 investment in the S&P 500 would have returned $21,000 over a similar timeframe. It is when one considers the long-term performance of the company that ADP really shines through. According to longrundata.com, an investor who invested $10,000 in ADP in 1984 would have almost $819,000 today, or an annualized return of almost 15% over this period, which is great.ADP's high switching costs give business stabilityThe inherent switching costs associated with moving payroll processing suppliers provide ADP with a competitive advantage. Once the company provides services to a specific client, a competitor needs to provide a highly compelling, disruptive value proposition to displace ADP. In general, given the hassle of moving providers and the need to properly plan migration, shifting providers isn't something that is easily done. Also as the market leader, with the position of incumbency, ADP benefits from a perception of security and stability. Companies are typically loath to trust such a sensitive operation as payroll processing to a start-up company with little history of track record in fear that funding stability and long-term viability is an unknown, even though they may have a more disruptive proposition.Increases in interest rates will boost profitabilityADP is one company that will benefit from an increase in interest rates, which should add a nice tailwind to its business. Typically, ADP receives payroll disbursements in advance, prior to distribution to company employees. This advance receipt of funds provides ADP with a cash float on which it is able to profit. With interest rates having been at very subdued levels for much of the last few years, this revenue driver has not been a significant contributor for ADP. However, with the federal reserve now on the path of raising interest rates, ADP should once again start to generate some significant revenue here.Product line extensions should contribute to profitabilityWhile payroll processing is at the heart of ADP's core, the business has been expanding into a range of adjacent services in recent years. Given that ADP occupies such an entrenched position in the enterprise, this offers the capability for the business to offer related product lines to be cross sold while selling payroll processing. In recent years, ADP has launched a range of employer services including retirement, insurance, tax and payment solutions. Several of these new product have achieved good take up and allowed ADP to grow revenues even with employment activity being subdued.Why did I pick ADP for long-term accumulationI liked the fact that ADP has such a solid lock on the payroll processing market. With such high switching costs built into the selection and displacement of providers, ADP likely has a long term lock on this market that isn't going away anytime soon. The business has had fairly consistent, predictable revenue growth over the last decade, during a variety of mixed economic conditions, which adds to my view that it is a very stable, consistent performer.The other overriding factor for my Dividend Portfolio Accumulation strategy is that I want businesses that have the best possible chance of delivering a growing dividend stream over many years (at least 30 or more). ADP was also attractive in this regard because it provides a play on global employment growth. While ADP derives close to 20% of revenues globally already, it still has significant opportunity for international expansion as emerging economies start increasing their domestic workforces. The business has a long track record, which also inspires confidence.ADP's long-term prospects as a dividend stock will closely track the company's organic growth. With a payout ratio that is already above 60%, there is very limited scope for further payout increases beyond this. Analysts expect long-term earnings growth of close to 10% for ADP over the next 5 years, so an ADP investor can look forward to similar dividend increases over this period.ADP is a position that I will accumulateADP, like many other high-quality stocks, is trading at a higher PE multiple, price-to-book multiple, price-to-sales and price-to-cash flow multiple than it has on average over the last 5 years. ADP is likely overvalued at this particular point in time, however given I am buying my dividend index in a similar way every quarter with the same set of companies, I've also topped up my ADP purchase as well.Given ADP's strengths in its core business, I am happy to keep consistently adding the stock without buying the entire position in one go in the expectation that I will be accumulating a business that will show steadily increasing intrinsic value over a long period of time. I most recently purchased a position in ADP at $87/share, earlier in the year, which followed a prior purchase at $84.Given my long-term conviction in the ADP business model and the growth opportunities in front of the business, I will continue to add ADP quarterly, and consistently over a long-term horizon."
3248136,48411,2015-06-09T23:09:24-04:00,"ADP has apparently shut off usage of its platform for SMB clients also integrating with Zenefits.
        ADP has defended its action stating that it has done this to keep Zenefits compliant with data share policy.
        Look for this to create a headwind for ADP while creating a tailwind for Paycom, Paylocity, Intuit, and Paychex.","It appears that a behind the scenes struggle between HR startup Zenefits and Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) has come public and boy is it ugly. In an article just published by techcrunch.com techcrunch is reporting that ADP has cut off Zenefits using clients from using the ADP run payroll system for sharing data with Zenefits.ADP has since come out defending its action stating that it has done this to keep Zenefits compliant with data share policy and because it experienced a ""spike in user traffic and a security risk from Zenefits"". Zenefits of course claims it's being treated unfairly because of a recent funding round - a funding round that valued the company at greater than the combined market caps of recent HCM IPO's and fast growing HCM providers Paycom Software (NYSE:PAYC) and Paylocity (NASDAQ:PCTY).Zenefits alleges that the ""traffic spike"" being reported by ADP is a lie and that ""ADP started shutting off access to certain customers well before the June 4th date"" - the date ADP alleges it experienced the traffic spike.While we'll probably never get to the actual bottom of this childish, embarrassing, and customer hurting dispute I believe this will be nothing but beneficial for PAYC and PCTY. Again, both are companies in the HCM space that are outpacing ADP in growth by a big margin. Also, both Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) and Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) should stand to see an uptick in activity as they were specifically named as Zenefits platform integrations that the company recommended switching to.I believe this event has the potential to hang around for quite some time in similar fashion to the ""data security scare"" events that took place in the banking/card management/retail space. While this is largely a one-off event payroll and HCM are vital activities to the SMB market, activities that have to be perfect every time or major disruption is caused. Why even take a chance if you're an SMB, just switch to a provider that hasn't had a failure.Again, this should create a near and mid-term tailwind for PAYC, PCTY, PAYX, and INTU. Look for the negative publicity and negative real-time outcomes to create a near and mid-term headwind to ADP.Good luck everybody."
3570146,48411,2015-10-13T21:44:11-04:00,"ADP is about to report its most anticipated earnings in years.I believe the company will report pedestrian but expected numbers, but this won't be the focus of the call.Platform transformation, Marketplace, DataCloud, and capital allocation will all be big focuses that the market will need detailed updates on; let's hope ADP delivers.","Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) reports FQ1/16 earnings in just over two weeks, and its first quarter out of the fiscal 2016 gate is definitely one of the most anticipated dating back at least a handful of years. Not for the financials that will likely be in line with modest expectations - analysts reporting to Thomson have ADP reporting a consensus 5.7% Y/Y sales growth (-3.7% T24M stack sales growth), 4.3% Y/Y gross margin growth (4.3% T24M stack gross margin growth), $515 million in EBITDA (18.9% EBITDA margin), and $0.65 EPS (5.3% Y/Y EPS growth) - but for the go-forward strategy that the analyst community is expecting ADP management to elaborate on.While the management has historically been extremely tight with forward-looking strategic elaboration outside of analyst days, once a year, the investment community and the broader Street, I believe, are looking for a deeper level of insight at next earnings given the recent news of a debt-financed, expanded share buyback program as well as a ratings downgrade by Moody's. Many who follow the space, myself included, believe ADP is at an inflection point that requires more specificity than normal to address. The following are my expectations for earnings:Organizational Optimization/AnalyticsDuring its FQ4/15 earnings call, ADP made it highly visible that it's moving further and further into being an ""organizational"" brand rather than simply an HCM brand. What do I mean by this? Well, with the introduction of its expanded Workforce Now and DataCloud ADP, to give just a few examples, ADP is trying to reshape itself into a strategic platform rather than an HCM module(s) provider. This, it should be noted, is the trend across the HCM space in general with some of ADP's younger competitors having the benefit (competitive advantage in my opinion) of more agility and less legacy infrastructure to navigate around. I think that needs to be noted from a competitive standpoint and maybe as a driver to some of ADP's other decisions - think capital allocation and M&A. It should also be noted that ADP has the competitive advantage of a much larger and in almost every case stronger balance sheet, which opens up significant optionality for both of the prior listed. That matters too, and I'm not overlooking this.ADP management noted, ""…and for certain clients on our strategic platforms, we were especially excited to introduce ADP DataCloud, which leverages ADP's unparalleled data and insight to deliver workforce analytics that can help boost productivity, help develop talent, increase retention and identify potential flight risks (Source: ADP FQ4/15 investor call)"", in pointing out that the future of ADP is that of a wide spectrum, comprehensive umbrella of services and products. Of course, the company has these products and has launched these products into its customer base already, but this is the focus of the company moving forward. Expect more on this at FQ1 earnings in regards to traction, drivers to rate of adoption, lifetime customer value data (for example, how much each solution is adding to this figure in the early going so far), etc. Investors should dial in to any comments given in this regard.ADP MarketplaceThis too is going to be something that drives ADP's viability in the space moving forward, and this too is an area where the company's size is going to be beneficial. I believe ADP's brand will benefit the company in building out its marketplace as well. The company now has ~60 partners providing solutions via its APIs, and as of the last quarter, management had noted there are up to 200 outside partners that have expressed interest. A few marquee partner names that ADP management has called out in the past have been Concur, Cornerstone OnDemand (NASDAQ:CSOD), and One Page. All, and these are just a few names, either embellish ADP's platform or bring to the platform something that's currently missing. Plus, all the partners called out have had recent new, dangerous competitive entrants enter the fold which might make them keener on deeply integrating to ADP's platform. This, eventually, could turn into an acquisition opportunity or deeper joint venture opportunity. The API is a nice place to start, but keep your eyes peeled here for synergistic defensive moves that could take place.Guys, I've seen how partnerships/API buildouts work in the broader tech space and regardless of tech endpoint (be it Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), etc.) the ability to build out a partner ecosystem is absolutely huge in expressing the value-prop of the underlying service. This is big for growth and retention. Both happen to be areas under particular scrutiny at ADP (the company's growth ""issues"", which aren't really issues at this point but it is getting there, are being exacerbated by negative FX impact globally). Again, I don't want to read too much into this right now, but I've seen simple APIs turn into acquisitions - Microsoft has basically created an entire farm team acquisition system out of this. Stay tuned for updates at earnings on both the Marketplace and the marquee names brought on board to partner.Updates to DataCloudAgain, I can't underline DataCloud enough when it comes to its importance to ADP's future. DataCloud, to reiterate, is the branded solution name for ADP's data analytics and big data product. This is the company's solution that offers reporting and analytics which includes the all-important benchmarking as well. Benchmarking, for those unfamiliar, is the ability to breakout performance to blinded data from peers and broader industry. DataCloud is sold with a particular focus to ADP's mid-market customers as an incremental module (reporting or analytics module) and is sold on a per employee per month basis. The mid-market customer, to remind those who maybe are unfamiliar, is the customer that ADP should be particularly worried about as this customer is now being targeted by newly public (read: newly accessed to huge amounts of funding) competitors like Paycom (NYSE:PAYC) and Paylocity (NASDAQ:PCTY) as well as private companies Zenefits, Square (coming public soon), etc. If ADP doesn't have success in retaining its mid-market customers and growing overall market share, this could become a problem that hangs around.Still, DataCloud has come out to a successful launch so far with it having ~1,000 clients and these being mostly in the mid-market. Vantage, another ADP product, not particularly focused on mid-market customers, has DataCloud built in. The company noted that it's seeing ""good traction"" for Vantage on its FQ4/15 call. This should help with the overall DataCloud traction as well as brand building for the solution, which might have a future as a stand-alone solution or a spin-off and can gain serious market share/brand integrity. ADP also noted on the prior investor calls that it would be frequent with updates to the DataCloud platform.If ADP is to accomplish its goal of reshaping to an organizational optimization brand, I think it has to be led by DataCloud. That's right - I think DataCloud is that important. I also think that this is realistic, as Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN) (non-competitive, SAAS-based customer service platform) has shown with its own benchmarking solution and reporting mechanism. For me, DataCloud might be the single most important issue to focus on at FQ1 reporting. Any updates should be analyzed with a fine-toothed comb.Summary ThoughtsThe wildcard that might be the focus of the call could be ADP's capital allocation details. The market, especially analysts - myself included - have been calling for more aggressive M&A from ADP as well as a more aggressive buyback program at such levels of being undervalued. We finally got our wish from a buyback standpoint, and the market has responded well (to the announcement along - shares have been volatile largely because of volatile macro-market beta) to the news. Could next up be the M&A answer we've all been waiting on? To be clear, ADP has never been active with M&As and openly will talk about the funding set aside each year for roll-up acquisitions and small/mid-size bolt-on tech. But is it time for ADP to go out and acquire offensive tech capacity even if at something of an expensive multiple? Is it time for ADP to buy Paycom or Paylocity and really grow/build out its cloud capacity and growth rate? Maybe even its innovation? I think it is, and I think it's long overdue.I know this is a hot topic with the ADP faithful (as was the question of capital return via buybacks before that was announced and loudly applauded by the market - I took some heat for even suggesting that the company should do this before the announcement was officially made), but I just look at the massive land grab that is HCM and Organizational Analytics and think that ADP should put aside its normal operating procedures and secure market share. Of course, not everybody will agree with me.In any case, this earnings period should have something for everybody. Stay tuned and good luck."
3278265,23471,2015-06-23T13:09:03-04:00,"ADP is suitable for the Enterprising Investor following the ModernGraham approach but not the more conservative Defensive Investor.According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is overvalued at the present time.The market is implying 10.22% annual earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, which is greater than the rate the company has seen in recent years.","Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) has shown some earnings growth over the last few years and pays a healthy dividend, which may garner some attention from prospective investors. In fact, many analysts who focus on dividend growth investing have the company on the radar as a potential investment, including Safe Dividend Stocks, Dividend Ladder, and Integrator. While dividend growth potential is a great qualitative item to utilize when making an investment decision, it is critical to first conduct a quantitative analysis of the company.Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.Defensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 3/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests to be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey DataBalance Sheet - March 2015Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryCompetitive ComparisonAutomatic Data Processing is not very attractive when compared to some other companies in the Business Support industry. For example, a ModernGraham valuation of Robert Half Incorporated (NYSE:RHI) indicates that company is suitable for the Enterprising Investor and fairly valued at the present time. On the other hand, Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) was found to be suitable for Enterprising Investors but significantly overvalued in its most recent ModernGraham valuation.ConclusionAutomatic Data Processing passes the initial requirements of the Enterprising Investor but not the Defensive Investor. Specifically, the Defensive Investor is concerned by the low current ratio, insufficient earnings growth over the last ten years, and the high PEmg and PB ratios while the Enterprising Investor is only concerned by the low current ratio. As a result, all Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to that valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, it has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $2.45 in 2011 to an estimated $2.93 for 2015. This level of demonstrated growth does not support the market's implied estimate for annual earnings growth of 10.22% over the next 7-10 years.In recent years, the company's actual growth in EPSmg has averaged around 3.9% annually, but the ModernGraham valuation model reduces the actual growth to a more conservative figure when making an estimate, and returns an estimate of intrinsic value well below the current price, indicating that Automatic Data Processing is overvalued at the present time."
3200506,85096,2015-05-20T17:14:06-04:00,Passes nine of ten guidelines and is a good slow growing business.ADP beat expected earnings by 0.02 for third fiscal quarter (ending March 2015) earnings report.Business is solid and growing at a slow pace with the economy.Strong Dollar and low interest rates are holding back strong growth for ADP.,"This article compares the ten Good Business Portfolio Guidelines to Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) parameters and evaluates its business prospects. ADP is one of the largest provider of business outsourcing solutions. The services include payroll and tax services, human resources services, and includes accounting, inventory, leasing and parts ordering for the auto and truck dealership businesses.Guidelines Comparison for Automatic Data Processing INC.1. NEVER EVER buy any company or security that has more than three letters in the symbol. I know this eliminates just about all mutual funds, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and a lot of other large cap good companies, but it also eliminates the small cap startups and many others that are not good investments. The only exception to this guideline is the purchase of a high grade corporate investment grade bond fund.Passed : ADP only has 3 letters and passed.2. Capitalization should be at least $7 Billion (share price times number of shares outstanding)Passed : Capitalization of ADP is $42 Billion and growing.3. Company should have a dividend of at least 1.0% on a yearly basis and the dividend should have been increased in 7 of the last 10 years.Passed : ADP has a dividend of 2.3% per year and has increased the dividend 8 of the past 10 years.4. Cash flow should be strongly positive. This allows dividends to increase, do share buy backs, and purchase of other companies to expand the company business. You can't make cash up by accounting tricks like World Com and Enron.Passed : ADP has positive projected cash flow of $1.8 Billion for 2015 and is growing.5. The company should be listed on a Major exchange (NYSE or NASDAQ). NO over the counter and pink sheets, NO venture capital.Passed : ADP listed on the NASDAQ.6. The company business should be understood. Don't invest in business models or products you don't understand. Would you buy the whole company if you could is the question. If yes the company can be bought (Peter Lynch). As an example I don't understand Google (GOOL). If you can actually understand how Google will continue to grow then you can buy it, except that it violates guideline number 1.Passed : ADP is a leading provider of human resource services and one of the world's largest independent computing services companies.7. Never invest in the following class of companies;- Airline operations business (poor business model). They should charge a price that they can make money on.- Banking small and large (can't tell what assets are worth).- BDCs (too much debt and bad businesses). High dividends are not worth it. It's better to have a real company like Harley Davidson (NYSE:HOG), that has an iconic product.Passed : ADP provides computer services.8. S&P Capital IQ rating should be at least 3 or better. Consider selling when its rating drops to 2 or 1.Failed : S&P Capital IQ rating is 1 indicating a strong sell. Value Line on 5/15/15 raised its rating on ADP from hold to buy. Two major analysis reports have different opinions. Considering the slow earnings growth of ADP in this low interest rate world ADP earnings have been flat. So I will trim ADP to my full position percentage of the portfolio of 4%.9. Remember you are not buying stock; you are buying shares in a company. Consider yourself an owner; you are. This idea may seem silly but it's one of the best in this list, very important. As an owner do your home work, read about the company every few days and check prices at least once a week. Having a list on your favorite financial site like Seeking Alpha or web home page will help.Passed : Cannot be evaluated consider it a pass.10. Compound annual growth rate for the next three years should be projected at least or greater than 6% per year.Passed: ADP has a CAGR of 12% for the next three years.Total Return EvaluationADP performed well in my 28.5 month test baseline compared to the DOW average. I chose the 28.5 month test period (starting January 1 2013) because it includes the great year of 2013 and the moderate year of 2014 and 2015 YTD. During this test period the Dow total return baseline was 38.46% and ADP total return was 56.10% for an over performance of 16.64 percentage points.Earnings and conclusionOn 4/30/15 ADP reported their third fiscal quarter earnings. The earnings were expected at $1.02 and came in at $1.04 compared to last year at $1.06. Revenue was also above expected by $10 million. ADP does business in over 104 countries. ADP is growing slowly but has been held back by head winds of the strong dollar on its foreign operations. When interest rates start to rise ADP will increase its earnings on the customer float deposits, and these earnings will fall to the bottom line. When interest rates rise the dollar will get stronger and will put ADP in a position where earnings will go up on the customer float and go down on foreign operations. Guideline eight issued a sell warning and considering the slow growth right now ADP will be trimmed. ADP is still a good business solid holding.Good Business Portfolio ChangesMy normal method of position sizing is to start a position at 1% of the portfolio and continue to buy more if the prospects remain positive for the business. When the position gets to be 4% of the portfolio buying is stopped . At 4% being a full position the company is left to grow to 8% of the portfolio when it will be trimmed back just below 8%.On 5/01/15 Automatic Data Processing was 4.70% percent of the portfolio. In the last 2 weeks the position of ADP has been trimmed back to 4.2% of the Good Businesses Portfolio. This position will be held since ADP has a good business that is slowly growing. With some of the proceeds from the sale the position in Omega Healthcare Inv. Inc. (NYSE:OHI) has been increased to 1.5% of the portfolio.Of course this is not a recommendation to buy or sell and you should always do your own research and talk to your financial advisor before any purchase or saleI am long ADP, HOG, OHI and do not own or intend to buy any other companies mentioned in the article."
3193416,36201,2015-05-19T17:55:16-04:00,"Automatic Data Processing's current yield is just 2.2%.Despite a less than exciting yield, there are several reasons the payroll processing giant is a good fit for a dividend growth portfolio.Strong competitive advantages should allow the company to continue increasing shareholder value for many years to come.","Automatic Data Processing's (NASDAQ:ADP) current yield is just 2.2%. That's hardly enough to excite an investor seeking income today, but for those of us with longer timelines, there are reasons to suspect it could be a smart addition to a dividend growth portfolio. One reason is that dividend growth has been better than average for companies that have raised payments for more than 25 consecutive years.While recent dividend growth has been relatively good, the stock does not pass the Chowder Rule. This simple test adds current yield to the five-year dividend growth rate. For a stock yielding less than three percent, the sum of yield and rate should be greater than 15. Over the past five years, ADP raised payments at an annual rate of just 7.9%. This may not be enough to pass the Chowder Rule, but it is just enough to keep it on my radar.Although I often let companies slide on the Chowder Rule, there's a second criteria that I won't bend on. Over the years I've noticed a shared characteristic among companies with long histories of increasing shareholder value. A durable competitive advantage, often called an economic moat, is vital to steadily growing profits over the long term. This is why every company on the Moaty Chowder watchlist has such an advantage. Automatic Data Processing's lead position in payroll processing suggests the presence of a wide economic moat. With this critical criteria met, it's time to see how well it stands up to the competition.Near-term outlookSince ADP's 2.2% dividend yield is well below the satisfactory threshold for most portfolios, solid growth in the years ahead is increasingly important. Luckily, when ADP reported fiscal third-quarter earnings last month, the theme was generally upbeat. Unfavorable foreign exchange took a two-point bite out of sales. Despite the headwind, revenue grew 7% compared to the same period last year. Most encouraging was a 1.1% expansion of pre-tax margin to 24.5%. As a result, operating earnings outpaced revenue, rising 12.4%.Looking ahead, ADP is well-positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment. Payroll processors hold client funds for far shorter periods than insurers, but income generated from the float is still significant. During the fiscal third quarter, ADP earned just 1.5% on funds held for clients. That seems fairly lousy until you realize how many clients it has. That dinky point and a half rate generated over $101.4 million in revenue for the quarter -- about 3.3% of the total.During fiscal 2013, ADP earned about 2.2% on funds held for clients. Hitting that rate again with the current level of client funds held would boost revenue by about $189.3 million. That seems miniscule, until you consider most of the extra revenue would filter to the bottom line.Rising interest rates aside, the average of seven analysts reporting to S&P Capital IQ is expecting fiscal 2017 earnings to come in at about $3.81 per share. That represents annual growth of about 6.7% over the three-year period beginning last July. Solid growth in the years ahead is worth four of a possible five points in this section.Dividend historyNow that we've looked forward, let's take a look back at the history of ADP's dividend policy. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results, but it does indicate a company's level of commitment to increasing shareholder value.After 40 consecutive years of raising payments, ADP's commitment is clear. The company will earn full marks for longevity, but its rate of growth is hardly inspirational. Over the past three-, five-, and ten-year periods, ADP increased the distribution at annual rates of 10.2%, 7.9%, 13.2%, respectively. All of those rates are better than average for companies that have increased payments for more than 25 consecutive years. In fact the three- and ten-year rates are even better than average for companies with much shorter histories. With this in mind, I'm giving ADP a full five points in this section.Dividend sustainabilityAlthough you can find faster growth rates, they aren't much help if they're unsustainable. The good news is that you can do quite well with moderate growth, as long as it is steady.Let's look at what would happen if the company continued increasing payments through the following decade at the same rate it has over the past 10 years. At 13.2% annually, investors would receive a 7.7% dividend yield on shares purchased at recent prices. That's not so bad, if the company can indeed be expected to continue raising dividends at this rate.ADP Dividend data by YChartsAs you can see, earnings haven't kept pace with dividends for many years now. As a result, the percentage of profits required to make payments, or the payout ratio, has risen to about 67%. While some companies can support payout ratios of 80% or more, this is unusually high for ADP.Going forward I really don't expect the company to raise payments faster than underlying earnings growth. Luckily the it appears on the cusp of significant growth. With this in mind I'm giving three of five points in this section.Competitive advantageOne feature common to nearly all companies with storied histories of increasing shareholder value is the presence of unassailable competitive advantages. These advantages are often collectively described as an economic moat. Without a moat, it would only be a matter of time before profit margins become too narrow to continue increasing the distribution.The first of ADP's advantages involve its size. Payroll processing is a highly scalable enterprise. In other words, the company becomes increasingly profitable with each client added, into infinity. As such it should be able to offer a level of service comparable to the competition at far lower prices. This goes a long way to discourage market entrants.Furthermore, should a competitor offer a desired level of service at a lower price, the cost of switching payroll services discourages clients from leaving. Small business retention rates above 80%, and large business retention rates near 95% suggest this is indeed the case. With its moat intact, I'm giving ADP a full five points in this section.ProfitabilityNow that we've had a subjective look at ADP's moat, let's see if we can find evidence of its benefit in the numbers. Having a moat is one thing, getting it to translate into profits that end up in your pocket is another.At first glance it seems this company is taking advantage of its advantages. One hallmark of a highly profitable company is strong generation of free cash flow, measured as cash from operations minus capital expenditures. I like to think of it as the amount of cash available to return to shareholders after making investments necessary to maintain core growth. Over the past ten years FCF has averaged a whopping 14.4% of revenue.In addition to impressive generation of FCF, ADP has generated returns on invested capital with a ten-year median of 22.2%. That's well above its cost of capital. Over the last twelve months ROIC has risen to 23.9%. With a weighted average cost of capital at around 9.8%, the company is well-positioned to increase shareholder value, and deserving of a full five points in this section.Bottom LineBefore you look at the score below, it's important to remember I haven't included a valuation yet. In an earlier post I explained why I won't be adding ADP to my portfolio. In a nutshell, it is so highly valued that anything less than stellar growth in the years ahead could result in lackluster returns or even a loss.Just to clarify, companies ranking highest on Moaty Chowder aren't to be automatically added to the portfolio. Rather they will be getting the most attention, including a valuation. Addition to the portfolio is contingent upon a favorable valuation.That said, the company did score extremely well. With 21 stocks evaluated so far, ADP is all alone in fourth place. You can see all the Moaty Chowder rankings to date, and a methodology discussion, right here."

As undisputed leader of the payroll processing industry, this pioneer's revenues dwarf those of its nearest competitors. Combine an industry leading position with client retention of about 12 years in its largest reporting segment and you have a recipe for steady gains that dividend growth investors salivate for.Hooray For BuybacksWith more than 630,000 clients, there's only so much room to grow, as evidenced by ADP's long-term performance. Over the past decade operating income has grown at a fairly steady rate of 3.06% annually from $1.65 in fiscal 2005 to $2.23 billion during in fiscal 14 - the company ends its year in June. Significant share buybacks helped accelerate EPS to a more acceptable growth rate of about 5.78% over the same period.Over the past several years however the company's rate of growth has slowed considerably, due in part to the spinoff of CDK Global (NASDAQ:CDK). ADP stockholders received one share of CDK Global for every three shares of ADP common stock they held near the end of last September. Taken together, shareholders that have held on to both companies have done well, especially if they picked up their shares during the last recession.While growth of operating income has been lackluster, share buybacks coupled with raising the level of net income distributed to shareholders - the payout ratio - has led to satisfactory dividend growth. Distributions grew at blistering rate of 12.1% during the above mentioned period from $0.60 to $1.88 per share.Near-Term DoldrumsFollowing the company's 40th annual increase late last year the annual dividend of $1.96 is now 65.8% of EPS over the past twelve months. There's still some runway left, but increases will likely slow over the next several years.If you're looking at past growth, and expecting an equally quick rise of the recent dividend yield - around 2.2% - to an acceptable rate soon, you had better get used to disappointment. Management recently stated plans ""to grow the dividend at a slower rate than earnings to allow us to return to our pre-separation target dividend payout ratio of 55% to 60% in about two years.""Earnings growth in the near term isn't looking so spectacular either. Fiscal '15 is unlikely to be a banner year for ADP's bottom line due in part to the CDK spinoff and currency headwinds. Despite management's guidance of 12%-14% EPS growth from continuing operations, the average analyst reporting to S&P Capital IQ is expecting EPS to fall 7% to $2.92.Too ExpensiveIf you've read any of my recent articles you'll know I take the long view, often buying into market overreactions to the downside. However using a DCF model, recent share prices above $87 suggest revenue growth, and/or margin expansion well above levels I would consider reasonable for a company so mature in this industry.With the domestic market saturated, and a strengthening dollar upsetting emerging market expansion, at this valuation I would expect lackluster returns over the following decade. I'm afraid ADP will remain in my watchlist for the time being.Sources:ADP SEC filingsCDK SEC filings"

The company's top-line is up 8% to $5.2b, while its bottom-line is up 9% to $632m for the 6 months ended 31 December 2014.Operating profitability continues to grow, as expectedIn an earlier article, I opined that ADP made a great move to spin off its non-core businesses - specifically its dealer services, as it would allow the company to focus on maximizing profitability in its core operating segments. The spin-off has been completed recently, and the company has already shown improvements in the context of profitability, with pre-tax earnings growth outpacing revenue growth. Pre-tax profit margins increased approximately 40 basis points from 17.8% to 18.2% over the comparable 6-month period. I expect further margin expansion to occur gradually for two main reasons - the scalability of the company's business model allows ADP to add new bookings at low incremental cost, and the fact that its clients are very sticky customers, evident from ADP's continued record retention rates.Migration of clients to its cloud platform is now complete, coupled with new analytics solutions will allow capitalization of high-growth cloud and big data marketsIn the company's Q2 2015 earnings call, CEO Carlos Rodriguez mentioned that nearly all its clients have migrated to the company's cloud platforms. The company continues to roll out more of its cloud offerings, notably cloud HCM solutions. ADP continues to see huge demand for its big data products since it introduced its analytics solution a year ago. Clearly, the company has decided to reinvigorate growth by participating in these markets. According to PRNewswire press releases here and here, the big data analytics market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 25.52% from 2013 to 2018 while the cloud applications market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 16.9% from 2014 to 2019. Given the fact that ADP is blessed with a large and still-growing customer base, I have little doubt the company would be able to push its new cloud and big data solutions to its clients. Hence, the company will have experience little difficulty in growing its top-line in the near-term.FX headwinds will persist throughout the year, dampening both the top- and bottom-lineFrequent readers of my work would know that in recent months, the dollar has been strengthening against most major currencies. This appreciation can be largely attributed to the diverging monetary policy stance taken by the Fed compared to its central banking peers. The FOMC has given hints that although a rate hike is very unlikely to occur in June, a September hike may be in order. As a result, the dollar has largely appreciated against most major currencies as investors seek to be first in-line to benefit from higher expected yields. According to CNBC, the dollar currency index has increased 22% since last year. As ADP's business is global, the company would no doubt suffer from persisting FX headwinds. In fiscal 2014, the company derived approximately 13% of its pre-tax earnings from its foreign subsidiaries. Management has also guided lower revenues and earnings numbers, citing an unfavourable FX environment. Hence, expect ADP to be mildly affected by the recent strengthening of the dollar.ValuationAs seen in the above DCF model, company revenues are expected to grow at 7% in FY15, which is at the low-end of the guidance range. This growth will stem primarily from new business bookings and will be offset by an unfavourable dollar exchange rate. EBITDA margins are expected to improve gradually to 23% by the end of the 5-year projection period, supported mainly by the scalability of the ADP's business model. The company currently trades at 15x EV/LTM EBITDA. Using this figure, along with an 8% discount rate due to the relative stability of the company's cash flows, the model produces a fair value of $108 for ADP, indicating that the company is currently trading at a 23% discount to fair value. ADP still has a fair amount of upside and hence my outlook on the company remains bullish. Investors are advised to hold or add to their position at current levels."
3084406,39011,2015-04-22T03:10:44-04:00,"ADP has been a great dividend growth story in the past decade.
        The company has managed to triple its payout in that time but I think most of the growth has been seen.
        I'll take a look at ADP's financials and forecast dividend growth going forward.","Services provider ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) touched new all-time highs earlier this year as the company's fundamentals and a favorable macro backdrop have conspired to send EPS above $3. ADP has certainly been a great buy in recent years but apart from that, ADP is also a robust dividend stock. Management has made capital returns of all types a priority in recent years so in this article, I'll take a look at ADP's financials in order to see how taxing the dividend is to pay.To do this I'll be using data from Morningstar.We'll begin with a quick look at the company's per share payout over the past decade.We see a very steady and rapid rise in the payout during this time period as the dividend has skyrocketed from just over 60 cents in 2005 to more than triple that number for 2014. That's impressive dividend growth and in particular, from a decently-sized base. Tripling the payout in a decade is robust indeed and it speaks to management's commitment to return capital to shareholders.This chart will give us a look at the magnitude of ADP's dividend raises we just looked at.Although raises have gotten somewhat smaller in the past few years, ADP has shown very strong and steady growth in the payout. Each year has a raise of at least 5% and most years are 9% or greater. This is how a payout gets tripled in a ten year period; sustained attention paid by management and a strong business backing it up.Now that we have a baseline for ADP's per share payout, let's take a look at how it pays for it. I like to use free cash flow to compare to dividends because dividends are cash payment obligations and the only truly recurring source of cash is FCF. Thus, I've charted FCF against the cost of the dividend below.We can see FCF has been pretty stagnant over this time period and that means that the proportion of FCF that is being used up by dividends has been growing. This point is illustrated below; the chart shows the amount of FCF that is consumed by dividends each year.We can see that the dividend used to consume about 30% of FCF but that number has risen markedly in recent years as huge dividend raises haven't been met by increasing FCF; ADP is simply using more of its stagnant FCF to pay the dividend. It's still well within a comfortable range around 65% of FCF but flexibility for future raises has certainly been reduced by the lack of FCF growth in the past few years.So what does this mean for ADP's flexibility with dividend raises going forward? This chart shows how ADP spent its FCF in fiscal 2014.ADP actually spent more than it produced in FCF last year retuning cash to shareholders. This sort of thing isn't really sustainable over the long term if a company runs a large deficit because the only truly recurring source of cash is FCF. However, ADP's deficit last year was very small at less than $100 million, something it can keep up for a very long time. So it's not that I'm worried ADP can't afford the capital returns it is currently making, it's just that I'm worried overspending may reduce its ability to raise the dividend and produce large buybacks.Overall, ADP has been a great dividend growth story. The company has managed to more than triple its dividend in the past decade and that's something any management team would be proud of. But given the fact that ADP has thus far been unable to really grow FCF and that it continues to raise the dividend, buybacks will likely have to be scaled back going forward. With stagnant FCF but a growing dividend obligation, the only logical thing that can happen over the long term is for buybacks to shrink. Indeed, even 2015's dividend increase was less than half of 2014's increase; something I'd expect more of down the road as well. ADP's dividend is certainly safe but I think most of the growth has been seen. I suspect ~5% raises will be the new norm for ADP."

The company currently yields about 2.3 percent, has a long history of yearly dividend increases, but expects dividend growth to slow in the near term due to the recent spin-off. Investors most likely know ADP as a company with an extensive history of dividend increases. Many investors also know ADP as the processor of the paychecks they receives from their employers on a periodic basis. In addition, ADP was also known for being one of the last American companies with an AAA credit rating until its spin-off of its Dealer Services division was announced.A combination of an extended period of low interest rates put forth by the U.S. Federal Reserve and ADP's stellar dividend growth history have led to the company's shares to appreciate to a level where the price-to-earnings ratio of ADP stock is above the company's historical price-to-earnings ratio of the mid-to-upper teens. With this in mind, a potential investor should put ADP on their watch list until the share price pulls back to a level near its historical price-to-earnings ratio. Avoiding establishing a full position in ADP shares at the current price is more important than ever, given that the Federal Reserve signaled recently that interest rates are set to rise starting in mid-2015. As interest rates rise, investors will begin to have an alternative lower risk investment vehicle, bank deposit accounts, which will offer more competitive interest rates. As bank deposit accounts begin offering more competitive interest rates, there is a high likelihood that investors exposing their investment funds to riskier investments in stocks with dividend yields will begin to pull back towards bank deposit accounts. As investors pull back from highly priced dividend growth stocks and the share price of such stocks drop, potential investors should then start to consider establishing a full position in a dividend growth stock such as ADP.BackgroundAutomatic Data Processing is the largest global provider of payroll outsourcing services based on revenue. The company offers a wide range of human resource, payroll, tax and benefits administration solutions. In addition to basic payroll processing, ADP sells companies other outsourced human resources services, such as payroll tax administration, retirement plan administration, health benefit administration, and workers' compensation insurance services. Additionally, ADP earns interest on funds that are temporarily held for its clients (The time between the transfer of money to ADP and the time a direct deposit is made or that checks are sent to and cashed by employees). Economic downturns pressure ADP's earnings because higher unemployment decreases demand for payroll services and falling interest rates decrease the revenue earned from interest on funds held for clients.First quarter fiscal 2015 earningsADP announced first-quarter fiscal 2015 earnings from continuing operations of 62 cents per share, a 13 percent increase from the year-ago quarter. The company's revenues increased 9 percent from the year-ago quarter to $2.57 billion. Strong performance from ADP's Employer Services, PEO Services and Dealer Services divisions drove results. The company's Employer Services division revenues increased 7 percent from the year-ago quarter to $2.1 billion based on organic growth. The company's PEO Services division revenues increased 18 percent from the year-ago quarter to $594.9 million. In the quarter, combined worldwide new business bookings for Employer Services and PEO Services increased 11 percent from the year-ago quarter. Interest on funds held for clients grew 1.2 percent from the year-ago quarter to $90.3 million.ADP completed spin-off of its Dealer Services business into the independent publicly-traded company CDK Global (NASDAQ:CDK), and ADP expects such a transaction to provide it with at least $700 million, which the company plans to use for buying back shares. ADP expects fiscal 2015 revenues to grow in the range of 7 percent to 8 percent on a year-over-year basis. Further, the company expects diluted earnings per share to increase 12 percent to 14 percent from diluted earnings per share of $2.58 in fiscal 2014. ADP expects to perform better given improved execution and higher client retention. In addition, a recovery in the job market will also help the company.ADP completed its Dealer Services spin-off - CDK GlobalIn April 2014, ADP announced plans to spin-off its Dealer Services business into an independent publicly-traded company. ADP completed its spin-off of CDK Global, and, in fact, CDK's shares have already attracted a substantial investment from an activist hedge fund. CDK's Dealer Services business provides marketing solutions to over 26,000 auto retailers, distributors and manufacturers.  The spin-off of CDK was believed to allow ADP to focus more on its core Human Capital Management (NASDAQ:HCM) business, going forward. 15 percent of ADP's revenue came from its former Dealer Services division. Analysts saw ADP's exit from this industry as positive, given that the company will no longer participate in the cyclical auto industry. Although analysts and investors considered the spin-off plan shareholder friendly, the credit rating agencies did not agree. Following the spin-off announcement, the Standard & Poor's lowered ADP's credit rating from AAA to AA, primarily due to the company's plan of using the spin-off proceeds to buy back shares. Moody's Investors Service also decreased its rating to Aa1, citing lower scale and variety of ADP's product portfolio.Dividend growth to slow in the near term given CDK spin-offIn ADP's most recently announced dividend increase, the company approved a $0.01 increase in the quarterly cash dividend to an annual rate of $1.96 per share. The increased cash dividend represented ADP's 40th consecutive year in which it increased its quarterly dividend. ADP indicated its intention to continue its track record of annual dividend increases, subject to board approval, while returning to its pre-spin-off target dividend payout ratio of 55 percent to 60 percent. The latest $0.01 increase to the quarterly cash dividend results in a dividend payout ratio above ADP's target. Therefore, ADP intends to grow its cash dividend at a slower rate than earnings growth to allow the company to return to its target 55 percent to 60 percent dividend payout ratio in about two years.Our viewsADP shares are overpriced given their share price appreciation. The shares rose in anticipation of the perceived belief that the now completed Dealer Services spin-off would be favorable to ADP shareholders. ADP participates in a saturated market for large-company employer solutions, and competition exists from established companies and emerging participants for small and mid-sized clients. While improving unemployment levels should benefit ADP, continuing underemployment is likely to persist. ADP is expected to perform well with improved execution and higher client retention. In addition, recovery in the job market will help the company. Finally, the company will face near-term challenges given the turbulent economic environment and increasing competition from Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) and Equifax (NYSE:EFX).We would recommend that potential investors watch the shares for a pull back before initiating a full position. The shares are currently near a 52-week high with a price-to-earnings ratio of about 28. Earnings estimates for fiscal year 2015 are $2.93 per share. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2016 are $3.31 per share. The forward price-to-earnings ratio based on fiscal 2016 earnings is about 25.75. The shares are expensive given the company's historical price-to-earnings ratio being in the range of the mid-to-upper teens. Investors should watch ADP shares and wait for the share price to fall into (or close to) the range of $59.60 to 66.20 (an 18 to 20 price-to-earnings ratio based on 2016 fiscal year earnings) before initiating a full position."
2684315,24787,2014-11-14T20:33:26-05:00,ADP's payout ratio in the past decade has increased from 30% to 60%.The P/E ratio is approaching 30 (the highest valuation in the past decade).The company lost its AAA credit rating after the spin-off of CDK Global.,"If you bought shares of Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) in 2002, you would have received an annual compounding rate of 9.39% since then. If you had instead delayed your purchase until 2003, you would have compounded your wealth at a 13.21% annual rate. Even though we're talking about the same exact company, why does the spread of nearly four percentage points exist between the annual compounding rate of the 2002 and the 2003 ADP investor?The answer has to do with valuation. In 2002, someone buying shares of ADP paid 30x earnings to establish an entry level position in the payroll and tax firm, whereas someone waiting for a fair valuation was able to buy shares of the company at a rate of 21x profits in 2003. In an important way, those annual returns cited in my first paragraph are somewhat inflated because the contention of my article is that ADP is a great company that is currently overvalued, and some of those capital gains will prove illusory when the price of the stock eventually returns towards fair value.I do have a few concerns about someone making an investment in this stock right now.First of all, the company is deploying the $800-$900 million received from the spin-off of CDK Global (in which CDK made a one-time cash payment to the former parent company) towards share buybacks. Share repurchases only create value if they are conducted at a price below what the company is worth. The company makes about $2.90 per share in profits. The current price of the stock is $85. That works out a P/E ratio around 29.This is not a price at which you want to repurchase stock! Over the past ten years, the highest average annual P/E ratio for the company was 26x earnings, a price that ADP saw in 2007 before the onset of the financial crisis. From 2008 through 2012, ADP could have retired stock at valuations in the 16x-20x earnings range. Instead, it is repurchasing stock now, at literally the highest valuation level that the company has seen in the past ten years.By the way, it is no longer hyperbole to compare ADP's current valuation to the company's valuation during the stock bubble -- the current price is starting to come within orbit of the 2000 highs. In 2000, ADP traded at 36x profits. For the company to be valued today like it was during the tech bubble, the price would only have to advance from $85 to $104 per share.Also, the dividend growth of the past decade was not commensurately matched by growing profits. From 2004 through 2014, ADP grew its dividend at a rate of 13.5% annually. That's been some significant additional cash for shareholders, but profits per share only increased by 5.0% over that same timeframe. Ten years ago, ADP was paying a third of its profits in the form of dividends. Now it is paying out two-thirds of its earnings as dividends.That is an important consideration for shareholders to take into account. You can study the balance sheet and see that it is earning 12% on its retained profits, but it does not mean quite the same thing it once did. In the mid-90s, ADP's payout ratio was miniscule -- in the 10%-20% range. Back then, when the company earned 12% on its retained profits, it essentially amounted to 12% annual earnings per share growth, and lo and behold, ADP returned 13% between 1994 and 2004 (that extra percentage point is the result of capital appreciation due to an expanding P/E ratio).Nowadays, ADP still earns around 12% on its retained profits. The problem is that it is only retaining a third of its profits, and shipping out two-thirds of its cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. That's why ADP has only grown profits per share at 5% over the past decade -- the business is retaining less profits on which to earn its returns.I do feel dirty criticizing this company -- it has been an absolutely excellent long-term holding. It has compounded at a rate of 15% annually since 1984, turning a $25,000 investment into $2,000,000 over the past thirty years. It is a dividend aristocrat that raises its payout every year, and there is nothing to indicate that the annual dividend growth will not continue well into the future. For much of the company's corporate history, it had a credit worthiness rating of AAA (though it lost this rating with the CDK spin-off).It really is a great business, however, there is nothing approaching a margin of safety if you pay today. The P/E ratio is 29 when you adjust for the CDK spin-off, and shares of the company were available for purchase in the 16x-20x earnings range during seven out of the fourteen years this millennium. That's reverse margin of safety territory where your future returns are nearly certain to lag the growth of the company. The payout ratio has doubled in the past decade, from the 30% range to the 60% range. And the company is still earning about 12% on retaining profits, which translates into an earnings per share growth rate in the 5%-6% range. It's a nice company to have in a portfolio, but this is not the season for making an initial purchase."

According to our observations ADP looks extremely overvalued and material concerns exist.First, earnings have not been growing at a stellar rate, and our observations of the yearly earnings growth rate for ADP suggest that current growth is 3%, a growth rate lower than the company has seen since before 2011.In addition, quarterly revenues have begun to decline measurably and revenues for ADP have not been this low since the third quarter of 2011 either.This combination of deteriorating revenue and lackluster earnings can become a major concern, especially when the stock's price increases relentlessly. In fact, at current levels shares of ADP have a peg ratio over 9.Technical take:According to our real time trading report for ADP the stock is near the level of longer-term resistance and by rule we would be Sellers and potential short Sellers of the stock near longer-term resistance levels. Our technical observations suggest that the stock can fall from resistance to support.Summary:According to our fundamental observations, ADP looks significantly overvalued based on its earnings and revenue trajectory, its peg ratio is enormous, and the stock is very close to a level of longer-term resistance.

The hedge fund, Sachem Head Capital Management, a $2 billion investor, disclosed on October 27, 2014 that they had acquired an economic interest in CDK equivalent to a 9.8 percent stake. At the close of trading on the date of disclosure, the company, which provides technology and marketing services for auto retailers, was valued at about $4.7 billion. An activist hedge fund, such as Sachem Head, is in the business of focusing on companies to urge management to make changes in strategy. The large stake taken in CDK is unusual in that the company's shares have only been trading since October 1, 2014 and have fallen only about 2.6 percent since the shares began trading. While it is not clear what actions the hedge fund will take towards CDK, the disclosed position is not hostile and currently the activist hedge fund is seeking meetings with CDK management.In April 2014, ADP announced plans to spin off their dealer services business into an independent publicly-traded company. The CDK spin-off transaction was structured as a tax-free spin-off of 100 percent of ADP's dealer services business to ADP shareholders and was completed on October 1, 2014.  The 100 percent tax-free spin-off was meant to help ADP focus more on their core Human Capital Management (HCM) business. Prior to the spin-off, according to ADP management, the strong long-term growth prospects of the automotive market would provide significant growth opportunities to CDK's dealer services business.In our previous article on ADP, we noted that about 15 percent of ADP's current revenue came from the dealer services division. We indicated further that the dealer services division, now CDK, participates in the volatile auto industry. We noted that analysts saw ADP's exit from the dealer services industry was positive given that the company would no longer participate in the cyclical auto industry. CDK's share price fell from about $31 on the first day of trading to as low as $25 on no significant news disclosure by the company. The initial selloff in CDK shares was likely due to investors selling the shares due to the spun-off company not fitting into the same investment thesis that had such investors investing in ADP. Given that CDK shares have been trading for about 1 month, little is known of the plans CDK management has for the company. The recent activist investor position in CDK, however, is a strong indication that CDK shares are worth more than the market is currently pricing them."

If ADP grows its dividend at 8.6% per year, it will take 2 years to equal a MMA yielding an estimated 20-year average rate of 2.98%. ADP earned a check for the Key Metric ""Years to >MMA"" since its 2 years is less than the 5-year target.Memberships and Peers: ADP is a member of the S&P 500, a Dividend Aristocrat, a member of the Broad Dividend Achievers™ Index and a Dividend Champion. The company's peer group includes: Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) with a 3.5% yield, Insperity, Inc. (NYSE:NSP) with a 2.7% yield and Convergys Corporation (NYSE:CVG) with a 1.5% yield.Conclusion: ADP earned one Star in the Fair Value section, earned two Stars in the Dividend Analytical Data section and earned one Star in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a total of four Stars. This quantitatively ranks ADP as a 4-Star Strong stock.Using my D4L-PreScreen.xls model, I determined the share price would need to increase to $91.75 before ADP's NPV MMA Differential decreased to the $500 minimum that I look for in a stock with 38 years of consecutive dividend increases. At that price, the stock would yield 2.0%.Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the target $500 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 6.3%. This dividend growth rate is lower than the 8.6% used in this analysis, thus providing a margin of safety. ADP has a risk rating of 1.25, which classifies it as a Low risk stock.As the industry leader, ADP enjoys advantages of scale, a respected brand and protected by high customer switching costs. The company should see its market grow since payroll outsourcing is currently under-utilized in the small- and medium-sized businesses and overseas. However, based on the current market size, the market is saturated for large-company employer solutions, with additional competition coming from established and emerging participants serving small and mid-sized firms.The previously announced plans to spin-off the Dealer Services business were completed on September 30, 2014. The Dealer Services business segment provided marketing solutions to over 26,000 auto retailers, distributors and manufacturers.As a result of the spin-off, ADP updated their guidance for fiscal 2015. The company now projects its EPS from continuing operations to grow 12% to 14% in fiscal 2015, up from 11%-13% as per the prior guidance. The company reaffirmed its revenue guidance for fiscal 2015 of a 7% to 8% year-over-year increase.Primarily as a result of the company's plan to buy back shares, Standard & Poor's lowered ADP's credit rating from AAA to AA. In addition, Moody's Investor service decreased its rating to Aa1, citing lower scale and variety of ADP's product portfolio.Financially, the company has a strong balance sheet, with a low debt to total capital of 25%, and a recurring revenue stream generating steady cash flows. Its free cash flow payout of 62% is slightly above my target maximum of 60%. The stock is trading below my calculated fair value of $80.46. I am reevaluating the stock in light of the Dealer Services spin-off.Disclaimer: Material presented here is for informational purposes only. The above quantitative stock analysis, including the Star rating, is mechanically calculated and is based on historical information. The analysis assumes the stock will perform in the future as it has in the past. This is generally never true. Before buying or selling any stock you should do your own research and reach your own conclusion.Full Disclosure: At the time of this writing, I held no position in ADP (0.0% of my Dividend Growth Portfolio).

2694075,58481,2014-11-20T01:29:17-05:00,"Every investor should have a core portfolio that investors can rely on for steady gains without wild fluctuations.Automatic Data Processing has steadily grown its revenue over the past several decades to become the premier payroll and HR services company in the industry.Just like banks and insurance companies benefit from higher interest rates, so will ADP, but with less risk.","In taking a slight turn from my previous three core holding picks, this article will take a forward-looking approach to economic trends and see which company will stand to benefit from rising interest rates, while still meeting my five criteria for a quality core investment. When looking at markets and industries that will have positive changes over the next 10-20 years, I believe rising interest rates are a foregone conclusion. The US Federal Reserve has been trying to jump start the US economy ever since the economic collapse in 2008-2009. To accomplish this task, one tool that has been used was to cut the effective Fed Funds rate to zero. In the history of the US, this rate has never been at such low levels for such a sustained period of time.Effective Federal Funds Rate data by YChartsWhile economists and investors can have an endless debate on the effectiveness of this policy and what the end result will be, the policy of interest rates near zero is an unsustainable solution. Many economists will tell you this virtually ""free money"" is responsible for creating asset bubbles and can eventually lead to inflation. Regardless of your economic views on this situation, the Federal Reserve has the final say and has already made their intention know that they will be raising rates in the future. No one knows exactly when this will/should happen, but it will happen. As a result, there are several industries that benefit from higher interest rates. Banks and insurance companies benefit because they are able to invest their cash holdings into bonds and securities that yield interest income. When interest rates rise, so will the company's income. However, my choice for a core investment holding in this area isn't a bank or an insurance company, it's the largest payroll processor in the United States, Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP). Banks and insurance companies were hit hard during the 2008-2009 recession and as a result they have increasingly stringent government regulations. ADP suffered during the recession just like the rest of the market, but nowhere near the levels that major banks and insurance companies did, because of their steady stream of revenue generation and clean balance sheet. Also unlike, banks and insurance companies, ADP doesn't have billions in liabilities on their balance sheet, which can have a serious negative impact on the stock.ADP data by YChartsADP takes in billions of dollars from its clients in order to cut checks for payrolls. The company then takes that money and invests it to generate interest income. In FY 2014, ADP had an average client fund balance of $20.7 billion that generated $373 million in interest income. While this is only 3% of total revenue, it's an easy way the company can generate millions more to the bottom line by doing nothing more sitting back and benefitting from higher interest rates. In comparison, ADP generated approximately $700 million in interest income in 2008 based on an average client fund balance of $16 billion; all because of higher interest rates. If ADP would have had the same interest yield in FY 2014 as it did in 2008, the interest income would have been roughly $900 million, over double its actual level. While ADP does have this positive long-term catalyst, it also meets my five criteria for becoming a core holding with flying colors.Core Investment Portfolio Pick #1: Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT)Core Investment Portfolio Pick #2: Disney (NYSE:DIS)Core Investment Portfolio Pick #3: 3M (NYSE:MMM)Core Investment Portfolio Pick #4: Automatic Data ProcessingADP is a provider of business outsourcing solutions, including payroll processing, human resource management, and tax and benefits administration. With an initial investment of $6,000 in 1949, Henry Taub, started Automatic Payrolls with an idea to meet an unmet need of providing payroll services. Today the company services 620,000 customers in 125 countries and did over $12 billion in revenue in FY 2014. The company continues to grow through expanding its services to new unmet areas and becoming the go-to company in the industry.Strong Historical PerformanceADP Total Return Price data by YChartsOver the past five, 10 and 20 year periods, ADP has dramatically outperformed the S&P 500 Total Return. If an investor bought shares 20 years ago, today they would be sitting on a 964% total return. Even more impressive is the steady and consistent rate at which the company has increased their revenue. Over the past 10 years, annual revenue has basically doubled with no major drop-off seen during the 2008-2009 recession. Very few companies can boost the steady returns, which ADP has delivered over the past 20+ years, through organic growth.ADP Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsInnovate and EvolvePayroll processing and human resource services doesn't seem like a complex industry which requires heavy R&D spending, but ADP spends roughly 5-6% of total revenue (roughly $700 million) on system development and programming. Moving over $1 trillion in client funds every year requires the most advance technology and security platforms. To achieve this, the company launched the ADP Research Institute in 2012 and a second ""Innovation Lab"" in 2013 to enhance user experience and increase their mobile platform usage. From 2011-2013, ADP was named to Forbes's Most Innovative Companies list.Most recently, the company announced they have expanded their services to accommodate the huge demand from businesses for help with Obamacare and meeting the new healthcare requirements. Many small/medium and even large companies are struggling to understand how to best meet the changing healthcare compliance rules and ADP is launching new solutions to fill this void. Quick-thinking solutions to serve the demand from existing clients is one of the many reasons ADP has been so successful over the years.High Barriers to Entry/Highly Established ServiceOn the surface it would seem payroll processing and human resources management is a low cost to entry industry, but when you consider the importance of the service, no upstart company can come in and take away large corporate clients. 620,000 clients have put their faith into ADP's products and services to run one of the most essential aspects of their business. ADP has invested millions into their technology platforms and cloud infrastructure to establish an industry-leading complete solution. Once a company has transitioned their entire payroll processing, benefits administration, tax services and talent management over to ADP, it's not something that can easily be brought back in-house or transferred to a competitor. ADP has an excellent retention rate, as well as a history of growing its revenue base with existing clients. There are a fair number of competitors in the industry, but ADP remains the largest with the most complex end-to-end solutions offered in 125 counties.Return Value to ShareholdersADP Dividend data by YChartsADP is a dividend aristocrat, which has increased its dividend for 39 consecutive years. It currently pays a 2.3% dividend yield and has a 10-year CAGR of 12%. During FY 2014, the company paid $880 million in dividends and $667 million in share repurchases, for a total of over $1.5 billion returned to shareholders. When selecting a core holding for the next 20+ years, it's not only important to select a stock which pays steadily increasing dividends, but also one that isn't burdened by heavy debt loads. High debt on the balance sheet can effectively take money away from shareholders through interest expenses and a lowered credit rating when the company looks to raise more money. At the end of FY Q1 '15, ADP had $4.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents and just $10 million in long-term debt. In FY 2014, the company only spent $6.1 million on interest expense. This gives the company flexibility to reinvest in itself and weather downturns in the economy as seen in its relative strength during the 2008-2009 recession.Best-of-BreedADP's largest direct competitor, Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), is half the size of ADP by market capitalization and has over 100,000 fewer customers. While ADP does have quality competitors, it has risen to the top by continually investing in new technology and mobile platforms to keep its business solutions the best in the business. This quality can be seen in its high retention rate and ability to attract new customers. In the past several years, the company has seen high-single-digit organic growth by expanding to new areas. ADP will continue to dominate this area for years to come.RisksWhile ADP has shown its ability to keep revenue stable during economic downturns and produce healthy margins, I believe the greatest risk to the company is slowly losing market share to competitors, such as Paychex, Insperity (NYSE:NSP), and TriNet Group (NYSE:TNET). Smaller competitors have the ability to poach smaller clients with a more personal approach and added focus. However, with 620,000 clients worldwide, I believe this is a relatively small risk. The company has shown its ability to expand even with added competition coming into the market. ADP is a fairly low-risk stock, because it has steady revenue locked up in contracts with an extremely diverse customer base around the world.ConclusionADP peaked my interest because it will benefit from a higher interest rate environment, but it is also a quality company that has proven itself over the past couple decades while putting shareholders first. Its payroll, human resources, benefits, and tax services will always be in demand from small to large businesses. ADP's core business is a necessity that many companies prefer to outsource so they can focus on their own core business. In addition, the stock has performed surprising well during economic weakness and has a rock solid dividend.Like I recommended on my previous picks, Lockheed Martin and 3M, I believe it's best to wait for a pullback in share price before initiating a position in ADP. At $84/share, the company has a trailing P/E of 27 and a forward P/E of 25, making it relatively expensive. When taking a 20-year view on a stock, the entry price becomes less relevant, but can' be ignored. Being patient and waiting for a drop in the market is the best way to either buy in at lower levels or slowly accumulate shares to lower your dollar cost average. I think ADP is a buy at $75/share and a strong buy at anything below that level."
2764755,23471,2014-12-18T02:08:18-05:00,"ADP is suitable for the Enterprising Investor following the ModernGraham approach.
        According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is overvalued at the present time.
        The market is implying 9.93% earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, which is well above the company's actual growth in recent years.","Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) has some attractive qualities that catch the eye of investors, especially because the company has consistently grown its dividend for a number of years. Such a trait is highly sought after by many investors. However, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here's a look at how Automatic Data Processing fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.ADP data by YChartsDefensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 3/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 4/5Key Data:Balance Sheet - September 2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryADP Dividend data by YChartsAutomatic Data Processing is suitable for the Enterprising Investor, but not the Defensive Investor, who is concerned with the low current ratio, insufficient earnings growth over the last ten years and the high PEmg and PB ratios. The Enterprising Investor, on the other hand, is only concerned with the low current ratio. As a result, the Enterprising Investor should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.From a valuation side of things, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $2.45 in 2011 to only an estimated $2.92 for 2015. This demonstrated growth does not support the market's implied estimate of 9.93%. In fact, the demonstrated growth over the last several years is only 3.82% per year. The company would have to see a significant change in its level of growth in order to meet the market's estimated growth level. As a result, the ModernGraham valuation model returns an estimate of intrinsic value below the market price at this time, and the company appears to be overvalued by the market.Be sure to check out previous ModernGraham valuations of Automatic Data Processing for greater perspective!"
2564345,63483,2014-10-15T14:19:55-04:00,"Automatic Data Processing recently announced its intended spin-off of its dealer services division.
        With the spin-off, the company will be left with its employer & PEO services divisions.
        Looking at the operating profitability of these two divisions, it is clear that the company intends to focus on maximizing value for these two divisions.
        Strong revenue growth and expanding margins signal that the company is diverting all attention to capitalize on the current economic recovery.
        Strong M&A activity coupled with cheap funding presents opportunities for the company to acquire synergistic business lines to further supplement its core.","A word on the spin-offIn my recent article, I examined Automatic Data Processing's (NASDAQ:ADP) decision to spin-off its dealer services division. Despite disagreement from Moody's, one of the top credit rating agencies, I reasoned that the spin-off would ultimately enhance shareholder value for the company, given the fact that the dealer services division was in another business entirely, compared to the remaining two business lines. ADP simply had no reason to keep its dealer services division; it served as a distraction to its core business, and there are barely any synergies that can be realized from keeping the division. Thus, the only prudent decision which the company took was to sell off its non-core division.Examining the remainderSource: SEC Filings, author's own calculationsEmployer servicesLooking at its employer services division, which represents approximately 80% of its total revenue (post-spinoff), revenue has grown from $7.4b in 2012 to $8.5b in 2014, representing a 6.4% growth rate in 2013, and a 7.7% growth rate in 2014. Given the maturity of ADP, it is surprisingly pleasant to see that the company's growth is actually increasing.Most mature companies would have growth in the low single digits, more or less in line with GDP growth. Hence, ADP is clearly ahead of its peers in terms of organic growth. This revenue growth can be attributed to its new business started during the year from new business bookings growth, an increase in the number of employees on the company's clients' payrolls and price increases.Furthermore, the company's worldwide client retention rate continues to meet expectations, with a 10bp increase to 91.4% compared to its 2013 fiscal year. Being able to retain clients signifies a wide economic moat, and can effectively be interpreted as the company destroying its competition. Having such a magnificent client retention rate also reduces the uncertainty and instability of cash flows. As investors as a whole are typically risk-averse, lower risk of operating failure is rewarded with higher valuations.As for the company's earnings from its employer services division, earnings increased from $2b in 2012 to $2.5b in 2014. Suffice to say, the company continues to impress by increasing its earnings from this division by about a quarter in a period of 2 years. However, the key point to note is that the increase in expenses was lesser than that of the increase in revenues, hence resulting in expanding margins from 27.6% in 2012 to 29.5% in 2014. This further cements my confidence in the company's ability to compete effectively in its industry. Most mature companies with strong brands are able to maintain their profit margins, increasing them over time is a tall order, hence my praises.Capital expenditures for the employer services, which basically refer to the amount the company has to reinvest in order to sustain and grow its business, are a paltry $40m in 2012, increasing to $60m in 2014. These numbers represent less than a percentage of the division's revenue, signifying that the company does not really need much cash to operate. That being the case, it essentially tells investors that the company would be barely affected during tough economic times, simply due to the fact that it requires so little to continue operations.Source: SEC Filings, author's own calculationsPEO servicesLooking at the PEO services division, which represents the remaining 20% of the company's total revenue (post-spinoff), revenues have grown from $1.7b in 2012 to $2.2b in 2014, increasing by 11.4% in 2013 and 15.1% in 2014. When one talks about mature companies, double-digit revenue growth is a rare sight. The increase in revenues was due to a major increase in the average number of worksite employees, which resulted in an increase in the number of new clients and growth in the company's existing clients. Clearly, ADP is finding ways to sell its existing clients more services which is remarkable given the company's age, hence increasing average client profitability.Earnings from PEO services increased from $171m in 2012 to $234m in 2014, nearly a 36% increase during said period. Similar to its employer services division, revenue increases were greater than that of expenses, hence resulting in expanding margins for the PEO services division. Profit margins increased from 9.7% in 2012 to 10.3% in 2014.As for capital expenditures, the company requires a mere $1m every year to sustain and reinvest in its PEO services division, a amount that when compared to its employer services division, is even more insignificant and could be a mere rounding error at this point. Operating businesses with low capital requirements are certainly a huge advantage. Suppose the economy tanks and interest rates increase by a wide margin. Most businesses would have difficulty raising capital to continue to fund their operations. The same cannot be said for ADP given its operating excellence and capital efficiency. The company's PEO services division can effectively act as a definition of a low-capital business.A word on M&AGiven that it is crystal clear to anyone that ADP does not require external funding, evident by its strong and sustainable cash flows, readers would be dumbfounded as to why I would even touch on the M&A markets. However, consider this. The M&A market is currently on fire. It seems that not a week passes by without an announcement that a company is acquiring, merging or divesting a business line or division. GE's Aircraft Unit recently bought Milestone Aviation Group, a helicopter leasing business. Symantec just announced its intention to split the company into half. Ebay also announced that it is spinning off its payments business, PayPal. Blackstone also wished to sell its advisory division. These are a few of many examples that signify a strong M&A market.Considering ADP's cash generation abilities and easy access to cheap funding as evident by its revered credit rating, the company is presented with near-perfect economic conditions to search for synergistic businesses to acquire in order to further increase shareholder value.The bottom lineAutomatic Data Processing is clearly in great shape and is set to perform very well following its dealer services spin-off. Coupled with cheap access to external funding and a healthy M&A market, the company could very well acquire or merge with a synergistic business to further better operating performance and profitability.With strong growth and steadily expanding margins, I expect the company to do very well in the near future. Due to its low reliance on the capital markets for funding, I do not expect the company to falter with global interest rates set to rise by the end of 2015. However, if the market misprices the company's stock on fears that wider macroeconomic conditions would hinder the company's operations, I will certainly be buying more of its stock, given the clear disconnect between the company's prospects and implied market expectations following said mispricing. I don't see why you should not."
2563945,63883,2014-10-15T12:05:43-04:00,"See what makes ADP so special in part 17 of my 54-part series on Dividend Aristocrats.ADP has increased its dividend payments for 39 consecutive years.The company processes an amazing 1 out of 6 employee payments in the US.ADP is now global with 620,000 customers in 125 countries.Learn more about ADP's competitive advantage and future growth prospects in this article.","In part 17 of my 54-part Dividend Aristocrats In Focus series, I take a look into the operations of Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP). ADP provides businesses of all sizes with payroll, tax, and human resource services and software. The company was founded in 1949 in Patterson, New Jersey. Now ADP has 620,000 customers in 125 countries. The company has seen strong growth through its 65 year operating history and has now paid increasing dividends for 39 consecutive years.Business OverviewADP operates in two primary business units after the recent spin-off of its auto dealership-focused Dealer Services divisions was completed in September of this year. The company's two remaining divisions are employer services and PEO services.The employer services division accounted for 79% of revenues and 91% of operating profits for ADP in fiscal 2014, adjusting for the spin-off of the dealer services division. The PEO services division was responsible for 21% of revenues and 9% of operating profits for the company in fiscal 2014, adjusting for the spin-off of the dealer services division.Competitive AdvantageWhen a business is selecting a company to handle its human resources, government compliance, and taxes, it absolutely must find a company that will ""get it right."" ADP operates in a field where being ""cheap"" can cost companies significantly more in governmental penalties and fees. As a result, the bulk of the market goes to the largest, most trusted company in the human resources field. ADP is that company.ADP is the Human Resources provider for over 80% of Fortune 500 companies. Further, the company pays 1 in 6 workers in the U.S. through its payroll processing services. ADP's market dominance is not confined to the U.S. The company is also the number-one outsourced human resource provider in Europe. Source: ADP NASDAQ OMX Conference PresentationAnother competitive advantage for ADP is its global scale. The company can manage the payroll for virtually all employees of multi-national corporations, a strong selling point that smaller rivals cannot claim. ADP's size gives it the ability to better serve the largest multi-national companies in a way that reduces the complexity of their operations by having only one payroll provider globally.ADP operates in an industry that is both rapidly changing due to advancing technology, yet somewhat stable due to the unchanging need for human resources, government compliance, and tax help for both small and large businesses. The human resources, payroll, and tax help industry is similar to the insurance industry in that it provides a service that will always be in demand as long as governments are around (which will probably be a long, long time) while benefiting from technological progress that has made gathering, sharing, and analyzing information easier than ever. This change enhances the services of the human resources industry without causing the industry to become obsolete.Growth ProspectsDespite the slow economic recovery in the developed world, ADP is growing quickly. The company experienced 8% revenue growth for fiscal 2014, nearly all of which was organic. Guidance in 2015 is 7% to 8% revenue growth. The company is seeing even faster growth from its PEO services division, which is expected to grow 13% to 15% for the company's fiscal 2015. Overall, ADP is expecting to grow earnings per share 11% to 13% for its fiscal 2015, not counting share buybacks or one-time expenses associated with its recently completed spin-off. Management's 11% to 13% EPS projection does not include share repurchases. Including share repurchases, I expect earnings per share growth 1% higher than the company's forecast for full fiscal 2015. The additional 1% growth from share repurchases brings EPS growth to 12% to 14% for fiscal 2015.ADP's growth is being driven by its new, improved service offerings. The company's new cloud services platform has been well-received by its customers. The company has successfully migrated 430,000 customers over to its cloud-based services. In addition, ADP doubled the amount of people using its Mobile Solutions App to 2.5 million. The company has also expanded its help and customer service hours, and offers 24x7 service for many of its product offerings. The result of the company's focus on serving customers more efficiently and when they need help has boosted ADP's retention rates, which are critical for long-term growth of recurring-revenue businesses. ADP's retention rate for fiscal 2014 was 91.4%, an all-time high for the company.The company's future growth prospects look very favorable going forward. In 2015, ADP is rolling out new solutions to help customers handle integration of the Affordable Care Act in the US. ADP is in a unique position in that it benefits from increased government regulation, and especially complex government regulation. When small and large businesses feel they cannot keep up with the regulatory burden of payroll taxes and government compliance in general, they will turn to an outsourced payroll provider like ADP. The long-term trend throughout the world is for governments to grow in both size and complexity, which will in turn drive future growth for ADP around the world.Dividend AnalysisADP currently has a payout ratio of 62% and a dividend yield of 2.64%. ADP targets a payout ratio of 55% to 60%. As a result, dividends are expected to grow slower than earnings over the next 2 years as the company's payout ratio falls to be in line with its target. I expect 12% to 14% earnings per share growth for fiscal 2015 (as discussed in the growth section above), and earnings per share growth of at least 7% in fiscal 2016. The 7% growth number for 2016 is conservative and in line with the company's revenue per share growth over the last decade. If the company grows as expected and reduces its payout ratio to 60% by the end of fiscal 2015, and then to 58% (near the mid-range of its target payout ratio), it will have the following earnings and dividends:Under this scenario, the company will grow dividends per share at about 6.6% a year while hitting its target payout ratio. After this, I would expect dividends to grow at overall company growth, which will likely be around 7% based on historical growth.ValuationADP currently has a P/E ratio of 23.3, well above the S&P500's P/E ratio of 18.5. The company is a high-quality business with a long history of rewarding shareholders and strong growth prospects going forward. As a result, it should trade at a premium to the S&P500. Over the last decade, ADP has traded at an average of 1.23x the S&P500's P/E ratio. This works out to the following ratios for ADP:ADP is trading about in line with its historical premium over the market at current prices. Like most stocks, it is trading at a premium over its long-term historical fair value due to the overvalued status of the market in general.Recession PerformanceADP performed very well during the recession of 2007 to 2009. Despite economic downturns, businesses still must pay employees and keep up with government regulation. As a result, ADP is fairly well-insulated from the effects of recessions. The company also has an extremely solid balance sheet with virtually no long-term debt and a very safe amount of cash and market securities on hand. ADP's revenue per share and earnings per share increased each year from 2007 to 2009, throughout the recession. The company's long-term earnings per share are shown in the image below: Source: YchartsFinal ThoughtsADP is a high-quality dividend aristocrat that has solid historical growth and good future growth prospects. The company is the dominant player in the payroll and human resources industry and offers shareholders safety due to its competitive advantages and conservative balance sheet. The downside to the company is that it appears to be somewhat overvalued at this time. As a result, it is ranked 43rd out of 132 businesses with 25+ years of dividend payments without a reduction using the 8 Rules of Dividend Investing."

One commenter asked me to further analyze the company's planned spin-off of its dealer services business.After the company's announcement, Moody's, a credit rating agency, responded by downgrading ADP's credit rating to Aa1 from AAA. Being a credit rating agency, it does not take a genius to realize that Moody's feels that the spin-off would result in reduced cash flow, thus affecting ADP's ability to meet its debt obligations.Source: SEC Filings, author's own calculationsBusiness SegmentsAs seen above, I have detailed data ADP's different lines of business.Looking at recent years, ADP's Employer Services business line generated approximately 69-70% of the company's total revenue. This line of business had margins of roughly 19-21%. As a percentage of revenue, this segment required 0.5-0.7% of capital expenditures every year.As for PEO services, the line generated approximately 16-18% of the company's total revenue with margins of roughly 9-10%. As a percentage of revenue, this segment required approximately 0.1% in capital expenditures to sustain itself.As for Dealer services, this segment generated approximately 15-16% of the company's total revenue, with margins of roughly 19-22%. As a percentage of revenue, this segment required approximately 1.8-2.2% of capital expenditures to sustain itself.Moody's opinionLooking at this spin-off from Moody's point of view, it is quite clear why the credit rating agency feels that the spin-off is the wrong move. ADP's dealer services generate about a quarter of the company's total revenue and the resulting spin-off will effectively result in ADP losing a ton of revenue. Given that, it is easy to see the reasoning behind the downgrade.Furthermore, the dealer services division operates within the auto industry, an industry known for its cyclicality that results in unstable earnings and uncertain cash flows. However, revenue from the dealer services division has not changed much in recent years, signaling that the division has found a way to cope with that cyclicality, at least on the surface.Given such great division performance, a spin-off is clearly the wrong move.A smart moveHowever, although the dealer services division comprises of a large percentage of ADP's total revenue and generates high margins, the spin-off is a necessary sacrifice. This is because, despite its great performance, it is a non-core business line.Companies that have divisions that are not related to its core business face several challenges. By the virtue of not being related to one another, this results in low levels of synergies between divisions. As a result, value for the company as a whole cannot be maximized.Furthermore, Ernst & Young, the famed accounting firm did a study that proved corporate divestments of non-core divisions resulted in large increases in shareholder value. With non-core divisions pruned off, companies are better able to focus on their main business lines and maximize profitability and returns.ConclusionThe goal of companies is to maximize shareholder wealth. The smartest way to achieve this is to create long-term value. Thus, although on the surface it seems that ADP is cutting off an arm, looking at the big picture, that arm is cancerous and must be pruned for the good of the rest of the body.Having a division that operates in a non-core industry is a bad move, no matter how you slice it. Differing opinions and conflicts of interest may arise in the future, resulting in problems that could have been avoided and prevented with a divestment. Prevention is always better than cure and hence ADP's decision to spin-off its dealer services division is the result of astute foresight in preventing future catastrophes for the company. This results in lesser risk for the company as a whole and should lead to share price appreciation. As seen in the Ernst & Young study I linked above, many companies who divested non-core business lines in order to focus on its core business and competencies experienced large increases in share price where 85% of such companies saw increased valuation multiples following their divestment. That alone, should be a compelling rationale for the divestment."
2499385,72015,2014-09-16T14:16:22-04:00,"Automatic Data Processing has an impressive history of consistent earnings and dividend growth.However, based on a Gordon Growth Model projection, the shares are currently significantly overvalued.This conclusion is also supported by investigating ADP's current valuation relative to historical averages.","As the largest payroll services provider in the United States, Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) has an impressive history of consistent growth and dividend increases. However, it's current share price seems dangerously overvalued relative to historical average multiples. This article will investigate whether income investors should be attracted by ADP's 2.3% yield and future dividend growth potential or remain cautious based on its steep valuation.Automatic Data Processing operates in more than 125 countries and offers a wide variety of HR and outsourcing services to corporations and organizations. ADP's website explains that the company:From an investor's perspective, one of the best aspects of ADP is the company's consistent growth. Over the last five years, the company has averaged top and bottom line growth of approximately 8% per year. And what did the company announce in its recently completed fiscal 2014? That's right - 8% revenue growth and 9% adjusted EPS growth:(Source: ADP Q4 Presentation)The company has achieved annualized dividend growth of 9% over the last five years. As the dividend has grown slightly faster than ADP's earnings, its payout ratio has moved from 56% in 2010 to 59% this year. Analysts do anticipate a slight acceleration in bottom line growth over the coming years. The consensus estimate has ADP earning $4.33 per share in 2017. When modeling this company from a long term dividend growth perspective, a future payout ratio of closer to 55% was projected. Using these estimates and assumptions, the stock would pay approximately $2.38 in dividends per share looking three years down the road. This leads to a projected long term dividend growth rate of 8%. A discount rate of 11% is justified by the stock's lower than average beta of 0.83 and its fairly consistent earnings growth history combined with a clean balance sheet that features no meaningful long term debt.The resulting Gordon Growth Model provides a share price estimate of $69.33, which is approximately 17% below ADP's current stock price:Unfortunately for ADP's investors, an investigation into the company's current valuation metrics leads to a similar conclusion. Dividend investors might be interested to learn that ADP's stock has averaged a dividend yield of 2.8% during the previous five years. The current dividend yield of 2.3% is 18% below this historical average. The price to sales ratio indicates a similar level of overvaluation relative to the five year average. The current price to sales ratio of 3.3 is 22% above the long term average, although the firm's gross margin has actually declined from 45% to 41% during this period:(Source: Thomson Reuters)From 2009 through 2012, ADP shares traded in a fairly narrow forward P/E range of 17-20x. For a company growing at between 8-10% per year, this seemed like a reasonable valuation, given the company's strong balance sheet and impressive return on invested capital of over 20%. However, over the last two years the stock has become significantly more expensive on a forward P/E basis, now trading at nearly 24x earnings. This represents an 18% premium to the five year average and demonstrates yet another metric which indicates that ADP shares are currently overvalued:(Source: Thomson Reuters)It is difficult to say anything about Automatic Data Processing as a company. The firm offers investors a solid dividend, strong balance sheet, impressive return on invested capital and the potential for additional future earnings and dividend growth. However, based on several different types of analysis, the shares have become significantly overvalued by approximately 20% at their current price. Income investors would be wise to wait for a pullback - perhaps in the event of general market weakness - before considering ADP as a potential addition to their portfolios."
2432915,67985,2014-08-19T06:01:00-04:00,The company plans to spin-off their dealer services division in late 2014 to enhance shareholder value.The company is a leader in most markets that it participates in.The company has a long history of yearly dividend increases to reward investors.,"Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is a company that is entering an exciting period. The company has decided to spin-off their dealer services division later this year. The company currently yields about 2.4 percent and has a long history of yearly dividend increases. While no stock should be considered a ""safe stock"" without any risk, ADP shares are relatively safe in comparison to many high profile stocks and should be strongly considered as a building block of any long-term investors' portfolio. With the split of ADP into 2 companies approaching in October 2014, investors will be able to hold shares in 2 high-quality companies.BackgroundAutomatic Data Processing is the largest global provider of payroll outsourcing services based on revenue. The company offers a wide range of human resource, payroll, tax and benefits administration solutions and is also a leading provider of integrated computing solutions to automotive, heavy truck, motorcycle, marine, recreational vehicle and heavy machinery dealers. In addition to basic payroll processing, ADP sells companies other outsourced human resources services, such as payroll tax administration, retirement plan administration, health benefit administration, and workers' compensation insurance services. Additionally, ADP earns interest on funds that are temporarily held for its clients (The time between the transfer of money to ADP and the time a direct deposit is made or that checks are sent to and cashed by employees). Economic downturns pressure ADP's earnings because higher unemployment decreases demand for payroll services and falling interest rates decrease the revenue earned from interest on funds held for clients.In addition to ADP's payroll and human resources divisions, which the company refers to as ""employer services,"" the firm has two other divisions: ""professional employer organization (PEO) services,"" in which ADP handles nearly all of its clients' employment tasks, and ""dealer services,"" which provides inventory management, accounting, and related business services to automobile and other vehicle dealers in over 50 countries.Fourth quarter fiscal 2014 earningsADP reported 10 percent growth in revenues to $3.1 billion for the quarter. Pretax and net earnings from continuing operations increased 24 percent and 29 percent, respectively. As adjusted, pretax and net earnings from continuing operations increased 15 percent and 14 percent, respectively. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.60 increased 30 percent from $0.46 in the year ago quarter. As adjusted, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $0.63 increased 15 percent from adjusted $0.55 from the year ago quarter. The employer services' division revenues grew 8 percent for the fourth quarter. PEO services' revenues increased 19 percent for the fourth quarter. Dealer services' revenues grew 8 percent for the fourth quarter.For the fourth quarter, interest on funds held for clients declined $5.5 million, or 5 percent, from $100.5 million a year ago to $95.1 million, due to a decline in the average interest yield to 1.7 percent, partially offset by an increase of 7 percent in average client funds balances from $20.4 billion to $21.8 billion. The CEO of ADP characterized fourth-quarter earnings as follows:ADP provided initial fiscal year 2015 guidance of earnings per share range of $3.49 to $3.55. The week after the earnings report, the board of directors of ADP authorized the purchase of an additional 30 million shares of its common stock. This is in addition to the approximately 15.5 million shares remaining to be purchased under previous share repurchase authorizations, resulting in a total authorization of approximately 45 million shares. ADP currently has approximately 481 million common shares outstanding as of August 1, 2014.Upcoming dealer services spin-offIn April 2014, ADP announced plans to spin-off their dealer services business into an independent publicly-traded company. The transaction is structured as a tax-free spin-off of 100 percent of dealer services to ADP shareholders and is expected to be completed by October of 2014. ADP expects to receive at least $700 million in conjunction with the spin-off. The dealer services business segment provides marketing solutions to over 26,000 auto retailers, distributors and manufacturers.  The 100 percent tax-free spin-off will help ADP focus more on their core Human Capital Management (HCM) business, going forward. According to ADP management, the strong long-term growth prospects of the automotive market will provide significant growth opportunities to the dealer services business.Fifteen percent of ADP's current revenue comes from the dealer services division. The dealer services division participates in the volatile auto industry. Analysts see ADP's exit from this industry as positive given that the company will no longer participate in the cyclical auto industry. Although analysts and investors consider the spin-off plan shareholder friendly, the credit rating agencies did not agree.  Following the spin-off announcement, the Standard & Poor's service lowered ADP's credit rating from AAA to AA, primarily due to the company's plan of using the spin-off proceeds to buy back shares. Moody's Investor Service also decreased their rating to Aa1, citing lower scale and variety of ADP's product portfolio.Competitors and risksMarket penetration for the industry that ADP participates in is high. In addition, the barriers to entry are high as well since payroll outsourcing requires a sizable infrastructure to process a large number of employees. Two of ADP's most well known competitors are Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) and Equifax Inc. (NYSE:EFX). Competition is likely to become more intense as more companies that specialize in business processing outsourcing (BPO) move into human resources outsourcing and may compete in the payroll services area. Large companies that are providers of commercial electronic data processing and BPO services (including back-office operations) include the technology consulting divisions of International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ). The industry is highly competitive, mature, and characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, and changing customer preferences. Companies compete on service quality, product performance, technological innovation, and pricing. Demand is affected by the spending budget of clients, which is affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets they serve.Analysts' views and our viewsAnalysts see ADP shares as overpriced given the shares price appreciation. The shares have risen in anticipation of the perceived belief that the pending dealer services spin-off is favorable to ADP shareholders. Analysts also indicate that ADP participates in a saturated market for large-company employer solutions, and competition exists from established companies and emerging participants for small and mid-sized clients. While analysts acknowledge improving unemployment levels, and believe ADP should benefit as a result, they still see continuing underemployment. ADP is expected to perform well with improved execution and higher client retention. In addition, recovery in the job market will help the company. Finally, the company will face near-term challengers given the turbulent economic environment and increasing competition from Paychex Inc. and Equifax Inc. Analysts have ratings from mostly ""hold"" for ADP to some ""buy"" ratings with price targets from $80 to $94.We generally agree with analysts, but we would recommend that potential investors watch the shares for a pull back before initiating a full position. The shares are currently near a 52-week high with a price to earnings ratio of about 27. Earnings estimates for fiscal year 2015 (which just started) are $3.52 per share. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2016 are $3.93 per share. The forward price to earnings ratio based on fiscal 2015 earnings is about 23.35. The shares are expensive given the company's historical price to earnings ratio being in the range of the mid to upper teens. Investors should watch ADP shares and wait for the share price to fall into (or close to) the range of $63.50 to 70.50 (an 18 to 20 price to earnings ratio based on 2015 fiscal year earnings) before initiating a full position.Disclosure: The author is long ADP, HPQ, IBM.

In order to discover whether investors should buy, sell, or hold ADP, we need to look at its fundamentals to see if its current valuation is justified. To analyze its fundamentals, I will be employing the industry staple - the discounted cash flow analysis.Historical financialsSource: SEC Filings, author's own calculationsAs seen above, revenues, excluding PEO (professional employer organizations) & clients, increased from $8.3b in 2012 to $9.5b in 2014. This represents a 6.8% growth from 2012 and a 7.5% growth from 2013. Clearly, revenues, excl. PEO & clients are seeing an uptrend.Interest on funds held for clients decreased from $493m to $374m from 2012-2014. This represents a 14.7% decrease from 2012, and an 11.2% decrease from 2014. Apparently, interest on funds held for clients are seeing a downtrend. PEO revenues increased from $1.7b in 2012 to $2.2b in 2014. This represents an 11.4% increase from 2012 and a 15.1% increase from 2013.Thus, total revenue has increased from $10.5b in 2012 to $12.2b in 2014. Overall, ADP's revenue has been growing over time.Total cost of revenues has increased from $6.2b to $7.2b during the 2012-2014 period, representing 58.6%, 58.8% and 59.2% of sales in the respective years. SG&A (selling, general & administrative) expenses have increased from $2.4b in 2012 to $2.7b in 2014, representing 23.2%, 23.2% and 22.6% of sales in the respective years.Hence, total expenses have increased from $8.6b in 2012 to $9.9b in 2014. Goodwill impairment and separation costs are excluded from the total expense calculation due to the fact that they are non-recurring in nature and hence not part of core operations.Source: SEC Filings, author's own calculationsAs seen above, I have normalized EBIT, EBIAT and EBITDA, by excluding other income, as it is derived from available-for-sale and marketable securities and hence not part of core operations.EBIT has increased from $1.9b in 2012 to $2.2b in 2014, representing EBIT margins of 18.3%, 18% and 18.2% in the respective years. Provision for taxes has increased from $670m to $754m during 2012-2014, representing tax rates of 34.6%, 34.6% and 33.9% in the respective years. EBIAT has increased from $1.2b to 1.4b from 2012-2014, representing EBIAT margins of 12%, 11.8% and 12% in the respective years. EBITDA has increased from $2.2b in 2012 to $2.5b in 2014, representing EBITDA margins of 21.3%, 20.8% and 21% in the respective years.Source: SEC Filings, author's own calculationsAs seen above, depreciation & amortization has increased from $319m in 2012 to $336m in 2014, representing 3%, 2.8% and 2.8% of sales in the respective years. Deferred income taxes varied from $36m to -$50m during 2012-2014, representing 0.34%, 0.22% and -0.41% of sales in the respective years. Stock-based compensation increased from $94m in 2012 to $138m in 2014, representing 0.9%, 0.9% and 1.1% in the respective years.Thus, total adjustments to non-cash charges amount to $450m, $438m and $424m in 2012, 2013 and 2014 respectively.Source: SEC Filings, author's own calculationsAs seen above, accounts receivables has varied from -$42m, -$218m and -$204m during 2012-2014, representing -0.4%, -1.9% and -1.7% of sales in the respective years. Other assets has varied from -$72m, -$284m and -$253m during 2012-2014, representing -0.7%, -2.5% and -2.1% of sales in the respective years. Accounts payable has varied from $10m, -$10m and $10m, during 2012-2014, representing about 0.1% of sales in every year. Accrued expenses and other liabilities has increased from $135m to $253m from 2012-2014, representing, 1.3%, 1.2% and 2.1% of sales in the respective years.Source: SEC Filings, author's own calculationsAs seen above, capital expenditures has increased from -$140m to -$217m during 2012-2014, representing -1.3%, -1.5% and -1.8% of sales respectively.Hence, this gives us free cash flow of $1.6b, $1.2b and $1.4b in the years 2012, 2013 and 2014, representing 15.2%, 10.8% and 12.1% free cash flow margins in the respective years.Projected financialsNow that we have skimmed through the historical financials, we have a base to start projecting ADP's future financials.Source: SEC Filings, author's own estimatesAs seen above, I have projected that revenue, excl. PEO & clients will grow at 7.1% from 2014-2015, and that growth will slowly decline by 1% year-over-year, plateauing at 3.1% in 2019. Thus, revenues, excl. PEO & clients are projected to increase from $9.5b in 2014 to $12.2b in 2019. I have projected that interest on clients funds will decline by 12.9% from 2014-2015, with the decline slowing by 1% year-over-year, plateauing at 8.9% in 2019. Thus, interest on funds held for clients is projected to decrease from $374m in 2014 to $209m in 2019.I have projected PEO revenues to grow at 13.3% from 2014-2015, and that growth will decline by 2.5% year-over-year, plateauing at 3.3% in 2019. Thus, PEO revenues are projected to increase from $2.2b in 2014 to $3.3b in 2019. As cost of revenue is hovering at around 58.6% to 59.2%, I have assumed that they will remain flat at 58.8% in the future. Hence, cost of revenues is projected to increase from $7.2b in 2014 to $9.3b in 2019.Similarly, SG&A expenses have varied slightly between 23.2% and 22.6% of sales, thus I have assumed that they will remain flat at 23% of sales in the future. Hence, SG&A expenses are projected to increase from $2.7b in 2014 to $3.6b in 2019.Thus, EBIT is projected to increase from $2.2b in 2014 to $2.8b in 2019, representing a 18.2% margin. Provision for taxes is projected to increase from $754m in 2014 to $990m in 2019, representing a 34.4% tax rate. EBIAT is projected to increase from $1.5b in 2014 to $1.8b in 2019, representing a 11.9% margin. EBITDA is projected to increase from $2.5b in 2014 to $3.3b in 2019, representing a 21% margin.Source: SEC Filings, author's own estimatesAs seen above, depreciation & amortization has hovered between 2.8% and 3% of sales, hence I have projected it to remain at 2.9% of sales in the future. Thus, depreciation & amortization is projected to increase from $336m in 2014 to $453m in 2019. Deferred income taxes has varied from -0.41% to 0.34% of sales, hence I have projected it to remain at 0.05% of sales in the future. Thus, deferred income taxes are projected to increase from $6m in 2015 to $8m in 2019. Stock-based compensation has historically hovered between 0.9% and 1.1% of sales; hence I have projected it to remain at 1% of sales in the future. Thus, stock-based compensation expenses are projected to increase from $138m in 2014 to $152m in 2019.Thus, total adjustments to non-cash charges are projected to increase from $424m in 2014 to $613m in 2019.Accounts receivables have varied from -0.4% to -1.9% of sales, hence I have projected it to remain at -1.3% of sales in the future. Thus, accounts receivables are projected to increase from -$175m in 2015 to -$211m in 2019. Other assets have hovered between -0.7% to -2.5% of sales, hence I have projected it to remain at -1.8% of sales in the future. Thus, other assets are projected to increase from -$231m in 2015 to -$278m in 2019.Accounts payables have varied from -0.09% to 0.1% of sales, hence I have projected it to remain at 0.03% of sales in the future. Thus, accounts payable are projected to increase from $4m in 2015 to $5m in 2019. Accrued expenses & other liabilities have historically varied from 1.2% to 2.1% of sales; hence I projected them to remain at 1.5% of sales in the future. Thus, accrued expenses & other liabilities are projected to increase from $199m in 2015 to $240m in 2019.Capital expenditures have remained at about -1.3% to -1.8% of sales; hence I have projected it to remain at -1.5% of sales in the future. Thus, capital expenditures are projected to increase from -$203m in 2015 to -$245m in 2019.Hence, free cash flow is projected to increase from $1.6b in 2015 to $2b in 2019.By discounting free cash flow to its present value, projecting and discounting terminal value using a conservative perpetual growth rate of 3%, I have arrived at an implied share price of $92.51, which implies that ADP is undervalued by about 10%.ConclusionEven with conservative assumptions regarding future revenue growth, profit margins and capital expenditures, ADP still shows to be undervalued by about 10%.Source: SEC Filings, author's own estimatesAs seen above, ADP has very little debt in its capital structure and hence has a large margin of safety to raise additional debt and reduce its cost of capital and thus increase its valuation. Furthermore, given that ADP is highly rated by credit agencies, it can surely raise additional debt at very low cost.Currently, ADP pays about $11m in interest expense, which is laughably minimal compared to its free cash flow of over $1b. Hence, additional interest expense that comes with new debt should not be a problem. In addition, with its sheer cash generation ability, ADP would have no problem increasing its dividends year-over-year.In conclusion, given that ADP appears to be undervalued based on conservative assumptions, its capacity to take on new debt to reduce its cost of capital and its potent cash generation year-over-year, investors should either buy or hold ADP until the story behind its fundamentals change materially.As always, my analysis of ADP on Excel can be seen here."
1853891,21835,2013-11-21T05:46:58-05:00,,"Linked here is a detailed quantitative analysis of Automatic Data Processing Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP). Below are some highlights from the above linked analysis:Company Description: Automatic Data Processing Inc., one of the world's largest independent computing services companies, provides a broad range of data processing services.Fair Value: In calculating fair value, I consider the NPV MMA Differential Fair Value along with these four calculations of fair value, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. Avg. High Yield Price 2. 20-Year DCF Price 3. Avg. P/E Price 4. Graham NumberADP is trading at a premium to all four valuations above. The stock is trading at a 76.5% premium to its calculated fair value of $43.81. ADP did not earn any Stars in this section.Dividend Analytical Data: In this section there are three possible Stars and three key metrics, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. Free Cash Flow Payout 2. Debt To Total Capital 3. Key Metrics 4. Dividend Growth Rate 5. Years of Div. Growth 6. Rolling 4-yr Div. > 15%ADP earned one Star in this section for 2.) above. The stock earned a Star as a result of its most recent Debt to Total Capital being less than 45%. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1974 and has increased its dividend payments for 37 consecutive years.Dividend Income vs. MMA: Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account (MMA) or Treasury bond? This section compares the earning ability of this stock with a high yield MMA. Two items are considered in this section, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. NPV MMA Diff. 2. Years to > MMAThe NPV MMA Diff. of the $273 is below the $500 target I look for in a stock that has increased dividends as long as ADP has. If ADP grows its dividend at 7.3% per year, it will take 7 years to equal a MMA yielding an estimated 20-year average rate of 3.41%.Memberships and Peers: ADP is a member of the S&P 500, a Dividend Aristocrat, a member of the Broad Dividend Achievers™ Index and a Dividend Champion. The company's peer group includes: Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) with a 3.2% yield, Insperity, Inc. (NYSE:NSP) with a 2.0% yield and Convergys Corporation (NYSE:CVG) with a 1.2% yield.Conclusion: ADP did not earn any Stars in the Fair Value section, earned one Star in the Dividend Analytical Data section and did not earn any Stars in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a total of one Star. This quantitatively ranks ADP as a 1-Star Very Weak stock.Using my D4L-PreScreen.xls model, I determined the share price would need to decrease to $66.71 before ADP's NPV MMA Differential increased to the $500 minimum that I look for in a stock with 37 years of consecutive dividend increases. At that price the stock would yield 2.6%.Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the target $500 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 8.7%. This dividend growth rate is higher than the 7.3% used in this analysis, thus providing no margin of safety. ADP has a risk rating of 1.75 which classifies it as a Medium risk stock.As the industry leader ADP enjoys advantages of scale, a respected brand and protected by high customer switching costs. The company should see its market grow since payroll outsourcing is currently under-utilized in the small- and medium-sized businesses and overseas. Significant growth opportunities exist as ADP moves toward a total HR service provider beyond its core payroll product. Near term, weakness in Europe, particularly the auto market, and low interest rates will limit ADP's margins.Financially, the company has a strong balance sheet, with no debt, and a recurring revenue stream generating steady cash flows. However, it is trading significantly above calculated fair value of $43.81, so for now I will wait before increasing my position.Full Disclosure: At the time of this writing, I was long in ADP (0.5% of my Dividend Growth Portfolio).

(NASDAQ:ADP) fares in ModernGraham's opinion, based on an updated and modernized version of Benjamin Graham's requirements of defensive and enterprising investors from The Intelligent Investor:Defensive and Enterprising Investor Tests (What is the significance of these tests, and what is PEmg ratio?):Defensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 4/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 3/5Valuation Summary (Explanation of the ModernGraham Valuation Model)Key Data:Balance Sheet - 9/30/2013Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - Modern GrahamConclusion:Automatic Data Processing fails to qualify for either the Defensive Investor or the Enterprising Investor. The company currently trades at a high PEmg ratio and a high PB ratio, but the most significant issue with the company is the level of current liabilities. Presently, the company has more current liabilities than current assets, leading to disqualification from contention for the Enterprising Investor. While many people claim that the current ratio is not as important today, the fact remains that a company with a strong current ratio is in a better financial position than a company with a poor current ratio. As a result, a poor current ratio indicates increased risk, which Intelligent Investors seek to avoid when possible. We are looking for low-risk, high-reward opportunities, so any increased level of risk makes us wary. As for the valuation, the company has grown EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $2.20 in 2009 to an estimated $2.77 for 2014. This is a very moderate level of growth, and in stark contrast to the 9.73% growth rate implied by the market at this time. Consequently, the market's price is not supported by historical earnings performance and the company appears to be overvalued.Disclaimer: The author did not hold a position in Automatic Data Processing (ADP) at the time of publication and had no intention of entering into a position within the next 72 hours."
1933571,25289,2014-01-08T02:50:38-05:00,,"In this article, I will feature one tech stock that has seen intensive insider selling during the last 30 days. Intensive insider selling can be defined by the following three criteria:Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) provides technology-based outsourcing solutions to employers and vehicle retailers and manufacturers worldwide.Insider selling during the last 30 daysHere is a table of Automatic Data Processing's insider-trading activity during the last 30 days by insider.There have been 230,694 shares sold by insiders during the last 30 days. All these shares were sold pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan.SEC Rule 10b5-1 is a regulation enacted by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2000. The SEC states that Rule 10b5-1 was enacted in order to resolve an unsettled issue over the definition of insider trading, which is prohibited by SEC Rule 10b-5. After Rule 10b5-1 was enacted, the SEC staff publicly took the position that canceling a planned trade made under the safe harbor does not constitute insider trading, even if the person was aware of the inside information when canceling the trade. This staff interpretation raises the possibility that executives can exploit this safe harbor by entering into 10b5-1 trading plans before they have inside information while retaining the option to later cancel those plans based on inside information.For example, a CEO of a company could call a broker on January 1 and enter into a plan to sell a particular quantity of shares of his company's stock on March 1, find out terrible news about his company on February 1 that will not become public until April 1, and then go forward with the March 1 sale anyway, saving himself from losing money when the bad news becomes public. Under the terms of Rule 10b5-1(b) this is insider trading because the CEO ""was aware"" of the inside information when he made the trade. But he can assert an affirmative defense under Rule 10b5-1(c), because he planned the trade before he learned the inside information.In general, it is a safer way for an insider to sell shares pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan than without it.Insider selling by calendar monthHere is a table of Automatic Data Processing's insider-trading activity by calendar month.There have been 453,354 shares sold, and there have been zero shares purchased by insiders since January 2013.

1662692,53342,2013-08-28T15:14:13-04:00,,"The CompanyAutomatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) is a $34.9 billion (Large Cap) global company and one of the largest providers of business outsourcing and human resource management solutions. A summary of its services are listed on its web site as a ""wide range of human resource, payroll, talent management, tax and benefits administration solutions from a single source, and helps clients comply with regulatory and legislative changes, such as the Affordable Care Act."" ADP also provides integrated computing solutions to vehicle dealers of all types and sizes. It is one of four U.S. companies that has a AAA credit rating from S&P--better than the U.S. government--, and it consistently out performs the S&P 500 index as well as increases its dividends regularly.ADP Dividend data by YChartsRecent Activity of CompanyAccording to Yahoo Finance, ADP's share price increased 23.53% in the previous 52 weeks with a price range between $52.04 and an all-time high of $73.83 that was reached on July 22, 2013. It is currently selling at $72.03 (August 26, 2013). ADP has recently released its 2013 full year financial statements, and in my opinion its fundamentals do not support the spectacular rise in the price of its shares. The following is a list of red flags that lead me to believe that ADP's share price is selling at a substantial premium and that a correction is likely.(1) Although ADP's revenue increased by 6.5%, its net profit after taxes actually decreased from $1.380 billion to $1.364 billion (-1%), and its total operating income and cash flow from operations also decreased. ADP's management blamed the low interest rate environment for the decrease in earnings. ADP is a payroll company, and it therefore requires its clients to deposit money with them to make the payroll payments. ADP invests the deposits until they are used and that is a high profit margin item. According to ADP the low interest rates caused a decrease in this revenue stream in the amount of $72.4 million. Management also forecasted that they expect this revenue decline to continue in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014. The chart below shows ADP's erratic and declining cash flow from operations as compared to its much smaller competitor's (Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) flat trend.ADP Cash from Operations TTM data by YChartsAccording to my calculations, ADP's average four year earnings growth is 2.5%, which included the 2013 decrease. ADP forecasted 7% revenue growth for 2014. Revenue growth in 2013 was 6.5%.(2) According to my calculations, ADP's return on its share price based on its 2013 earning was 3.91%. Its five year average rate of return is 8%. I make this calculation by simply dividing the earnings per share by the current price of the security. I also do a similar calculation using the cash flow from operations after deducting capital expenses. The return using cash flow was 3.71%. Return on the current value of the security is important because from it you can determine whether the company is beating the rate of inflation, and by how much, as well as its relation to yields on U.S. Treasuries. The current inflation rate is 2% and the yield on a 10-year US Treasury is 2.73%. This means that ADP's real rate of return is only 1.91% after adjusting for inflation, and its return is only 1.18% higher than a risk free 10-year US Treasury.(3) According to my calculations, ADP's four year average earnings growth is only .7%.(4) ADP's current PE of 25 is at the high end of its historical range. According to my calculations its average PE over the last five years is 18.5. Below is a graph showing the PEs of ADP's and PAYX's over the last five years.ADP PE Ratio TTM data by YCharts(5) According to my calculations, at a 5% earnings growth rate it will take more than ten years before ADP's projected future earning are equal to its present market capitalization of $39.9 Billion.All of the above factors are indicators that tell me the share price of ADP is selling at a premium.ValuationIn analyzing a stock price I also like to use a present value of future earnings model to corroborate my other findings. For ADP I projected ten years of future earnings using a 6% growth rate. ADP's four year average growth rate is only .7%, but I nevertheless used the higher rate for the reason that I believe the last four years may have been somewhat skewed by the slow recovery from the recession, and also I took into consideration ADP's forecasts for revenue growth, as well as its AAA credit rating and strong balance sheet. The total projected earnings came to $42.39. I then calculated the present value of that figure using a 5% discount rate which I felt was reasonable in today's low interest environment. The result was a present value of $26.02. In order to get a range I then did a present value calculation using a 10% discount rate. That calculation showed a present value of $16.34. I then repeated the calculation using cash flow from operations after deducting capital expenses and came up with a range from $15.15 to $24.12. I used numerous variations because I realize that present value results can change substantially by simply applying small manipulations in a somewhat arbitrary discount rate. The ADP present value computations verify quite clearly that its shares are selling at a premium.SummaryAs a human resource and payroll company, ADP does well when the economy does well. Its performance is particularly sensitive to the overall employment environment. The recovery of the economy from the recession (especially unemployment) has been slow but steady, and we see this in ADP's revenue growth that has been steady but not spectacular. ADP's recent increase in stock price however, has been spectacular, and in my opinion it has simply outpaced the fundamentals of the company, thus making its share price due for a substantial correction. There are a number of economic and political catalysts coming up in the near future that could trigger such a correction to ADP as well as the entire market. To name a few; the turmoil in Syria and Egypt, the sequester, the future of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve, the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, and the debt ceiling crisis. Any one of these events could be the catalyst, as well as a black swan event. I therefore am of the opinion that this is a good time for holders of the stock to take some profits.Disclosure: I am long ADP. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1567602,23478,2013-07-24T11:55:00-04:00,,"By Jeff BaileyAutomatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is undoubtedly a fabulous company, growing year-after-year, maintaining its AAA credit rating, and slowly-but-steadily expanding the work it does for companies beyond payroll to encompass all things related to personnel.But, as we've seen more dramatically with Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV) and furniture component maker Leggett & Platt (NYSE:LEG), it's tough to be a great company in a crummy industry.And the HR-outsourcing business has, domestically at least, one giant problem: American companies will do just about anything to avoid adding to their employee counts. With each recession, businesses learn how to be more productive. They come out of downturns leaner and determined to remain that way. As a long-term trend, it's a marvelous productivity story, though one that has left millions of lower-skilled workers behind:(Click to enlarge)US Employment data by YChartsThat's right, on a not-quite-150% increase in workforce, U.S. corporate profits since 1948 are up more than 7,500%; $1.75 trillion in profits churned out using 144 million domestic workers.As an aside, ADP's recent score on worker productivity is somewhat less impressive: Its 57,000 workers (as of June 30, 2012) brought in $10.7 billion in revenue, or about $187,000 per worker; 10 years earlier, with 40,000 employees at June 30, 2002, ADP had revenue for that year of $7.0 billion, or roughly $175,000 per employee. That's a lot of elbow grease in each dollar of sales, especially compared to technology companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).If ADP earned a tiny fee for each dollar of U.S. corporate profits, or for each productivity-enhancing machine installed -- rather than for processing payroll and other services related to headcount -- it would be a fabulous growth vehicle. But its fortunes are tied to employment, as are those of companies like Manpower (NYSE:MAN).Because of ADP's long record of stellar financial results, increasing market share and its bulletproof balance sheet, its shares command a premium PE ratio. ADP expects to report revenue growth of 6%-to-7% for the fiscal year ended June 30, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations growth in the same range. Solid performance, but its valuation puts it in the company of stocks like Google, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Davita (NYSE:DVA) and Nike (NYSE:NKE).(Click to enlarge)ADP PE Ratio TTM data by YChartsThose companies have enjoyed far more rapid sales growth over the past decade (though that's certainly no guarantee of growth going forward).(Click to enlarge)ADP Revenue TTM data by YChartsADP's main business, called Employer Services (and including the well-known payroll service) accounts for nearly three quarters of revenue and that business's revenue is in turn nearly 80% domestic. That makes sense. ADP is all hooked up with 7,000 government bodies, from very local to Uncle Sam, in the U.S., and adding each additional customer represents a lower cost than the last one, allowing it to price aggressively to win customers and still maintain a lush profit margin.(Click to enlarge)ADP Profit Margin Quarterly data by YChartsADP holds employers' payroll money for a very short time before the checks are deposited, or automatic deposits are effective, and that client money in total is in the $20 billion-or-so range. Interest earned on those funds goes to ADP, a nice perk of the business. But with interest rates so low, its return on those funds has fallen, to 2.8% in fiscal 2012 from 3.6% as recently as fiscal 2010. ADP expects to report interest on client funds, for the year ended June 30, fell 15% to $420 million. Rising interest rates would help.(Click to enlarge)ADP Shares Outstanding data by YChartsInvestors also like ADP because it has steadily reduced its shares outstanding through buybacks, and upped its dividend regularly. The dividend yield of 2.45% is no great shakes, but dividend growth is perhaps a better goal in choosing stocks. To keep the dividend growing, ADP has upped its payout ratio, and now it would seem future dividend growth is more dependent on profit increases.(Click to enlarge)ADP Payout Ratio TTM data by YChartsLinkedIn (LNKD), of course, is essentially in the HR business, too. But as an entirely new business, it has years or growth ahead. ADP is a more mature business, and the hire-only-as-absolutely-needed mindset of major U.S. and international companies could significantly limit its future growth.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1812392,38491,2013-11-06T13:18:47-05:00,,"Crazy as it sounds, we can learn everything we need to know about dividend investing from hockey legend, Wayne Gretzky.He racked up 61 NHL records by the time he retired, including the most goals scored, by doing one thing remarkably well: skating to where the puck was going, not where it was.As dividend investors, we need to do the exact same thing to score. We need to ""skate"" to companies with the ability to keep growing their dividends, instead of companies with the highest current yields.If you don't believe me, believe the data.Dividend Growers Still King of the MarketIn a runaway bull market, you might think that dividend stocks would fail to keep up. Think again.So far this year, the S&P 500 Index is up a stout 23.52%. Yet the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index is actually up more, rising 24.5% in 2013.Mind you, these aren't any old dividend payers. You'll recall, Dividend Aristocrats are companies that have increased their dividends every year for at least 20 years.So we're talking about dividend growers - not simply dividend payers - performing best in 2013.This isn't some fluke, either. As I've shared before, dividend growers always perform best.Here's the latest proof: After slicing and dicing the data from 1972 through the second quarter of 2013, Ned Davis Research found that dividend growers return an average of 9.8% per year. That compares to a return of only 7.3% per year for straightforward dividend payers.Much like how Gretzky always skated ahead of the puck, if we want to enjoy the most profits, we need to invest ahead of any imminent dividend hikes. That way, we immediately benefit from the increased payout. It's like an instant raise.And that's where Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) comes in…The Next Dividend Hike Could Come Any Day NowThis payroll processing company has increased its dividend payment for 38 years in a row.Based on the latest quarterly results, which included a 9% increase in profits - and the firm's reasonable dividend payout ratio of 59% - there's very little doubt that another increase is in store.Now, since the announcement of a hike often comes in November, the company's 39th increase could be announced any day now. Based on last year's 10% dividend increase, the current yield on the stock could soon top 2.5%.Naturally, that's not the only reason I consider the stock a smart investment. Here are three others:~ Rock-Solid Balance Sheet: Unlike the Federal Reserve or the U.S. Government, ADP sports a rock-solid balance sheet, fortified by almost $1.6 billion in cash.~ Steady Demand: ADP is the largest human resources services company in the world. Unless you think the economy is going to collapse to zero, literally, ADP is going to enjoy steady demand for its services for the foreseeable future. That means it'll be able to maintain (and keep increasing) its dividend.~ Built-in Inflation Hedge: At some point, inflation is going to rear its ugly head again. Thankfully, ADP provides a built-in hedge. Its core business involves collecting cash from its customers and then issuing paychecks, making deposits in retirement accounts and transferring funds to pay taxes (over $1 trillion in total each year). Although it doesn't hold on to these funds for a long time, it does get to keep any interest it earns. The interest adds up, too, accounting for more than 30% of the company's pre-tax profits in some years. That means as interest rates rise to keep pace with inflation, so, too, will the income ADP earns in this manner.Bottom line: We need to anticipate dividend growth to outperform the market. And you won't find a safer, more compelling opportunity to do so in the coming weeks than ADP.

1645022,24491,2013-08-19T16:29:02-04:00,,"Payroll processing firm Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) announced decent fourth quarter results. Revenue increased 7% year-over-year to $2.8 billion, roughly in-line with consensus estimates. Earnings were a penny shy of consensus expectations, increasing 6% year-over-year to $0.55.ADP benefits greatly from increased employment, particularly since the firm is synonymous with payroll processing and management. Revenue from its 'Employer Services' division grew 8% year-over-year during the quarter to $2 billion. Management noted that growth was organically driven, as the firm didn't make many acquisitions. Bookings increased at a double-digit pace during the fourth quarter, and we saw its pretax operating margins jump 120 basis points year-over-year. Client retention for the segment was robust during 2013 at 91.3% (40 basis points higher than 2012).ADP's 'Professional Employer Organization Services (NYSE:PEO)' division experienced year-over-year revenue growth of 11% to $487 million as more organizations opted to outsource HR management. We're huge fans of this business, particularly in the event that small business formation accelerates. The value-add for PEO services is huge, especially since it allows busy owners to focus on business-centered operations rather than the often tedious day-to-day back office tasks. Pretax operating margins in the segment increased 50 basis points year-over-year as cost growth slowed.The one downside during the quarter came from 'Interest Held on Funds Held for Clients'. As a payroll processor, ADP acts as the middleman between employers and employees, so it holds funds between pay periods. Historically, this has been a nice high-margin source of revenue for ADP, but the prevailing low interest rate environment has pressured this source of earnings. Interest income fell 16% year-over-year to $100 million during the fourth quarter and declined 15% for the full-year to $421 million. Still, a higher interest rate environment could provide a nice boost to segment earnings.Looking ahead, ADP gave relatively strong fiscal year 2014 guidance. Sales are expected to increase 7% to $12.1 billion, driving earnings growth of 8%-10% and implying earnings per share of $3.12-3.18 for the fiscal year.Valuentum's TakeADP is easily the largest HR/payroll outsourcer, dwarfing competitors like Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) and Insperity (NYSE:NSP). Still, the smaller competitors don't appear to be growing earnings at a faster clip. Paychex expects service revenue to advance 5%-6% and net income to grow 8%-9% in its fiscal year 2014 (ending May 2014), while Insperity's adjusted net income ($19.3 million) was roughly flat year-over-year over the first six months of its 2013 fiscal year.

1475261,48641,2013-06-02T09:24:28-04:00,,"Investors who want to use their stock portfolios to build long-term wealth need to include dividend stocks that will provide them with a reliable stream of income. One of the most recommended dividend stocks is Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ: ADP). If you haven't yet heard of this company, it's about time for you to become familiar with it.A Good Dividend StockFounded in 1949, ADP is a pioneer in outsourced payroll processing services but it currently offers a wide variety of business outsourcing solutions. However, it is best known for its payroll and tax filing services, and its clients include some of the biggest companies in the world. In the Computer and Data Services category, it is Most Admired Company in America. It has also won AAA rankings from both Standard & Poor's and Moody's, the only IT services company to achieve this distinction.Investors looking for dividend stocks should know that ADP is one of the so-called Dividend Aristocrats; companies that have made this list have increased their dividend payouts to shareholders annually for at least twenty five years. The companies that make this list include some of the most famous brands in the world, including Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), 3M (NYSE:MMM), McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ).A quick overview of ADP's dividend statistics reveals that it has increased dividends for 38 consecutive years; it has a relatively high payout ratio of 56%, meaning that of every dollar in earnings, $0.56 is paid out in dividends, and 2.7% of its share price is paid out in dividends. ADP's current payout is $1.74 on an annual basis or $0.435 quarterly. The company last increased dividends in December 2012, and investors who jump in now will likely have to wait for six months or more before they enjoy an increase in payouts. But it is expected that as the general economy continues to improve and business activity increases, ADP will continue to increase its dividends.Apart from these dividend stats, there are many other things to recommend about ADP. In its most recent earnings report for the third quarter of 2013, the company reported earnings per share of $0.99, an increase of nearly nine percent from the same quarter a year ago. Its revenue for the period grew to $2.2 billion, a 7% increase, while its net earnings reached $482.7 million. At the end of the quarter under review, the company held cash and cash equivalents worth $1.68 billion, a 17% increase. ADP's long-term debt, meanwhile, was $15.3 million.Its outlook for FY 2013 was optimistic as the company revised its guidance figures upward. From an original revenue growth outlook of 5% to 7%, the figures were revised to 6% to 7%. Estimates of earnings growth were also reworked upward, from 5% to 7% to 6% to 7%. Its various divisions were also expected to experience revenue growth, with PEO services seeing the highest growth of 12%, followed by Dealer Services, an 8% to 9% increase, and Employer Services, 7%.Apart from the fundamentals, it is also worth considering some of the intangibles that could affect a company's future performance. One of these is the leadership of a company, since the type of corporate culture he or she creates also impacts on the company's bottom line. Companies that had stressed employee satisfaction in the workplace generally had higher revenue increases and better total returns. In a ranking of the top CEOs conducted by Glassdoor, a site that monitors employee sentiment, ADP CEO Carlos Rodriguez was ranked 11th, with some 94% of employees surveyed saying they approved of his performance.However, one factor that could affect ADP's financial performance in the coming years is increased competition in the business outsourcing sector. Although ADP was able to co-exist with rival Paychex (NASDAQ: PAYX), since the two companies targeted different market sectors, a new company, Intuit (NASDAQ: INTU), has managed to win a share of the lucrative small-business sector with its popular Turbo Tax and QuickBooks business software. While this directly affects Paychex, whose market is small and medium-sized businesses, ADP may also find itself challenged by Intuit in the future as it aims to get a bigger share of the markets.The Bottom LineDividends are key for investors to build their wealth over the long term, since these provide capital that they can reinvest further to develop their portfolio holdings. Automatic Data Processing fits all the criteria of a good dividend stock, including healthy financials, a long history of increasing its dividends as well as of paying dividends to investors on a regular basis, and a sensible dividend payout ratio that does not overwhelm earnings. And its current share price of $69.81 has increased by some 34% from last year. Hence, defensive investors who want a safe stock to add to their portfolio should definitely buy into Automatic Data Processing.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Some of the best companies are ones you have contact with on a regular basis but do not think twice about. Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is a company many Americans know of but might not consider as an investment.ADP started in 1949 as a manual payroll services company. ADP went public in 1961. It is one of only four companies with a triple-A rating by both Standard & Poor's and Moody's. Currently, ADP has generated $10.73 billion in revenues for the past 12 months. ADP has $40,166,300,000 in assets and $33,605,200,000 in liabilities. This is far from being categorized as being a conservatively financed company, according to Graham. However, since ADP is only one of four companies with a triple-A credit rating, there really is no concern here.ADP has increased its dividend since 1975. For 38 years, ADP has not just paid a dividend but has increased it on an annual basis. Currently, the dividend is $1.74 at a yield of 2.5%. The payout ratio is 56%. With earnings at $2.94, its P/E should place the price at $58.80. The Graham Number sits at $29.92. The earnings for the past seven years are as follows: ADP has a steady share buyback program. It also has reduced its outstanding shares by 14.5% over the past 20 years. This is comparable to Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), the king of long-term share buybacks. In 2012, ADP CFO Christopher Reidy had this to say to the Wall Street Journal about the company's share buyback program:ADP is one of those companies that have a large moat. They are the company others go to when they need payroll solutions. Even though there was an almost catastrophic recession, ADP was still able to maintain earnings and quickly grow them as the economy strengthens. ADP publishes a monthly jobs report, where it reports an increase or decrease in non-farm jobs in the private sector.ConclusionsI like ADP; it is the payroll company and has been so for quite some time. ADP should be on any long-term dividend investor's list. At current prices, the company is overbought for my tastes. Based on the current valuations, I'd like to see the price come down to around $60.00 before opening a position, perhaps selling some puts.I would categorize this as a forever stock, as it pays increasing dividends for almost 40 years. It has a moat and is considered the authority in payroll services. The recession did not affect the company's earnings, which means this is a very defensive stock. If you are interested in ADP, make sure you wait for a pullback as last thing you want is to pay too much for any stock.Disclosure: I am long IBM, KO, MPC, WMT.

1311561,46731,2013-04-01T10:21:12-04:00,,"An OverviewAutomatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) provides business outsourcing services. These services include processing payroll, human resource information, and tax and benefits administration, among others. They collect for these services, and also earn interest on funds held for their clients. This portion of the business is very similar to ADP's closest publicly traded competitor, Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) which I looked at for its return prospects in an earlier article.ADP has two other main business segments as well. Their Professional Employer Organization segment places employees at various companies that are dual-employed by ADP and their client. This serves as a sort of in-house outsourcing for their clients. Their other main business segment is Dealer Services, which offers systems, marketing, and management assistance to auto, truck, marine, and heavy equipment dealers. (Company description provided at Yahoo! Finance)ADP recently hit both a 52-week high and a new all-time high and currently sells at 20X forward earnings estimates (per Morningstar). ADP is a stock I currently own, and I am wondering if its future return prospects still meet my requirements for total return. I only buy stocks that offer an attractive total return profile of 9-11% annually over the next 5 years. Obviously you want stocks that will continue to gain after 5 years, but trying to do any analysis more than 5 years out includes more guessing than I am willing to do. I view ADP as being of the highest quality, so my threshold for buying would be the lower 9% hurdle.So where does ADP need to be 5 years from now to earn 9% annually? The short answer: $88.22/shareNow, let's take a brief glance at how that number is calculated:Looking forward, we can expect the next full year's worth of dividends to get 2.7% of the year 1 return. That leaves the stock price to make up for the other 6.3% in year 1. Given ADP's history of increasing their dividends (see table provided below), it is reasonable to assume that the dividend will be able to, at a minimum, grow at the same pace as the stock price over the next 5 years. For this reason, we will assume that these ratios will hold, with ADP's dividend providing 2.7% of the annual return, and the stock price needing to make up the remaining 6.3% each year.$65/share * (1.063) ^5 = $88.22/shareWe know what share price we need 5 years from now to earn our 9% annually, now let's figure out what we would expect the share price to be. With a company as stable as ADP, we should be able to make a fairly accurate calculation of what the company's earnings will be five years from now. Taking into account the ongoing share buybacks, we should then be able to predict the share count in that year as well and get our earnings per share number. Let's start the process of figuring out what ADP's 2018 earnings will be. Here is a quick table showing five years of some popular metrics taken from the 2012 Annual Report.(all numbers in millions except Basic Earnings per Share)If this is all the data I had, I would not have a shot at analyzing this company. Fortunately for all of us, though, there is another 100+ pages worth of data to analyze offered up in each annual report.Here is a table of what I view to be the key metrics for ADP's business, broken down and rearranged into segments as I feel appropriate. Information was pulled from the 2010 and 2012 Annual Reports (form 10-K) for ADP. All numbers were either listed in Financial Statements, Analysis of the Financial Statements, or were calculated using numbers listed in one or both of these sections.(Source: Nick Eerkes - Article Author, all numbers in millions USD except earnings per Diluted Share and Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding-Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding is in millions)Fiscal 2012 numbers are adjusted to remove the effects of the sale of assets related to rights and obligations to resell a third-party expense management platform. Fiscal 2009 and 2010 numbers are adjusted to reverse the effects of favorable tax rulings of 120 million and 12.2 million, respectively, in those years. Since the value of these two occasions was received in these years, but was not the result of business operations in those years, I thought it best to reverse it out.Also of note, I assigned $0 of operating and SG&A (Sales, General, and Administrative) expense to the income earned on Corporate Investments, and to the income earned on Client Funds Held. The reasoning for this is simple. The costs associated with earning extra income off of your corporate investments are a reality for all large, publicly traded companies. Investing Client Funds Held is just an extension of that. Furthermore, there is little to no incremental cost to investing each additional dollar. It is my opinion that to try and allocate operating and SG&A expenses to this portion of this business would create more distortions than simply allocating it all as a cost of operations.So what was the point of dissecting the income statements and balance sheets of the last 5 years, flushing out the undesirable portions, and then reassembling them in this way? Well, now the numbers are ""cleansed"" and we can really look at what trends are happening in the underlying business and try and project out 5 more years of business operations. When we take into account the timing of their fiscal years in relation to the date of our analysis, we will need 6 more years of projections to get us to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, are best proxy for five years from now.The ProjectionsSo what are these numbers going to be over the next 6 fiscal years? Let's take them one at a time.Segment Earnings DataCombined Operating Segment Revenues:Here is a table focusing in just on Combined Segment Revenue Growth over the last five fiscal years.(Revenues in millions USD)Here is another table looking at Revenue growth by region. This is not shown in constant currencies, nor does it break out revenue into the segments I have, but I think it still sheds some light on where growth is coming from.(all non-percentage numbers in millions USD, Other includes South America, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia)Revenue growth for ADP comes from a variety of sources. A growing population (more importantly a growing workforce) can lead to more business clients and more employee checks per business client. Taking market share from competitors, buying smaller competitors, and expanding operations into an untapped market also grows this revenue. Additionally, ADP is able to raise prices at a rate equal to or above inflation given their sticky relationship with their customers.Looking at the revenue growth trends, I would assume that the 2011 numbers had some snapback effect locked in from a down 2010, and some of this played out still in 2012. When you factor in a strengthening US and World growth outlook, as well as a slowly shifting revenue base to the faster growing parts of the world, I would peg a conservative yet realistic Revenue growth estimate for the next 6 years at 8% per year.Segment Pretax Earnings Margin:(all non-percentage number in millions USD)The above table shows the trend for this margin over the last 5 years. I expect this number to move around a little over time, but in the end to average around the 14.4% experience in 2012. For this reason, and since 2012 is arguably the most similar operating year to what we would expect over the next five years, 14.4% is the margin I will use for the Segment Pretax Earnings Margin over the next 6 years.Segment Earnings before Taxes:Using the projections I was able to come to above over the next five years, with 2012 as a base, this table shows what I would expect from this segment of the business over the coming 6 years.(all non-percentage numbers in millions USD)Investments of CFH Earnings DataAverage Client Funds Held:Here is a table focusing in just on Average Client Funds Held Growth over the last 5 fiscal years.(all non-percentage numbers in millions USD)It is difficult to predict changes in this metric from this data alone. Calling on my experience from writing an article on Paychex (link earlier in article), and what I know about the business model as a whole, I can say with reasonable certainty that Average Client Funds Held will grow roughly in line with payroll services growth. However, because of the business mix at ADP, a degree of uncertainty is added. Due to the lack of clarity, I am prompted to estimate lower, and therefore be more conservative. Therefore, I will use a 5% growth rate for Average Client Funds Held over the next 6 years.% Earned on CFH:This number is the real crapshoot. ADP holds both short-term and intermediate-term (3-5 years) bonds and has them laddered, so changes in interest rates have an immediate effect on reinvested bonds, but is diluted by the remainder of the portfolio. Over the next 5 years, I would expect interest rates to head back towards where they were in 2008, without quite reaching those levels. The % earned on CFH would remain below that until the portfolio fully cycled into higher yielding assets. I view my guess as good as any other so I will use a conservative estimate of 2.5%, 2.5%, 2.7%, 3%, 3.3%, and 3.6% for the fiscal years 2013-18.Interest Earned on CFH:With my projections for Average Client Funds Held and % Earned on CFH here is the table for what I would expect the Interest Earned on CFH to be through 2018.(all non-percentage numbers in millions USD)Corporate Investments Earnings DataBefore beginning projections there are some items worth noting. ADP carries a much larger amount of Corporate Investments than their closest comparative company Paychex. From what I can surmise, the reason they do this is two-fold. First, having a large amount of additional corporate investments can smooth out the variances in Client Funds Held (CFH) over a given year, and therefore mean less buying and selling as a percentage of the portfolio to meet cash distribution needs. Second, by having their own capital invested alongside the money invested from CFH, they can invest in securities with a slightly higher risk profile, and thus earn higher interest rates. This is much like how a bank operates. For this reason, I also find it appropriate to deduct interest expense from these earnings. Now let's get back to projections.Corporate InvestmentsLet's look at the balance of Corporate Investments over the last five years, here is a table showing the year-over-year change.(all non-percentage numbers in millions USD)There are so many factors that go into this number including timing of acquisitions, disposal of assets, share buyback programs, changes in dividend policy, etc. For simplicity, let's assume that ADP will grow Corporate Investments at a rate to match Client Funds Held growth, thus keeping the bank-like capital buffer that I referenced above. So, for the next 6 fiscal years: 5% annually.Interest Expense and Net Corporate Investment Income:As can be seen in the earlier table, over the last five years, the interest expense for ADP appears to be on a collision course with zero. This is a result of ADP paying back its long-term debt without issuing any new long-term debt. The base case would be to expect this to continue, and just project interest expense as 0 for our time period. This then removes the need to have different line items for Income from Corporate Investments and Net Corporate Investment Income as well.% Earned on Corporate Investments:Once again, this number is the real crapshoot. Look under Investments of CFH Earnings Data specifically at % Earned on CFH for more analysis. I will use a conservative estimate of 2.2%, 2.2%, 2.4%, 2.7%, 3%, and 3.3% for the fiscal years 2013-18. This is an annual .3% discount from my % Earned on CFH projections, as there seems to be a fairly consistently lower earnings yield on Corporate Investments than CFH over the previous five years. This can be explained by ADP's desire for a high-quality bank-like buffer.Income from Corporate Investments:Using our projections above, we can calculate our expectations for Income from Corporate Investments over the next 6 fiscal years. Here is a table with the projections, note the two data points that have been omitted for reasons listed above under: Interest Expense and Net Corporate Investment Income.(all non-percentage numbers in millions USD)Overall ProfitabilityPre-Tax Earnings from Cont. Operations:This number is just a combination of Pre-Tax Earnings from the three segments I have outlined. It is included in the table under Net Earnings.Overall Pretax Margin:This number is a calculated number, therefore no projection is needed. It is calculated and included in the table under Net Earnings.Effective Tax Rate %:The table below shows the effective tax rates, as calculated by me (netting out tax benefits and asset disposals) over the last five years.There appears to be a downward trend, I believe this to be a result of a sales mix shift out of the United States and into lower tax portions of the world. I am not comfortable projecting this to continue at the rate we have seen, but I do think it will continue. Additionally, since 2012 is our lowest year, the chances that this is an outlier and that would throw off both trend and starting point are quite high. This uncertainty pushes me towards being conservative in my estimates. Therefore, I will account for a drop of .1% per year over the next 6 fiscal years, but will use 35% as my starting point, rather than 34.5%.Provision for Income Taxes:This number is a calculated number, therefore no projection is needed. It is calculated and included in the table under Net Earnings.Net Earnings:(all non-percentage numbers in millions USD)Earnings Per ShareDiluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding:Here is a table showing the effects stock buybacks have had on the share count over the last 5 years.(share numbers in millions)Share buybacks have been ongoing over the last 5 fiscal years, with a slowdown in the heart of the economic crisis. I have every reason to expect ADP to continue to retire around 1% of shares outstanding every year. The earnings that I have projected out cover this along with the dividend and additional investments needed to grow the business. Simple enough, I will assume a 1% reduction in share count each year for the next 6 fiscal years. This is shown in the final table below.Earnings per Diluted Share:This number is a calculated number, therefore no projection is needed. It is calculated and included below in the final table under Consolidated Projections.Consolidated Projections(Source: Nick Eerkes - Article Author, all numbers in millions USD except earnings per Diluted Share and Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding-Diluted Weighted Average Shares Outstanding is in millions)The ConclusionWith a final Earnings Per Diluted Share number of $4.76, what type of earnings multiple would be required to reach the $88.22/share stock price for my Total Return requirements. Simple enough:$88.22/share / $4.76 share price = 18.5X earningsGiven the quality of the company we are looking at, this seems like a reasonable multiple. Another way of looking at it is with an earnings multiple of 20X, we would expect a share price of $95.20, about 8% higher than the $88.22 we projected as a minimum price.It looks like this stock meets my total return requirements. ADP will remain safely tucked away in my portfolio for the time being.Disclosure: I am long ADP, PAYX. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

That is why we created a forward-looking assessment of dividend safety in our innovative, predictive dividend-cut indicator, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. In this article, let's evaluate the investment merits of Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), as well as its dividend under this unique but yet very straightforward framework.Investment Highlights• Automatic Data Processing's business quality (an evaluation of our ValueCreation™ and ValueRisk™ ratings) ranks among the best of the firms in our coverage universe. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders with relatively stable operating results for the past few years, a combination we view very positively.• Automatic Data Processing is one of the world's largest providers of business outsourcing solutions. The firm offers a wide range of easy-to-use human resource, payroll, tax and benefits administration solutions from a single source.• Automatic Data Processing has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 15.3% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 0 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 0.3%.• ADP is one of only about four non-financial US companies rated AAA by S&P and Moody's. The company has minimal long-term obligations and has been paying dividends continuously since 1974.• ADP boasts a large, recurring revenue base resulting in strong, consistent cash flow generation. An added plus is that the firm's business model has low capital requirements.Investment ConsiderationsReturn on Invested CapitalADP's DividendADP's dividend yield is solid, offering roughly a 3% annual payout at recent price levels. We prefer yields above 3% and don't include firms with yields below 2% in our dividend growth portfolio. So, ADP is about in line with what we prefer.We think the safety of ADP's dividend is good (please see our definitions at the bottom of this article). We measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate in any given year, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges, which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend in any given year. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying these cash outlays well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing cash a company has on hand plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends. As income investors, however, we'd like to see a score much larger than 1 for a couple reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future.For ADP, this score is 2.2, revealing that on its current path the firm can cover its future dividends with net cash on hand and future free cash flow. We also use our dividend cushion as a key decision component in choosing companies for addition to the portfolio of our Dividend Growth Newsletter.Now on to the potential growth of ADP's dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity it has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. We evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in 10 years, the company has a nice growth rate, and a nice dividend cushion, its future potential dividend growth would be excellent, which is the case for ADP.And because capital preservation is also an important consideration, we assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss (offering investors a complete picture). In ADP's case, we currently think the shares are fairly valued, so the risk of capital loss is medium.All things considered, ADP stands out to us as one of the better income plays on the market today.

1059141,39351,2012-12-12T02:25:37-05:00,,"Brief Fundamental OverviewMarket Cap: $28 BillionDividend Yield: 3.04%Estimated 2013 P/E: 18.1xAutomatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), one of the nation's largest payroll processors, is known for its history of increasing dividend payments as earnings grow. Just last month, the company announced that it is increasing the dividend by 10%, making it the 38th consecutive year that the company has increased dividend payments to shareholders (Press Release). The company also has a history of buying back fairly large amounts of stock as part of publicly announced programs.ThesisADP is a company that will benefit significantly when interest rates increase from current levels. While the 2012 and 2013 earnings valuations may seem a bit stretched, ADP has serious potential to grow earnings over the medium to long term as interest rates rise. While investors will likely have to wait some time before this scenario plays out, there is real long-term upside potential to ADP. Many investors like ADP for its stable business model, combined with its dominant market position in the business services sector. ADP is definitely a name to watch as the employment situation improves.ADP PayrollsAs one of the nation's largest payroll services company, ADP holds a significant amount of cash for short periods of time before it writes paychecks to employees of clients. This business model is beneficial for ADP as the company is able to earn interest on this money for the few days that it holds it. Once payments are made on paychecks to client employees, a different client most often replaces the money that is held on their behalf by ADP. This allows ADP to have a fairly stable float from client funds that the company can invest in short-term and long-term securities to earn a return for its shareholders.The Interest Rate ProblemAs the Federal Reserve has set the Federal Funds Rate at a range of 0%- .25%, bond prices are high, especially for top rated debt such as US Treasuries. ADP primarily holds AAA and AA rated debt. This development in the bond market has hurt ADP significantly as the rate of return on the money held for clients has been less than it has received historically. At the end of the Q3 this year, ADP held $22.1 billion in corporate investments and funds held for clients. Importantly, ADP has a very minimal amount of outstanding debt. In Q3 of this year, ADP averaged 2.5% APR on its corporate investments and funds held for clients. It is easy to see how small changes in bond yields can affect ADP's bottom line. The APR of 2.5% is a decrease of 50bps from last year's Q3 average APR earned of 3%. It is estimated that a change of 100bps in short-term and medium-term interest rates would result in approximately $40 million in earnings before taxes. This hypothetical change in interest rates would increase EBT by approximately 9%.Interest Rate OutlookHistorically, interest rates have been highly cyclical generally increasing as economic conditions improve. As economic conditions improve, it is likely that the ultra-low interest rate environment currently experienced will eventually end, resulting in higher yield bonds, most likely across all maturities. The one problem with this is the timing of the change in interest rates. The Federal Reserve has indicated that it would like to keep interest rates low until the unemployment rate drops significantly or until inflation increases substantially. This scenario may take some time to play out, so investors betting on increasing interest rates may have to wait some time. All eyes will be on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) this week, as it meets on December 11-12 to discuss monetary policy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1115091,23852,2013-01-16T11:58:02-05:00,,"Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is a conservatively managed, diversified company that has increased its dividend every year for over 3 decades.-Seven Year Revenue Growth Rate: 3.3%  -Seven Year EPS Growth Rate: 6.7% -Seven Year Dividend Growth Rate: 14.2% -Current Dividend Yield: 2.94% -Balance Sheet Strength: Extremely StrongI view ADP as an excellent business, but not one that's at a particularly attractive price. If the stock price were to decrease by at least 5-10% down to the mid $50′s, I would view it as a better dividend stock selection.OverviewAutomatic Data Processing is one of the world's largest outsourcing companies. ADP handles human resource needs, benefits, payroll, and computing processes for many companies around the world. They prepare employee payroll checks, direct deposits, and tax reports. They capture, calculate, and record employee time and attendance. They perform hiring services. They provide record-keeping and administrative services for retirement plans.ADP also assists companies in certain industries with computing needs. For client businesses that sell cars, boats, are involved with heavy trucking, or similar fields, ADP can supply important software to help the business operate, from inventory, to networking, to data integration.RatiosPrice to Earnings: 21 Price to Free Cash Flow: 23 Price to Book: 4.5 Return on Equity: 22%Revenue (Chart Source: DividendMonk.com)Revenue growth over this period has been fairly mild, at a 3.3% annualized pace.Earnings and Dividends (Chart Source: DividendMonk.com)ADP has erratic earnings growth at an average rate of 6.7% per year over the last seven years.Dividend growth has averaged over 14% per year over the last seven years, and the company has a streak of consecutive annual dividend increases that is nearing four decades. The most recent quarterly dividend increase was approximately 10%. The payout ratios from earnings and free cash flow are safe.Approximate historical dividend yield at beginning of each year:How Does ADP Spend Its Cash? For the fiscal years 2010, 2011, and 2012, ADP brought in a total of approximately $4.5 billion in free cash flow. Over that same period, the company spent around $2.1 billion on dividends, a bit over $2.2 billion on net share repurchases, and approximately $1.1 billion on net acquisitions.As far as the effectiveness of the buybacks is concerned, the ADP reduced its share count from approximately 600 million to 490 million over the last decade.Balance SheetAutomatic Data Processing has nearly zero debt, which means their ratios that are normally reported such as the interest coverage ratio and the total debt/equity ratio are essentially perfect. ADP is one of only four non-financial companies in the United States to have a perfect AAA credit rating.The company does have over $3 billion in goodwill, which makes up about half of their shareholder equity. This goodwill from their acquisitions is fairly modest and does not have a large negative affect on my view of the balance sheet.Investment ThesisThere are a number of things that could be said for ADP's strong market position. Although the company does have competitors, they're not on the same scale as ADP. Their largest competitor in the U.S. is Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), which has revenue of approximately one-fifth of ADP. Since ADP offers services that are so essential, so widespread, and go so deeply into a business, the company's services have very high switching costs. For a business to switch a big segment of its human resources, payroll, and administrative components, it would be a significant expense and hassle. This is why the average client stays with ADP for over 10 years and their client retention rate is over 90%. Lastly, their strong balance sheet allows them to weather nearly any financial difficulty.The company has over 600,000 clients, and none of the larger ones account for even 2% of revenue each. In addition, the business has been expanding successful internationally. For instance, ADP's ""GlobalView"" service accounts for 1.1 million employees total.Overall, ADP is large and diverse enough and represents a large enough chunk of U.S. payroll data that their monthly U.S. jobs report is watched by market analysts and can be a factor in the movement of the S&P 500 on the days it is released.Eventual Catalyst for Growth: Interest Rates The recession has had more than the obvious effect on ADP. Apart from facing the same economic downturns as everyone else (and handling them defensively with their essential and widespread services), the company has faced the problem of low interest rates. Unlike other companies that use debt and therefore benefit from low interest rates, ADP would prefer higher interest rates for growth.This is because ADP holds an enormous amount of client funds that they use for payroll and other functions. The result is similar to an insurance company, where an insurance company collects premiums, pays out claims, and uses that float, that collection of billions of dollars, to invest in income-producing assets from which get to keep the income. As of 2012, ADP holds nearly $18 billion in client funds, uses those funds for client purposes, but gets to keep the investment income that comes from those funds. Of course, ADP is conservatively managed and must keep these funds safe, so they invest in AAA/AA investments that produce a reliable, but low-return investment income. Due to the recession, interest rates have been held artificially low for an abnormal amount of time, which has affected ADP's interest income.Interest rates play a large role in ADP profitability. In 2012, the company reported $493 million in interest income. This fell 9% from 2011 levels of $540 million, because although their base of client funds grew, their average interest rate decreased.This is an important chart, because it helps to show a part of ADP's ""real"" growth as compared to their reported income growth, which has been negatively affected by reduced interest rates. In addition to other metrics of growth such as number of clients, number of employees served, total revenue growth, and more, funds held for clients is a rather important metric of continued business growth and expansion for ADP. The amount of funds held grew by almost 4.7% annually over this six-year period, on average, but reduced interest rates have kept interest income low. ADP defends against interest rate changes by laddering the expiration of their investments, but as the interest rates have been held low for so long, ADP has had to continually reinvest the funds into lower-return investments, which is why there has been the gradual decline in interest rates.Interest income only accounts for a small portion of revenue. Out of nearly $10.7 billion in 2012 revenue, interest from client funds was only $493 million, or less than 4.6%. However, total net income for 2012 was $1,389 million, so a major change of a couple hundred million dollars in total interest income has a considerable effect on net income and EPS results. This is part of the reason that ADP growth looks so slow; interest rates have been acting as a headwind on their income and margins even as the business continues to grow. If a 4.0% interest rate were fixed onto the 2012 figure for client funds instead of the actual 2.8% figure, it would have boosted 2012 reported net income by around $220 million, or more than 15%.Over time, interest rates will eventually increase, and this should act as a tailwind, rather than the headwind that it has been, for ADP's reported net income and EPS. I believe that optimism of the current valuation is taking this into account, although interest rates will likely stay low for quite some time and even with generous interest rates factored in, the laddering of interest rates means the company will have a gradual increase in rates much like they had a gradual decrease in rates.RisksADP faces macroeconomic risk like any other large firm. In particular, 14% of employer services revenue for ADP comes from Europe.As previously described, interest rates are a risk because they have a direct affect on profitability for the company.Over 26,000 dealers of cars, trucks, boats, RVs, and other vehicles in over 100 countries use ADP software for dealer management. Downturns in this particularly industry can negatively affect ADP.Conclusion and ValuationI analyzed ADP almost exactly one year ago, and the company had the same stock valuation as it does now, with a P/E of around 21. The conclusion of that report was that the stock appears a bit overvalued, and over the last year, the stock has underperformed the S&P 500.With roughly the same valuation now, I believe the stock appears to still be trading in a range that is not particularly appealing for value investors that look for a margin of safety. ADP's strong business position and particularly robust balance sheet mean that the company does deserve a stock price premium due to lowing the 'risk' aspect of risk-adjusted returns, but I believe the current price leaves little room for value.Using the dividend discount model, the company needs to increase the dividend at a long-term rate of over 7% per year in order to justify the current stock price in the high $50′s if a 10% discount rate (desired rate of return) is assumed. This is reasonable, and overall I wouldn't view ADP as a poor investment, especially when the defensiveness of the company is considered.However, I think this one is worth watching for dips. A P/E of below 20 and a dividend yield of over 3% would be rough boundaries where I think it would start looking a bit better.Disclosure: As of this writing, I have no position in ADP. You can see my dividend portfolio here."
1354731,41941,2013-04-19T13:17:03-04:00,,"Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is the largest provider of payroll outsourcing services in the world. Additionally, ADP provides services such as data progressing, benefits administration, tax filing, and human resources outsourcing. Employer Services and Dealer Services are the two primary business segments that account for the majority of ADP's revenues.Employer Services provides services such as payroll, human resource, tax filing, reporting, and benefits administration services to over 570,000 customers in Asia, Australia, Brazil, Europe, and North America. Dealer Services is a global provider of professional services, data products, and transaction systems to automobile/truck dealers and manufacturers.We believe that ADP has a very solid, high return on capital business that does not require significant capital investments to grow. ADP has a few headwinds hurting its business with high unemployment rates in many of its markets affecting its Employer Services segment and low auto sales in Europe affecting its Dealer Services segment. Over the next few years, we expect these headwinds to moderate providing a nice boost to ADP's earnings.One aspect of ADP's business that we believe will allow ADP to continue to earn outsized returns is the fact that the market for payroll outsourcing services is huge. So large, in fact, that ADP should be able to grow this segment of its business for at least the next decade. More to the point, providing payroll outsourcing services to small and medium sized businesses should provide ADP with fertile ground for growth for the foreseeable future.Analysts' estimate that ADP will earn $2.91/share in 2013 and $3.18/share in 2014. We believe that these estimates are a bit low and that these estimates underestimate the improving United States job market as well as underestimate the potential for significant share repurchases.We believe that ADP is a good value for the following reasons:Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in ADP over the next 72 hours.

1046791,24196,2012-12-05T12:47:25-05:00,,"The power of growing dividends over time continues to be underestimated by many investors. Many are concerned with another decade of slow growth and low to negative equity returns. However, one way to prepare for another decade of slow economic growth is to invest in high dividend yield stocks that have shown they can weather tough economic times and even increase their dividends while it happens.One such company is Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP). With a dividend yield of 3.1% and a history of increasing dividends over time, ADP is one of my favorite dividend paying stocks.ADP Profile*:Automatic Data Processing, Inc. provides business outsourcing solutions. The company operates in three segments: Employer Services, Professional Employer Organization (NYSE:PEO) Services, and Dealer Services. The Employer Services segment offers a range of human resource (NYSE:HR) information, payroll processing, time and labor management, and tax and benefits administration solutions and services, including traditional and Web-based outsourcing solutions to employers in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America, Australia, and Asia. Its solutions assist employers in the staffing, management, payment, and retention of their employees.*Profile taken from Yahoo FinanceADP has a solid history of growing dividends over time. The company has been paying dividends since 1983 and they have never failed to increase their dividend in any year. The growth rate of the dividend over the past 5 years has also been solid at almost 15%, although it has slowed to 9.7% in the last year. Also, ADP has a relatively low payout ratio, which means there is still room for the dividend to grow even if they hit an earnings slump.It is not necessarily obvious how investors will fare if they hold onto ADP for the next 10 years, receiving not only the dividend, but a growing dividend over time. It's important to analyze scenarios for such a company where we look at the dividend yield and growing dividends. I ran the following scenario on our publicly available calculator called Total Returns- Dividends Vs. Price Appreciation. If we buy 1,000 shares today, apply the 1 year growth rate of 9.7% over the next 10 years, reinvest dividends, and assume the price of the stock does not change, we get the following:An annual return of 4.6% when the stock price hasn't moved is definitely a victory. I also included the future value of the dividend income stream compared to the future value of the initial investment. The dividends accumulated to more than $32,000 over the 10 year period. Looked at another way, the price of this stock could fall by more than 50% during this period and the investor would still break even. Now let's take a look at what happens over 20 years using a more conservative dividend growth figure of 6%:The annual return jumps to 5% even with no growth in the stock price. Again, the key here is the growing dividend payments over time. Also notice that the total dollar value of the dividend payments is nearly double the value of the initial investment. That is the beauty of high dividend paying stocks over time. The initial investment becomes less and less important.Scenarios such as the ones I've run here can help investors understand the power of dividends over time, especially when those dividends are growing.Disclosure: I am long ADP.

1154911,23479,2013-02-04T14:34:38-05:00,,"Automatic Data Processing  (NASDAQ:ADP) is set to release Q2 FY 2013 earnings on Tuesday, Feb.  5. The company has reported year-over-year increases in revenues for six  straight quarters, posting Q1 organic revenue growth of 3%. Since ADP's  primary business involves payroll processing, its revenues are  dependent on new business and employment growth in the United States.  This correlation with employment might help ADP's revenue growth during  the second quarter as the U.S. economy experienced a decrease in  unemployment rate. The U.S. unemployment rate shrunk from 8.1% in  September to 7.8% in December, and we think this will provide a boost to  the number of employees on ADP's client payrolls.Due to this recent trend, we will closely watch the average number of  employees on ADP's client payrolls to determine whether or not a  strengthening job market has impacted the company's performance over the  last three months.Client Payroll GrowthOne of the biggest drivers in ADP's Payroll Processing division,  which constitutes approximately 76% of the company’s value, is the  average number of employees per account. If increasing employment in the  United States has translated to payroll growth among ADP's client base,  it could provide upside to our top-line growth estimates. We think that  one of the best proxy's for ADP's results is another payroll  processor, Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX). The company announced earnings at the end of December and posted revenue growth of 5% year over year.Small Business Client GrowthAnother aspect of ADP's business we will be closely watching is the  revenue it generates from small businesses. Small business employment  growth increased during the quarter with the addition of 25,000 jobs in  December. This is an encouraging trend for ADP because small business  growth and employment create a feedback loop in the overall economy and  have been the drivers of economic growth in the past.We will also be closely watching the progress that ADP's partnership with Xero  has made. ADP entered into this partnership in July 2012 to  specifically target small businesses, and we think that ADP's focus on  pushing its services to the cloud will attract new clients because it  makes it cheaper for small businesses to outsource payroll. We think  these are important developments as we expect the company's small  businesses segment to be a key growth driver in the coming years.We currently have a $60 price estimate for ADP, which is approximately the same as the current market price.Disclosure: No positions."

Recently I looked at Automated Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP).Automated Data Processing, Inc. is a global leader of business outsourcing solutions. They are the largest payroll processing company in the United States with a market capitalization of $29.11B and a 17% market share. ADP pays 1-in-6 employees in the United States and approximately 33 million worldwide. Its size is a competitive advantage for two reasons. They are one of a few companies that can handle the human resource outsourcing for large organizations while the services they provide come with high switching costs. The success of ADP's products along with the high switching costs are two reasons for its 8% revenue growth year-over-year, 90% revenue retention and an average client tenure of approximately 10 years.Business DescriptionBelow is a table that describes ADP's three major operating segments and their earnings for the 2012 fiscal year which ended June 30, 2012.(click to enlarge)ADP ES is the largest and most profitable division with a 26% profit margin, however, the margin decreased 30 basis points due to the effects of acquisitions and the increase in sales headcount. The acquisitions and increase in sales headcount are two good investments in the future of the division and will likely contribute to future revenue and earnings growth.PEO Services' is the fastest growing division by both revenue and earnings. The increases are due to the 12% growth of worksite employees from both new and existing clients.Growth was also seen in Dealer Services, however operating margins decreased from the previous year due to implementing and servicing new clients.Comparison to CompetitorsADP does not look impressive when compared to Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU) and Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) on a fundamental basis. ADP lags the other two stocks in return on assets, return on equity and return on investment while its gross margin, operating margin, and profit margin are smaller.(click to enlarge)The argument could be made that ADP is an undervalued stock based on its lower P/E and P/B ratios but its PEG ratio of 2.21 is the highest of all three stocks.(click to enlarge)Discounted Earnings Per Share ValuationBelow is a model that calculates ADP's fair value based on its discounted EPS and its terminal value after year 5. The average earnings growth for the last 5 years was 7.02% per annum. The average long-term EPS growth estimate of the 24 analysts covering ADP is currently 9.19%. ADP's discounted EPS valuation was based off of these estimates. The EPS projection was taken from the 2013 mean EPS estimate and grown for five years at the mean long-term growth rate of 9.19%. An 11% discount rate was used while the terminal growth rate was 5%.(click to enlarge)The model calculated a $61.18 per share price. Considering ADP's October 9th, 2012 closing price of 58.48, the stock appears to be trading near fair value.ADP qualifies as a ""defense play"" considering its high revenue retention, low beta of .71 and low debt levels.

866831,24491,2012-09-14T03:42:23-04:00,,"Although analyzing historical dividend payment trends is important, we think assessing what may happen in the future is even more important. That is why we created a forward-looking assessment of dividend safety through our innovative, predictive dividend-cut indicator, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. We use our future forecasts for free cash flow and expected dividends and consider the company's net cash position to make sure that each company is able to pay out such dividend obligations to you -- long into the future. In this article, let's evaluate the investment merits of Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), as well as its dividend under this framework. For an in-depth evaluation of ADP's intrinsic value, please click here.Investment ConsiderationsReturn on Invested CapitalAutomatic Data Processing's DividendAutomatic Data Processing's dividend yield is above average, offering a 2.8% annual payout at recent price levels. We generally prefer yields above 3%, but ADP's payout is very close.We think the safety of ADP's dividend is excellent (please see our definitions at the bottom of this article). We measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate in any given year, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges (read hiccups in operations), which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend in any given year. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying these cash outlays well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing cash a company has on hand plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends. As income investors, however, we'd like to see a score much larger than 1 for a couple reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future.For Automatic Data Processing, this score is 2.8, revealing that on its current path, the firm can cover its future dividends with net cash on hand and future free cash flow. The beauty of the Dividend Cushion is that it can be compared apples-to-apples across companies. For example, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) scores a 1.4 on this measure. Also, for firms that have a score below 1 or that have a negative score, the risk of a dividend cut in the future is certainly elevated. In fact, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion caught all dividend cuts in our non-financial coverage universe, except for one, which subsequently raised its dividend above pre-cut levels (meaning it shouldn't have cut it in the first place). Most recently, the Dividend Cushion caught the recent cuts by JC Penney (JCP) and Supervalu (NYSE:SVU). We use our dividend cushion as a key decision component in choosing companies for addition to the portfolio of our Dividend Growth Newsletter (please see our links on the left sidebar for more information).Now on to the potential growth of ADP's dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity it has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. As such, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in 10 years, the company has a nice growth rate, and a nice dividend cushion, its future potential dividend growth would be excellent, which is the case for Automatic Data Processing. The company currently pays a solid dividend and has excess cash-flow capacity to increase it in future periods.And because capital preservation is also an important consideration, we assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss (offering investors a complete picture). In ADP's case, we think the shares are fairly valued, so the risk of capital loss medium. If we thought the shares were undervalued, the risk of capital loss would be low.All things considered, the growth potential and safety of ADP's dividend are attractive, and the size of its yield makes the firm worth considering as a potential income play. We're interested.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company operates in three segments: Employer Services, Professional Employer Organization (NYSE:PEO) Services, and Dealer Services. The company is a member of the dividend aristocrats' index, has paid dividends since 1974 and increased them for 37 years in a row.The company's last dividend increase was in November 2011, when the Board of Directors approved a 9.70% increase to 39.50 cents/share. The company's largest competitors include Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), Convergys Corp (NYSE:CVG) and CSG Systems (NASDAQ:CSGS).Over the past decade this dividend growth stock has delivered an annualized total return of 7.80% to its shareholders.The company has managed to an impressive increase in annual EPS growth since 2003. Earnings per share have risen by 5.90% per year. Analysts expect Automatic Data Processing to earn $2.93 per share in 2013 and $3.20 per share in 2014. In comparison Automatic Data Processing earned $2.82/share in 2012.The company has consistently repurchased stock over the past 7 years, reducing its share count from 620 million shares in 2002 to 489 million in 2012.The company will generate higher revenues over the next decade as a result of acquisitions, improving client retention rates, and increased North American auto sales, which would boost its Dealer Services segment. While the employment picture in the US is not very rosy at the moment, the economic recovery should lead to additions to jobs in the near term. In addition, the market for payroll outsourcing services is relatively untapped with small and medium sized businesses, which could deliver strong growth for well positioned firms like ADP. International expansion in payroll outsourcing could be another area where ADP could look for to generate growth.The market for HR Management services, which represent a high portion of ADP's Employer Services segment, is expected to increase by 4.5% per year until 2014 according to IDC. The market for Business Process Outsourcing, where ADP is trying to expand into, is expected to increase by almost 5% per annum during the same time frame.The barriers to entry in the payroll outsourcing are very high, as they require sizable investments in technology and infrastructure in order to process the information for thousands of employees. In addition, this business requires regular investment in technologies in order to stay competitive. This also creates economies of scale for larger processors such as ADP, which further differentiates them from competition.The return on equity has increased from 19% to 23%. Rather than focus on absolute values for this indicator, I generally want to see at least a stable return on equity over time.The annual dividend payment has increased by 13.40% per year over the past decade, which is higher than the growth in EPS. The expansion in the dividend payout ratio allowed the company to raise distributions at a rate that is higher than earnings.A 13% growth in distributions translates into the dividend payment doubling almost every five and a half years. If we look at historical data, going as far back as 1986 we see that Automatic Data Processing has actually managed to double its dividend every five years on average.The dividend payout ratio increased from 28.60% in 2003 to 55% in 2012. A lower payout is always a plus, since it leaves room for consistent dividend growth minimizing the impact of short-term fluctuations in earnings.Currently, Automatic Data Processing is slightly overvalued at 20.70 times earnings, has an adequately covered dividend, and yields 2.70%. I would consider adding to my position in the stock on dips below $56.Disclosure: I am long ADP. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it.

In the run up to the earnings results, no substantial movement in analysts' estimates for the quarter was noticed.Looking Back at the Prior QuarterBoth of ADP's top and bottom lines came in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the second quarter of 2012. Quarterly revenues increased 7.4% on a year-over-year basis to $2.58 billion, primarily due to strong new business sales, improving client retention and incremental revenue from recent acquisitions.Earnings per share (EPS) increased 9.7% year over year on the back of strong revenue growth.For further details please read: ADP Matches Estimates in 2Q2012 OutlookFor fiscal 2012, ADP expects total revenue to increase in the range of 7.0%-9.0%. EPS is expected to increase 8%-9% over $2.52 reported in year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2012 is pegged at $2.74 per share.Employer Services is expected to grow approximately 7% and pre-tax margins to expand 30 bps. The company expects pays per control to increase approximately 2.5% (prior outlook 2.0%) for fiscal 2012.PEO Services revenue is forecasted to improve 17.0%. Pre-tax margin is expected to improve slightly on a year-over-year basis. ADP expects Dealer Services revenue to increase in the 9.0%-10.0% range (prior forecast 8%-9%) with a pre-tax margin expansion of at least 50 bps.The company expects interest on funds held for clients to decline by $45.0 million to $55.0 million or 8%-10% from $540.1 million in fiscal 2011. However, the company expects 6%-7% increase in the average client fund balances.Estimates Trend RevisionOver the past 30 days, only one out of the 20 analysts covering the stock revised the estimate downward, while no upward revision was noticed for the quarter. With only one downward revision, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is pinned at 91 cents per share.For fiscal 2012, none of the 24 analysts covering the stock revised any estimate in the last 30 days. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2012 is pinned at $2.74 per share.The analysts covering the stock opine that ADP will likely post in line results on the back of improvement in the employment market coupled with growth in the new business sales and strategic acquisitions to pave way for top-line growth in the forthcoming quarters.Our TakeWe note that ADP's earning has always matched the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the past four quarters and for the current quarter we expect the phenomenon to continue.ADP is expected to report an in line third quarter backed by new business sales, diversified product portfolio, improving customer retention, accretive acquisitions, strong balance sheet and shareholder-friendly programs (aggressive share buybacks, dividend) over the long term.However, increasing competition from Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) and Insperity Inc. (NYSE:NSP) and a gloomy macroeconomic outlook in the Europe are major headwinds in the near term. Additionally, higher-than-expected unemployment rates and low interest rates remain concerns for the company's payroll processing business.We have a Neutral recommendation on ADP over the long term. Currently, ADP has a Zacks #2 Rank, which implies a 'Buy' rating in the short term."

319932,23852,2012-01-17T08:46:41-05:00,,"SummaryAutomatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is a conservatively managed, diversified company that has increased its dividend every year for over 3 decades.-Five year revenue growth: 2%-Five year EPS growth: negative-Five year cash flow growth: negative-Dividend yield: 2.88%-Dividend growth: 13%-Balance Sheet: PerfectOverall, I consider ADP to be somewhat expensive at the current price. There are, however, some positives that ADP likely has in its favor that are probably accounted for in its current stock valuation. For those interested in buying ADP as a defensive dividend grower, it would be prudent, in my view, to look for dips rather than to buy at the current price.OverviewAutomatic Data Processing is one of the world’s largest outsourcing companies. ADP handles human resource needs, benefits, payroll, and computing processes for many companies around the world. They prepare employee payroll checks, direct deposits, and tax reports. They capture, calculate, and record employee time and attendance. They perform hiring services. They provide record-keeping and administrative services for retirement plans.ADP also assists companies in certain industries with computing needs. For client businesses that sell cars, boats, are involved with heavy trucking, or similar fields, ADP can supply important software to help the business operate, from inventory, to networking, to data integration.Revenue, Earnings, Cash Flow, and MarginsADP has had slow business growth over the past several years, but nonetheless remains strong.Revenue Growth Revenue growth over this period has averaged only a bit over 2% annually, which is a rather slow pace. A positive note is that although growth was largely flat or down for the first half of this time period, revenue did grow by over 10% between 2010 and 2011. Revenue over the latest trailing twelve month period has breached $10 billion.Earnings Growth EPS growth has been erratic, and overall, negative during this period. Even over a full 10 year period, EPS growth has only averaged around 4% annually. Analysts have estimated high single-digit EPS growth for 2012 and 2013.Operating Cash Flow Growth ADP has had negative cash flow growth over this period as well.MetricsPrice to Earnings: 21Price to FCF: 19Price to Book: 4.5Return on Equity: 21%Dividend GrowthADP has paid growing dividends for over 3 decades. The current yield has slipped under 3% to only 2.88%, and the payout ratio is a bit over 60%.Dividend Growth Over the past 5 years, ADP has grown its dividend by an average of 13.4% annually, which is solid. The most recent quarterly increase at the end of 2011 was a bit under 10%. The dividend payout ratio, with respect to earnings, has been increasing. Over the long term, dividend growth must eventually slow down to the level of EPS growth (or EPS growth must accelerate), since the payout ratio cannot comfortably exceed past a certain point.Share RepurchasesADP has been spending more money on share repurchases than on dividends. For the three years of 2009, 2010, and 2011, ADP has paid out approximately $2 billion in dividends, and has spent slightly over $2 billion on net share repurchases. This has resulted in decreasing the number of shares outstanding by a bit over 5% over those three years. Before the recession, ADP was regularly spending at least twice the amount of money on share repurchases as on dividends. Over ten years, the number of shares outstanding has decreased from approximately 630 million to 490 million. The amount of money spent on dividends and share repurchases each year exceeds earnings, and approximately matches free cash flow over the long term. However, with a P/E of 21, I find that share repurchases are not the best use of returns for shareholders; the rate of return just isn’t particularly high.Balance SheetADP’s balance sheet is very, very strong. Total debt/equity is practically zero, and the interest coverage ratio is therefore practically infinite. However, approximately 50% of the shareholder equity consists of goodwill, but this isn’t a problem. ADP is one of only four non-financial US companies that currently hold a perfect AAA credit rating from the top rating agencies. (The other three are Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Johnson and Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and as a disclosure, I own all three.) Rating agencies have received criticism for having been rather useless with regards to the financial collapse, but looking at ADP’s balance sheet, it’s rather clear why they receive the rating they do. The business has diverse revenue and income streams, practically zero debt, a large and defensive business that can withstand a major recession, etc.Investment ThesisWhen I analyzed ADP a year and a half ago, it was trading at slightly above $40/share, and I wrote that it was attractively priced. It has since gone up to $55, which may be great for short term investors who could have made basically a 40% rate of return over that period, but for longer term investors, I believe that means ADP is somewhat overvalued now. EPS has not grown at that rate, and therefore the P/E is higher, the dividend yield is lower.However, it’s a great business, and I haven’t published an analysis on it for a year and a half, so it’s worth watching the company for dips. As explained below in the catalyst section, there is a case for optimism in terms of future growth that justifies at least a part of the current premium stock valuation, although I still propose that it’s overly expensive at the current price if one desires good returns.There are a number of things that could be said for ADP’s strong market position. Although the company does have competitors, they’re not on the same scale as ADP. Their largest competitor is Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), which has revenue of approximately one-fifth of ADP. Since ADP offers services that are so essential, so widespread, and go so deeply into a business, the company’s services have very high switching costs. For a business to switch a big segment of its human resources, payroll, and administrative components, it would be a significant expense and hassle. This is why the average client stays with ADP for over 10 years. Lastly, their strong balance sheet allows them to weather nearly any financial difficulty.The company has over a half-million clients, and none of the larger ones account for even 2% of revenue each. In addition, the business has been expanding successful internationally. For instance, ADP’s “GlobalView” service had 105 multinational/global client contracts that account for nearly 1 million employees total.Catalyst for Growth: Interest RatesThe recession has had more than the obvious effect on ADP. Apart from facing the same economic downturns as everyone else (and handling them defensively with their essential and widespread services), the company has faced the problem of low interest rates. Unlike other companies that use debt and therefore benefit from low interest rates, ADP would prefer higher interest rates for growth.This is because ADP holds an enormous amount of client funds that they use for payroll and other functions. The result is similar to an insurance company, where an insurance company collects premiums, pays out claims, and uses that float, that collection of billions of dollars, to invest in income-producing assets from which get to keep the income. As of 2011, ADP holds nearly $17 billion in client funds, uses those funds for client purposes, but gets to keep the investment income that comes from those funds. Of course, ADP is conservatively managed and must keep these funds safe, so they invest in AAA/AA investments that produce a reliable, but low-return investment income. Due to the recession, interest rates have been held artificially low for an abnormal amount of time, which has affected ADP’s interest income.Interest rates play a large role in ADP profitability. In 2011, the company reported $540 million in interest income. This fell slightly from 2010 levels of $543 million, because although their base of client funds grew by 11%, interest rates on their investments fell from 3.6% to 3.2%. The interest rate was 4.0% in 2009, 4.4% in 2008, 4.5% in 2007, and 4.1% in 2006. The following chart presents the information more clearly.This is an important chart, because it helps to show a part of ADP’s “real” growth as compared to their reported income growth, which has been negatively affected by reduced interest rates. In addition to other metrics of growth such as number of clients, number of employees served, total revenue growth, and more, funds held for clients is a rather important metric of continued business growth and expansion for ADP. The amount of funds held grew by almost 4.5% annually over this period, on average, but reduced interest rates have kept interest income flat. ADP defends against interest rate changes by laddering the expiration of their investments, but as the interest rates have been held low for so long, ADP has had to continually reinvest the funds into lower-return investments.Interest income only accounts for a small portion of revenue. Out of $9,880 million in 2011 revenue, interest from client funds was only $540 million, or less than 5.5%. However, total net income for 2011 was $1,254 million, so a major change of a couple hundred million dollars in total interest income has a considerable effect on net income and EPS results. This is part of the reason that ADP growth looks so slow; interest rates have been affecting their income and margins even as the business continues to grow. If a 4.0% interest rate were fixed onto the 2011 figure for client funds instead of the actual 3.2% figure, it would have boosted 2011 reported net income by $135 million, or more than 10%. If a 4.5% interest rate were fixed onto the 2011 figure for client funds, it would have boosted 2011 reported net income by $220 million, or over 17%.Over time, interest rates will increase eventually, and this should act as a tailwind, rather than the headwind that it has been, for ADP’s reported net income and EPS. I believe that optimism of the current valuation is taking this into account, although interest rates will likely stay low for quite some time and even with generous interest rates factored in, the valuation is still a bit expensive in my opinion.RisksADP is a very defensive, diverse, business. They do have a bit of concentration with auto dealers, and ADP in general is susceptible to global economic downturns. If there are high numbers of closing businesses in tough economic environments (which is more likely among their smaller clients), then ADP’s growth and profitability get impacted. Plus as with all large businesses, ADP has regulatory risk and some currency risk. Low interest rates, as previously described, can be a problem as far as net income is concerned. I believe most of the risk associated with the stock, at the current time, has more to do with the valuation than the underlying fundamental business. Slow business growth is a concern (even when taking into account the previous and current interest rate changes), as slow business growth can fundamentally impact stock valuation.Conclusion and ValuationIn conclusion, I think ADP is a bit expensive, although I think there are more positives for the company than one might expect by looking at previous growth history alone. Based on the rather slow growth (with the potential for improved moderate growth ahead over the long term), and based on the excellent balance sheet and defensive nature of the business, I think ADP would be a decent buy at around $45 or so per share. Writing puts at a strike price of $48 for January 2013 with an intention of buying the stock should the option be assigned might be an acceptable use of capital for those looking to enter a position. Or, one could invest elsewhere for the time being and look to buy ADP on market weakness, if one were so inclined. The current $55 stock price seems to me to be too expensive; I’d hold at the current price if I owned ADP but wouldn’t buy.Disclosure: I have no position in ADP at the time of this writing."
322735,24196,2012-01-27T14:37:25-05:00,,"The power of growing dividends over time continues to be underestimated by many investors. Many are concerned with another decade of slow growth and low to negative equity returns. However, one way to prepare for another decade of slow economic growth is to invest in high dividend yield stocks that have shown they can weather tough economic times and even increase their dividends while it happens.One such company is Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP). With a dividend yield of 2.8% and a history of increasing dividends over time, ADP is one of my favorite dividend paying stocks.ADP ProfileAutomatic Data Processing, Inc. provides business outsourcing solutions. The company operates in three segments: Employer Services, Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services and Dealer Services. The Employer Services segment offers a range of human resource information, payroll processing, time and labor management, and tax and benefits administration solutions and services, including traditional and Web-based outsourcing solutions to employers in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America, Australia and Asia. Its solutions assist employers in the staffing, management, payment and retention of their employees. (Profile taken from Yahoo Finance)ADP has a solid history of growing dividends over time. The company has been paying dividends since 1983 and they have never failed to increase their dividend in any year. The growth rate of the dividend over the past five years has also been solid at almost 15%, although it has slowed to 5.2% in the last year. Also, ADP has a relatively low payout ratio, which means there is still room for the dividend to grow even if they hit an earnings slump.It is not necessarily obvious how investors will fare if they hold onto ADP for the next 10 years, receiving not only the dividend, but a growing dividend over time. It's important to analyze scenarios for such a company where we look at the dividend yield and growing dividends. I ran the following scenario on the Total Returns calculator - Dividends Vs. Price Appreciation. If we buy 1,000 shares today, apply the one-year growth rate of 5.6% over the next 10 years, reinvest dividends, and assume the price of the stock does not change, we get the following:An annual return of 3.8% when the stock price hasn't moved is definitely a victory. I also included the future value of the dividend income stream compared to the future value of the initial investment. The dividends accumulated to more than $29,000 over the 10-year period. Looked at another way, the price of this stock could fall by almost 50% during this period and the investor would still break even. Now let's take a look at what happens over 20 years:The annual return jumps to nearly 5% even with no growth in the stock price. Again, the key here is the growing dividend payments over time. Also notice that the total dollar value of the dividend payments is nearly double the value of the initial investment. That is the beauty of high dividend paying stocks over time. The initial investment becomes less and less important.Scenarios such as the ones I've run here can help investors understand the power of dividends over time, especially when those dividends are growing.Disclosure: I am long ADP."

Free Cash Flow Payout2. Debt To Total Capital3. Key Metrics4. Dividend Growth Rate5. Years of Div. Growth6. Rolling 4-yr Div. > 15%ADP earned three Stars in this section for 1.), 2.) and 3.) above. A Star was earned since the Free Cash Flow payout ratio was less than 60% and there were no negative Free Cash Flows over the last 10 years. The stock earned a Star as a result of its most recent Debt to Total Capital being less than 45%. ADP earned a Star for having an acceptable score in at least two of the four Key Metrics measured. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1974 and has increased its dividend payments for 36 consecutive years.Dividend Income vs. MMA: Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account (MMA) or Treasury bond? This section compares the earning ability of this stock with a high yield MMA. Two items are considered in this section, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:1. NPV MMA Diff.2. Years to > MMAADP earned a Star in this section for its NPV MMA Diff. of the $867. This amount is in excess of the $500 target I look for in a stock that has increased dividends as long as ADP has. If ADP grows its dividend at 7.0% per year, it will take 2 years to equal a MMA yielding an estimated 20-year average rate of 3.6%. ADP earned a check for the Key Metric 'Years to >MMA' since its 2 years is less than the 5 year target.Memberships and Peers: ADP is a member of the S&P 500, a Dividend Aristocrat and a member of the Broad Dividend Achievers™ Index and a Dividend Champion. The company's peer group includes: Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) with a 4.6% yield, Insperity, Inc. (NYSE:NSP) with a 2.7% yield, and Convergys Corporation (NYSE:CVG) with a 0.0% yield.Conclusion: ADP did not earn any Stars in the Fair Value section, earned three Stars in the Dividend Analytical Data section and earned one Star in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a total of four Stars. This quantitatively ranks ADP as a 4-Star Strong stock.Using my D4L-PreScreen.xls model, I determined the share price would need to increase to $56.74 before ADP's NPV MMA Differential decreased to the $500 minimum that I look for in a stock with 36 years of consecutive dividend increases. At that price the stock would yield 2.7%.Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the target $500 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 5.3%. This dividend growth rate is lower than the 7.0% used in this analysis, thus providing a margin of safety. ADP has a risk rating of 1.25 which classifies it as a Low risk stock.While a weak economy and low employment levels have negatively impacted ADP, the company enjoys a scale advantage as the industry leader leader and has a well-respected brand. These along with high customer switching costs has provided ADP with a serviceable moat. Although the company is trading in excess of my $41.73 fair value price, it recently moved up to a 4-Star stock as a result of updated financials an an increased dividend. It is one I will continue to watch for opportune times to increase my position.Disclaimer: Material presented here is for informational purposes only.

The RUN platform is a cloud based solution which provides payroll and tax administration services for small businesses. Since this integration with Xero will provide businesses with greater insight into the financial situation of its company, we believe that this is an offering which could help increase the number of small business clients currently with ADP.Check out our complete analysis of ADP hereAccording to our estimates, payroll processing represents approximately 75% of ADP's total value. Small businesses are not the primary driver in this segment but an increase in either the number of employees at an average small business or the number of small businesses using ADP's services can provide upside to the stock. For example, if taken by itself, the average number of employees in small businesses per client increases to approximately 16, it would provide 5% upside to ADP's value. Additionally, if the average number of employees per small business client increases to 13, and the number of small business clients also increases to approximately 520 thousand, it would also provide a 5% upside to the company's value.We believe that a couple of new developments in recent months could be catalysts in increasing the average number of employees per client, the number of small businesses clients or both. Currently, there is a tax bill being negotiated in Congress which seeks to provide financial incentives for small businesses who hire additional employees.  Some estimates state that, if the bill passes, it would create approximately a million jobs in the economy, primarily in the small business sector. If this occurs, we can expect the average number of employees per client for small businesses using ADP to increase.Even if the bill does not pass, ADP should benefit from America's focus on generating economic growth by stimulating small business growth and employment. In ADP's favor are new bills such as the JOBS act, which aims to reduce restrictions on the funding of small businesses. Initiatives such as this, which provide more cash to small businesses, should spur small business creation and employment.We believe that ADP, by integrating with an online accounting provider such as Xero, is providing a platform that makes it much easier for a small business to manage its finances. In a challenging economic environment, where small businesses must focus on what they do instead of dealing with the difficulties of payroll management, this platform could provide ADP with a greater number of small business clients.We currently have a $60 price estimate for ADP, which is approximately 10% above the current market price.Disclosure: No positions"
645301,24491,2012-06-07T18:18:52-04:00,,"As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In Automatic Data Processing's (NASDAQ:ADP) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $47 per share, lower than where it is currently trading. To get the most out of this article, please take a couple minutes to view the following short video here.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. In the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of our VBI has stacked up per underlying score:If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Automatic Data Processing posts a VBI score of 3 on our scale, reflecting our ""fairly valued"" DCF assessment of the firm, its unattractive relative valuation versus peers, and very bearish techinicals. We use Korn/Ferry (NYSE:KFY), Manpower (NYSE:MAN), Insperity (NYSE:NSP) and Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) for our peer group analysis.Our Report on Automatic Data ProcessingIn the spirit of transparency, our report on Automatic Data Processing and hundreds of other companies can be found here. imagesInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsAutomatic Data Processing's business quality (an evaluation of our ValueCreation and ValueRisk ratings) ranks among the best of the firms in our coverage universe. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders with relatively stable operating results for the past few years, a combination we view very positively.The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. If the firm's share price fell below $38, we'd take a closer look at adding it to the market-beating portfolio of our newsletter. In the spirit of transparency, we show the performance of our Best Ideas Newsletter below:Automatic Data Processing has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 15.7% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 0 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 0.6%.The firm's share price performance has trailed that of the market during the past quarter. However, it is trading within our fair value estimate range, so we don't view such activity as alarming.The firm's technicals look very weak. If current prices hold, the firm's moving averages could create a death cross, a very bearish technical pattern.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Automatic Data Processing's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 58.1%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 9.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid gray line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Automatic Data Processing's free cash flow margin has averaged about 15.1% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Automatic Data Processing, cash flow from operations increased about 9% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 9% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Automatic Data Processing's shares are worth between $38.00 - $56.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's LOW ValueRisk rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $47 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 18.7 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 13.4 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 6.8% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 4%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 15.8%, which is above Automatic Data Processing's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.4% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Automatic Data Processing, we use a 9.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $47 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Automatic Data Processing. We think the firm is attractive below $38 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $56 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Automatic Data Processing's fair value at this point in time to be about $47 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Automatic Data Processing's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $57 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $47 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

A previous article examined ADP's Income Statement for the September quarter.  Reported earnings were $0.02 more than our $0.60 EPS estimate.  We have now updated the various financial metrics we use to analyze Cash Management, Growth, Profitability and Value.  This post reports on the metrics for ADP and the associated financial gauge scores.  The metrics were calculated using data from ADP's current and historical financial statements, including those in the latest 10-Q.  Before getting into the details, we will take a step back to introduce the subject of today's analysis.  Automatic Data Processing performs payroll, human resource, data processing, and outsourcing Business Services for well over 500,000 clients, large and small, in the United States and other countries.  ADP pays one of every six private sector employees in the U.S.  ADP is one of four remaining U.S. companies with a AAA bond rating.  An S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat, ADP recently announced its 36th-consecutive annual dividend increase.    The company's market value is currently close to $25 billion, on a fully diluted basis.  As the processor of many payrolls across the U.S., ADP quickly senses macroeconomic changes in Employment.  ADP uses the data it collects to issue the monthly ADP National Employment Report on non-farm private employment.    Fortune Magazine deemed ADP to be Most Admired in the Financial Data Services industry.  In  fiscal 2010, which ended 30 June, ADP's earnings fell to $1.21 billion  from $1.33 billion in the prior year.  Revenue increased to $8.93  billion from $8.84 billion.  The company's results in fiscal 2010 were  weakened by high unemployment, which reduces the demand for payroll  services, and low interest rates, which limits the company's interest  income.  ADP has three main businesses:  Employer Services, Professional Employer Organization  Services, and Dealer Services.  Employer Services processes payrolls,  administers benefits, and performs other services to enable firms ""to  staff, manage, pay and retain their employees.""  PEO Services, by establishing co-employment  relationships with customers and their employees, enables businesses to  outsource various functions.  In this arrangement, an ADP entity  becomes the employer of record for the affected employees.  Dealer  Services helps companies that sell vehicles and machinery manage their  business activities.  The Employer Services business segment contributed 72 percent of total revenue in fiscal 2010.  Competitors include Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), the now-private Ceridian, and India's Wipro (NYSE: WIT).In 2007, ADP divested its Brokerage Services Group business, which became Broadridge Financial Solutions (NYSE: BR).  GCFR articles related to Broadridge can be found here.  Now we turn to the financial gauges.  The latest quarterly results produced the following changes to the scores: The  current and historical values for the financial metrics that determine  the gauge scores are listed below, with some brief commentary.  Readers  are encouraged to verify these figures and calculate others as they see  fit using the filings available at the SEC's web site and elsewhere. The Cash Management gauge score picked up a couple of points due to some minor variations in the underlying financial metrics.  ADP has $1.3 billion in cash and cash-equivalents.   ADP has only $35 million (a pittance for a big firm) of Long-term  Debt.  The debt-to-equity and debt-to-cash-flow ratios are near zero.   Working Capital  -- the difference between Current Assets and Current Liabilities, but  excluding client funds and obligations  -- is also approximately $1.3  billion.  The amount of Working Capital relative to Revenue is  stable-to-decreasing, which is good.  The Current Ratio, also  excluding client funds, is under the classical 2.0 threshold.  However,  the latest figure is within its normal range for ADP.  Days of  Sales Outstanding has been static for the last year.  The figure is  below (albeit slightly) its long-term average, which is signal of  improved cash efficiency.  We'd like to see the Cash Conversion Cycle  Time move down, for the same reason. The  Growth gauge jumped abnormally with September's results because the  growth metrics were so much better than they had been in September  2009.  The numbers moderated in December, and the score gave back its  gain.  Revenue  in December 2010 quarter was 9.4 percent greater than in the comparable  year-earlier period.  This performance, which was boosted by recent  acquisitions, pushed trailing-year revenue growth to 5.8 percent.  While  we wouldn't call this a robust growth rate, it is certainly an  improvement on the negative rate of 12 months earlier.  The upward  trend in Revenue / Assets may be moderating.  Note that we exclude Client  funds from Assets when making the Revenue / Assets calculation.    The  negative (and worsening) Net Income trailing-year growth rate is one  drag on the Growth gauge score.  Although macroeconomic factors such as  U.S. employment and interest rates probably have the most prominent  effect on income, one-time items have also weakened ADP's results.  For  example, ADP recorded an $8.6 million impairment charge on assets held  for sale.  Similarly, in the June 2010 quarter, ADP recorded a $9.1  million impairment charge on securities.  In addition, ADP's  income in the prior year benefited for a tax settlement, which makes the  more recent results look comparatively worse.    Cash Flow from  operations during the first six month of the current fiscal year is 3.8  percent less than in the same six months of the previous fiscal year. The Profitability Gauge score barely budged in the latest period.  A  decreasing Operating Margin (albeit slightly) is not helping the  score.  The decrease indicates that expenses are taking a bigger bite  out of each revenue dollar.  The ROIC and FCF/IC ratios are healthy and consistent with their historical averages.  The  increase in the Accrual Ratio could be a concern.  However, one-time  items that have affected Cash Flow and Income have made this metric  especially erratic.  We'd like to see the Accrual Ratio decrease and get  back under 0 percent. The  Value gauge score, weak after September, had nowhere to go but down  when the share price increased 10 percent and Net Income fell 2 percent  in the December 2010 quarter.  The results on a per-share basis are somewhat better because ADP has been repurchasing its shares.  The  company's earnings growth would not seem to justify the current P/E  multiple.  However, it seems likely that ADP's share price has increased  because investors are more confident that improving employment trends  will ultimately benefit ADP's payroll business.  The GCFR gauges won't  register this improvement until after it actually occurs. The  Overall gauge score tumbled mostly because of weakness in the Growth  and Value gauges.  The score will remain under pressure until key  parameters such as Operating Income, Net Income, Cash Flow from  Operations perform better.  As mentioned above, one-time items  have skewed some of the numbers.  The effect of these factors should  become clearer over time.   Full disclosure: Long ADP at time of writing."

Please note that our organization of  revenues, expenses, gains, and losses, which we use for all analyses,  can and often does differ in material respects from company-used  formats.  The standardization facilitates cross-company comparisons.  Revenue  in the December quarter rose 9.4 percent, from $2.2 billion last year  to $2.4 billion in the most recent three months.  Fluctuations in  currency exchange rates shaved about 1 percent from revenue growth.  Reported  revenue exceeded our $2.36 billion estimate by 2 percent.

Employer Services, the company's  largest business segment, achieved Revenue growth of 7 percent, from  $1.56 billion to $1.66 billion.  Revenue from the company's  ""traditional"" payroll businesses didn't increase, which indicates  Employer Services revenue growth was due to new lines of business and  recent acquisitions.  Revenue rose a robust 15 percent at the Professional Employer Organization Services segment, from $311 million to $358 million.

We believe  Automatic Data Processing’s second quarter results reflect the sluggish  U.S. employment market and tough competition from Paychex Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX).  However, we believe the strong fiscal 2011 outlook suggests a positive  second half, driven by higher client retention and new business sales  from Employer Services and PEO Services.Currently, Automatic Data Processing has a Zacks #3 Rank, which implies a Hold rating on a short-term basis."

This post examines ADP's Income Statement for the latest quarter and compares the entries on each line to our ""look-ahead"" estimates.  Reported earnings were $0.02 more than our $0.54 EPS estimate.The principal sources for the income statement analysis were the earnings announcement and the associated webcast presentation [pdf]. In a second article, we will report ADP's scores as measured by the GCFR financial gauges.  The follow-up post will also provide the latest figures for the various financial metrics we use to analyze Cash Management, Growth, Profitability and Value. Before getting into the details, we will take a step back to introduce the subject of today's analysis.Automatic Data Processing performs payroll, human resource, data processing, and outsourcing Business Services for well over 500,000 clients, large and small, in the United States and other countries.  ADP pays one of every six private sector employees in the U.S.  The company's market value is currently about $22 billion on a fully diluted basis.ADP is one of four remaining U.S. companies with a AAA bond rating.  It is also an S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat, having hiked its dividend for 35 consecutive years.  Fortune Magazine deemed ADP to be Most Admired in the Financial Data Services industry.In fiscal 2010, which ended 30 June, ADP earned $1.2 billion on Revenue of $8.9 billion.  ADP has three main businesses:  Employer Services, Professional Employer Organization  Services, and Dealer Services.  Employer Services processes payrolls,  administers benefits, and performs other services to enable firms ""to  staff, manage, pay and retain their employees.""  PEO Services, by  establishing co-employment  relationships with customers and their employees, enables businesses to  outsource various functions.  In this arrangement, an ADP entity  becomes the employer of record for the affected employees.  Dealer  Services helps dealers of vehicles and machinery manage their business  activities.In 2007, ADP divested its Brokerage Services Group business, which became Broadridge Financial Solutions (NYSE: BR).  (GCFR articles related to Broadridge can be found here.)  Additional background information about ADP and the business environment in which it is currently operating can be found in the look-ahead.Please click here to see  a normalized depiction of the actual and projected results for the  just-concluded quarter, as well as the quarterly Income Statements for  the last couple of years.  Please note that our organization of  revenues, expenses, gains, and losses, which we use for all analyses,  can and often does differ in material respects from company-used  formats.  The standardization facilitates cross-company comparisons.Revenue  in the September quarter rose 6.4 percent, from $2.10 billion last year  to $2.23 billion in the most recent period.  Fluctuations in currency  exchange rates shaved about 1 percent from revenue growth.Reported revenue exceeded our $2.14 billion estimate by 4.2 percent.Employer Services, the company's  largest business segment, achieved Revenue growth of 5.6 percent, from  $1.48 billion to $1.56 billion.  Revenue from the company's  ""traditional"" payroll businesses was up only 2 percent, which indicates  healthier growth in new lines of business.  Revenue grew at a robust 15.2 percent at the Professional Employer Organization Services segment, from $296 million to $341 million.  The  Dealer Services business reported a surprisingly strong 11.6 percent  Revenue increase, from $302 million to $336 million.  However, organic  growth was only one percent as this unit continues to be affected by  dealerships closings.Operating Expenses were $1.12 billion, or 50.1 percent of Revenue.  (Note we treat this item as the Cost of Goods Sold for consistency with our other analyses, but the item is only a subset of what ADP classifies as Total Costs of Revenues.)  This ratio translates into a Gross Margin of 49.9 percent, a substantial 220 basis points less profitable than last September's 52.1 percent.  The latest Gross Margin was 210 basis points lower than our estimate of 52.0 percent.Depreciation and amortization expenses were unchanged at $60 million, as expected.ADP spent $135 million on ""Systems Development and Programming Costs,"" which we treat as analogous to Research and Development.  The expense was up $9 million (7.1 percent) from last year's $126 million.  The latest figure matched our estimate exactly.As a percentage of Revenue, R&D increased from 6.0 percent to 6.1 percent.  Sales, General, and Administrative  expenses rose 4.9 percent to $516 million. The latest amount was just  $2 million more than our $514 million estimate for the quarter. Reported  SG&A expenses equaled 23.1 percent of Revenue, down from 23.4  percent last year. Subtracting the various operating expenses from Revenue yields Operating Income  of $402 million, which fell short of last year's $415 million by 3.2  percent. The latest Operating Income amount was only 0.5 percent less  than our $404 million target, as higher-than-expected Revenue was offset  by a lower-than-expected Gross Margin.    As for  non-operating items, Other Income less Interest Expense equaled $35  million, net.  This amount was only a little better than last year's $31  million, but it was quite a bit better than the $10 million we  expected.   The effective Income Tax Rate was 36.2 percent in the September 2010 quarter.  We had estimated the tax rate would be 35 percent.At the bottom line, Net Income  of $279 million was 2 percent less than income of $284 million in the  September 2009 quarter.  With fewer shares outstanding, earnings per  share were unchanged at $0.56.Reporting earnings were $10  million ($0.02 per share) more than our target for the quarter, in large  part because Other Income was better than we anticipated.In  summary, the September quarter was mostly consistent with  expectations.  Revenue was better, but this was offset by a  softer Gross Margin.  There were surprises in the expenses, but other  income was significantly better. Full disclosure: Long ADP at time of writing."

The  purpose of the model is to establish a baseline for identifying  surprises, positive or negative, in the quarterly results the company  will report.  Estimates for each line of the Income Statement are derived from management's guidance, the company's historical financial results, and other publicly available data.First, we present some background information about ADP and the business environment in which it is currently operating.Automatic Data Processing performs payroll, human resource, data processing, and outsourcing Business Services for well over 500,000 clients, large and small, in the United States and other countries.  ADP pays one of every six private sector employees in the U.S.ADP is one of four remaining U.S. companies with a AAA bond rating.  An S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat , ADP recently announced its 36th-consecutive annual dividend increase. The company has a market value of about $23 billion.As the processor of many payrolls across the U.S., ADP quickly senses macroeconomic changes in Employment.  ADP uses the data it collects to issue the monthly ADP National Employment Report on non-farm private employment.Fortune Magazine deemed ADP to be Most Admired in the Financial Data Services industry.In fiscal 2010, which ended 30 June, ADP's earnings fell to $1.21  billion from $1.33 billion in the prior year.  Revenue increased to  $8.93 billion from $8.84 billion.  The company's results in fiscal 2010  were weakened by high unemployment, which reduces the demand for payroll  services, and low interest rates, which limits the company's interest  income.ADP has three main businesses:Employer Services, Professional Employer Organization Services, and Dealer Services.  Employer Services processes payrolls,  administers benefits, and performs other services to enable firms ""to  staff, manage, pay and retain their employees.""  PEO Services, by  establishing co-employment relationships with customers and their employees, enables businesses to  outsource various functions.  In this arrangement, an ADP entity  becomes the employer of record for the affected employees.  Dealer  Services helps companies that sell vehicles and machinery manage their business  activities. The Employer Services business segment contributed 72 percent of total revenue in fiscal 2010.  Competitors include Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), the now-private Ceridian, and India's Wipro(NYSE: WIT).Dealer Services revenue has been adversely affected by the downturn in vehicle sales and the closing of many dealerships.  ADP has recently acquired several other companies, including Italian business software developer Byte Software House, automotive marketing firm Cobalt, human resource solutions provider Workscape, and payroll tax firm MasterTax.In 2007, ADP divested its Brokerage Services Group business, which became Broadridge Financial Solutions(NYSE: BR). GCFR articles related to Broadridge can be found here.   Automatic Data Processing earned $0.56 per diluted share on a GAAP basis in the September-ending first quarter of fiscal 2011.  Earnings per share were unchanged from the same three months of last year.Readers wanting to take another look at ADP's September 2010 quarter might wish to review our Income Statement and Financial Gauge analyses.Now, we are ready to look ahead to ADP's results for the December 2010 quarter.In the press release on 27 October 2010 announcing its results for the September quarter, ADP updated its guidance for fiscal 2011.  Some changes to the  guidance reflect the company's better-than-expected performance during  the first fiscal quarter, and other adjustments are reactions to recent  corporate acquisitions. Including the results of the newly acquired companies, ADP now believes it can achieve full-year Revenue growth between 7 percent and 8 percent.  Since Revenue in fiscal 2010 was $8.93 billion, the guidance translates into a  Revenue range of $9.56 billion to $9.65 billion for the fiscal  year that will end in June 2011.  Let's say $9.6 billion.In the  September 2010 quarter, ADP brought in Revenue of $2.23 billion.  This  leaves $9.6 billion - $2.23 billion = $7.37 billion for the final nine  months of the fiscal year.December quarters are not typically  biggest producers of Revenue for ADP, so we can't simply divide $7.37  billion divided by 3.  Our specific target is $2.36  billion, 32 percent of the nine-month total.ADP's guidance indicates that pretax operating margin  expansion is expected at the company's Employer Services, but margin  declines are expected at PEO Services and Dealer Services.  Acquisition  costs will put negative pressure on margins.  However, since Employer  Services is much bigger than the other units, the company-wide margin  may be flat to slightly positive.In fiscal 2010, the Gross Margin as a percentage of Revenue was 52.1 percent, but it was closer to 50  percent in each of the last two quarters.  Given this information and  the seasonal pattern, we are setting our target for the Gross Margin in  the December quarter at 51 percent.  When combined with our Revenue  estimate, the margin target leads to a forecast for the Cost of Goods Sold-- what ADP calls ""Operating Expenses"" -- of (1 - 0.51) * $2.36 billion = $1.16 billion.  Depreciation  and amortization expenses have been around $60 million per quarter for  nearly three years.  We have no reason to expect a different figure in  the December 2010 quarter.Research and Development expenses (""Systems Development and Programming Costs"") were $135  million in the September 2010 quarter.  We are looking for a similar  figure in the current quarter.Sales, General, and Administrative expenses are more variable.  In the last five fiscal years, the amount  per quarter has ranged from $436 million to $697 million.  As a  percentage of Revenue, SG&A has varied between 20.7 percent and 32.5  percent.  The percentages have generally been falling from year to  year.   Given this data, we are expecting SG&A expenses in the  December 2010 quarter will be 24 percent of Revenue, or 0.24 * $2.36  billion =  $566 million.Rolling up these estimates yields a target for Operating Income, as we define it, of $442 million.  This is 2.4 percent less than Operating Income in the December 2009 quarter.As  for non-operating items (i.e., other income less interest expense), $15  million would seem to be a conservative estimate based on recent  history.We're assuming the effective Income Tax Rate will match fiscal 2010's 35 percent.  This assumption leads to an estimate for Net Income of $297 million ($0.60 per share, depending on the share count).  In  the year-earlier quarter, Net Income from continuing operations was $316  million ($0.62 per share).Please click here to see a normalized depiction of the projected results next to ADP's  quarterly Income Statements for the last couple of years.

225962,22493,2010-09-19T14:54:52-04:00,,"Last week the government released the latest unemployment data. Bloomberg, always ready to roll up the sleeves to help its friends in government (get reelected), was running a headline that said “Companies in U.S. Added 67,000 Jobs in August.”While I haven’t had time to go through the minutiae of the report, I find myself scratching my head at Mr. Market’s rather positive reaction to the report, given the bullet points: The fine folks at Chart of the Day just published their take on the numbers. You may see something cheerful in this snapshot, but if so, it eludes me…A week ago, ADP (NASDAQ:ADP), a company that does real-time payroll processing for about one in every six U.S. workers and whose data – because it is based on hard data and not surveying – has tended to be accurate, released its report for August employment. Interestingly, based on its data, ADP had reported that the construction industry had actually cut 33,000 jobs in August.ADP's data pointed to an overall decline in the work force of 105,000 jobs, worse than the government’s numbers that showed overall unemployment rose by 54,000 – moving the unemployment rate from 9.5% back up to 9.6%.At all times, but especially ahead of an election as important as November’s, you can count me skeptical in the extreme when it comes to government data. Especially when it flies in the face of the clear trends in motion. Even with the government’s stimulus funds still coursing through the economy, in the second quarter U.S. gross domestic product fell by more than half, to an annualized rate of just 1.6%. Without the government’s supercharged spending, it’s been calculated that actual GDP would have been halved again.So, where are all these new private-sector jobs coming from?The construction industry was reported to have hired 19,000 people – a good number of whom, I suspect, are working on government-subsidized projects. At least in this neighborhood – and everywhere else I’ve traveled over the summer – there are almost no new houses being built. But there are a lot of roads being paved, whether they need it or not.It also was reported that 17,000 new temps were hired in August. Historically, the number of temporary workers rises throughout the duration of a recession. In fact, only when the number of temps decisively turns down, in conjunction with full-time employment turning up, can we begin to expect that the economy is on the road to recovery.Healthcare also added a fair number of jobs, over 20,000. The nation’s hospitals and medical facilities are dangerously understaffed – especially ahead of the pending nationalization of the industry and the added demand that will trigger – so this is a bright spot, of sorts.And the mining industry added 8,000 jobs, as you would expect it to. All to the good, until the next round of legislation sends this and other “dirty” businesses back into retreat. (A major overhaul of the U.S. mining regulations was temporarily shelved because the Democrats were concerned it would hamper Nevada senator Harry Reid’s reelection chances. After the elections, expect it to resurface.)However, even if you take the government’s latest unemployment report at face value and accept that the private sector added 67,000 jobs, with overall employment falling again by “just” 54,000, the country still hasn’t even begun the process of clawing back the more than 8.4 million jobs lost since this crisis hit.And, given that the economy is being helped along through overt stimulus and the Fed’s not-so-overt policy of maintaining abnormally low interest rates, conditions for a recovery are about as favorable as they’re going to get.I might quip that the road to recovery will be long indeed, but that would be inappropriate, because so far the road to recovery is nowhere in sight.Disclosure: No positions"

Working Capital  -- the difference between Current Assets and Current Liabilities, but  excluding client funds and obligations  -- is also nearly $1.6 billion.   The amount of Working Capital relative to Revenue is stable. The  Current Ratio, also excluding client funds, slipped under 2.0, which  took a point from the Cash Management gauge score.  However, the ratio  is at its five-year average value.Days of Sales Outstanding, an indicator of cash efficiency, has flattened.Revenue,  CFO, and Net Income growth rates compare the last four quarters to the  four previous quarters.  The Operating Profit rate is the annualized  rate of growth in Operating Profit after Taxes over the last 16  quarters.1. Assets excludes Funds held for clients.The  results of the June quarter enabled trailing-year Revenue growth to get  back over zero, albeit slightly.  Nevertheless, it may be encouraging  that payroll-processor ADP was able to achieve positive Revenue growth  given the high level of unemployment in the U.S. Revenue-to-Assets  declined, but the ratio remains well above its five-year average.  We  exclude Client funds from Assets when making this calculation.The  negative growth rate for Net Income was made worse by a fiscal 2009 tax  settlement that reduced taxes and boosted prior-year income.   Conversely, the growth rate for Cash Flow from Operations benefited from a $158.7 million tax refund received by a Canadian subsidiary of ADP.The  Profitability gauge score reflects the laudable rates of return on  Invested Capital.  The returns are above their five-year averages. Operating Expenses have been stable when assessed on a trailing four quarters basis.  Greater Cash Flow helps the Accrual Ratio's positive assessment of earnings quality.The  Price/Earnings multiple stayed constant because Net Income and the  company's share price declined proportionately in the June quarter.    Since Revenue increased in this period, the Price/Sales Ratio came down a  tad.In general, the current value metrics are attractive when  compared to their five-year averages, but they are not quite as  appealing when compared to their value one year earlier.  This explains  why the Value score was so much higher in June 2009 than June 2010.None  of the gauge scores changed by more than 2 points in the second  quarter.  Small decreases in the Cash Management, Growth, and  Profitability gauges were just slightly more significant than the small  rise in the double-weighted Value gauge.  As mentioned above,  one-time items have skewed some a few of the financial metrics that  determine the gauge scores.   The overall weakness that is  nevertheless evident can be attributed to the negative marginal effects high  unemployment has on a payroll-processing company.Full disclosure: Long ADP at time of writing."

Below are some highlights from the above linked analysis:Company Description: Automatic Data Processing Inc. is one of the world’s largest independent computing services companies, provides a broad range of data processing services.  Fair Value: I consider four calculations of fair value, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:ADP is trading at a discount to 1.) and 3.) above. The stock is trading at a slight premium to its calculated fair value of $39.62. ADP did not earn any Stars in this section.Dividend Analytical Data: In this section there are three possible Stars and three key metrics, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:ADP earned three Stars in this section for 1.), 2.) and 3.) above. A Star was earned since the Free Cash Flow payout ratio was less than 60% and there were no negative Free Cash Flows over the last 10 years. The stock earned a Star as a result of its most recent Debt to Total Capital being less than 45%. ADP earned a Star for having an acceptable score in at least two of the four Key Metrics measured. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1974 and has increased its dividend payments for 34 consecutive years.Dividend Income vs. MMA: Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account (MMA)? This section compares the earning ability of this stock with a high yield MMA. Two items are considered in this section, see page 2 of the linked PDF for a detailed description:ADP earned a Star in this section for its NPV MMA Diff. of the $522. This amount is in excess of the $500 target I look for in a stock that has increased dividends as long as ADP has. If ADP grows its dividend at 5.5% per year, it will take 3 years to equal a MMA yielding an estimated 20-year average rate of 3.71%. ADP earned a check for the Key Metric ‘Years to >MMA’ since its 3 years is less than the 5 year target.Other: ADP is a member of the S&P 500, a Dividend Aristocrat and a member of the Broad Dividend Achievers Index.Conclusion: ADP did not earn any Stars in the Fair Value section, earned three Stars in the Dividend Analytical Data section and earned one Star in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a total of four Stars. This quantitatively ranks ADP as a 4 Star-Buy.Using my D4L-PreScreen.xls model, I determined the share price would need to increase to $41.74 before ADP’s NPV MMA Differential decreased to the $500 minimum that I look for in a stock with 34 years of consecutive dividend increases. At that price the stock would yield 3.23%.Resetting the D4L-PreScreen.xls model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the target $500 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 5.4%. This dividend growth rate is virtually the same as the 5.5% used in this analysis, thus not providing any margin of safety. ADP has a risk rating of 1.00 which classifies it as a low risk stock.A weak economy and low employment levels have negatively impacted ADP, and will likely continue to do so in the near-term. However, as the industry leader ADP enjoys advantages of scale and a respected brand. Financially, the company has a strong balance sheet and steady cash flows from a recurring revenue stream. Recently moving up to a 4-Star rating, ADP is worthy of additional consideration when trading close to my buy price of $39.62. For additional information, including the stock’s dividend history, please refer to its data page.Disclosure: At the time of this writing, I was long in ADP (0.8% of my Income Portfolio).

It operates in three segments: Employer Services, Professional Employer Organization Services, and Dealer Services. This dividend aristocrat has raised dividends for 35 consecutive years. Back in November 2009 Automatic Data Processing announced a 3% dividend increase.Over the past decade this dividend stock has delivered an average total return of 1.20% annually. In 2007 ADP spun off its Brokerage Services business, distributing one share of Broadridge Financial (NYSE:BR) common stock for every four shares of ADP common stock held by shareholders. The total returns calculation for ADP over the past decade includes this transaction.The company has managed to deliver an 8.10% average annual increase in its EPS between 2000 and 2009. Analysts expect Automatic Data Processing to earn $2.40 share in FY 2010, followed by an increase to $2.55/share in FY 2011. While the employment picture is bleak in the US, it is improving. In addition to that, the market for payroll outsourcing for small and medium sized businesses could provide opportunities for growth, because of low penetration from outsourcers. The market for processing services that ADP specializes in is expected to grow at a pace of 5% per annum until 2013. The company's venture in the business process outsourcing is a bold move, considering the intense competition in this market segment, which could add pressure to margins. The market for business process outsourcing is expected to grow by almost 7% per year by 2013. Overall there is a high barrier to entry in the payroll processing field, since a sizeable investment in infrastructure is needed to process millions of employees' information. The big plus of this business is the recurring revenue stream and strong cash flow. ADP is a great proxy for exposure to the technology sector, since it has a proven business model, and it is less susceptible to technological obsolescence. As prices for technology products decrease, ADP can do its job cheaper, which helps profitability.The Return on Equity has remained in a tight range between 17% and 26%. Rather than focus on absolute values for this indicator, I generally want to see at least a stable return on equity over time.Annual dividends have increased by an average of 15.90% annually since 2000, which is higher than the growth in EPS. A 16 % growth in dividends translates into the dividend payment doubling every four and a half years. If we look at historical data, going as far back as 1974, Automatic Data Processing has indeed managed to double its dividend payment every four and a half years.Over the past decade the dividend payout ratio has doubled to 50%. This is a direct result of the higher dividend growth in proportion to earnings growth. As the company matures, it has returned most of its earnings back to stockholders in the form of increased distributions and share buybacks. A lower payout is always a plus, since it leaves room for consistent dividend growth minimizing the impact of short-term fluctuations in earnings.Currently Automatic Data Processing is attractively valued at 15.60 times earnings, yields 3.20% and has an adequately covered dividend payment. In comparison to its closest competitor Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), which trades at a P/E of 20.40 and yields 4.60% with a dividend payout ratio of 94%. I view ADP as more attractively valued. I would be looking forward to adding to my position in Automatic Data Processing (ADP) on dips.Disclosure: Long ADP"

ADP pays one of every six private  sector employees  in the U.S. ADP is one of four    remaining U.S. companies with a AAA bond  rating.  It is also an S&P 500 Dividend   Aristocrat, having hiked its dividend for 35 consecutive years.Fortune Magazine deemed ADP to be most admired in the Financial Data Services industry.ADP earned  $1.3 billion on revenue of $8.9 billion in fiscal 2009,  which ended June  2009.  It has a market capitalization of about $20  billion.The  company, according to its latest 10-K, has three main   businesses: Employer Services,Professional   Employer Organization Services, and Dealer Services.  Employer   Services processes payrolls, administers benefits, and performs other   services to enable firms ""to staff, manage, pay and retain their   employees.""  PEO Services, by establishing co-employment relationships with customers and their   employees, enables businesses to outsource various functions.  In this   arrangement, an ADP entity becomes the employer of record for the   affected employees.  Dealer Services helps dealers of vehicles and   machinery manage their business activities.The Employer Services business segment contributed   nearly three-quarters of the total revenue in fiscal 2000.  Competitors   include Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), the  now-private Ceridian,  and India's Wipro (NYSE: WIT).As  a payroll processor, ADP is sensitive to changes in Employment.    From the payroll data it collects, the company issues the monthly ADP National Employment  Report on  non-farm private employment.Dealer Services  revenue has been adversely affected by the  downturn in vehicle sales and  the closing of many dealerships.In  2007, ADP divested its Brokerage Services Group business, which  became Broadridge Financial Solutions(NYSE: BR).  (GCFR articles related to Broadridge can   be found here.)  In accordance with an outsourcing agreement   between the two companies, ADP has been providing data center services   to Broadridge.  In 2010, Broadridge notified ADP it would not extend the   agreement beyond its 30 June 2012 expiration date.  ADP does not   anticipate that end of this relationship will have a material impact.In fiscal 2010's third quarter,   which ended 31 March 2010, ADP earned $0.80 per share, the same as in   2009.Now, we are ready to look ahead to ADP's results for  the June 2010  quarter.In the earnings announcement released in   April 2010, ADP updated its Revenue and EPS forecasts for fiscal 2010.In accordance with the guidance, we are assuming Revenue in fiscal 2010 will match fiscal 2009's $8.87 billion of Revenue.  In   the first three quarters of the current fiscal year, ADP had Revenue of   $6.75 billion, which leaves $2.12 billion for the final quarter. This  amount is only 0.6 percent greater than Revenue of $2.11 billion  in the  June 2009 period.The only guidance ADP provided in regard to  its operating margins is  that ""We continue to anticipate no improvement  in segment pretax  margins.""  ADP's Gross Margin was  53.75 percent in fiscal  2009, and it has been 52.6 percent during the  first three quarters of  fiscal 2010.  We assume it will be only 52.0  percent in the June  quarter.  This is equivalent to forecasting that the Cost of Goods Sold-- what  ADP calls ""Operating  Expenses"" -- will equal (1 - 0.52) * $2.12 billion =  $1.02 billion.  Depreciation and  amortization expenses have  been around $60 million per quarter for  nearly three years. We have no reason to expect a different figure in   the June 2010 quarter. Similarly, it seems  reasonable to  assume Research and Development  (R&D) expenses  (""Systems Development and Programming Costs"")  will continue to be  approximately $130 million per quarter.Sales, General, and  Administrative (SG&A) expenses are more variable -- the amount  has been as low as 22 percent  of Revenue and as high as 32 percent  during the last five years --  and  June quarters tend to have a  relatively SG&A expense relative to  Revenue.  With this in mind, we  are expecting SG&A expenses in the  current quarter will be 27  percent of Revenue, or 0.27 * $2.12 billion  =  $572 million.Rolling up these estimates yields a target for Operating Income,  as we define it, of  $340 million.  This is 1.9 percent more than  Operating Income in the  June 2009 quarter.As for non-operating items (i.e., other income less   interest expense), $10 million would seem to be a conservative estimate   based on recent history. We're assuming the  effective Income  Tax Rate will match last quarter's 36.6 percent, and  we threw in $5  million loss on discontinued operations.  With these  assumptions, Net Income will be  $217 million ($0.43 per  share, depending on the share count).  In the  year-earlier quarter,  which benefited from a $120 million favorable tax  settlement, Net  Income from continuing operations was $353 million  ($0.70 per share).This earnings per share estimate for the  quarter would result in annual  earnings of $2.41 per share, which is  several cents above the  company's guidance.  If the actual EPS amount  equals the guidance, it  will be interesting to learn where we were  (unintentionally)  optimistic.Please click here to see a full-sized,   normalized depiction of the projected results next to ADP's quarterly   Income Statements for the last couple of years.  Please note that our   organization of revenues, expenses, gains, and losses, which we use for   all analyses, can and often does differ in material respects from   company-used formats.

Review the Free Cash Flow record here.The resulting estimated intrinsic value per share (discounted back to the present) is approximately $46.61.Market Price = $41.73 Intrinsic Value = $46.61 (estimated) Debt/Equity ratio = .01 Price To Value (P/V) ratio = .9 and the estimated bargain = 10. percent.Before we make a purchase, we must decide ( filter #1 ) if ADP is a high quality business with good economics. Does ADP have ( filter #2 ) enduring competitive advantages, and does ADP have ( filter #3 ) honest and able management.The current price/earnings ratio = 15.6It 's current return on capital = 19.99Using a debt to equity ratio of .01, ADP shows a 5-year average return on equity = 18.7Some industries have higher ROE because they require no assets, such as consulting firms. Other industries require large infrastructure builds before they generate a penny of profit, such as oil refiners. Generally, capital-intensive businesses have higher barriers to entry, which limit competition. But, high-ROE firms with small asset bases have lower barriers to entry. Thus, such firms face more business risk because competitors can replicate their success without having to obtain much outside funding.Growth benefits investors only when the business in point can invest at incremental returns that are enticing; only when each dollar used to finance the growth creates over a dollar of long-term market value. In the case of a low-return business requiring incremental funds, growth hurts the investor. The wonderful companies sustain a competitive advantage, produce free cash flow, and use debt wisely.Does ADP make for an intelligent investment or speculation today? Time is said to be the friend of the wonderful company and the enemy of the mediocre one. Before making an investment decision, seek understanding about the company, its products, and its sustainable competitive advantages over competitors. Next, look for able and trustworthy managers who are focused more on value than just growth. Finally ask: Is there a bargain relative to its intrinsic value per share today?Great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misapraised. In terms of Opportunity Cost, is ADP the best place to invest our money today?Time Forward Projection:How will ADP compete going forward? Keep in mind that a financial report like this is a reflection of the past and present. It may be used to project a future, but it may not account for factors yet unseen. Therefore, pay attention to competitive and market factors that may affect changes in profitability.In summary, using a debt to equity ratio of .01, ADP shows a 5-year average return on equity = 18.7 . Based on a holding and compounding period of 10 years, and a purchase price bargain of 10. percent, and a relative FCF growth of 7 percent, then the estimated effective annual yield on this investment may be greater than 8.1 %.Going forward, are there any tranformational catalysts or condition indicators imaginable on the horizon?As always, I appreciate hearing your views.Disclosure: No positions"

In Part 2, we present the final five of 10 examples. As a reminder, the sectors were listed and picked at random and are not offered in any specific order. Our goal is to present one company from each of the 10 sectors that make up the S&P 500. Also, once again, note that even though the S&P 500 is a weighted index, this more concentrated group of only 10 companies is presented equally weighted.For those of you that missed Part 1, the criteria we used to make each selection are repeated below:Above-average AchieversIn order to compile this list of above-average achievers in both capital appreciation and current dividend yield, each company had to meet certain criteria. First of all, each selection had to have historical earnings-per-share growth in excess of the S&P 500 index. Next, each selection had to have a current dividend yield that was higher than the 2.2% current yield for the S&P 500.Since valuation is very important, each company had to have a current P/E ratio that was no more than 120% of the modern 17.5 historical normal S&P 500 P/E ratio. Also, because controlling risk was a major consideration, only companies with a market cap greater than $5 billion were included.Sector Six: EnergyFigure 8A and 8B look at Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX). This is the world's fourth-largest energy company on proven reserves of both oil and natural gas. Chevron Corp. currently trades at under 11 times earnings and offers a dividend yield of 3.9%.Figure 8A CVX 11yr EPS Growth Correlated to PriceFigure 8B calculates the performance associated with Figure 8A. Clearly this leading integrated oil and gas producer has rewarded its shareholders quite well since calendar 2000 in contrast to the losses received from passive investors in the S&P 500.Figure 8B CVX 11yr Dividend and Price PerformanceSector Seven: HealthcareFigures 9A and 9B look at Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). The recent weakness in the stock market and a recent recall and marketing faux pas has caused Johnson & Johnson's stock price to trade at one of its lowest valuations in over 20 years. Notwithstanding these issues, Johnson & Johnson recently raised their dividend by 10.2%.Figure 9A JNJ 11yr EPS Growth Correlated to PriceFigure 9B calculates the performance associated with Figure 9A. With share price starting out above JNJ’s earnings justified value and currently trading below its earnings justified level has masked the full measure of JNJ’s consistent operating performance. However, this quality company was still able to generate a positive rate of return coupled with a solid and growing dividend income stream.Figure 9B JNJ 11yr Dividend and Price PerformanceSector Eight: TelecommunicationsFigures 10A and 10B look at CenturyLink Inc. (CTL), formerly known as CenturyTel Inc. This rural focused telecom carrier is the fourth largest telephone company in the United States. Although historical earnings growth over 13% has been significantly above average, future growth is only expected to average a much more subdued rate of 3%.Cognizant of this fact, CenturyLink has increased their payout ratio dramatically since calendar year 2008. Therefore, although they offer the highest current yield of the companies in this article, CenturyLink is also expected to have the lowest future rate of earnings growth.Figure 10A CTL 11yr EPS Growth Correlated to PriceFigure 10B calculates the performance associated with Figure 10A. An abnormally high beginning valuation and the subsequently current low valuation based on reduced growth expectations, has caused this once fast grower to underperform the S&P 500. We found this to be the most difficult industry to find a suitable selection in. Legacy telecom companies have questionable future fundamentals, and the more modern wireless companies do not meet our dividend requirements.Figure 10B CTL 11yr Dividend and Price PerformanceSector Nine: UtilitiesFigures 11A and 11B look at NextEra Energy, Inc. (FPL-OLD), formally known as Florida Power & Light. The new name describes a strategy that many electric utilities are utilizing in order to diversify away from their regulated businesses.In order to grow going forward, utilities need to find growth opportunities that are not controlled by regulation. Since calendar year 2000, NextEra Energy, Inc. has grown earnings at a compounded rate over 7%; current estimates expect earnings growth over the next five years to be slightly above 6%.Figure 11A FPL 11yr EPS Growth Correlated to PriceFigure 11B calculates the performance associated with Figure 11A. Since NextEra Energy, Inc. was undervalued at both the beginning and the end of this time period, shareholder returns correlate very closely to operating earnings growth. Additionally, their dividend has increased at a rate that is consistent with earnings growth. When valuations are aligned, shareholder returns will logically be a reflection of the companies compounded annual growth rate in earnings per share.Figure 11B FPL 11yr Dividend and Price PerformanceSector 10: Information TechnologyFigure 12A and 12B look at Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), the 10th and final company in our series. Automatic Data Processing is the nation’s largest payroll and tax filing processor. From Figure 11A it is very clear that Automatic Data Processing was excessively overvalued in calendar year 2000.However, until only recently, it is clear that the stock market has generally capitalized this extremely high quality company at a premium level. The current dividend yield is in line with a ten-year T-bond and about a third higher than the average company in the S&P 500.Figure 12A ADP 11yr EPS Growth Correlated to PriceFigure 12B calculates the performance associated with Figure 12A. Due to excessive overvaluation in calendar 2000, above-average earnings growth was not able to overcome the high valuation. Consequently, Automatic Data Processing produced a loss for its shareholders. However, current consensus estimates for five-year future growth are in excess of 12% which augurs very well for future shareholder returns.This assumes that the market will assess a high valuation for this blue-chip company in the future as it has in the past. Also, the Information Technology Sector has long been thought of as a growth sector rather than a dividend income play. But as the industry matures, that is changing, as there are currently several other companies in this sector with dividend yield greater than 3%.Figure 12B ADP 11yr Dividend and Price PerformanceSound PrinciplesThere are several principles and lessons that we are hopeful this article illuminates. One of the great advantages of our EDMP, Inc. F.A.S.T. Graphs™ is the ability to receive an instant perspective of how well a company has been historically managed. When valuations are in line with earnings justified levels, then performance tends to mirror and or correlate very closely to the rate of change of earnings growth.Prospective investors can have a reasonably accurate estimation of the rate of return a company is capable of generating based on its historical earnings growth record. On the other hand, investing is about looking forward instead of looking into the rearview mirror. Therefore, forecasting future earnings is the key to successful future results.Valuation Based On Growth RateAnother valuable feature of our EDMP, Inc. F.A.S.T. Graphs™ is assisting investors in making a prudent decision on knowing when to buy. Generally speaking, risk and rate of return tend to be closely related, i.e., the greater the risk the higher the return potential should be; the lower the risk the lower the return potential should be. Therefore, our EDMP, Inc. F.A.S.T. Graphs™ offers three iterations of the earnings justified valuation level based on rates of growth and risk. Typically, faster growers tend to command higher valuations (PE ratios) and are therefore usually considered riskier. Our research has identified three key ranges of growth that define value based on earnings growth rates.Companies growing at 15% a year or better will calculate a PEG ratio (Price Equal to Growth rate) orange line with white triangles, earnings justified valuation line. Of the ten companies in this series only HCBK and CVX graphs are listed as a PEG ratio multiple. Companies growing at 5% or less will calculate an orange line with white triangles earnings justified value line, utilizing Ben Graham's classic formula for valuing a company. These slow growers will be marked with an orange GDF followed by a number which equals the fair value PE ratio. None of the examples in this article were GDF companies. Finally, in the middle are companies growing between 10% and 15% per annum. These companies are typically more mature and pay a dividend. The orange line with white triangles (earnings justified valuation line), in these examples represents an EDMP modified version of the previous two graph types. These graphs will be marked with an orange GDF-EDMP followed by a number representing the fair valuation for this group of companies. The majority of the examples in this article are GDF-EDMP graph types.Risk vs. RewardOnce again, as a general rule the faster the growth, the higher the risk. Therefore, the risk an investor is willing to assume will be a key factor in which of the three groups he or she should choose from. The most important points to understand here are that when taking lower risk one must also be willing to accept a lower rate of return.Valuation MattersAlso, the rate of return one should intelligently expect from an investment in any company will correlate to the rate of change of earnings growth the company is capable of achieving. History clearly establishes this fact, and therefore, we see the evidence as undeniable and conclusive, assuming of course, that valuations are in line with earnings justified levels when purchases are made.The Key: Forecasting the FutureAdditionally, the lesson that making investment judgments based purely on current metrics can often prove misleading. In the ten examples cited above, future returns based solely on current yield does not necessarily imply good returns in the future. The quality of the company and the consistency and dynamic of its operating history can be very enlightening and important information to know. Even though EDMP, Inc. F.A.S.T. Graphs™ provide a vital fundamental perspective of a company and its business, they are no substitute for comprehensive and thorough research. Companies and industries are subject to change and no chart or graph is capable of telling the future. Only hard work and diligence are capable of assisting in that task.SummaryThese ten selections, one from each sector of the S&P 500, have outperformed the S&P 500 historically. If an investor expects to outperform a benchmark index like the S&P 500 in the future, it's imperative that rational thought and behavior be applied to the task. Common sense would dictate that above-average companies like the ten covered here that have produced above-average results, are a good place to begin looking for above-average future returns. The idea behind this article was to provide an example of how this task could be accomplished in a sound and prudent manner. A well thought-out and executed buy-and-hold strategy is still an effective and viable approach as evidenced by the ten companies reviewed above. However, there are two keys to success. First, an achievable forecast for above-average future earnings growth is essential, and second, the stock must be trading at or below its earning justified level when purchased.Disclaimer: The opinions in this document are for informational and educational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to buy or sell the stocks mentioned or to solicit transactions or clients.

218523,20568,2010-08-04T11:20:17-04:00,,"By Dirk van Dijk, CFA    Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) reported that the private sector added 42,000 jobs in July,  significantly higher than both the 19,000 gained in June according to  its survey (revised up from 13,000, but still well below the 83,000  private sector job gains reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics) and  well ahead of the consensus expectations of a gain of 25,000 on the  survey.As by far the largest payroll processor in the country, ADP is in a good  position to assess the overall health of the private sector job market,  although its figures have often differed significantly from the  official Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) numbers, which come out on  Friday. This was the sixth straight month of private sector job gains,  according to ADP.If, as this report suggests, the private sector also gains jobs  according to the BLS, it will be the seventh straight month according to  that report (although the disagreement about January is relatively  small in absolute numbers -- a small gain versus a very small loss).Services vs. Goods ProducingThe service sector gained 63,000 jobs in the month, offset by a loss of  21,000 in the goods producing sector. Within the goods producing sector,  factory jobs fell by 6,000 -- the first decline in six months. That is  at odds with the ISM manufacturing survey that came out on Monday, which  suggested further job gains in manufacturing in July.The construction industry lost another 17,000 jobs (implying that mining  added 2,000 jobs to get to 21,000 lost in all of goods producing). That  is the smallest loss of construction jobs since November of 2007. The  construction industry has been extremely hard-hit in this recession --  it has lost jobs in every month since January of 2007, and the total  losses are 2.240 million.The losses in that industry partially explain why the unemployment rate  has risen so much more for those without any college education than for  those who have a degree. It is an industry that historically has  provided fairly high-paying jobs for those without that much formal  education.Small vs. Medium vs. Big BusinessBroken down by firm size, it looks like we are seeing the start of a  comeback in small-firm hiring. Small firms (under 50 employees) added a  total of 21,000 employees -- 29,000 in the service sector, offset by a  decline of 8,000 in the goods producing sector.Medium-sized businesses (between 50 and 499 employees) also added 21,000  jobs in total -- 24,000 in services offset by a loss of 3,000 in goods  producing. The improvement in medium-sized businesses was actually a bit  stronger than in small businesses since 48.255 million people work for  small businesses, and 41.211 million work for medium-sized businesses,  so on a percentage basis, medium-sized businesses did slightly better on  the job-creation front.Large business, in aggregate, kept payrolls unchanged in July, with a  gain of 10,000 service jobs offset by a loss of 10,000 goods producing  jobs for the month. The decline in large goods producing jobs is  somewhat of a surprise since auto companies like Ford (NYSE:F) have been adding workers.  That is a very small part of the overall job picture, just 3.36 million  in total, or 3.23% of all private sector jobs.BLS Numbers to Include Census LayoffsThe ADP numbers only cover the private sector, not any government  employees. The headline numbers the BLS reports on Friday are likely to  be much lower than the 42,000 job gain showed by ADP. The census is  almost complete, and the federal government will be laying off more of  the temporary census workers in July.Census workers have been a big distortion to the jobs numbers this  year. They added 400,000 to payrolls in May, but then subtracted 225,000  in June. In July, layoffs of census workers will probably reduce  overall payroll employment by about 145,000 or so. Census workers have  been completing their jobs far faster than anyone had expected, and much  faster than they have during previous census years. That is because,  due to high unemployment, the census has had a much more talented pool  of people to draw upon, and they have been much more productive.However, the reward for that increased productivity has been quicker  pink slips. All the rewards of increased productivity (and productivity  growth over the last year is the highest it has been in over 50 years)  have been going to the employers, not the employees. Apparently, that is  just as true for the federal government as an employer as it is for  private employers. Nobody can accurately claim that the administration  is keeping the census workers around longer than needed to make the  employment situation look better than it is.State and  Local Government JobsIn addition, State and Local payrolls are likely to be falling, as those  governments are facing massive budget shortfalls and are not allowed by  law to run operating deficits. Their only choices (unless help comes  from Washington, and that help has been repeatedly stalled by  filibusters in the Senate) are to either raise taxes or cut spending.The biggest line item in any state or local government is going to be  salaries.  Look for lots of layoffs for teachers, police and  firefighters, as well as people like health inspectors for restaurants.  The line at the DMV is also likely to be much longer next time you go to  renew your license, since there will be fewer people working there.It is hard to see how laying off teachers and having 35 or 40 students  in a classroom is going to be good for the economy in either the short  term or the long term. It is going to be very hard for America to  compete in the 21st Century if most of our workforce is made up of  functional illiterates.While overall this is a slightly encouraging report, it does not  indicate the sort of job growth that is going to be making a significant  dent in the unemployment rate.Disclosure: No positions"
214324,23179,2010-07-13T16:19:09-04:00,,"BackgroundAutomatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP), headquartered in Roseland, New Jersey, is one of the world's largest providers of business outsourcing solutions. Over 570,000 clients benefit from ADP's six decades of experience providing a wide range of human resources, payroll, tax filing and benefits administration solutions from this single source.Over 70% of their $9 billion in revenues comes from ADP’s stature as the nation's largest payroll and tax filing processor. ADP's Professional Employer Organization segment (PEO) provides comprehensive human resource (HR) solutions to small and midsize companies and generates 10% to 15% of their revenues. Their Dealer Services segment generates the remainder of their revenues (approximately 14% to 15%) by providing integrated services to more than 25,000 dealers of automobiles, trucks, motorcycles and marine recreational vehicles worldwide.Financial StrengthAutomatic Data Processing, Inc. enjoys one of the highest credit ratings of any company in the S&P 500. Value Line rates them No. 1, the highest in safety with a financial strength rating of A++. Standard & Poor's rates their debt AAA and stable, a rating that very few companies are given. These high marks are thanks to a pristine balance sheet with over $4.00 a share in cash and very little debt. Argus maintains that Automatic Data Processing, Inc. has one of the strongest balance sheets of any US company.We believe that Automatic Data Processing, Inc.’s superb financial condition provides shareholders several benefits. Their dividend, currently at over 3.3%, is historically high and well protected by cash flows. In addition to a secure dividend, Automatic Data Processing, Inc., has plenty left over to continue making strategic acquisitions and for funding share buybacks.Fundamentals at a GlanceFigure 1 below looks at Automatic Data Processing, Inc. through the lens of our EDMP, Inc. F.A.S.T. Graphs™ since calendar year 1996. There are three elements on this Fundamentals at a Glance graph that are noteworthy.The first is the earnings line, the orange line with white triangles, plotted based on the GDF-EDMP modified formula for value of 17.3 times earnings. Note that Automatic Data Processing, Inc. has historically traded at a quality premium to their earnings justified value.This leads to the second noteworthy element, ADP’s historically normal PE ratio of 25.7, the blue line with asterisks. This clearly illustrates the quality premium the market has traditionally placed on their shares.The third and final element is the mustard yellow cash flow plot marked with a “C”. We believe this clearly indicates that Automatic Data Processing, Inc has historically been both a quality and a cash flow story.Figure 1 ADP 15yr. Earnings & Cash Flow Correlated to PriceThesis for GrowthAutomatic Data Processing, Inc.’s current historically low valuation is, we believe, attributable to expected flattish earnings growth for fiscal 2010 (ended in June). ADP will report earnings on July 29, 2010. Furthermore, only modest growth of 5% or so is expected for fiscal 2011, which would take earnings to $2.50-$2.55 range per share for this fiscal year. In our opinion, current headwinds which include low employment, low interest rates and weak vehicle sales of all types are the main culprits behind Automatic Data Processing, Inc.'s current low valuation.Management has indicated seeing signs of employment in the U.S. stabilizing, and therefore, has added sales people to take advantage of this improving climate. Furthermore, ADP’s sales to small and midsize companies are currently exceeding expectations.However, since pressure continues for their biggest U.S. clients, management has narrowed guidance for fiscal 2010 to $2.36-$2.38 on flattish revenues. Longer term, the increasing trend for outsourcing computing solutions, in addition to ADP’s leading position in payroll and tax augurs well for future growth to eventually resume to more normal higher rates.Looking further out, however, the prospects for reacceleration of earnings growth seem brighter. According to IDC, the market for Human Resources management services, which is Automatic Data Processing, Inc.'s largest segment, is huge at almost $105 billion and is expected to grow at approximately 5% or better into 2013.Similar growth is expected for processing services were Automatic Data Processing, Inc. holds a dominant position. Finally, as economic activity improves worldwide, an expected strengthening in employment and potentially better vehicle sales are pluses.Figure 2 below calculates performance associated with Figure 1 above. The 8.6% average earnings growth rate Automatic Data Processing, Inc. has generated since 1996 (see Figure 1) has slowed to approximately 5.6% since calendar 2006. However, shareholders have been compensated by a higher dividend payout ratio beginning in calendar 2007, which has also led to a temporary acceleration in ADP’s dividend growth rate. Also, even considering today's current low valuation, they nevertheless outperformed the S&P 500 since 1996.Figure 2 ADP 15yr. Performance HistoryFigure 3 provides a five-year forecast for earnings and dividend growth of 11%, based on the current consensus of 24 leading analysts reporting to FirstCall. This forecast implies a closing price of $60.54 on 12/31/2015 assuming a price earnings ratio of 15 according to our calculation based on our modified GDF-EDMP formula for value (see flag on Figure 3 with red arrow).This is more in line with Automatic Data Processing, Inc.'s historical achievement of 10% to 15% earnings growth prior to the recent slowdown due to the “great recession.” It's important to note from Figure 1 above, that although growth temporary slowed down, Automatic Data Processing, Inc.'s earnings and cash flows held up remarkably well through it all.Figure 3 ADP 5yr. Consensus Earnings EstimateConclusionAutomatic Data Processing, Inc. is an extremely high quality U.S. corporation that is currently trading at a historically low valuation. Therefore, their current entry dividend yield is abnormally high and we believe, well protected by strong cash flows and an impeccable balance sheet. Therefore, we believe that investors seeking safety, and an increasing dividend, coupled with above-average growth potential might consider Automatic Data Processing, Inc. for long-term investment.Disclosure: Long ADP at the time of writing."
188988,23088,2010-02-17T08:41:04-05:00,,"By Mike YamamotoAutomatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) saw a late-day surge of upside option trading yesterday ahead of a meeting with analysts this morning.Traders began snapping up calls in the March 43 and May 44 strikes in the last half-hour of yesterday's session. The call volume yesterday totaled 7,853 in the March contracts and 4,450 in the May options, clearly unusual activity because the two strikes have averaged a grand total of 23 and 21 each per day for the last month. Most of the March 43 calls were bought for $0.20 and $0.25 while nearly all of the May 44 contracts went for $0.50. Open interest was just 354 and 704 contracts respectively at these strikes, indicating that the calls were bought to open new positions. Shares of the human resource services company closed yesterday up 1.75 percent to $41.30, rallying at the end of the day after the option action. ADP spiked higher after beating earnings estimates on Nov. 4 and ran for the next month to its 52-week high of $44.50, but the stock has been in a steady downtrend ever since.ADP would need to rise some 4.7 percent for the March calls bought yesterday to turn a profit. The shares would have to gain roughly 7.7 percent for the May calls to make money. The analyst conference will be webcast today at 8:45 a.m. ET. ADP is also scheduled to hold its annual ""Meeting of the Minds"" conference in late March."
201167,20568,2010-04-27T16:47:13-04:00,,"Operating Performance  Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) announced operating results for the third quarter of fiscal  2010. Net earnings from continuing operations for the quarter were 79  cents per share, one cent above the Zacks Consensus Estimate. However,  earnings per share were down by one cent from 80 cents reported in the  year-ago quarter. EPS was affected by a higher effective tax rate in the  quarter and higher cost of sales. The quarter benefited from improved demand in Employer Services and PEO  Services, the slowdown in the decline of pays per control and client  retention rate compared to the year-ago period. Management said that the  Dealer Services continued to execute well in the challenging automotive  marketplace, with significant growth in new business sales during the  quarter. Additionally, ADP closed four strategic acquisitions in its Employer  Services business during the quarter, which is expected to add over $10  million in revenues and dilute EPS by about 1 cent per share in fiscal  2010. During the quarter, ADP completed the sale of Dealer Services' non-core  Commercial business, which was part of the 2005 Kerridge Computer  acquisition. The results of operations for this business are reported  within discontinued operations. Gross margins decreased to 45.5% in the quarter from 48.7% in the  year-ago period, due to higher Systems development and programming  costs. Operating margin of 24.9 % benefited from improved sales and lower  selling, general and administrative expenses, which declined 3% year  over year. Revenue Third quarter revenues of $2.44 billion were up 3.1% year over year, of  which 2% of the growth came from favorable foreign currency gain.  However, this was partially offset by a negative effect of the economic  downturn. By segment, Employer Services and PEO Services segments performed well  in the quarter as sales increased 1% (all organic) and 15.1%,  respectively. However, this was partially offset by Dealer Services  segment sales, which fell 3% year over year. The growth in Employer Services revenue was due to higher payroll  revenues, which grew 8%, partially offset by a 3% decline in revenues  from traditional payroll and payroll tax filing business in the United  States. The number of employees on the company’s clients' payrolls in  the U.S. declined 2.5%, as measured on a same-store-sales basis for  clients on AutoPay platform. Worldwide client revenue retention improved  1.4% from the last year. Employer Services' pretax margin was flat compared to the year-ago  period as the benefits from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009  restructuring and growth in client funds balances were offset by fewer  W2's processed due to lower employment levels, continued investment in  client facing-resources as well as the dilutive impact of recent  acquisition activity. PEO Services' revenues increased due to higher pass-through revenues and  an increase in the number of worksite employees. PEO Services' pretax  margin declined 200 basis points, primarily due to the impact of  one-time items in both the current and prior-year quarters and higher  pass-through costs. Average worksite employees paid increased 5% to  nearly 206,000. The decline in Dealer Services' revenues was attributable to the  cumulative impact of dealership closings, along with lower transactional  revenues and lower international software license fee revenues. Dealer  Services' pretax margin increased 140 basis points, benefiting from  lower headcount levels resulting from the fourth quarter fiscal 2009  restructuring as well as other cost containment measures. For the quarter, interest on funds held for clients declined 10% year  over year to $147.9 million, due to a decline of 50 basis points in the  average interest yield to 3.2% due to the seasonally high level of  client funds that are invested overnight, partially offset by an  increase of 4.8% in average client funds balances.Balance  Sheet Automatic Data Processing ended the quarter with $2.1 billion million in  cash and marketable securities (including long-term) and $41.3 million  in long-term debt. The company acquired over 6.5 million shares of its  stock for treasury at a cost of nearly $280 million as of March 31,  2010.Guidance Updated Management said that its key business metrics showed improvement during  the quarter, and were consistent with the company’s expectations,  despite the continued effect from the recession. However, increased  investment is expected to pressure the company’s near-term earnings  growth. Thus the company expects fiscal 2010 to be flat compared to  2009. Management expects earnings per share to be in the range of $2.36 –  $2.38 compared to $2.38 generated in fiscal 2009. Earnings per share  from continuing operations in fiscal 2010 and 2009 have each been  reduced by 1 cent as a result of discontinued operations. The current  Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for $2.40 in EPS for 2010, above the  company’s guidance. Automatic Data Processing expects flat year-over-year revenues for  fiscal 2010. By segments, Employer Services revenue is expected to decline by 1%,  with an average decline of about 4% in pays per control for the full  year. The company expects client revenue retention to be about flat with  last year.   PEO Services revenue is expected to increase 8% to 10%, driven by  increased pass-through revenues. The company anticipates slightly  positive combined Employer Services and PEO Services worldwide new  business sales growth. Dealer Services revenue is expected to decline by  3% to 4% with no improvement in the segment’s pretax margin."
196756,23050,2010-04-02T02:35:32-04:00,,"We begin by reviewing  background information about ADP and the  business environment in which  it is currently operating.   Automatic Data  Processing performs payroll, tax, and other  personnel-related Business Services  for over  500,000 clients, large and small.  ADP pays one of every six private  sector employees  in the United States.  ADP earned $1.3 billion on  revenue of $8.9 billion in fiscal 2009,  which ended last June.  The  Employer Services segment contributed  nearly three-quarters of the total  revenue.  ADP has a current market  capitalization of about $22.5  billion.   Competitors include Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), the  now-private Ceridian,  and India's Wipro (NYSE: WIT).  ADP  is one of four   remaining of U.S. companies with a AAA bond  rating.  It is also an S&P 500 Dividend   Aristocrat, having hiked its dividend   for 35 consecutive years.   Fortune Magazine deemed ADP to be Most   Admired in the Financial Data Services industry.  As a payroll  processor, ADP directly feels the effects of lower Total   Non-farm Employment and the higher Unemployment Rate in the U.S.  The weak labor market today is   illustrated vividly in the monthly ADP National Employment  Report on non-farm  private employment, which ADP creates based on  payroll data.   In 2007, ADP divested its Brokerage Services Group  business, which  became Broadridge Financial  Solutions (NYSE: BR).  GCFR articles related to Broadridge can   be found here.  Now, we are ready to look ahead to ADP's  results for the March 2010  quarter.  In its earnings announcement released   in February 2010, ADP updated its Revenue and EPS forecasts for fiscal   2010.Given this guidance, we are  assuming Revenue   in fiscal 2010 will match (i.e., be flat relative to) the $8.87  billion  of Revenue in fiscal 2009.  In the first half of the current  fiscal  year, ADP had Revenue of $4.30 billion, which leaves $4.57  billion for  the second half.  In the last few years, the March quarter has  been responsible for 52 to  53 percent of second-half Revenue.  This  suggests to us that Revenue  in the March quarter should be around 0.525 *  $4.57 billion= $2.40  billion.   The Gross Margin has  been close to 52 percent of  Revenue in each of the last three quarters.   However, ADP's margin  is typically much more lucrative, for  whatever reason, in March  quarters.  Assuming the seasonal pattern will  repeat, we are choosing  54 percent as our Gross Margin target for the  latest quarter.  This is  equivalent to forecasting that the Cost of Goods Sold -- what  ADP calls ""Operating  Expenses"" -- will equal (1 - 0.54) * $2.4 billion =  $1.1 billion.   Depreciation and  amortization expenses have  been around $60 million in each of the last  eight quarters.  We have no  reason to expect a materially different  figure in the March 2010  quarter.  Similarly,  it seems reasonable to assume Research and Development  (R&D) expenses  (""Systems Development and Programming Costs"")  will continue to be about  $125 million per quarter.  Sales, General, and  Administrative (SG&A)  expenses are more variable -- the amount  has been as low as 22 percent  of Revenue and as high as 32 percent  during the last five years --  but  March quarters tend to have the least  SG&A expense relative to  Revenue.  In addition, a declining expense  trend is evident.  With  these factors in mind, we are expecting  SG&A expenses in the  current quarter to be 23 percent of Revenue, or  0.23 * $2.40 billion =   $552 million.  Rolling up these estimates yields a target for Operating Income,  as we define it, of  $559 million.  This is 12 percent less than  Operating Income in the  March 2009 quarter. ADP  reported that it received $14.8 million (pretax) in the March  quarter  from the Reserve Fund.  The company had previously written off  some or all  of this investment.  As for the more run-of-the-mill  non-operating  items (i.e., other income less interest expense), $25  million would seem  to be a reasonable estimate based on recent  history.  If the Income Tax Rate is 36 percent, Net Income will be  $383 million ($0.76 per  share, depending on share repurchases).  In the  year-earlier quarter,  Net Income from continuing operations was $403  million ($0.80 per  share).

179678,23050,2009-12-24T01:54:40-05:00,,"Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ: ADP) earned $0.56 per share in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, which ended 30 September 2009, up from $0.54 in the same quarter of last year.    In November, we   examined ADP's Income Statement for the September quarter and compared the entries on each line to our ""look-ahead"" estimates.  We later performed a financial gauge analysis of ADP, which determined the GCFR Overall gauge fell from 58 to 52 of the 100 possible points.   We have now modeled ADP's Income Statement for the quarter that will end on 31 December 2009.  The intent of this exercise was to produce a baseline for identifying deviations, positive or negative, in the actual data that the company will announce on 2 February 2010.  GCFR estimates are derived from trends in the historical financial results and guidance provided by company management.   First, we set the stage with some background information about ADP and the business environment in which it operates.  Automatic Data Processing, Inc. performs payroll, tax, and other personnel-related services for over 500,000 clients, large and small.  ADP declares it pays one of every six private sector employees in the United States.  ADP vies for clients with numerous public and private, business software and services companies.  Competitors include Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX), the now-private Ceridian, and India's Wipro (NYSE: WIT), to mention a few.  As a payroll processor, ADP directly feels the effects of lower  Total Non-farm Employment and the higher Unemployment Rate in the U.S.  The weak labor market today is illustrated vividly in the monthly ADP National Employment Report on non-farm private employment, which ADP creates based on payroll data.   ADP is one of four remaining of U.S. companies with a AAA bond rating.  It is also an S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat, having  hiked its dividend for 35 consecutive years.   Investing gurus Bill Ackman, David Einhorn, and Bill Nygren owned ADP shares on 30 September 2009.  ADP has recently agreed to acquire OneClickHR [LON: OCLR], a British developer of human resources software, for $25.4 million.  On 30 October,  ADP closed on its purchase of HRinterax, ""an HR content and support services company focused on the small business market.""  In 2007, ADP divested its Brokerage Services Group business, which became Broadridge Financial Solutions (NYSE: BR).  GCFR articles related to Broadridge can be found here.  We're now ready to look specifically at the current quarter.  In a press release announcing results for the quarter ended last September, ADP provided a very cautious forecast for fiscal 2010. We've noted previously that guidance in terms of Earnings per Share, instead of Net Income, enables management to satisfy or exceed expectations by increasing share repurchases.  Since Revenue in fiscal 2009 was $8.9 billion, a decline between 1 and 2 percent would translate into a fiscal 2010 Revenue range between $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion.  We are choosing a mid-range figure of $8.75 billion as the Revenue projection for fiscal 2010.    Historical data suggest 25 percent of a fiscal year's Revenue will be realized in the December quarter.  By applying this ratio to our Revenue projection for fiscal 2010, we obtain a $2.19 billion Revenue estimate for the second quarter of the current fiscal year.  The Gross Margin was 52.1 percent of Revenue in the September 2009 quarter, and we are expecting a similar margin in the December quarter.  This is equivalent to forecasting that the Cost of Goods Sold -- what ADP calls ""Operating Expenses"" -- will equal (1 - 0.521) * $2.19 billion = $1.05 billion.    Depreciation and amortization expenses have been around $60 million in each of the last eight quarters.  We have no reason to expect a materially different figure in the December 2009 quarter.    Similarly, Research and Development (R&D) expenses (""Systems Development and Programming Costs"") have been about $125 million per quarter.  Sales, General, and Administrative (SG&A) expenses are more variable, but the amount in the December quarter is normally modestly higher than in the preceding September quarter.  We are expecting SG&A expenses in the current quarter to be 5 percent greater than September's $493 million, which would be $517 million.   Rolling up these estimates yields a target for Operating Income, as we define it, of $438 million.  This is 1.1 percent less than Operating Income in the December 2008 quarter.  For net non-operating income (i.e., other income less interest expense), $25 million would seem to be a reasonable estimate based on recent history.    If the Income Tax Rate is 36 percent, Net Income will be $296 million ($0.59 per share, depending on share repurchases).  In the year-earlier quarter, Net Income from continuing operations was $300 million ($0.59 per share).

This amount was 5 percent greater than the $0.59 per share earned one year earlier.    If a  favorable tax item in the latest quarter is excluded, earnings would  only have increased $0.01 to $0.60 per share.  This post examines  ADP's Income  Statement for the quarter and compares the entries on each line to  our ""look-ahead""  estimates.  Our target for Net Income in the latest quarter was  $0.59 per share, which ADP exceeded by $0.03.  The principal  sources for the income statement analysis were the earnings announcement, the webcast presentation [pdf], and the conference call transcript (available from Seeking  Alpha).  In a second  article, we will report ADP's   scores as measured by the GCFR  financial gauges.   The follow-up post will also provide the latest  figures for the various financial metrics we use to analyze Cash  Management, Growth,  Profitability and Value.   Automatic Data Processing performs payroll, tax, and other personnel-related services for over 500,000 clients, large and small.  Additional background information about ADP and the business environment in which it is currently operating can be found in the look-ahead.

Please note that our organization of revenues, expenses, gains, and losses, which we use for all analyses, can and often does differ in material respects from company-used formats.  The standardization facilitates cross-company comparisons.Revenue of $2.20 billion was basically unchanged from that in the December 2008 quarter.  Revenue would have been about 2 percent less, according to ADP, if foreign exchange rates had not been favorable.  The reported figure for Revenue exceeded our $2.19 billion estimate, which was derived from the company's guidance for the fiscal year, by less than 1 percent.  Looking at  ADP's various business segments, starting with the largest, we see that  quarterly Revenue fell 2 percent at ADP  Employer Services.  As a major payroll processor, lower Employment in the latest period put downward pressure on this unit's Revenue.  The business that provides services to automobile dealers reported a Revenue decline of 5 percent.  Not surprisingly, this unit has been harmed by the large number of dealerships that have or will soon close.  The   Professional Employer Organization Services segment was the bright spot, growing Revenue a relatively robust 9 percent.  In explaining this performance, ADP's CFO said during the conference call: Operating  Expenses, what we list as Cost of Goods Sold, were 47.7 percent  of Revenue, which translates into a Gross Margin of 52.3 percent.  The latest margin was 2 points lower than December 2008's 54.3 percent.  Our 52.1 percent estimate for the Gross Margin was 20 basis points too low.  Depreciation and amortization expenses matched our $60  million estimate.   ADP spent $121 million on Research and Development (""Systems Development and Programming Costs""), which was about $2 million (1.6 percent) less than last year.  We had estimated that R&D expenses would increase $2 million, so our estimate proved to be 3.3 percent too high.  Sales, General, and Administrative expenses of $520 million exceeded our estimate by only 0.6 percent.  These expenses were 9.25 percent less than in the December 2008 quarter.  Operating  Income, as we define it, was $453 million, which exceeded the equivalent amount in the previous December quarter by 2.3 percent.  The $53 million reduction in SG&A expenses more than made up for the $43 million rise in Operating Expenses.  Operating  Income exceeded our $438 million estimate by 3.4 percent.  Other income less interest expense of $27 million was $4 million less than last year, but it was $2 million more than we anticipated.   The effective Income Tax Rate was 34.2 percent in the December 2009 quarter, more than 200 basis points less than the previous December's 36.5 percent.  The tax rate was lower because the recent quarter included a favorable item that reduced the provision for income taxes by $12.2 million.  The tax rate, excluding the benefit, was 36.8 percent.  We had estimated the tax rate would be 36.0 percent.  Net Income of $316 million ($0.62 per share) for the quarter was 5.6 percent higher than the previous December's $301 million ($0.59 per share).  Excluding the special tax benefit, Net Income would have been $303.6 million ($0.60 per share), bringing the increase down to 1 percent.  Our Net Income estimate of $296 million ($0.59 per share) was 6.2 percent less than the reported amount and 2.5 percent less than earnings excluding the tax benefit.  ADP concluded its earnings presentation by noting that the ""U.S. economy appears to be at bottom of downturn; however, we remain cautious about near-term outlook.""  The company then noted the effort it is making to increase sales; adding new customers or providing new services for existing customers is a way the company can offset the negative effects of lower employment.  Management also asserted that ""ADP is well positioned to leverage the inevitable economic recovery.""   Full  disclosure: Long ADP at time of writing."

This is the 35th year in a row that ADP has raised their dividend.

The current dividend pay out indicates a pay out ratio of 57% on estimated 2010 earnings.The stock is up 8% since I started a position in ADP inside my wife's RRSP. An interesting thing to note is that this stock seems to have really taken off despite the fact that US unemployment is at best flattening out.

Revenues compared to the first quarter of 2009 declined 4% to $2.1 billion. ADP notes that net earnings from continuing operations increased 2% while diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased 4% from $0.54 to $0.56 per share.For the quarter, employer service revenue declined 3%, PEO revenues increased 6%, and dealer services revenues declined 4%. Revenue from interest on client funds declined 15.8% compared to the year ago period due to lower funds and lower interest rates.For its 2010 fiscal year ADP is projecting a 1%-2% decline in revenues and earnings that are essentially flat as compared to 2009 at $2.39 per share. It anticipates no improvement in pretax margins.With declining revenues, ADP has squeezed everything out of the business that it can with amazing results. To produce earnings growth as unemployment has grown to over 10% and as over 2,000 dealerships have closed in 2009 is a boon for shareholders. In addition, ADP continues to pay a solid dividend and repurchased $13.7 million in shares in the first quarter.A look at the cash flow statement in its 10Q reveals a decline in cash flow from operating activities from $398 million in 2009 to $244 million in 2010, largely as a result of a $230 million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities. This should be something to watch in future quarters. Deducting $34 million in capital expenditures results in $196 million in what I would consider to be owner earnings. From this, the company paid $166 million in dividends and repurchased almost $14 million in shares. Long-term investors in ADP should be pleased with ADP’s return of capital to shareholders.In 2009, ADP had a return on equity of 26.2%. It had operating cash flow of $1.6 billion and capital expenditures of $158 million resulting in owner earnings of $1,404.7MM. Starting with this number and assuming no growth in 2010 followed by 8% growth for years 2-5, then 6% for years 6-10;  I get an intrinsic value of $40 per share after applying a 10% discount rate to these cash flows. I think ADP will do a bit better than that, but a value range of $38-$45 is a pretty good estimate.I consider ADP a core holding. It has a solid dividend (3.10% as of this writing), shareholder friendly management, and should benefit as interest rates rise and the employment picture improves.Disclosure: I currently hold shares of ADP"

The standardization facilitates cross-company comparisons.Revenue was 3.6 percent less than in the September 2008 quarter, and about half the decline was attributable to unfavorable foreign exchange rates. Since we estimated Revenue would decline 8.3 percent, ADP exceeded our expectations. Our target was derived from the company's Revenue guidance for all of fiscal 2010.Revenue from ADP's Employer Services business segment, which is (by far) the company's largest operation, was down 2.6 percent in the September quarter.  U.S. Traditional Payroll and Payroll Tax Filing services were especially weak, which might not be surprising given that the unemployment rate has increased significantly over the last year.  Revenue from the business supporting automotive dealers was also lower, but (only?) by 4.1 percent. ADP recorded a $7 million asset impairment charge in response to GM's plan to close all Saturn dealerships.  The Cost of Goods Sold -- what ADP calls ""Operating Expenses"" -- was 47.9 percent of Revenue, which translates into a Gross Margin of 52.1 percent. The margin was slightly better than last year's 52.0 percent, but it was less profitable than the 53.5 percent we predicted based on fiscal 2009's results. Depreciation and amortization expenses matched our $60 million estimate, which was essentially the same as last year's amount.   Research and Development expenses (""Systems Development and Programming Costs"") also matched our expectation.   Sales, General, and Administrative expenses were 6.5 percent less than last year and 6.1 percent less than our $525 million estimate.   Operating Income, which we define as   the difference between Revenue and the operating expenses identified above, fell a mere 0.3 percent compared to last year's September quarter. Our estimate for Operating Income was 13.7 percent too low, mostly because our Revenue prediction was too low and our SG&A expense estimate was too high.  Other income less interest expense was $11 million more than we anticipated.   The provision for income taxes in the September 2009 quarter corresponded to an effective Income Tax Rate of 36.5 percent, compared to 37 percent last year.  We estimated the tax rate would be 36.0 percent.  Net Income for the quarter rose 2.6 percent (4.7 percent on a per-share basis) above last year's amount. Because of the better-than-expected operating performance, Net Income surpassed our estimate by 17 percent (14 percent on a per-share basis).

171186,20568,2009-11-04T12:17:49-05:00,,"Wednesday, Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP), the biggest payroll processing firm, estimated that the economy lost 203,000 private sector jobs in October. That was more than the consensus estimate of 190,000 jobs lost. However, the September job loss numbers were revised to a loss of just 227,000 from the original read of 254,000. Thus the losses are coming from a higher base level, and if the revisions are included, this report was in line with consensus or perhaps a bit better. Still, it indicates that while the economy might be expanding, employment isn’t. However, this is the seventh straight month where ADP has seen fewer jobs lost than the month before. This is similar to the pattern that we saw following the last two recessions. While employment has always been considered a lagging indicator, it has been becoming more so with each passing decade. In part this reflects the changing nature of the workplace, with manufacturing jobs making up a much smaller part of the total. Also, this time around an unusually high percentage of the job cuts are of the permanent variety (see ""Permanent vs. Temporary Layoffs""). The graph below, originally from the Atlanta Fed, was also used in that post. The job loss numbers are a net number, with new jobs created offsetting other job losses. The rate of layoffs has slowed down, but the rate of job creation has not yet picked up (see ""It's the Lack of Job Creation, Stupid!""). By sector, ADP saw 86,000 jobs lost in the service sector, which is far larger, but more stable than the goods producing sector. The service sector losses included 18,000 from financial services -- the 23rd straight month of declines there. The goods producing sector lost 117,000 jobs, including 65,000 in manufacturing and 51,000 in construction. The read on manufacturing is in direct contrast with the ISM manufacturing survey which came out on Monday and indicated that manufacturing was actually gaining jobs in October. We will see on Friday which one was right when the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) comes out with the official employment numbers. The consensus for the BLS (which includes government jobs, while ADP does not) report is for a decline of 175,000 jobs. The ADP report might make people a little bit more inclined to take the over on that number, but I don’t think by a lot. By firm size, it looks like large firms, which tend to have better access to financing, are faring better than their little brothers. They lost a total of 53,000, while medium and small firms each lost 75,000 thousand. Traditionally, small businesses are one of the main engines of job creation in the country, something I wrote about here: ""A Rarity: The Small-Business Loan."" However those numbers are a little bit deceptive since small businesses employ more people overall than do large businesses. Specifically, there are 17.9 million people working for firms with more than 500 employees, 42.3 million working for firms between 50 and 499 employees and 48.1 million working for firms with fewer than 50 workers. Thus on a percentage basis, large employers dropped 0.3% of their payroll in October, while medium-sized firms dropped 0.18% and small firms dropped less than 0.16%. As evidenced by the announcement Tuesday by Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) that it would be trimming back its worldwide workforce by 7%, even the largest, most well-financed and stable of companies have not been immune from layoffs in this cycle. All of this, however, is prelude to the big number on Friday. The September number was a major disappointment after months of steady improvement. The October report (and the revisions to September and August) will tell us if that was simply a temporary aberration, or the start of a new trend that we should be worried about. My gut tells me that it was an aberration. The economy is getting back on track, but it seems like it is likely to be stuck in first gear for a while, but at least that is better than going in reverse. Of course there is a bit of a ""chicken-and-the-egg"" problem, since continued job losses tend to hurt the economy and can lead to further job losses. A rising unemployment rate at a level over 10% is a recipe for Scrooge to rule Christmas, not Santa. However, it looks as if the fiscal and monetary stimulus program have managed to break that vicious cycle enough to generate at least some economic growth, but not yet enough to cause net job growth. History suggests that it will come, but might take a few more months."

(NASDAQ:ADP) reported first quarter 2010 EPS of 56 cents, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents.Revenue First quarter 2010 revenue of $2.1 billion was down 4.0% from the year-ago quarter. Revenue declined across all segments except PEO (Professional Employer Organization) services, negatively impacted by the severe economic conditions that prevailed during the past year. Unfavorable foreign exchange comparisons comprised two percentage points of the quarter’s revenue decline.Revenue by Segment Employer Services revenue was $1.49 billion, down 3% compared to the year-ago quarter. Within this segment, the United States traditional payroll revenues and payroll tax filing business declined 7.0%, while the beyond-payroll revenues grew 3%. Number of employees under clients payroll declined 6.5% in the U.S., measured on the basis of same-store sales. PEO Services revenue was $296.2 million, up 6.0% compared to the year-ago quarter. This can be attributed to the higher benefits pass-through revenues that resulted from increases in both benefit rates and the number of worksite employees. Dealer Services revenue was $313.5 million, down 4.0% compared to the year-ago quarter. This decline can be attributed to continued dealership closings and consolidations, as well as lower transactional revenues related to lower car-sales volumes. Other revenues were $1.1 million in the quarter. Operating Results Total expenses for the quarter reached $1.68 billion, down 5.23% compared to the year-ago quarter, as the company has implemented cost-control measures from the fourth quarter of last year. Pretax earnings from continuing operations were $447.3 million, down 1. 4% from the year-ago quarter, while net earnings from continuing operations was $284.1 million, up 2.2% from the year ago quarter. Provision for taxes remained flat. Net Income for the first quarter was $284.1 million or 56 cents per share, up 3.0% from $276.9 million or 54 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities (including long-term marketable securities) for the quarter was $1.7 billion, down from $2.4 billion reported in the previous quarter. Long-term debt for the quarter was $42.2 million, almost flat compared to $42.7 million reported in the previous quarter. During the quarter, the company acquired over 360,000 shares of its stock at a cost of about $13.7 million.Guidance Management believes that the U.S. economy has reached the bottom of its economic downturn, and that now the economy will slowly stabilize. For the fiscal year 2010, the company expects a revenue decline of 1.0% to 2.0%, while diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.34 to $2.39, compared to $2.39 per share earnings from continuing operations reported in fiscal 2009 (excluding favorable tax settlement)."
174121,20302,2009-11-18T15:15:26-05:00,,"Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) is a cyclical business. Its revenues are generated from business services, and when business cuts back on those services the revenue falls. Naturally, the company’s revenue has fallen off as of late.  The RBP Snapshot below shows what the current price of the stock implies about future revenue growth. ADP will need to generate revenue equal to $8.6 billion in the next twelve months, or 1.6% less than it did over the previous twelve months, as well as more substantial revenue growth (4%-6%) in the years thereafter. Can it do this?  It is an interesting question because the bulk of ADP revenues are from payroll processing. This is highly dependent upon employment levels. Even though some see signs that the economy is recovering, there is little indication that unemployment is falling. In fact, it keeps rising. And as it does, payroll revenues will keep declining.  As the nation’s largest payroll processor, ADP’s performance is highly negatively correlated with unemployment levels. So should we pose this as a macroeconomic question? That is, if the company’s Required Business Performance suggests revenues will fall slightly in the next year, but begin growing after that, can we infer that investors are expecting the rise in unemployment to slow over the next year and begin declining in 2011?  What other factors might contribute to revenue or free cash flow growth even in the face of continually rising levels of unemployment?"
164846,21835,2009-10-05T11:27:30-04:00,,"Company Description: Automatic Data Processing Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP) is one of the world’s largest independent computing services companies, providing a broad range of data processing services.  Fair Value: I consider four calculations of fair value:ADP is trading at a discount to (1) and (3) above, as it is trading at a 10.5% discount to its calculated fair value of $43.47. ADP earned a star in this section since it is trading at a fair value.Dividend Analytical Data: In this section there are three possible stars and three key metrics:ADP earned three stars in this section for (1), (2) and (3). One was earned since the company's Free Cash Flow payout ratio was less than 60% and there were no negative Free Cash Flows over the last 10 years. ADP earned another star as a result of its most recent Debt to Total Capital being less than 45%, and another for having an acceptable score in at least two of the four Key Metrics measured. The company has paid a cash dividend to shareholders every year since 1974 and has increased its dividend payments for 34 consecutive years.Dividend Income vs. MMA: Why would you assume the equity risk and invest in a dividend stock if you could earn a better return in a much less risky money market account (MMA)? This section compares the earning ability of this stock with a high yield MMA. Two items are considered in this section:ADP earned a star in this section for its NPV MMA Diff. of $9,903. This amount is in excess of the $500 target I look for in a stock that has increased dividends as long as ADP has. If ADP grows its dividend at 15.3% per year, it will take 2 years to equal a MMA yielding an estimated 20-year average rate of 3.9%. ADP earned a check for the Key Metric ‘Years to >MMA’ since its 2 years is less than the 5-year target.Other: ADP is a member of the S&P 500, a Dividend Aristocrat and a member of the Broad Dividend Achievers Index. ADP has a strong balance sheet and a steady cash flow stream. The company’s free cash flow is more than double its dividend. ADP repurchased 33 million of its shares in FY 2008. As the economy continues to slow in the near-term, ADP will face slower employment growth, though long-term opportunities for earnings growth should come from small and medium-sized business market and overseas. Risks include intense competition, the threat of new entrants and failure to further penetrate small and midsized domestic business and international markets.Conclusion: ADP earned one star in the Fair Value section, earned three stars in the Dividend Analytical Data section and earned one star in the Dividend Income vs. MMA section for a total of five stars. This quantitatively ranks ADP as a 5 Star-Strong Buy. I determined the share price could increase to $108.65 before ADP’s NPV MMA Differential dropped to the $500 that I like to see for a stock with 34 years of consecutive dividend increases. At that price the stock would yield 1.18%.Resetting the model and solving for the dividend growth rate needed to generate the target $500 NPV MMA Differential, the calculated rate is 5.6%. This dividend growth rate is significantly lower than the the 15.3% used in this analysis, thus providing a margin of safety. ADP has a risk rating of 1.50 which classifies it as a medium risk stock.ADP is the leader in its segment. Barriers to entry are high requiring a sizable infrastructure to serve a large number of employees. With its low debt and strong free cash flow ADP is an attractive buy at prices below $43.47.Disclosure: At the time of this writing, I was long in ADP (1.1% of my Income Portfolio)."

Over the past year, revenue grew by 1% to $8.9 billion for the year. Excluding one-time items, diluted earnings per share from continuing operations grew 10% to $2.39.ADP produces some of this earnings per share growth by repurchasing shares. ADP acquired 13.8 million shares during the year totaling $550 million. These repurchases are in addition to the $1.28 per share in dividends that ADP pays. A cash flow statement was not included in their earnings release, but net income for the year was $1.33 billion. The company repurchased $550 million in shares and paid dividends of approximately $647 million. They continue to return money to their shareholders.Employer service revenues were flat year-over-year, and the number of employees on their client payrolls fell by 2.5% for the year. PEO Service revenues grew by 12% for the year. Dealer Service revenues fell by 11% on an organic basis. Overall, Dealer Services totals 15.5% of ADP’s revenues.Guidance for the coming year anticipates continued economic and employment weakness with earnings per share remaining flat. Following a year of flat earnings per share, ADP would have to grow at a rate of about 8% over the following 5 years to justify its current price.This is a strong, stable company that could grow faster than 8.0% per year during an economic recovery, but for now it looks like the shares are pretty fairly valued.Disclosure: I currently own shares of ADP"

It operates in three segments: Employer Services, Professional Employer Organization Services, and Dealer Services. This dividend aristocrat has raised dividends for 34 consecutive years. Back in November 2008 Automatic Data Processing announced a 13% dividend increase.Over the past decade this dividend growth stock has delivered an average total return of 0.50% annually. In 2007 ADP spun off its Brokerage Services business, distributing one share of Broadridge Financial (NYSE:BR) common stock for every four shares of ADP common stock held by shareholders. The total returns calculation for ADP over the past decade includes this transaction.The company has managed to deliver an 8.00% average annual increase in its EPS between 1999 and 2008. Analysts expect Automatic Data Processing to earn $2.38 share in FY 2009, followed by a small decline to $2.36/share in FY 2010. ADP’s earnings have been constrained by decrease in overall employment levels, closings at small and midsize businesses it services and a general decrease in interest income from funds held for clients. Never the less the company could achieve strong revenue growth of 5%-6% annually, as its markets such as HR management services and Business Process Outsourcing are expected to grow annually in the 5%-6% range over the next five years. The company is a leader in the processing space, and could achieve growth through acquisitions and expansion abroad. There is a high barrier to entry in order to compete in ADP’s business segments. I like the recurring revenue and long term deals structure that ADP’s business enjoys. This leads to stability in cash flow generation, which provides for a good foundation for solid dividend growth over time.The Return on Equity has remained in a tight range between 17% and 23%. Rather than focus on absolute values for this indicator, I generally want to see at least a stable return on equity over time.Annual dividends have increased by an average of 15.50% annually since 1999, which is higher than the growth in EPS. The company has also managed to decrease the number of dillluted shares outstanding from 636 million in 1999 to 527 million in 2008 through share repurchases.A 15 % growth in dividends translates into the dividend payment doubling every five years. If we look at historical data, going as far back as 1979, Automatic Data Processing has really managed to double its dividend payment every five years.The dividend payout ratio has doubled to 50%. As the company matures, it has returned most of its earnings back to stockholders in the form of increased distributions and share buybacks. A lower payout is always a plus, since it leaves room for consistent dividend growth minimizing the impact of short-term fluctuations in earnings.Currently Automatic Data Processing is attractively valued at 16.00 times earnings, yields 3.40% and has an adequately covered dividend payment. In comparison to its closest competitor Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX), which trades at a P/E of 19 and yields 4.4% with a dividend payout ratio of 80%, I view ADP as more attractively valued. I would be looking forward to adding to my position in Automatic Data Processing on dips.Disclosure: Long ADP"

The April-to-June period is the fourth quarter of ADP's fiscal year.  Earnings in the  recent quarter benefited from tax settlements that led to a one-time $120 million reduction in income taxes.  If this tax benefit had not been realized, earnings per share would have been $0.46.  This post examines the Income Statement for the quarter and compares it to our ""look-ahead"" estimates.  Our target for ADP's Net Income in the latest quarter was $0.47  per share.  In a second article, we will report ADP's  scores as measured by the GCFR Financial Gauges.  The follow-up post will also provide the latest figures for the financial metrics we use to analyze Cash Management, Growth, Profitability and Value.  Our principal sources were the earnings announcement and the conference call transcript at SeekingAlpha.  Some background information about Automatic Data Processing and the business environment in which it is currently operating can be found in the look-ahead.  Please click here to see a full-sized, normalized depiction of the actual and projected results for the just-concluded quarter, as well as the quarterly Income Statements for the last couple of years.  Please note that our organization of revenues, expenses, gains, and losses, which we use for all analyses, can and often does differ in material respects from company-used formats.  The standardization facilitates cross-company comparisons.    Revenue was 4.5 percent less than in June 2008 quarter and 2.0 percent less than our estimate.  ADP reported: Fiscal 2009 Revenue was 1.0 percent more than in fiscal 2008.  This tepid growth rate was at the bottom end of the 1-to-2 percent range forecast by ADP in May.  Revenue from ADP's Employer Services business segment, which is (by far) the company's largest operation, was essentially flat in the June quarter.  Revenue from the business supporting automotive dealers was down, but (only?) by 9 percent.  The Cost of Goods Sold -- what ADP calls ""Operating Expenses"" -- was 47.8   percent of Revenue, which translates into a Gross Margin of 52.2 percent.  The margin was down from 55.0 percent in the year-earlier quarter, and it was also less profitable than the 54.0 percent we predicted.  Depreciation and amortization expenses were unchanged from last year, and the current value was just $1 million more than our $60 million estimate.   Research and Development expenses (""Systems Development and Programming Costs"") were 10 percent lower than last year's value, but 6 percent greater than our estimate.  The R&D expense was 6.0 percent of Revenue, a little more than our 5.6 percent estimate.  Sales, General, and Administrative expenses were 17 percent less than in the June 2008 quarter and 8.4 percent less than our estimate.  As a percentage of Revenue, SG and A costs fell from 31.6 percent last year to 27.4 percent.  Although Revenue was lower than in last year's second quarter, Operating Income increased by 6 percent as a result of ADP's cost-cutting successes.  Our estimate for Operating Income was 5 percent too high, mostly because our Revenue and Gross Margin predictions were overly optimistic.  Other income less interest expense was $7 million more than we anticipated.  In the June 2008 quarter, ADP recorded a $16 million gain on the sale of a building.  As mentioned above, the provision for income taxes in the June 2009 quarter was $120 million less burdensome, $13.6 million instead of $133.6 million, because of the favorable settlement of certain tax matters.  This benefit resulted in an effective Income Tax Rate of only 3.8 percent.  The tax rate would have been 37 percent (our assumption was 36 percent) if the benefit had not been realized.  The tax benefit allowed  Net Income to soar 51 percent (56 percent on a per-share basis) beyond last year's amount.  If the tax benefit is excluded, Net Income in the quarter would have been almost exactly the same as last year and just $4 million ($0.01 per share) below our prediction.

ADP is also active in providing financial information systems to car, motorcycle, marine, and recreational vehicle dealers located across all major continents. The company offers great solutions for businesses that are seeking to realize efficiencies by cutting costs of non-revenue generating units. Heavily tied to the employment rate, ADP obviously makes more fees as it disburses more payroll checks and sells more of its information systems as durable good orders pick up.ADP is very dependent on a healthy economy, but it has managed to weather the downturn extremely well, as businesses seek operational efficiencies during the current capital crunch. The need for lean operations only helps ADP since its HR outsourcing functions includes more than just payroll, but the crucial human capital systems that every company uses to train, evaluate, and award its talent. This outsourcing can significantly cut costs, directly affecting the bottom-line of ADP’s customers. It is not wise to be bullish on ADP until later this year as management recently cut guidance during the first week of April. Although ADP should meet guidance, it will most likely trade sideways if not down for the majority of 2009. A Q4 entry is best, as most believe the economy will rebound mid 2010. This means the stock market should find itself in the midst of a bull market in early 2010, so remember to jump ship before the New Year. Analysts believe that macro conditions have caused ADP to suffer, so a healthy economy will lead to a healthier ADP. So, what is going to happen when the economy turns?Simply put, ADP is going to see a renewed interest in its niche outsourcing systems and services and also a surge in payroll processing. It is simple to understand that a healthier economy leads to a lower unemployment rate, causing more payroll contracts leading to a surge in durable goods. Once the car market rebounds, ADP’s dealership services will also see its share of the pie expanding. Also, any thought that business will stop outsourcing HR functions is also flawed. The benefits are extremely high, causing companies to further digitize and outsource such operations for a “leaner” enterprise. ADP is also expanding into the BRIC nations as it just acquired a majority stake in ChinaLink to benefit from the increasing need for HR expertise in China. It is no news that China’s stimulus package is top notch and many jobs will be created through it. ADP’s confidence in this market is excellent, and should aid it in getting through worsening economic times here at home.This strategic acquisition makes ADP one of the best-managed companies, and also one of the only AAA companies left in the world. Managerial transparencies will really aide us as investors, helping us time our entry into this position. The latest guidance was poor and did affect the stock poorly, but the commitment to transparency is really one of the best things shareholders can find. A truly rebound reliant play, ADP is a star in the IT sector. I believe that once signs of an economic rebound are observed, you should consider dollar cost averaging into this holding. Expect a bottom in margins and earnings later this year as 2010 brings hopes of an economic relief.The rest of this free research report “Stocks For An Economic Recovery” which includes commentary on all sectors is available for download at the following link.- Santosh SankarDisclosure: The Fund the author manages is long ADP."
146511,20568,2009-07-01T14:25:51-04:00,,"By Dirk van DijkADP (NASDAQ:ADP), the largest payroll processing firm in the U.S., has come out with its estimate of job losses in June for the private sector. It is not a pretty picture, with the economy shedding 473,000 more jobs in the month. This was far worse than the 394,000 consensus expectation.On the silver-lining side, the May number was revised to a fall of 485,000 jobs from the initial estimate of 532,000. This moves the May ADP data somewhat closer to the BLS data (June due out tomorrow) of 345,000 jobs lost in May. Also, while the June ADP number is higher than expected, it is the smallest absolute number of job losses since September. I can’t say that I am shocked by the ADP number given that initial claims for unemployment insurance have consistently been running about 600,000.The ADP and BLS numbers do not match up exactly, for starters, ADP only shows private sector jobs while the BLS numbers include government jobs as well. That should not make a huge difference this time around. While the Federal government probably added quite a few positions in June -- mostly for the Census -- State and Local governments are under severe financial stress (see this post), and job losses there will offset any Federal gains.On the other hand, even with the revision, there is still a big gap between the BLS and the ADP numbers. ADP provides a clue as to what the BLS will report tomorrow, but it is not always the best indicator out there. While the BLS numbers will continue to be the official ones, the ADP numbers do not have the Birth/Death adjustment that the BLS numbers have -- an adjustment that has consistently been working to lower the job loss totals, and which I find very hard to take seriously.Digging further into the details, the job losses were about equally split between the goods producing sectors which lost 250,000 jobs, including 146,000 in manufacturing and 97,000 in construction, and the service sector which lost 223,000 jobs. This is the 40th straight month that the country has lost manufacturing jobs. Of course, there were far fewer goods producing jobs to start with than service sector jobs, so on a percentage basis, it is manufacturing and construction that continue to be the hardest hit in the downturn.Job losses were felt in all-sized firms as well. Large businesses (>500 employees) dropped 91,000 jobs, while medium sized (>50,<500) firm payrolls fell by 205,000 and small businesses employment fell by 177,000 in the month.Increasing unemployment will mean less income which will keep retail sales weak, particularly of discretionary goods and services. A good example of this is travel, causing hotel companies like Starwood (HOT) and Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR) to have much lower occupancy rates, especially in their more resort oriented destinations.It also makes it much more difficult for people to pay down their existing debts, meaning that more credit card defaults are likely, which is obviously not good news for the likes of American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Capital One (NYSE:COF)."

(NASDAQ:ADP) provides payroll and other personnel-related information technology services to well over 500,000 employers worldwide.  It competes with firms such as Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX).  The company is also known for the monthly ADP National Employment Report on non-farm private employment.    We have already posted an analysis of ADP's financial results for the three months that ended 31 March 2009.  This period was the third quarter of the company's fiscal 2009, which will end in June.    Our earlier evaluation of the March quarter was incomplete because ADP's press release  did not include a Cash Flow Statement, and the published Balance Sheet had been significantly condensed.  Since we didn't yet have all the data required to compute exact GCFR gauge scores, the scores we posted were based on a mix of actual and estimated data.  ADP subsequently filed a 10-Q quarterly report with a complete set of financial statements.  We used the data in the 10-Q to update our evaluation.  Changes to the analysis results are described below.  The 10-Q did not change our examination of the March quarter's Income Statement, including the comparison with our  previously communicated expectations.   The additional data in the 10-Q merely reduced the Value and Overall gauges by one point each, relative to the preliminary analysis.  The following are the updated gauge scores:A handful of the financial metrics we estimated earlier did need to be adjusted to reflect the data in the 10-Q.  For completeness, we repeat the tables below with revised figures highlighted in red text.  An unrelated update to S&P 500 market data affected one ratio.Disclosure: Long ADP at time of writing."
144821,23050,2009-06-23T08:07:43-04:00,,"The GCFR Overall Gauge of Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ: ADP) slipped a bit, from 61 to 57 of the 100 possible points, in the March 2009 quarter. Our initial and updated analysis reports for the third quarter of the company's fiscal 2009 explained this result in some detail. (An algorithm adjustment after the update was published cut ADP's score from 59 to 57.) In the March quarter, ADP's earnings per share increased from $0.79 in 2008 to $0.80 in 2009. Revenue in the recent period slipped 2.2 percent, which ADP attributed to the weak economy and the stronger dollar. Fortunately for ADP, lower operating costs (especially SG&A) more than compensated for the Revenue decline. Operating Income increased by a small amount, and Net Income, which was adversely affected by a charge related to the company's investment in the Reserve Fund, was basically flat.   Of our four gauges, the contrary Value gauge is currently strongest for ADP at 16 of 25 possible points.  We have now modeled ADP's Income Statement for the final quarter of fiscal 2009, which will end on 30 June. The intent of this exercise was to produce a baseline for identifying deviations, positive or negative, in the actual data the company will announce on 30 July. GCFR estimates are derived from trends in the historical financial results and guidance provided by company management.   First, we set the stage with some background information about the company and the business environment in which it operates.  Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (NASDAQ: ADP), with over 500,000 clients, is the largest firm providing payroll and other personnel-related information technology services. The company is also known for the monthly ADP National Employment Report on non-farm private employment.   ADP is one of a mere handful of U.S. companies with a AAA bond rating, and it is a member of the ""shrinking universe,"" as David Templeton so aptly expressed it, of S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. ADP has hiked its dividend for 34 consecutive years, including a 14 percent increase last November.   As a payroll processor, ADP feels the effects of decreased employment in the U.S.   ADP competes for clients with numerous large and small, public and private, business software and services companies. In the U.S., the IRS lists 24 payroll service providers that have satisfied its requirements for electronic submissions. Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) and now-private Ceridian are probably the names most familiar to investors. We wouldn't be surprised if India's Wipro (NYSE: WIT) is also a competitor or will become one.  In 2007, ADP divested its Brokerage Services Group business, which became Broadridge Financial Solutions (NYSE: BR).   We're now ready to look ahead.  In ADP's press release announcing March's quarterly results, which was issued on 5 May 2009, the company updated its forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year. Some excerpts are listed below:We've noted previously that guidance in terms of Earnings per Share (NYSEARCA:EPS), instead of Net Income, enables management to satisfy expectations by increasing share repurchases.  Since Revenue in fiscal 2008 was $8.776 billion, the latest guidance translates into a fiscal 2009 Revenue projection of (1.01 to 1.02) * $8.776 billion = $8.864 billion to $8.952 billion. We will split the difference and use $8.91 billion as the projection for the fiscal year. Revenue in the first three quarters of fiscal 2009 was $6.76 billion, which leaves $2.15 billion for the June quarter. The Gross Margin was 54.2 percent of Revenue in the first three quarter of fiscal 2009. From ADP's historic record, we have observed that the Gross Margin in the June quarter is typically between 0 and 0.4 percent less than the average of the three previous quarters. Therefore, for the June quarter, we project a Gross Margin of 54.2 - 0.2 = 54.0 percent. This is equivalent to forecasting that the Cost of Goods Sold (CGS) -- what ADP calls ""Operating Expenses"" -- will equal (1 - 0.54) * $2.15 billion = $990 million.  Depreciation and amortization expenses have been around $60 million in each of the last seven quarters. We have no reason to expect a different figure in the June 2009 quarter. Similarly, recent quarters suggest that Research and Development (R&D) expenses (""Systems Development and Programming Costs"") will probably be about $120 million.  At $520 million, Sales, General, and Administrative (SG&A) expenses in the March quarter were much lower than recent quarterly figures. However, the historical record would argue against expecting a similar value in the June 2009 quarter. In the last five years, the June quarter has been responsible for between 27 and 29 percent of the fiscal year's total SG&A expense. With this as a guide, our June target for these expenses becomes $630 million. Rolling up these expense estimates yields a target for Operating Income, as we define it, of $350 million. This is 11.6 percent greater than Operating Income in the June 2008 quarter. For net non-operating income (i.e., other income less interest expense), $20 million would seem to be a reasonable estimate based on recent data. If the Income Tax Rate remains at 36 percent, Net Income will be $237 million ($0.47 per share, depending on share repurchases). In the year-earlier quarter, Net Income from continuing operations was $226 million ($0.435 per share).   Please click here to see a full-sized, normalized depiction of the projected results next to ADP's quarterly Income Statements for the last couple of years.

The company is proving its defensive mettle.Sure, the valuation has held up versus a lot of stocks with a PE of 15x, but we are still well below 52-week highs at $46. So the stock is at least much cheaper than it was in the recent past. With a net cash balance sheet, and the reassurance of the latest results, plus management forecast for about 10% (low end of guidance) EPS growth this year (yes, growth), it doesn't seem like ADP will be disappearing anytime. This isn't a Lehman, a leveraged commodities company, etc. It's a stalwart with net cash. Returns on this stock are likely just a matter of time, waiting for the economy to come back, and worst case on a 3 year horizon it's probably dead money. Now, some might be ready to invest now, while some might still be on the fence watching. This author falls in the second camp. There are a lot of opportunities out there.  But I nevertheless wanted to see if perhaps one can be paid for being patient on ADP, liking the stock but also willing to walk away. After running an options model against ADP I noticed that the June $35 puts are particularly interesting. Bid/Ask right now is $0.90/$1.00. Tiny volume. One could offer to sell at $1.00 and see if you get hit. Worst case you end up buying ADP for $34 cost, (We are assuming you like the stock here) but if the puts expire worthless you collect 2.9% return on your $34 exposure before transaction costs. That's a 30% IRR. You might then be free to do it again. Sure this strategy might mean you miss ADP on a big rally. But there are a lot of decent values right now, and you can get the next one. What we are doing here is getting paid for being willing to walk away from a stock which we like. Oh, and for being uniquely small in trading size but with, hopefully, low transaction costs.  3% for the 1-month risk that you will own ADP at $34. Food for thought.

ADP’s quarterly results are widely expected to reflect the increasingly weak job market, as reported by both ADP and the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Thomas Weisel expect an in line Q4 with guidance calling for revenue of $2.1B-$2.2B, and the low end of an EPS range of 46c-55c. Weisel's Q4 estimates are 46c on $2.14B in revenue. The firm believes Q4 results will be overshadowed by the outlook that will be provided for FY10. Though the company has not yet provided guidance for FY10, management has previously commented that it expects client retention and new business sales for FY10 to be at Q3 levels or above. While FY10 consensus has migrated down to $2.44 from $2.53 at the time of the Analyst Day in late March, and more in line with Weisel's view of $2.43, the firm believes the broader market continues to discount the potential for downward revisions to this number. Weisel's bottom’s up analysis suggests FY10 EPS should fall within a range of $2.30-$2.50. Their bias is the midpoint of this range, or flattish EPS of approximately $2.40. While higher beta, cyclically depressed stocks have been driving the recent market rally, Weisel believes the market will embrace ADP once there is general consensus that earnings have troughed in the current cycle.

Then, on February 6, the U.S. Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls plunged 598,000 in January, the largest drop in 34 years. About 3.6 million U.S. jobs have been lost since the recession began in December 2007, with the last three months showing the greatest declines: payroll losses were 577,000 in December and 597,000 in November. The unemployment rate has reached 7.6%, the highest since September 1992. Despite the worsening economy, ADP did reasonably well in its second quarter. Let’s take a closer look.On February 3, ADP, the leading payroll processing company with annual revenue of $8.7 billion, reported second quarter results that met estimates. Q2 revenue grew 2.5% to $2.2 billion, down nearly three percentage points due to a stronger U.S. dollar. Net income grew 3% to $300.4 million while diluted EPS grew 7% to $0.59. Analysts were expecting earnings of $0.59 on revenue of $2.2 billion.ADP bought back shares for over $190 million during the quarter. It also increased its dividend 14%, marking its thirty-fourth consecutive year of dividend increases. Cash and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $1.45 billion compared with $3 billion at the end of the first quarter. By segment, Employer Services (ES) revenue grew 6% to $1.64 billion with 3% growth in the U.S. payroll and tax filing business and 10% growth in beyond payroll revenue. Year–to-date client retention declined 0.5 percentage points. The dollar value of new business sales declined 13% for ES and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services due to price sensitivity and the increased number of companies going out of business. PEO Services revenue grew 14% to $285.4 million and Dealer Services revenue decreased 1% to $342.7 million.Executing on its strategy for international expansion through acquisitions that was announced last quarter, Dealer Services recently announced the acquisition of Automaster, a leading DMS provider in Finland.ADP reiterated its fiscal 2009 growth-forecast of 2% to 3% growth in revenue, and 10% to 14% growth in earnings per diluted share. At the time of writing, the stock was trading around $37, having recovered from its 52-week low of $30.83 on October 16.

I think it's worth ferreting out high quality, good-yielding  stocks and then writing covered calls and naked puts to obtain a wide range of  results that can provide exactly that.   One issue that meets my  criteria is:   Automatic Data Processing (NYSE:ADP) Feb. 18, 2009 close: $36.84 52-week-range: $30.83 (Oct.  16, 2008) - $45.97 (Sep. 9, 2008) Dividend = $0.33 quarterly  = 3.58% current yield   ADP is America's  largest payroll and employee tax filing processor with over 585,000 accounts.  Domestic revenues account for about 82% of their approximately $9 billion in  expected sales for FY 2009 (ends June 30, 2009). They also provide Human  Resource solutions and various accounting, inventory and leasing services to  smaller companies.    EPS have risen in 13 of the  past 16 fiscal years and the current year is almost certain to add to that total  with consensus estimates running about $2.40 versus FY 2008's $2.20 figure. As  payroll processors they are being restrained by the nation's worsening  unemployment numbers [less workers = less payroll to process].  Even so, analysts now are looking for  $2.56 for FY 2010.    These are low volatility  shares [Beta = 0.75] and the balance sheet is fabulous with treasury cash of  over $1.37 billion versus total debt of just $51.2 million as of December 31,  2008. Only $16.9 million of that comes due in the next five years.     The dividend has been  raised in each of the past 17 years. The current yield of 3.58% is better than  that on a 10-year Treasury and almost all bank CDs. It's also higher than ever  before on ADP shares (excepting at last October's nadir).     Value Line gives ADP its  highest safety rating, an 'A++' for financial strength. They show them in the  100th percentile for 'stock price stability' and in the  95th percentile for 'earnings predictability' [with 100th  being best]. Historically, ADP shares  have commanded premium P/Es. Their 10-year median multiple has been 27x and the  past five-year average was 24x.At Wednesday's close of $36.84,  ADP is offered at about 15 times calendar year 2009 estimates.       I expect ADP shares to  climb by year end but in the current equity environment here's my conservative  combination play with great total return potential even if the stock does  nothing through next January.   ……………………………….……….

That's a  $9,682 profit or 36.3% cash-on-cash if this 'best case scenario' plays out.      Not too bad considering  that ADP shares did not have to go up to achieve this return. In fact, they  could have declined by 4.99% (to $35) and you'd still get that best case  profit.   What's the risk?   If ADP shares end up below  $35 you'd have to buy an additional 1000 shares and lay out $35,000 more cash.              $60,318 for 2000 shares = $30.16 /share as your net  break-even price.   While I can't guarantee you  that ADP won't be below that price by next January, I can tell you that ADP  shares have not changed hands that cheaply since early 2003. Sales, cash flow,  earnings, dividends and book value are all way higher now than they were when  making Wednesday's valuation way better. I'd be ok with owning those extra shares at  that multi-year low price if it comes to that.    Astute buyers of ADP at the  lows in March 2003 (at about 16.3x that year's earnings) saw their shares climb  from $27.20 to $47.30 in under 14 months.

The consensus estimate is 56c for EPS and $2.17B for revenue, according to First Call. The company does not provide quarterly guidance, so variations from consensus are not uncommon. ADP did provide lower FY09 guidance on its last earnings call of 2%-3% revenue growth and 10%-4% in EPS growth. Thomas Weisel is predicting Q2 results of 56c and $2.1B, which is in-line with consensus expectations. Given the economic backdrop, Thomas Weisel said it would not be surprised to see the company moderate its FY09 guidance of $2.40-$2.49, which is consistent with its below guidance view of $2.31 and consensus of $2.36. Key elements of Weisel's positive thesis have been its belief that ADP's earnings are more stable than the broader market in an economic downturn, the strength of cash flows and balance sheet and an attractive dividend yield of 3.5%-4.0%. While these themes remain, we are undoubtedly entering a riskier period for this stock as large companies rely heavily on headcount reductions to cut costs and pressures mount on the US auto industry. While none of this is new information, nor is the potential impact on EPS, the risk associated with declining metrics (new sales, checks/client) has increased, said Weisel. In particular, the market will begin to focus on FY10 earnings power. Robert Baird also continues to view ADP favorably as they expect earnings to remain relatively resilient in the face of the worst recession in 26+ years. Also, take note that Bernstein downgraded ADP shares to a Market Perform on Jan. 27 on relative valuation and a lack of catalysts.

Although ADP does not provide quarterly guidance, the firm offered FY09 guidance on their last earnings call of EPS growth of 10% to 14%, and revenue growth of 7% to 9%. That translates to EPS of $2.40 to $2.49, and revenue of $9.39B to $9.48B. Weisel says key quarterly items are the investment portfolio's exposure to securities that have suffered losses in value and any potential adjustments to its outlook, as well as expectations about payroll growth. The firm says about 45% of the investment portfolio is invested in corporate bonds and asset backed securities, some of which could have become impaired during the quarter. Last month Weisel lowered their FY09 estimates below consensus to $9.03B and $2.28, to reflect deteriorating economic conditions, declining employment trends and the impact of recent reductions to interest rates.

64177,21381,2008-02-12T04:48:36-05:00,,"Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) continued its strong performance as a company in their fiscal second quarter of 2008, posting 15% year-over-year revenue growth and 22% earnings growth from continuing operations. In addition, ADP guided to 12-13% revenue growth, and 18-21% diluted earnings per share growth in 2008. The market is certainly not pricing the company as if it expects these targets to be achieved. ADP also continues to pay a $0.29 per share dividend per quarter. That’s over a 3% dividend yield.Quarterly HighlightsIn the first two quarters of 2008, ADP has re-purchased over 18 million shares at a cost of $842 million. I view this as a shareholder friendly practice that drives growth in earnings per share.ADP’s flagship Employee Services division reported an 11% increase in revenues on a year-over-year basis. Their “beyond payroll” revenues grew at a 16% rate in the US.ADP had its PEO Services segment grow revenues at a 22% rate. Average worksite employees paid increased to approximately 170,000, representing 20% growth over the prior year.Dealer Services Revenue grew at a 9.5% rate with margins improving as well. Client Funds revenues grew at a 14% rate to $162 million. This is just interest on float that ADP earns, which will be negatively impacted by lower short-term rates this year. Still, there was an 8.9% increase in average client fund balances.All segments of ADP’s business look to be performing well. If this rate of growth continues, shares could double in five years.Trailing-Twelve Month Owner EarningsADP’s trailing twelve month numbers are as follows:  Capital expenditures for the 2nd quarter were not reported. I have estimated capex based on the past three quarters of history.ValuationIn order to determine an intrinsic value of ADP, I start with owner earnings of $2.19 per share. I then apply a 5-year growth rate, followed by a terminal growth rate for years 6-30 of 5%. I discount the series of cash flows back at 10%.Using 5-year growth rate of 5%, followed by terminal growth rate of 5% results in a value of $35 per share. This is about as conservative as you can project given the consistency of ADPs performance.Assuming ADP cannot hit their guidance and only grows at a 12% rate for 5 years, the value is $46 per share. The market seems concerned that unemployment will rise, and stall ADP’s growth. A 12% growth rate assumes that they hit some headwinds, but over the course of the next five years, they continue double-digit earnings per share growth.Finally, I want to assume that ADP hits their guidance and can maintain strong earnings per share growth due to continued buybacks and growth in their less mature businesses such as PEO services. Here I assume 18% growth for five years and get a value of $59 per share. Keep in mind that ADP generated 22% year-over-year growth in continuing operations per diluted share in their most recent quarter. A 25% margin of safety here still results in a value of $43 per share. This still looks achievable for ADP.ConclusionThe market certainly seems to be a bit irrational in regard to ADP at this time. It is rare to get a chance to buy this company on sale, so now continues to be a good time to add shares for the long term. Don’t forget the nice 3% dividend yield as well. Disclosure: Long ADP"

It has been increasing its dividends for the past 33 consecutive years. Over the past 10 years the company has delivered an average total return of 6.20 % annually to its shareholders. The majority of the gains occurred from 1998 to 2000. The stock has not recovered from its November 2000 highs yet. (Click charts to enlarge.)At the same time the company has managed to deliver an 8.40% average annual increase in its EPS since 1998. ADP has also managed to consistently purchase back 2.1% of its shares on average in every year since 2000.The ROE has fluctuated in the 17%-25% range for our study period. Overall this indicator has increased since 1998.Annual dividend payments have increased over the past 10 years by an average of 15.20% annually, which is significantly above the growth in EPS. A 15% growth in dividends translates into the dividend payment doubling almost every 5 years. If we look at historical data, going as far back as 1983, ADP has indeed managed to double its dividend payments every five years. If we invested $100,000 in ADP on December 31, 1997 we would have bought 3258 shares (adjusted for a 2:1 split in January 1999). Your first quarterly check would have amounted to $215 in early 1998.

For a period of 10 years, your quarterly dividend has increased by 339 %. If you reinvested it though, your quarterly dividend would have increased by 392%.I also like the fact that the company’s dividend payout has not exceeded 50% over the past 10 years in addition to the low P/E ratio which is less than 19 and the above average dividend yield of 2.70%.Disclosure: I own shares of ADP"

ADP offers a wide range of HR, payroll, tax and benefits administration solutions to companies of all types and sizes. ADP is also a leading provider of integrated computing solutions to auto, truck, motorcycle, marine and recreational vehicle dealers. Its business is organized into three segments: Employer Services, Professional Employer Organization [PEO] Services and Dealer Services. Employer Services offers HR solutions like payroll processing, tax and benefits administration solutions, both traditional and Web-based. It has over 560,000 clients in the United States, Canada, Europe, South America (primarily Brazil), Australia and Asia.PEO Services provides over 4,500 small and medium sized businesses with employment administration outsourcing solutions through a co-employment relationship. These solutions include payroll, payroll tax filing, HR guidance, 401[k] plan administration, benefits administration, compliance services, and health and workers’ compensation coverage.Dealer Services provides integrated dealer management systems to over 25,000 automotive, heavy truck and power sports dealers in over 50 countries.The Company acquired eleven businesses in fiscal 2007 for approximately $434.4 million. These include Employease, Inc., a leading on-demand service provider of web-based solutions for HR and benefits professionals; VirtualEdge Corporation, an on-demand provider of talent lifecycle management solutions for HR organizations; the fully-outsourced payroll business of Intuit.; the tax incentives business of Mintax, Inc.; and Taxware, LP, a leading provider of tax content and compliance solutions for sales, use and value added tax. Looks like ADP has identified on-demand / SaaS as a growth area, and has already started making its moves in that direction.On March 30, 2007, it spun-off its former Brokerage Services Group (BSG) business into an independent publicly traded company called Broadridge Financial Solutions (NYSE:BR). It also divested non-strategic and slow-growing businesses of Sandy Corporation, a Dealer Services business, in January 2007 and the Travel Clearing business in July 2007.Using the money from the BSG spin-off, ADP bought back over 40 million shares of its common stock for treasury at a cost of over $1.9 billion and increased the cash dividend 24% during fiscal 2007.On the financial front, ADP reported a 13.5% increase in revenue to $2 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2008. Net earnings from continuing operations grew 10% and diluted EPS was $0.45, a 15% y-o-y increase from $0.39. Excluding the net one-time gain in last year’s first quarter, diluted EPS increased 25%, and pretax and net earnings both increased 21%.Segment-wise, Employer Services showed 11% growth in revenue, with 9% organic growth and 8% growth in our traditional payroll and tax filing business in the US. Beyond Payroll revenues grew 18% in the U.S. with strong performance from Employease and VirtualEdge acquisitions. PEO saw a revenue growth of 21%.

Its stock is currently trading around $48 after hitting a 52-week high of $51.5 in February. Its market cap is around $25.5 billion.It would be very interesting to watch if ADP’s acquisition spree continues to embrace some of the Indian BPO efforts that would add some very high-growth components to the company’s portfolio.

With a constant eye on my watch list, this is one of the stocks which has drawn my focus: Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP)For those of you who aren't familiar with ADP, it might be the people who pay you every two weeks. ADP is a provider of business outsourcing solutions. The company you work for may outsource its payroll or even its tax and benefits administration to ADP. It is also a leading provider of integrated computing solutions to several vehicle dealers throughout the world. These are businesses with very predictable cash flow, and high barriers to entry. Each of the markets and businesses that ADP operates in, globally and in the United States, are expected to grow quickly over the next several years. ADP has been growing very quickly over the past few years and is expected to continue that growth going forward. Earnings growth in the high teens are a regular occurance for this firm, and its dividend growth has followed suit. ADP has paid dividends since 1974, and its dividend growth has been very solid. The dividend has actually doubled since 2004, and its latest increase was a very strong 26%. ValuationThe stock is currently sitting at a multi year low of $37.91. From a technical perspective though, the stock chart looks scary as it seems to have broken dow to uncharted territory. The last time this stock looked this good was back in 2003 when it traded down to $32. ADP has traditionally always demanded a premium P/E, which I believe is warranted due to the company's market position, high growth rate, strong return on equity, and low debt. I have my eye on this one as I believe the fear of many jobless Americans has investors selling this one hand over fist. The opportune time to buy into ADP is when fears of a high unemployment rate loom. The current P/E of around 19x marks a 10-year low level. The stock is yielding 3% which is unheard of for ADP shares as well. I always get really interested when I see a big recent dividend raise coupled with a low stock price."

first purchased Automatic Data Processing (NYSE: ADP) during the last
recession after a poor earnings report that broke a string of 25 years
of double digit earnings growth. Since then, the company has offered
steady returns and a nice level of dividend growth. This is a Warren
Buffet type stock: simple business, great operating history, and
rational management. Long-term prospects also remain solid. The key, of
course, is getting this for a great price.
About the CompanyAutomatic Data Processing provides outsourcing solutions to
employers, vehicle retailers, and manufacturers. It operates in three
segments: Employer Services, Professional Employer Organization [PEO]
Services, and Dealer Services.The Employer Services segment offers human resource information,
payroll processing, and tax and benefits administration products and
services. This is ADP’s core and traditional business. The serve over
560,000 employers and pay nearly 33 million workers in 30 countries.The PEO Services segment provides small and medium sized businesses
with employment administration services such as payroll, payroll tax
filing, HR guidance, 401(k) plan administration, benefits
administration, compliance services, health and workers’ compensation
coverage, and other supplemental benefits for employees.The Dealer Services segment offers integrated dealer management
systems and business solutions to automotive, heavy truck, and
powersports vehicle retailers.HistoryThe current CEO, Gary Butler, has committed to focusing ADP on its
core strengths and returning value to shareholders. He has done this by
spinning off ADP’s broker service business, now known as Broadridge
Financial (NYSE: BR), increasing dividends and continuing share
repurchases.The financial highlights below have not been adjusted for the
spin-off. They represent actual reported numbers except for the
revenue, earnings, and earnings per share growth noted in 2007. These
numbers are adjusted to account for the spin-off of Broadridge
Financial.The margins and returns of equity have been very strong in the past, and will likely continue.ValuationThe valuation I’ve derived is pretty straightforward. I start with
owner earnings of $1,254,700 and grow them at a 12% rate for five years
followed by a 5% rate for years 6-30. I then discount the cash flows
back at 10%. The resulting value is $48 per share.If earnings per share are further leveraged by share buybacks in the
coming five years and ADP achieves an 18% earnings per share growth,
shares would be valued at $61 per share. If ADP achieves only 5% growth
for the next 30 years, shares would be worth only $36.ConclusionThe market has recently provided a nice discount for ADP. If shares
approach $35, I will likely add a bit to my current holdings. Returns
are never going to be tremendous for this company, but it provides
relatively stable and predictable returns. Add to it a very shareholder
friendly management team, and it has the makings for a great long-term
holding.Look for dividends to continue to increase, share buybacks to
continue, and earnings per share growth to be surprisingly strong for a
company as mature as ADP."

39377,20869,2007-06-26T05:51:20-04:00,,"Continuing our search for a stock to add to our portfolio of superior dividend yielding stocks, I will analyze Automatic Data Processing Inc. (NASDAQ:ADP). It is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat which means that it has increased it yearly dividend for the last consecutive 25 years. That is a record worth evaluating. Let’s have a look. Company Profile From Yahoo Finance: This is a large cap stock with a market capitalization of $26.78B. Company Fundamentals When determining whether to add a company to my dividend yield portfolio, the first test that must be passed is the return on invested capital. Management must be able to keep a consistently high ROIC. In the case of ADP, management has done a terrific job with a rock solid 17% throughout the whole period. The return on equity numbers confirm management’s success and also show that this company has relatively no debt. In fact, this company has total debt as 0.7% of capital. The ROE numbers are 18.39% over 10 years and 18.37% over 5 years. The equity growth rate has been on the weak side. The 10 year average is 10.17% and the 5 year average is 7.32%. And last year, it was almost at the 5 year average at 7.41%. Definitely nothing to write home about. Earnings per share growth rate nicely reflect the equity growth rate with a rate of 8.59% over the whole 10 year period. However, the 5 year average is 2.83% and last year’s EPS growth rate was 3.35%. Not the trend I want to see. Sales growth rate has been on the decline as well. Over the 10 year period, the sales growth rate was 8.25%. However, that was thanks to some fairly decent sales growth rates in 1997 and 1998. Unfortunately, those growth rates have not been seen again since then. The 5 year average is 5.75% and last year’s growth rate was 4.50%. Dividend Fundamentals ADP is currently paying a dividend yield of 1.88%. That is the same as the S&P 500 dividend yield but lower than the Dow Jones Industrial Average dividend yield of 2.25%. ADP definitely seems to be paying the average dividend yield. The current dividend yield is not as important as the dividend growth in the long run in my opinion. And ADP definitely has a long history of dividend raises. These last 10 years clock in at a dividend growth rate of 13.33% and that has definitely been very stable over the whole 10 year period. That is definitely a healthy dividend raise each year. However, cash flow growth rates have not been keeping up with these dividend growth rates. Over the 10 years, the cash flow growth rate comes in at 6.63%. And it gets much worse from there. The 5 year average is a measly 1.05%, the 3 year average is 1.41% and last year’s was negative 6.23%. With the cash supply not growing as quickly as the dividends, and it takes cold hard cash to pay for dividends, this is a concern. Looking at the dividend payout ratio, I see that ADP has consistently been at around 25% for the first 7 years. However, since then, it has grown over the last 3 years: 34.62%, 33.80% and 38.38% respectively. And this makes sense from the fundamental numbers that we have seen. Valuation Models You know that I like to put a hard number value on a stock. So let’s have a look at our different valuation methods. Looking at yield, I see that the 10 year average high dividend yield is 1.28%. The 5 year average high dividend yield is 1.55%. At today’s current dividend yield of 1.88%, this stock currently has the highest dividend yield it has ever had over the last 10 years. My model yield price is $59.35. That would mean that the stock is currently trading at a discount of 17.72%. However, I think that the diminishing fundamentals are causing investors to demand a higher yield from this company. There may be concern that ADP cannot continue its 13% per year dividend growth. Calculating Graham’s number, I come up with a model price of $21.45. That is a much lower price than I obtained from the yield method. This would imply a premium of 127%! And lastly, let’s calculate the price of the stock 10 years from now. Of course, we need to determine the value that the earnings per share will grow at over the next 10 years. Looking at the equity growth rate, I see a 5 year average of 7.32%. And this correlates well with last year’s rate of 7.41%. Now, analysts have estimated a growth rate of 15%. I have no idea how they can defend that growth rate. Well, ok. I do know how. For 6 of the last 10 years, ADP has been able to grow their EPS at approximately 15%. But I feel that equity growth rate is a better proxy for future EPS growth rate. Typically, investors have been willing to allow a stock to have a P/E that is roughly twice its EPS growth rate. Analysts are forecasting 15% EPS growth rate, and the stock currently is trading at a P/E of 25.57. And historically, ADP has had a P/E in the 25 - 29 range. However, with my estimate future EPS growth rate of 7.32%, no investor would be willing to pay that high a multiple. So, assuming twice the 7.32%, that would give me a future P/E of 14.64. With that information, I determine the future price to be $56.67. Discounting that back to the present (using a rate of 15%), my model price is $14.01. Like my Graham number, this implies a huge premium of 248%! See my calculations here. Conclusion Investors seem to be demanding a higher yield from this stock than they ever have in the past. Many of the fundamental numbers such as equity growth rate, earnings per share, and sales growth rate have been on the decline. Although the yield is high, my other valuation methods show this stock to be too expensive. ADP still has a relatively low payout ratio. So they will definitely be able to continue to grow their dividends at their current historical rate of 13% for the next few years. ADP 1-yr chart  Disclosure: I do not own any shares in ADP."
34513,20099,2007-05-04T04:14:02-04:00,,"Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) recently reported earnings and wants the market to believe all is reasonably well. It is even predicting earnings at the high end of guidance.  But this is after three quarters are in the bag. It refused to give 08 guidance, stating it is still in the budget and forecast stage. ADP executives feel that because of favorable FX rates, ADP will experience attractive revenue growth. This comment was not expanded on by management or significantly questioned by analysts on the conference call. The FX comment needs considerably more color. As ADP expands internationally, more revenue in foreign currency is sourced. In addition, it is supposedly leveraging facilities and staff in India to take advantage of cheap labor costs. The mix of foreign revenues and foreign costs will become increasingly more critical. As ADP continues to shift from expensive U.S. domestic wage rates to cheaper foreign costs, the favorable FX assumption for revenues may provide compensating penalties when calculating costs. In addition, as we can see from stocks such as Infosys (NYSE:INFY), India is running out of cheap intelligent labor and ADP may have incorrectly guessed India’s ability to reduce costs. The sleeper on ADP’s income statement is the growing reliance on interest income earned from client balances. Currently, approximately 55% of net income is derived from this source. ADP is becoming a spread management concern. Clients will eventually start demanding pricing concessions as they become tired of this specific friction cost. When ADP refuses third party independent stand alone software, solutions will become more attractive to employer organizations. ADP is slowing turning on a roasting spit waiting for the future to run it over. ADP 1-yr chart:"

Because rival First Data (FDC) was taken private just a few months ago, our interest in ADP was immediately piqued. Given ADP’s bulletproof balance sheet, strong free cash flow, & potential for an LBO event, we are recommending investors buy into any and all pullbacks in ADP’s share price.   Business Overview  ADP is one of the largest providers of computerized transaction processing, data communication, and information services. It is a leader in human resources services such as payroll and tax, and it also provides benefit administration and comprehensive outsourcing services. It serves about 600,000 clients and helped 32 million employees get paid last year. From 2004-2006, ADP’s revenues, EBIT, net profit, and cash flow grew at a CAGR of 10%, 10%, 29%, and 14%, respectively. The NJ-based company employs over 46,000 people. Investment Highlights  ADP’s large size (its controls 30% of its market) enables scale economies to come into play. It’s Employer Services division is immensely attractive to us as it produces stable cash flows and boasts an economic moat other payroll processing firms would die for. Because of the sheer amount of client data that ADP possesses, we think the switching costs in this industry are quite high, a characteristic private equity practitioners often seek to capitalize on. The recent LBO of student loan giant Sallie Mae (NYSE: SLM) was really about private equity’s interest in controlling a wealth of information, cross-selling SLM’s clients (educational costs are soaring and the potential to cover the entire loan cycle got much easier for Sallie Mae after it gobbled up privately held UPromise® last summer), and obtaining a “best of breed” asset whose shares had temporarily tumbled and dirt cheap. Like Sallie Mae, ADP generates stable cash flows that can be levered against. ADP may sound like a boring company, but investors should note that besides suspicious & erratic spikes in call volume, shares are trading within 5% of their 52 week high  Although ADP is facing pricing pressure from the #2 player Paychex (NYSE:PAYX), there are a number of other qualities we can’t but help think private equity would be interested in claiming, namely, ADP’s low debt (1% of assets), high client retention ratio (90%), trailing 12 FCF/sales yield of 17%, and reputable AAA credit rating. As the table above indicates, investments in new fixed assets are low and the recent spinoff of ADP’s securities clearing business should help drive management focus going forward as well as bolster aggressive share buybacks. Valuation & Risks  ADP’s future looks bright, as cross selling opportunities are rife, core payroll growth remains robust, and management continues to unlock shareholder value (current CEO Gary Butler, a 30Y ADP veteran, has galvanized ADP to repurchase over 20M shares in the last 3 quarters). Furthermore, improving EBIT margins (due to better SG&A expense control) and a pristine balance sheet with close to $4/share in cash strikes us as attractive and nuanced ADP’s currently undervalued stock price. Long time believers, that “best of breed” names, should sell at above-average premiums, we deem shares of ADP undervalued by at least 10%.   Our back of the envelope DCF model (see Exhibit 3 below) is certainly no Picasso, but under a reasonable assumption that sales will continue to grow almost 8% for the next couple of years (approximately ADP’s 3Y average), then taper to 4% thereafter, as well as an assumption that management will sustain a FCF/revenue yield of 15-17%, we arrive at a $54 target price for ADP (we use a 10% required rate of return to account for ADP’s US market concentration (86%/sales), a potentially weaker job milieu, and lower bargaining power vis-à-vis a rapidly consolidating financial services industry (from 2000-05, the number of US commercial banks declined by about 9.7%). As to whether or not ADP is really a $30B+ company, only time will tell – if traditional investors don’t capitalize on ADP’s cheap stock price, private equity probably will.  Appendix: Could ADP Recapitalize? To “size up” ADP in terms of a potential LBO deal, we ran a quick LBO Litmus Test. First, we took ADP’s enterprise value by adding its market cap to its debt and backing out cash – we arrived at $24.5B, approximately. Then, we multiplied ADP’s enterprise value by the prime rate of 8.25% (which we assumed would be ADP’s cost of debt, although we should note that private equity deals have been firing away at higher rates) to determine what level of operating cash flow ADP would need to generate in order to cover interest expense (market rate * book value of debt). This landed us at a $1.95B -- it happens to be right in the ballpark of ADP’s 2006 operating cash flow, $1.81B. Although a quick and dirty approach, it illustrates that ADP should have no problem levering up its balance sheet as cash thrown off from operations seemingly covers potential debt obligations.

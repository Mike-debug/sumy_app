4384754,105240,2020-11-04T03:10:45-05:00,Earnings will likely improve in the coming quarters as the credit card and loan receivable balance will recover as economic activity picks up.ADS’s expansion plans include a new proprietary credit card and vertical growth in beauty segment. The company also plans to ramp up marketing in the fourth quarter.The target price for the mid of next year suggests a high upside from the current market price.,"Earnings of Alliance Data Systems Corporation (NYSE: ADS) improved to $2.79 per share in the third quarter from $0.81 per share in the second quarter of 2020. The earnings recovery was mainly attributable to an improvement in credit sales and lower provisions for loan losses. Earnings will likely continue to increase in the coming quarters as credit card and loan receivables will likely grow as economic activity picks up. Further, ADS has strategic investment plans that will likely drive earnings in the coming quarters. Overall, I’m expecting ADS to report earnings of around $7.07 per share in 2020 and $12.15 per share in 2021. The June 2021 target price suggests a high upside from the current market price; hence, I’m adopting a bullish rating on ADS.ADS’s total revenue recovered in the third quarter to $1,051 million from $979 million in the second quarter. The improvement was mostly attributable to a 28% increase in credit sales in the third quarter, on a linked-quarter basis, as retailers continued reopening and consumer spend improved, according to details given in the third quarter’s investor presentation. The card gross yield improved as the impact of COVID‐related customer relief on fees was mitigated, which undermined the decline of average card receivables during the quarter, thereby lifting credit sales. The following chart from the presentation shows how credit sales rose sequentially despite the decline in average credit card receivables.I’m expecting revenues from card services to continue to improve because the recovery of economic activity will likely drive up credit card receivables. Further, ADS is in the process of offering its new proprietary credit card, called Comenity, which is likely to incrementally increase card receivables in the coming quarters, as mentioned in the presentation. Further, ADS has recently launched two new partnerships in the beauty supplies segment that will support card and loan receivables growth in the coming quarters.ADS also plans to close the acquisition of Bread, a point of sale technology platform, in the fourth quarter of 2020. However, Bread will take three years to be accretive to income, as mentioned in the presentation.The LoyaltyOne segment, which handles air miles and rewards, is another important driver of total revenue as it made up around 18% of revenues in the third quarter. I’m expecting revenue from this segment to continue to improve in the coming quarters as air traveling will likely speed up a few months after a COVID-19 vaccine first becomes available. I’m expecting air travel to return to normal by the second half of 2021.Mostly due to the expected improvement in card and loan receivables and air miles activity, I’m expecting revenue to increase by around 5% year-over-year in 2021. I’m expecting yields to not affect revenues next year because interest rates will likely remain stable. Further, I’m not expecting COVID-19 relief programs to affect yield in 2021.ADS’s earnings improved in the third quarter due to a plunge in provisions for loan losses to $208 million from $250 million in the second quarter of 2020. I’m expecting the provision expense to decline sequentially in the coming quarters but stay above normal. The company has already built significant loan loss reserves earlier this year that will help cover some of the loan losses in the coming quarters. The provisions for loan losses made up 9.1% (annualized) of total loans in the first nine months of 2020, as opposed to an average of 5.9% in the years 2016 to 2019. The management mentioned in the third quarter’s conference call that it expects average net loss rate pressure to be maintained in 2021. Considering these factors, I’m expecting ADS to report provisions for loan losses of $1.2 billion in 2021, representing 7.0% of total loans, down from an expected 8.3% of total loans in 2020.ADS’s credit risk has substantially declined in the third quarter as the economy has reopened. As mentioned in the third quarter’s conference call, COVID-19 related relief programs represented just 3% of total card receivables in the third quarter, down from 10% in the second quarter.Due to the expected recovery in card receivables and sequential decline in provisions for loan losses, I’m expecting earnings to improve in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the third quarter. However, the non-interest expense will likely limit the earnings growth in the fourth quarter. ADS’s plans to invest in strategic initiatives, including the new card offering, will likely drive expenses. Moreover, the management plans to ramp up marketing expenditure in the fourth quarter, as mentioned in the conference call. Considering these factors, I’m expecting ADS to report earnings of $2.84 per share in the fourth quarter, which will take full-year earnings to $7.07 per share.For 2021, I’m expecting the 5% revenue growth to drive earnings. Further, lower provisions for loan losses will likely support earnings growth. Excluding provisions, I’m expecting margins to remain mostly stable because the interest rates are likely to be maintained at the current level. Further, I’m expecting marketing and administrative expenses and investments to increase in tandem with revenues. Considering these factors, I’m expecting earnings to increase by 72% year-over-year in 2021 to $12.15 per share. The following table summarizes my estimates for income statement items.After the slash in dividend earlier this year, ADS’s current quarterly dividend suggests a dividend yield of just 1.5% based on the closing price of $57.37 for November 3, 2020. However, there is room for an increase in dividends because of the expected increase in earnings. Further, ADS’s combined banks had a common equity tier I ratio of 18.8% in the third quarter, as mentioned in the presentation, which is far above the regulatory requirement of 6.5%.However, investors are cautioned that ADS is far from a dividend stock. The sharp cut in dividends earlier this year shows that the management prefers earnings growth over dividend consistency. Further, even if ADS reverts to its previous quarterly dividend level of $0.63 per share, it will provide a dividend yield of only 4.4%.Considering ADS’s history and for the sake of prudence, I’m assuming that ADS will maintain its quarterly dividend at the current level of $0.21 per share through 2021.The price-to-book multiple (“P/B”) is the most appropriate way to value ADS because the company belongs to the financial sector. ADS is currently trading at a P/B ratio of 2.07x, as shown in the chart below.Data by YChartsUsing my earnings and dividend estimates, I have arrived at a forecast book value of $33.3 per share for June 2021. Multiplying this book value per share with the P/B multiple of 2.07 gives a target price of $69.1 for the mid of next year. This price target implies a 20% upside from the current market price. The following table shows the sensitivity of the target price to the P/B ratio.Based on the high upside, I’m adopting a bullish rating on ADS. I like the company because its earnings are set to sharply recover from the COVID-19 pandemic in the coming quarters."
4367873,105703,2020-08-12T05:00:16-04:00,"Alliance Data Systems operates a moat-worthy business with card services and loyalty programs for many leading retailers.Its business has been negatively impacted by the effects of COVID-19, but management's operating efficiency efforts are encouraging.I see the share price reaction as being too negative, with plenty of upside potential with a steadily improving economy.","The Financial sector has been one of the hardest-hit sectors since the start of the pandemic. Since the start of the year, the Fidelity MSCI Financials Index ETF (FNCL) has returned -19.0%, while the S&P 500 has returned +3% YTD, led by strong gains in the tech sector. As such, I believe there are some bargains to be had if one is willing to do a little bit of digging. I believe that the company I’m focused on today, Alliance Data Systems Corp. (ADS), represents one such opportunity. This company operates at the intersection of finance and data-driven marketing, and in this article, I evaluate what makes ADS a potentially good investment at today’s prices; so let’s get started.(Source: Dallas Morning News)Alliance Data Systems is a company that most people may not have heard of. However, it provides essential financial transaction services that many Americans use. The company operates with two primary business segments – Card Services and LoyaltyOne. As a bridge between retailers and consumers, the company is able to provide effective, multi-channel marketing communications for its clients.The LoyaltyOne segment comprises ~20% of the company’s revenues, and provides data-driven loyalty marketing solutions through its Air Miles program in Canada. The Card Services segment comprises the remaining ~80% of the company’s revenues, and manages more than 145 branded credit programs for many well-recognized brands, such as Wayfair (W), Pottery Barn (WSM), and Ulta Beauty (ULTA).Through its relationship with 40 million consumers, ADS is able to better understand consumer behavior and strengthen the relationship between its clients and their customers. What I find attractive about ADS is that it essentially operates at the intersection of financial and data services, which gives it valuable insights that it uses to drive increased consumer adoption.The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly hurt ADS’ business, as evidenced by the -27% and -51% YoY declines in Revenue and Core EPS that it saw in the second quarter. I see this as being a ‘double-whammy’ situation for ADS, as it is exposed to the risks and challenges from both an economic downturn and decreased consumer activity in physical stores during the pandemic. These factors have translated into a vast underperformance in the share price, as evidenced by the stock’s -56% YTD performance. Comparatively, the S&P 500 returned +3% over the same time frame.Looking at the technical performance below, it appears that shares have somewhat stabilized since the volatile ‘peaks and valleys’ phase from March to June. Since the beginning of July, the share price has bounced in the $40 to $45 range, with solid support in the low $40s. As such, I don’t see shares dipping below the $40 handle without a major news event, and in the near term, I see a slightly bullish pattern beginning to emerge. Shares remain undervalued from a technical standpoint, as they are sitting well below the 200-day moving average of $70.70.(Source: StockCharts)Meanwhile, management has taken steps to adapt the business to the current COVID-19 environment, as it pivoted the Air Miles rewards program to at-home delivery and service options, and launched a digital redemption program. In addition, I see longer term benefits from management’s efforts to position the business with a leaner operating model, as the CEO noted on the latest conference call (emphasis added by author):Additionally, credit delinquencies appear to be stable, as just 10% of its card members are in forbearance, and 85% of those not in forbearance made a payment, which as management noted, is significantly up from last year. Nonetheless, management has taken the prudent step of boosting its reserve ratio from 12.1% to 13.3%, due to uncertainty around macroeconomic factors and a second stimulus measure. While the dividend was reduced and share repurchases have been suspended, I see them as being justified moves in helping the company strengthen the balance sheet. At present, the company carries $1.2 billion in cash with no debt maturities until December of 2022.Turning to analyst estimates, I’m encouraged by the overall bullish sentiment, as the shares have an average recommendation rating of 2.2, which implies a Buy rating. In addition, the average price target is $61.27, which sits comfortably above where the shares are trading at today.(Source: YCharts)Alliance Data Systems operates a profitable and moat-worthy card services and loyalty programs business with many leading retailers. With valuable insights into consumer behavior, the company is able to offer its retail clients highly effective multi-channel marketing communications to consumers. While the company has been negatively impacted by the effects of COVID-19, I see the share price reaction as being overly negative and unwarranted, with potential for strong upside from the currently low valuation. In addition, I see the cost efficiencies that management is driving to be long-term positives for the company. Lastly, I’m encouraged by the relatively low delinquency rate that the company has seen, with plenty of upside potential with an economic rebound.I have a Buy rating on shares at the current price of $48.91 and a forward P/E ratio of 7.9. I have a price target of $62, which translates to a forward P/E ratio of 10. I believe this price target is reasonable and still provides investors with an adequate margin of safety, given my expectation of a steadily improving economy through the rest of this year.(Source: F.A.S.T.

4369383,20599,2020-08-18T01:37:45-04:00,"Alliance Data Systems faces uncertain times because COVID-19 has disrupted its business of retail loyalty and credit cards.Though the stock had touched a high of about $297 and is available at 17% of that high, it still does not make the cut as a long-term bet.However, it can be picked up as a trading play, depending on chart signals.","Imagine owning a retail loyalty business at a time when consumer confidence is down in the dumps, a credit card business at a time when the real unemployment rate is high, and an air miles business at a time when airlines are leaking cash and are desperate for travel to restart.That, in short, is the story of Alliance Data Systems (ADS) in COVID-19 times. The stock is currently at $47, as of August 13, 2020, a pale shadow of its 2015 high of about $310.Many investors have begun taking a liking to beaten-down pre-COVID-19 themes, and it is a matter of time before sentiment starts favoring ADS too. Nonetheless, one needs to check if it qualifies for investment as of now.In Q2 2020, ADS beat EPS estimates by $0.34 but missed revenue estimates by $178 million. The primary reason was the stimulus checks, and the secondary reason was that many states had reopened for business. People had cash, and they paid up their dues, and delinquency rates stabilized or reduced.(Image Source: ADS Q2 2020 Earnings Call Transcript)However, things have taken a turn for the worse since then, and the virus is back with a vengeance. Schools are opening in an unplanned manner, people are not obeying the mask orders, election rhetoric is getting shriller, eviction notices are being printed, and politicians have taken a break without agreeing on the Stimulus-2 bill.Everything seems to be in a mess these days, and the virus is not letting up. Bankruptcies have started surging, and the retail and airline industries are facing rough weather. Therefore ADS’ business prospects seem uncertain until an effective and safe vaccine, or a drug, is developed for COVID-19.Return on Money Deployed in Business(Image Source: ADS’s Q2 2020 SEC Filing)ADS’s balance sheet has about $16.6 billion in deposits, long-term debt, paid-in capital, retained earnings, and non-recourse borrowings. It is reasonable to estimate that by deploying this capital in the business, the company should earn a reasonable return and generate healthy cash flows.In Q2 2020, ADS generated $495 million in operating cash flows after providing for a non-cash charge of $304.3 million. The company’s operating income in the same quarter was $174.7 million. That means the company generated 2.98% and 1.05% of its total money employed in the business as quarterly operating cash flows and net income, respectively.The outlook is uncertain, and Q3 and Q4 2020 may not be as decent as H1 2020. Therefore, ADS’s earning power in the short term may be adversely impacted.(Image Source: Seeking Alpha)ADS’s Total Return metric compares poorly with that of its peers like Seagate Technology (STX), Citrix Systems (CTXS), and Axcelis Technologies (ACLS). The peers have delivered superior returns or have not lost much on multiple time frames ranging between 1 year and 10 years.ADS compares favorably only from the very short-term point of view (1 month), but it has been a loser on every other time frame.ADS is a beaten-down stock and it can rise in the short term, especially if market operators start paying attention to names that got hammered because of the pandemic. It looks like a trading idea that is dependent on charts rather than fundamentals.If I were a long-term investor, I would keep away from ADS because the unemployment situation can linger on till 2022. The retail industry is floundering, the airline industry hopes to recover by 2024, and there’s a wave of bankruptcies coming up. The outlook is uncertain, and the company is slashing expenses to ride through this rough patch. So long COVID-19 hangs around, the company will likely feel the pain.*Like this article?

4319083,103910,2020-01-28T09:00:00-05:00,"Alliance Data Systems is a private label credit card company that has grown EPS at an 18% CAGR since 2005.The company’s focus on mall-based retailers in the past has led to earnings declines over the past two years.As ADS focuses on growth sectors within retail, earnings growth should begin to improve.  The stock, at 5-6x earnings, is priced as if it will be out of business in a few years.The company generates impressive ROEs and tons of free cash flow that the company can use to buy back shares or perhaps continue growing the dividend.","This article was selected to be shared with PRO+ subscribers, who also got 7 days' exclusive access to Thomas Lott’s original Top Idea on Alliance Data Systems (NYSE:ADS). Find out more about PRO+ here.Seeking Alpha: Can you briefly summarize your bullish thesis for readers who may not have seen it yet?Thomas Lott: Sure. ADS is primarily a private label credit card issuer. They historically focused on mall-based retailers. So, when you are checking out at J Crew for example, they will ask you if you want a J Crew credit card. ADS manages these programs, as well as carrying the receivable balances on their books. And the growth rate in this space was mid-teens for years. That is, until physical retail sales began to shift to online sales a few years ago. ADS’ earnings peaked at over $19 per share in 2017, but likely will be in the $16.90 ballpark this year.Nobody likes a company in secular decline, so the stock has been murdered, dropping from $300 per share to $110 or so now.Throw in two CEO changes in 9 months, and the market is downright fearful what the future of this company is.From a valuation standpoint, that means that ADS has dropped from a 30x P/E multiple, to today it's trading at a bit over 6x trailing earnings, or a 15% FCF yield. That’s pretty insane.However, ADS appears to be at an inflection point today. In 2015, noting the declining sales volumes at malls, the company altered its strategy to shift from issuing credit cards on behalf of mall-based retailers, to growth segments like e-tailers and beauty and jewelry type verticals.From over 60% of sales to mall-based consumers in 2015, today only 25% of card sales are from their legacy retailers. While the company is making significant progress, this transition has been painful, and takes time.In Q3 2019, ADS reported Card Services revenue actually grew 3%. As they have unloaded old declining blocks of card business, ADS has also taken some large provisions. These charges likely will taper off in 2020, and sales appear poised to grow 5-7%.Given the massive free cash flow that this business generates, and the low multiple here, buybacks are going to be significantly accretive to EPS. Just taking stable/runrate earnings figures, and throwing in buybacks, and the company should be able to do $19-20 in EPS in 2020.Rarely have I seen beaten up finance companies continue to trade at 5-6x earnings. The stable ones, comps like Synchrony (NYSE:SYF) and Capital One (NYSE:COF), trade in the 8-10x range usually. When Santander (NYSE:SC) for example traded to 5x earnings a couple of years ago, just a bit of growth in earnings brought the stock back up well over 100% in three years, to an 8.5x multiple.So, at even just an 8 multiple, ADS appears to offer upside to between $150 and $180 per share.A new CEO, Ralph Andretta, will also join the company next month (February 2020). He ran Citigroup’s (NYSE:C) card business and looks like a good fit.Their balance sheet is fine by the way, no concerns there.SA: Can you discuss how the fears of a retail apocalypse have spread from retailers to mall REITs and now to a private label credit card issuer such as ADS, and how this creates the mispricing? Are investors still “living in the past” in terms of how they view ADS’ exposure?TL: Nothing scares investors more than the term mall-based retailers! While these companies continue to struggle with weak sales, it is far easier for Alliance Data to just find replacement retailers that already are growing online. In fact, they have done a good job adding new customers like Sally Beauty, Wayfair and Houzz.This won’t immediately turn around overnight. They still carry card balances from L Brands (NYSE:LB), which is quite profitable business, but in slow secular decline. Overall, the company is targeting mid to high single-digit growth, which seems doable. That is assuming we don’t have a recession.Overall, if their legacy retail customers decline 1-3% (which is the case in L Brands case for example, their biggest customer), and the new Wayfair’s of the world grow 5-10%, then that should average out to growth again at ADS.One thing investors seem to miss about this business is the variable cost nature of it. Unlike a brick-and-mortar retailer, who carries the burden of high fixed costs and negative operating leverage, ADS is an asset-light finance company. They are better able to adapt to sales declines.SA: Can you discuss how there is opportunity even if management falls short of guidance? Do investors mistakenly treat this as an “all or nothing” scenario?TL: Yes, good question. Guidance today is that EPS will grow in the mid to high 20% ballpark in 2020. A tender offer in August 2019, plus repaying debt with sales proceeds (ADS sold their Epsilon marketing business in mid-2019), and a little growth in their core Card Services business all add up to impressive improvement over 2019. That said, I am not modeling that kind of growth. The company’s outlook implies $21+ in EPS in 2020.With Street estimates at $19.42 in 2020, and my estimates between $19 and $20 per share, the bar seems pretty low. They’ll likely miss their guidance, but in my view, any growth at all and/or the perception of even GDP type growth will dramatically improve the multiple on the stock.Don’t forget there has been a negative technical here, as ValueAct began unloading their 7% stake last October. I suspect that they are done selling, but it has definitely weighed here.SA: It appears ADS has a significantly larger moat than investors give it credit for - can you discuss this and how it helps limit the downside?TL: Absolutely the reality is that this business would be extremely hard to replicate. Competitors need scale, a decent-sized balance sheet and marketing know-how which drives customers like Wayfair to choose a card provider on their behalf.The banks aren’t really equipped to do this. These are really marketing decisions. Understand that retailers like J Crew want a J Crew card so that they can market to their best customers. They avoid the 3% fees that Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) charge, but more importantly they can track exactly what purchases their return customers want to buy, and can market to these valuable customers.The biggest competitors to ADS are Capital One (COF), Synchrony Financial (SYF) and Citi. It’s truly an oligopoly. But the bigger guys here really target the over billion dollar plus accounts. ADS focuses on a nice niche of $100mm to $1BB customers.As for the downside, with such high ROEs, ADS’ earnings held up remarkably well during the Great Recession. EPS fell roughly 1/3 from peak to trough, far better than most banks and better than names like Discover (NYSE:DFS). The reason?When people lose their jobs, they stop using their private label Victoria’s Secret cards, and instead run up balances on their general purpose cards. For necessities like food and bills. Loss rates were lower for ADS than even blue-chip issuers like JPM, Citi and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) during that time. The downside is probably $14-15 in EPS if we get a recession in 2021. Even at a 6 multiple, that is 85-90 per share.With upside to perhaps $175, I like the set up here.***Thanks to Thomas for the interview."
4318053,24784,2020-01-29T08:00:00-05:00,"While Alliance Data Systems does not quite qualify as a Compounder, as a Second Tier name, it has an impressive track record and throws off tons of FCF.At 5.3x 2020 EPS, this is a stunningly-cheap (and hated) stock that has a 50-75% upside.There is risk, particularly in an economic slowdown, but the margin of safety is too high to ignore.","Alliance Data Systems (NYSE:ADS) has been perhaps the worst-performing financial stock over the past 3-4 years. In 2015, the stock peaked at $300 per share, only to drop over the next four years to its current level around $112, down roughly 60%.The company is a retail-oriented, private-label credit card issuer, for consumers who want, for example, a Victoria's Secret branded card. The stock has suffered mightily as credit card balances at the company have continued to decline amidst the shift away from brick and mortar retail to online spending.At 5.3x forward 2020 earnings, ADS is the absolute cheapest stock in our 2nd Tier bucket, on both an absolute and relative P/E ratio (scoring over 2 standard deviations cheap to its history). While not a best-in-class Compounder, ADS has some impressive historical metrics and is pretty close:But the list of recent mishaps is equally impressive:That is a lot of bad news.When the Fed lowered in 2019, it added insult to injury. Net interest margins (""NIM"") will be pressured near term, as their credit card balances immediately reset to lower Prime rates, but longer duration liabilities remain in place (for 6 months on average).But I believe the company is at an inflection point.In 2015, roughly 60% of their credit card receivable (""AR"") balances were with legacy mall-based retailers and included many apparel stores. With bankruptcies, falling sales, and store closings, these AR levels have been in decline. The company has since been aggressively shifting into growth segments.While a painful transition, this shift is paying off. Today, of their AR balances, over 60% are with new, healthier verticals: for example, beauty products, home goods, and e-tailers. AR balances are beginning to grow.It is starting to show up in the numbers, too. In Q3 Card Services revenue actually increased 3%, and the company today expects mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth in 2020. Per management guidance, that plus buybacks should drive EPS growth upwards to 25% in 2020 as well.November appears even stronger, with monthly data showing average AR balances up an impressive 8% year over year.While absolutely not one investor in this stock believes in management's 2020 guidance, my suspicion is that, if they grow revenue and earnings at all, this stock will not continue to trade at a 5x multiple.As for peers, Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) trades at 8.5x, with their ""core revenue"" growing around 5%.At a comp multiple at 7.5x earnings, a healthy 15% discount to SYF/COF, and a $21 in EPS in 2020-2021, ADS would trade to $160 per share, up almost 50%. On the downside, I struggle valuing this at a sub 5x multiple. Perhaps, earnings stagnate, and at 5-6x TTM EPS, ADS would trade at $85-100, down about 20%.But there is lots of hair here, and probably, a name that may not only take patience but also try it during earnings season.Source: Author spreadsheetNote: The right column above (labeled ""Parent"") excludes bank deposits and non-recourse debt from credit card securitizations. Cash, per conversations with management, is shown at $200mm above, which excludes cash held for regulatory purposes at their two banking subsidiaries.Alliance Data Systems today operates in 2 businesses: Card Services and Loyalty.The company sold their Epsilon marketing business in July 2019 for $4.5BB ($3.5BB net of taxes). They used $2.5BB to pay down debt and $750mm to tender for shares at a price of $148.50 last August.1. Card ServicesThe biggest business and the crown jewel, at just over 90% of EBITDA, is Card Services, which offers co-branded and private-label credit cards for retailers (like J. Crew, for example) who don't have the capacity to manage a credit card program internally.Underwriting, issuing cards, sending out bills, and collecting payments, is a valuable service they provide for their retail customers. A co-branded card can be used at any retailer (a la American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL) Mastercard), whereas a private label card can only be used at the particular retailer (e.g. a Target (NYSE:TGT) card). Retailers love private label cards, as it's a closed network that cuts out the normal 3% fee that banks/Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) usually charge.More importantly is that ADS is able to collect data on exactly what purchases were made by particular card customers and can email specials or sales to them, or cross-market and offer online rewards/coupons as well. The marketing potential and value cannot be understated. Return customers are the most valuable to a retailer.In all, ADS has 160 private label and co-branded card programs. L Brands (NYSE:LB) is their biggest customer with about 10% of total ARs.As ADS keeps the credit card balances on their own balance sheet, they essentially are a credit institution. Synchrony Financial is their best peer, but Capital One (COF), American Express (AXP), Discover (DFS) and Citigroup (C) are also comps.Most of the bigger names in the space go after the biggest customers, like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) (who last year transitioned from SYF to COF), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) (managed by SYF today).ADS operates in a smaller niche, focusing on the $100mm to $1BB sized AR balance retailers, whereas Citi and SYF (with 70% market share) focus on bigger fish. Replicating this business would be virtually impossible, creating a nice moat for the few real private label competitors in this industry (ADS, C, COF, and SYF).Contracts to provide co-branded or private label credit cards with customers are typically 5-15 years. Given the disruptive nature of switching and potential loss of customer data, retention rates are high. Note that, even if a retail customer files for bankruptcy, the card receivables are due from the consumer and tend to continue to be paid.The biggest problem with ADS's business in a nutshell is that the industry is pretty much fully saturated, and as brick and mortar retail declines, so have their credit card balances and sales.Since 2015, ADS has struggled with retail weakness, and as mentioned, about 60% of card balances back then were held with smaller-sized mall-based retailers. Today, with only 25% of ARs held with mall-based retailers, and with 60%+ not in secular decline, the shift has finally begun to pay off.SourceThe bears would point out that ADS carries a large portfolio of subprime consumer risk and that delinquencies and charge-offs are higher than peers. That is true indeed, but properly provisioned, a subprime lender can still generate very healthy 20-30% EBITDA margins, depending on delinquency rates and economic conditions.With almost 25% interest rates on cards, there is a lot of leeway to be profitable even with 6% average annual charge-offs. ADS continued to generate solid high 20% EBITDA margins even in 2008 and 2009. Worst case, net charge-offs were around 8% during the Great Recession.It is also worth pointing out that, in this smaller retail niche, the average credit card customer carries only a $500 balance. While interest rates may be egregious, at 24.7% today, on low balances, the absolute dollars are not large and often ignored by individual cardholders.2. Loyalty BusinessSecondly, ADS operates a Loyalty business, mostly Canadian-based, that has had its own share of struggles. ADS manages loyalty programs (Lowe's Canada (NYSE:LOW) for example), collecting data and ""miles"" or ""points"" for customers.In Canada, 70% of the population actually has an Air Miles loyalty card. That way, with one card, consumers can have access to 160 different loyalty programs nationwide.It is a spread business for ADS, as they collect revenue from their sponsor for dollars spent (e.g. Lowe's), and then pay for redemptions made by Loyalty consumers (gift cards, coupons etc.). In return for payments, sponsors get important data mining/analytics, and marketing campaigns, too.At 17% of revenue and 9% of EBITDA, Loyalty is not a huge business for ADS. With mid 20% EBITDA margins, it today is a GDP-type, slow-growth business that does throw off a fair amount of cash.Problems arose for Loyalty in 2015, when Canada's parliament banned the expiry of miles. Prior to this, miles were lost if not used within 5 years, and the Loyalty business made a lot of their money on this breakage. I suspect ADS may consider selling this business in the future, although management has said that it is not a pressing business to unwind, given its solid free cash flow characteristics.Source: Author spreadsheet and company financialsThe big takeaway from above is that Card Services has struggled since 2015. Card Services EBITDA margins have compressed from 37% in 2016, to 26% this year. Blame higher charge-offs and loan loss provisioning, as the company shifts away from some of its weaker retailers.Loyalty EBITDA margins have remained relatively stable, with Canadian dollar weakness a big reason for declining EBITDA.I always note delinquency data compared to Allowance for Loan Losses (""ALL""). When ALL is lower than current levels of delinquencies, then I get worried. Here, at 107%, it is a hair tight but acceptable. SYF runs a bit higher with a 125% ratio. (The higher the better).Financial stocks can be a disaster when they are over-levered. In ADS's case, they have $18BB in credit card receivables, funded with $12.5BB in deposits plus roughly $7BB in non-recourse securitizations. Corporate debt totals $3BB, with $4.5BB of cash.At 2x debt/EBITDA on a gross basis, and in a net cash position overall at the parent, it is hard to get too worried. Funding costs run in the high 3% range overall, against 24.7% APRs, a very healthy spread.Here is the balance sheet:With the Epsilon sale closing in July 2019, plus a tender offer/debt paydown in August, Q3 was quite messy. On the negative side, management was forced to cut guidance to $16.88 in EPS this year.Some background:Coming into the year, management forecast $22 in core EPS for 2019.In Q1, 2019 guidance was cut to $18.47 after the announced sale of Epsilon (so yes $3.50 in earnings lost, but the company stated that that was before applying proceeds to buying back shares and debt reduction).In Q2, management raised guidance to $19.63 after the Epsilon sale closed, to account for a partial year of share repurchases.In Q3, management then cut guidance to $16.88 for 2019. The company has been selling blocks of Accounts Receivables in its strategic shift, and write-downs there, combined with lower AR balances, have caused a negative revision. Back to school weakness also hurt.No wonder the market is fed up with the company.I am hopeful that Melisa Miller, who started as CEO in June (and ran Card Services before anyway), decided to lowball the year in her first full quarter running the show.Just to illustrate the noise in the quarter, here is a rundown of the GAAP to adjusted EPS (which typically is pretty clean).I found the $100mm provision expense to be a non-legitimate add back. So, my $4.72 figure includes that expense. It seems plausible that lower underwriting standards will lead to higher charge-offs; my hope is that the company is provisioning for this properly.Overall 2019 charge-offs are expected to be flat compared to 2018 at just under 6%.If we annualize this estimate (about 28% of EPS is generated in Q3), use the most recent share count, and factor in debt reduction (i.e. interest savings) from the $2.5BB of debt repaid, then I get a run rate EPS figure of $19.13 per share.I figure with any growth in receivables, they should be in the $20-21 in EPS range in 2020. The company is also targeting $100mm in incremental cost savings for 2020 that I did not factor into above.Below is a summary model, with a Recession scenario included.The recession scenario simply takes charge-offs from 6% to a peak of 8% as was experienced during the Great Recession. Every point hit to charge-offs is 1% X $18BB (180mm in lower EBITDA). Like 2009, EPS would fall in the 25-30% range, to roughly $15.78 as modeled above.Synchrony trades at 8.5x earnings, and Capital One also trades in the same ballpark at 8.7x. Both of these stocks typically trade at 10x going back a decade.ADS, on the other hand, trades at 5.3-5.5x forward 2020 EPS, and 6.5x 2019 estimates.Below is a chart of Alliance Data's P/E ratio going back to 2011.Quite a collapse in the multiple!During the 2010-2015 time frame, AR growth averaged 15%, with EPS growth a bit better.The company now is targeting 7-8% AR and revenue growth going forward. EPS growth should be a bit better than that. Share buybacks, which average about 5% per year also should be additive to EPS.Street estimates for 2021 are $22.68 in earnings per share.A SYF multiple on that is 8.5 X $22.68 = $193 for upside of 75%.Private label cards, even at the subprime level, is a high margin, high ROE business. While ADS struggles with some top-line issues, I don't expect the company to actually continue to lose revenue, given its shift, and barring a recession.With EBITDA in the $1.55BB range, and capex at $155mm for 2020, this is a great free cash flow business. Select M&A and buybacks, plus an ok dividend yield (at 2.3% today), offer ways to offset incremental credit balance weakness.With their free cash, since 2015, the company has reduced its share count by 27% cumulatively, or 5.5% per year. They did sell their Epsilon marketing business in mid-2019, so part of the proceeds were used to buy back shares.Below is management's 2020 outlook:SourceAdmittedly, management has been overpromising and under-delivering for years now. In fact, the last (promotional) CEO Ed Heffernan left in mid-2019. His successor, Melisa Miller will step down when the new CEO (Ralph Andretta) takes over in early February 2020.The CFO has indicated that Melissa was more a temporary solution, and that they found a new candidate more quickly than expected. The new guy at least is from co-brand competitor Citigroup. While we have no real ability to assess his skills, his resume does fit well with ADS.This is actually the third time I have looked at ADS. The first time, in 2016, at $200 plus per share, I deemed it fair value, but risky with a load of mall-type retail ARs dominating the book.Last June, I passed at $150, as, to me, it seemed that everything was going wrong with it (falling AR balances, Epsilon sale, declining NIMs, weakening economy).The difference today seems to be that 1) it's stunningly cheap and trades at multiples where financial stocks tend to bottom, 2) ARs and revenue in Card Services are now (finally) growing again, and 3) the consumer and economy appear on more solid footing. This is, after all, a large moat business with high ROEs, and a killer track record, right up until 2016.There are parallels here to Santander Consumer (NYSE:SC) too. SC's stock fell in 2015 from $25 to under $10 the next year, from a P/E of 10x to under 5x. It has since recovered to $23 again, roughly an 8.2x multiple. Similar to ADS, they charge high rates to risky consumers, in their case for automobile purchases. SC, however, lacks the track record of ADS.Yes, there is a new CEO on the way, with the risk of cutting guidance. There is risk, too, of continued AR and EPS weakness, especially if we get a recession. But, to me, the risk reward is favorable.Recent wins with companies like Sally Beauty (NYSE:SBH), Houzz (HOUZ), Wayfair (NYSE:W), Build.com, and Lands' End (NASDAQ:LE) point to a shift to growthier clients.In time, this strategy should work. I do worry that we are too early in buying, especially if the company lowers lending standards in order to offset AR declines from its problematic mall-based retail clients. But, at 5-6x earnings, the company is priced as if it will be out of business in less than a decade.Cycle/Credit RisksFlat Yield CurveSubprime ExposureL BrandsManagement TurnoverSelling by ValueActNew CECL Accounting Rules (will increase provision expense some in 2020)"
4317826,52852,2020-01-19T22:02:38-05:00,"Contrary to bullish articles on Alliance Data Systems, the stock is fraught with risks.The company is rudderless, with multiple CEO transitions within a year, among other executive turnover.Furthermore, the credit cycle is long in the tooth, and Alliance Data Systems is exposed to the retail apocalypse.","As I was studying Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS), a song keep playing in my head, Pitbull's Timber. It goes something like this:Source: A Zen Analyst originalAll kidding aside, I feel deeply concerned by the recent bullish articles on ADS, which, in my opinion, do not highlight the high degree of risks involved in owning the stock. ADS fell 50-60% over the past two years, while the S&P 500 rallied 18%. But it is not the underperformance that makes the stock risky, it is the emerging risk factors that do so. In this article, I will explain to my readers a few key risks associated with owning ADS.Let's start with the company's June 7th, 2019 press release notifying investors that its long-time CEO, Ed Heffernan, resigned as CEO, President, and Director of ADS effective June 5th. In the press release, ADS's chairman issued the following statement to calm investors' nerves:I would like my readers to learn the following lesson - one that I learned many times as professional investor: a CEO transition effective in two weeks is bad, a CEO transition effective two days ago is really bad, but when the Chairman assures that the stock is a strong investment with a bright future, it is really, really bad.(Image Source)In August 2019, the company announced, effective the same day as the press release, that the CEO of LoyaltyOne resigned. LoyaltyOne is ~25% of ADS's 2018 revenue after excluding Epsilon, which the company sold in 2019.In a November 2019 press release, after just five months, ADS's board replaced the new CEO (remember Ms. Miller that the Chairman was so excited about in the June press release?) with an even newer CEO. This transition will be effective February 2020.I don't know about you, but boy, am I excited about this upcoming earnings call on 1/3/2020!The consumer credit expansion cycle is long in the tooth and showing signs of strain. NCO (net chargeoff) rate for US consumer credit bottomed around mid-2015 at a tad below 3%, but steadily rose to around 4% by June 2019 - that's a ~1/3 increase. (Source: Bloomberg)ADS's 3Q'19 NCO was 5.6%, higher than Synchrony Financial's (SYF) 5.4%, Capital One's (COF) 4.1% and Discover Financial Services' (DFS) 3.3%.There are two key main drivers for rising NCO. First is rising unemployment, which reduces consumers' ability to pay off debt. Since the economy remains robust and unemployment low, this isn't the issue. The second driver of increasing NCO is a booming economy, which increases competitive and risk-taking behavior of financial institutions. This dynamic results in two negatives.Negative #1: Financial institutions loosen credit standards as they reach to extend marginal credit to the marginal borrower. Diminishing marginal utility is Economics 101. Consumer credit growth has been accelerating since 2012, and peaked at around +6.8% in 2016. (Source: Federal Reserve)Negative #2: Believing that the economy is healthy, issuers bid aggressively against each other for deals. Prime example: ADS's pure-play private-label credit card competitor, SYF, recently lost Walmart (WMT) to COF. Another example is Goldman Sachs' (GS.PK) highly unequal partnership with Apple (AAPL).ADS was one of the most aggressive growers during this period of credit expansion, growing average receivable balances ~22% in 2013, ~21% in 2014, a whopping 30% in 2015, and 24% in 2016.Unfortunately for ADS, it grew into the worst possible vertical: mall-based retailers. Although the disclosure strikes me as being very spotty, I've been able to piece it together.It is beyond the scope of this article to cover the ""retail apocalypse"", but do spend some time researching this topic and each of the retailers I presented in this section.To be fair, ADS is making an effort to reduce its mall-based retail exposure. According to my notes, the CFO said during a December 2019 Goldman conference that ADS's mall-based apparel retailers exposure went from 50% to 60% of the company's receivables to 25% currently. While this is good progress, 25% is still a large chunk - and note that it is a very specific ""mall-based apparel retailers"".I am not making a call on the direction of the stock, but I do think that the do-it-yourself investor ought to know the risks associated with owning ADS. Contrary to some of the bullish articles out there, ADS ownership is fraught with risks, which, in my opinion, justifies the price declines. Note that the risks I discussed in this article are only the more salient ones to me. Please read the 10-K and do your own due diligence to uncover the others I have not discussed (for example, capital structure concerns). Personally, I am staying on the sidelines until after the company reports Q4 earnings on 1/30/2020 given yet another CEO transition. Please share your perspective below!"
4344573,104609,2020-05-08T08:19:36-04:00,"Credit card companies are likely to take a hit, not only due to a decline in retail sales but also an increase in loan losses.Alliance Data Systems has a higher-than-normal delinquency rate of 6-7% that is likely to spike with unemployment.It has struggled to keep up with the shift away from brick-and-mortar - a shift that is accelerating in today's environment.The company has a tangible book value of about zero, so it lacks the financial wherewithal to handle a substantial increase in loan losses.While the company appears cheap on a historical basis, its business model is not robust, so its survivability is uncertain.","Alliance Data Systems (ADS) has taken a significant COVID-19 hit and remains nearly 60% below its March highs. The company provides loyalty credit card services to brick-and-mortar stores, as well as data analytics services. ADS has been struggling for years due to the decline of brick-and-mortar sales, and many fear that COVID-19 will be its final blow. Indeed, the data suggests that this is a possibility.In 2015, the stock hit a peak price of $300. By January of this year, it had declined to $100 and has fallen 50% more since then. The revenue and assets have been in decline since then, and many analysts are looking for the bottom. Indeed, analysts may see a value opportunity. The stock's valuation is low with a TTM P/E of 12X and a price-to-cash flow of around 2X. The discrepancy can be attributed to loan loss provisions.If we assume ADS's prospects will not continue to decline, it is clearly undervalued. However, COVID-19, as well as long-term factors, jeopardize its turnaround potential. As you'll see, the company does not have much room to handle a rise in charge-offs.COVID-19 has caused brick-and-mortar sales to decline dramatically. Many major retailers are closed or are seeing much lower traffic than normal. The company has made an effort to expand e-commerce operations, but the fact remains that brand loyalty is lower online, so loyalty-based credit cards are less viable.Additionally, the value to customers of travel rewards is likely greatly diminished, meaning new customer growth will likely be very poor. In fact, credit card applications have already dropped by 40% during the virus, and it seems the trend will continue.More worrisome is the likelihood of an increase in delinquencies. The company has allowed greater forbearance and is planning for greater charge-offs. Delinquency was already a problem before this crisis, and it is only likely to accelerate in Q2. While an increase in accounts receivable may look like growth, it will not be if people are unable to repay the debt.It is true that the generous unemployment bonus and stimulus checks will temporarily mitigate this risk. However, state unemployment systems are already running out of funds and are now reliant on loans from the federal government. This means they will likely be increasingly stringent on new jobless applications and are unlikely to continue payments after six months.Obviously, COVID-19 stay-at-home orders are unlikely to last so long, but I'd bet double-digit unemployment will. Thus, there may be a substantial increase in individual bankruptcies for the rest of 2020.By far, ADS's main revenue source is credit card charges. In Q1, it saw $1.2 billion in revenue from charges and only $46 million and $120 million in service and redemption revenue respectively. It may market itself as a technology company, but the fact is that it is a traditional credit card company.Similarly, the company's major expense is its provision for loan losses, which stood at $655 million last quarter, up from $252 million in Q1 2019 due to expected COVID-19 impacts. At the end of March, ADS had $1.28 billion in delinquent loans, half of which were over 91 days delinquent (see 10-Q pg. 15). With $17.36 billion in total delinquencies and receivables, it has had a delinquency rate of 7.4%, which is far higher than the national average of 2.6%.Given the $403 million in additional loan loss provisions, it expects this rate to jump to at least 9.6% (likely higher given over half of the delinquencies usually repay).Quite frankly, I believe ADS is giving a relatively conservative estimate for the spike. The company's book value is only $1.08 billion, so if there are greater charge-offs than expected, then that could easily cause its equity book value to turn negative. Of course, the company has about a billion in intangible assets, so its tangible book value is essentially zero. If the cash stops coming, it will be forced to sell equity to repay creditors.Bulls argue that the company made it through 2008 without significant hiccups. This is true, as its net income hardly fell and the stock price and gross profit rapidly recovered. See below:Data by YChartsAs you can see, ADS made it through the Great Financial Crisis without a financial crisis. That said, the total U.S credit card debt is over 60% higher today. Indeed, mortgage debt remains far below 2006-2007 levels, but total household debt is higher due to a buildup of credit card, auto, student, and other higher-interest forms of debt. Additionally, 80% of workers now live paycheck to paycheck.In my opinion, ADS is in a bit of a lose-lose situation. If consumers continue to spend, there is a high probability of significant loan losses that jeopardize the company's ability to stay solvent. If they do not continue to spend and use the money to repay debt, loan losses will be less problematic but total receivables and revenue will decline. U.S retail sales have already declined at least 9% (far worse than any period in 2008) and will likely remain depressed for months. If stay-at-home measures are extended (even if slightly lifted), it is likely that both will occur.In this article, I focused largely on the short-run impacts of COVID-19. It seems clear that the economic fallout of stay-at-home measures will hurt the company significantly on all fronts. Demand for its cards will be much lower, loan losses significantly higher, and its operational efficiency likely lower due to employees working from home.Of course, these negative factors will likely rebound after the economy is reopened. However, the fact is that many businesses will be permanently closed, and unemployment will likely remain high at least through year-end. Even more, it is possible that the virus has accelerated a permanent shift toward e-commerce, which has been the major long-term factor harming ADS.Additionally, without an extreme business model transition, the company's long-term prospects are poor due to its dependence on brick-and-mortar. According to ADS's 10-K, its 10 largest clients account for 44% of its revenue, with the struggling-to-survive L Brands (LB) accounting for 11%. While the company is focusing on greater value with data, I have doubts it will be able to successfully manage the change, as witnessed by its declining revenue over recent years.I do not have a position in the company, but I believe it is headed lower and best avoided at its current price. Yes, its valuation may seem low, but the leverage is extremely high, which leaves little room for a substantial increase in bad debt expenses. If there is a rapid rebound of the real economy, ADS may be a value opportunity. However, such a rebound looks increasingly unlikely, making the company overvalued."
4311331,104812,2019-12-09T05:26:58-05:00,ADS is down 44% over the past year based on a challenging operating environment.The company is profitable and management sees higher growth next year.We think the market may be too bearish as the stock trades at a deep discount to industry peers while broader consumer credit fundamentals remain positive.We rate ADS as a buy.,"Alliance Data Systems (NYSE:ADS) provides private label credit cards along with marketing services and loyalty programs for over 145 brands with 43 million active cardholders. It's been a difficult operating environment for the company given the ongoing structural weakness in the retail industry considering declining brick and mortar traffic and ongoing store closures among a number of major clients. Weak growth and a decline in earnings have sent shares in ADS 44% lower over the past year. That being said, there are some encouraging signs of a turnaround with management offering a positive outlook for the year ahead. We think ADS represents value at the current level and the market is simply too bearish. This article recaps recent developments and our view on where the stock is headed next.(Source: Finviz.com)The company last reported Q3 earnings in October with non-GAAP EPS of $5.05 and GAAP EPS of $2.41 which both missed expectations. Revenue on the quarter at $1.44 billion increased by 1.4% year over year. Despite the significant decline in the stock price, the company remains profitable and free cash flow positive. The market has focused on its weak growth, lower card receivables, loan balance quality, and lower gross yield which have combined for earnings headwinds.(Source: Company IR)The card services segment which represents 83% of revenues and 89% of the operating income in the last quarter appeared to show some stability with management highlighting a 6% y/y increase in credit sales as the first positive quarter of 2019 for the metric. Favorably, the segment's operating expense as a percent of revenue fell by 100 basis points to 8.7% from 9.7% in Q3 2018. Another positive this past quarter was the principal loss rate that fell 30 basis points to 5.6% from 5.9% in the period last year.The company maintains a bullish outlook on market fundamentals seeing the core private label credit card business with robust growth with a forecast of industry outstanding balances to grow by 6% per year through 2022. The trend has been more ""omni-channel"" shopping by consumers shifting from brick and mortar to online while ADS sees opportunity to grow with the changes in the market including mobile. The company sees a market opportunity of $50 billion per year as an addressable market.(Source: Company IR)Management is guiding for full year 2019 revenues at $5.6 billion, flat from 2018. The reported EPS target in a range between $16.75 and $17.00 if confirmed would be down by about 14% from $19.49 in 2018. Going forward, the company has a more positive outlook with an expectation to return to earnings growth in 2020 driven by reducing its cost structure and streamlining its operating model. Current guidance sees 2020 revenue growth up to the ""low-single digits"" and core pro-forma EPS growth in the ""mid to high 20%"" range.(Source: Company IR)It's important to recognize that ADS has some of the highest delinquency and charge-off rates among major credit card companies. With data for October 2019, ADS's delinquency rate reached 5.9% and the charge-off rate reached 6.6%, each above the industry average.(Source: Seeking Alpha)The relatively high numbers here compared to traditional credit card companies like Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) or American Express (AXP) reflect ADS's focus on retail store-branded credit cards which are simply a higher-risk lending segment typically attracting lower-credit rated consumers. The figures here are also higher than Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) with a 'core delinquency' rate of 4.5% and 'adjusted charge-off' rate of 5.1%, as the closest comparable considering both companies focus on private-label credit cards with a high exposure to retail.The other side is that these cards are often issued with higher interest rates and represent the earnings opportunity for the underlying ADS business. ADS highlights how its business is able to generate industry-leading ROE which has averaged 40% over the past five years. The company believes it is positioned for long term, sustainable growth.(Source: Company IR)What we like about ADS is that it trades at a deep discount to industry peers reflecting the weaker growth this year and lower-quality balance sheet credit exposure and overall bearish sentiment more recently. ADS's forward P/E multiple at 6.2x compares to an average forward P/E of 8.9x for Synchrony Financial, Capital One Financial Corp., and Discover Financial Services (DFS). ADS's price to free cash flow at 2.6x is at a 7% discount to SYF and 14% discount to COF.Data by YChartsThe higher delinquency and charge-off rates in recent months for ADS are concerning but from a macro perspective, there are indications the environment could be improving or at least will stabilize. Going back to the first half of 2019, a concern in the market was that the U.S. economy was decelerating towards a recession which would negatively impact credit services companies leveraged to trends in consumer spending.Investors here simply need to reconcile what has been a more recent wave of enthusiasm towards a recovery to economic growth expectations in the United States. The global macro outlook has also become less uncertain with a growing consensus of a U.S.-China trade deal or preliminary agreement that has pressured global risk sentiment. The S&P 500 (SPY) trading at a new all-time high suggests the market is gaining confidence that the economic cycle will be extended.Considering the most recent November jobs report with a stronger than expected non-farm payrolls result, the sense is that trends like a firm labor market and accelerating wage growth will be positive for consumer credit. The setup here is that ADS is well-positioned to benefit over the next year at the margin.Even for investors that aren't buying the narrative of a potential economic growth renaissance, which is understandable, a middle ground of moderate economic growth with stable consumer dynamics should also be positive for ADS. The company can realize its operational and financial recovery in 2020 based on management guidance under different market scenarios.It's been a difficult year for ADS with disappointing results. We believe the core business has value and the company has a path to regain growth. The company recently hired a new CEO which may be the fresh start and new perspective it needs to move forward. We like the stock on valuation and see upside with a potential stabilization of operating metrics in the year ahead.The main risk will be the cyclical outlook and consumer credit conditions. A deterioration in the labor market and spike in credit card delinquencies could likely lead to a reassessment of the company's earnings outlook. Given the company's market segment exposure to retail, we expect volatility to continue. Overall, we view risks as tilted to the upside and rate shares of ADS as a buy."
4344329,66103,2020-05-07T16:24:29-04:00,"Alliance Data Systems stock has been severely beaten down.Investors are afraid that large charge-offs will wipe out the company's equity.A look at past history and the level of reserves build-up suggest that the company will survive this downturn. If so, the upside is huge.","Alliance Data Systems Corporation (NYSE:ADS) was founded in 1996 and is headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. Alliance Data was formed from the December 1996 merger of J.C. Penney's (JCP) credit card processing unit and The Limited's credit card bank operation. In August 1998, Alliance Data acquired Loyalty Group for $250 million. The deal gave Alliance Data two valuable business enhancements, Canada's Air Miles Rewards Program and the company behind the popular Air Miles program, LoyaltyOne. It also had a digital marketing segment called Epsilon which it divested in 2019 for about $3.5 Billion or (10 X EBITDA).Alliance Data Systems Corporation operates through two segments, LoyaltyOne and Card Services. The LoyaltyOne segment offers the AIR MILES reward program in Canada; short-term loyalty program; and loyalty services, which include loyalty consulting, customer analytics, creative services, and mobile solutions.The Card Services segment provides receivable financing services comprising underwriting and risk management; processing services, such as new account processing, bill processing, remittance processing, and customer care; and marketing services to private label and co-brand retail credit card programs. Segment Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA are as follows:The Card Services segment is now the major profit driver of the company.ADS Card Services is basically a private-label credit card issuer. Private-label credit cards are issued in partnership with retailers and differ from general-purpose cards in that they can only be used at the issuing retailer. The company also issues co-branded cards with retailers in partnership with Visa (NYSE:V) or Mastercard (NYSE:MA) that can be used at any retailer. It mainly targets customers with prime credit ratings.The card issuers, consumers, and retailers form a symbiotic relationship. The issuer earns a net interest margin and the retailers get the benefit of a loyalty relationship, personalized market intelligence, and avoidance of interchange fees charged by general-purpose card issuers. The consumers get the benefit of special discounts, loyalty rewards as well as customized terms (i.e., extended credit terms).The company captures and analyzes data created during each customer interaction, leveraging the insight derived from that data to enable clients to identify and acquire new customers and to enhance customer loyalty. It serves clients across various end-markets, including financial services, specialty retail, grocery and drugstore chains, petroleum retail, home furnishing and hardware, beauty and jewelry, hospitality and travel, and telecommunications.The stock came out of the depth of the financial crisis of 2009 like gangbusters when it bought back 30% of its shares outstanding with excess funds released from its loan loss reserves. The stock reached its peak in 2015. After that, as the retail apocalypse meme took hold, it has been on a downwards trajectory. With the recent COVID-19 downturn, it has really broken down. With the current downturn, investors, obviously, fear that people will stop paying their credit card bills and defaults will increase.So, basically, we have a situation here where not only net income has declined but the multiples investors are willing to pay for the shares have also imploded. One big issue is that after the financial crisis, the market was valuing the company like a technology company and giving it high P/E multiples (in the mid-20s to mid-30s.) This issue was picked upon by short-sellers who shorted the stock and made a lot of money. Over time, motivated by the shorts, the market realized its error that ADS is more and more a finance/credit company rather than a tech/industrial company, and P/E multiples started to re-rate the shares to much lower multiple. In fact, ADS financial reporting is still stuck in the past, i.e., its reports are structured like that of a tech company and not like an ordinary finance company. The end result is investor confusion, skepticism, and low valuation.I believe investors have overreacted to the fear of charge-offs. The company does not appear to be going out of business. ADS has built up its Allowance for Loan Loss (ALL) reserves rapidly. As of March 31, the company had ALL reserves of 2,150.80 million vs. credit card loan receivables of 17,731.9 million. This is adequate for the absorption of a 12.1% charge-offs vs. receivables without dipping into equity. In 2010, a ratio of 10% provision proved adequate to weather the last recession. This is also comparable to the ratio put forward to Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in their presentation (below).Commenting on first-quarter results, Ralph Andretta, president and chief executive officer of Alliance Data said:Andretta added that:Thus, unless the current crisis is much worse than the great recession, ADS's reserves should be adequate to absorb peak recession charge-offs without affecting equity. Capital at the bank level is quite healthy at about 17% (regulatory minimum is 4%).It should be noted that ADS owns two state-regulated industrial/credit-card bank subsidiaries in Delaware and Utah, respectively (Comenity Bank or Comenity Capital Bank). These banks take FDIC insured deposits such as Money Market and CDs and issue the credit cards. ADS's receivables are funded through a combination of bank deposits and securitization of receivables. The company has total liabilities of 23.1 Billion (6.3 Billion are securitized and non-recourse).ADS has compounded book value at about 20% per annum over the last 10 years and bought back a lot of stock. Unfortunately, the stock has fallen quite a bit and the money has not ended up in shareholder's pocket.If push comes to shove, ADS can sell its loyalty segment. It could likely get $1.12 billion for that segment (I am assuming ~5x EBITDA; last year, it could have got 10x for it based on similar deals in the loyalty space, but such is life and this is now.) Synchrony Financial is its closest but much larger competitor with revenues of $16 billion, valued at around $10 billion market cap (P/S of 0.63). This would imply that the ADS's card services segment with an estimated 2020 revenues of $4 billion should be valued at about 2.5 billion. This would imply a sum of parts value of $3.6 billion vs. a current market cap of 2.1 billion as compared to peers. This is a 42% margin of safety, at a low point in the business cycle.The loyalty segment should be separated from the card division. With the sale of Epsilon, ADS is really a credit card bank. I believe it is just a matter of time before this happens.This is, of course, just the start of the downturn and the situation will continue for the next year. In Q1, receivables were already down -9%. I think we can easily expect that receivables will plummet rapidly (I am estimating -20% to -30%) in the quarters ahead from a year ago. While this reduces risk, it will have a negative effect on earnings potential. Understandably, the company is not able to provide guidance. The company has also cut its dividend by 2/3rd. The huge economic uncertainty has driven the stock price to a low level.The following table gives ADS income from continuing operations. As you can see, it's quite variable with 2018 being the peak.Note: The company has included depreciation and amortization expenses in the above numbers which are not really that relevant for a mostly finance company as there are little assets to wear out. I have left them in, but, if anything, the true profitability is understated.Assuming that ADS can get earnings back to the 2019 level after the recession, the company's current market capitalization is only 2.2 billion. This is less than 5 times normalized core earnings. Assuming normalized P/E to be about 10, this would represent a 100% upside. The Price to Sales ratio is at the lowest level in its history. If the company manages to survive this downturn (and odds suggest that it will), the upside on the other side should be very good.Multiple insiders have bought the stock recently which is encouraging."
4283746,105080,2019-08-09T11:26:52-04:00,"The stock has consistently underperformed in recent years: from touching above $300 a share in 2015, it currently trades at around $140.Since the end of 2018, several new signings have already been announced.The restructured ADS remains cheap within a cohort of inexpensive credit card/payment providers.","The following segment was excerpted from this fund letter.Alliance Data Systems (NYSE:ADS) is a provider of credit card lending, marketing and loyalty services to a variety of consumer-facing businesses, principally online and physical retailers. The company is organized in three segments, the largest of which is the credit cards business, as well as a loyalty program which includes the Canadian Air Miles program, and Epsilon, a marketing and analytics business first acquired in 2004 for $310 million (the company has also since acquired other marketing businesses that have been integrated into Epsilon).Perhaps in part because of the confusing collection of tangentially related businesses in ADS, the stock has consistently underperformed in recent years: from touching above $300 a share in 2015, it currently trades at around $140. The last fall has come as a result of the company's attempt at simplifying its narrative by selling Epsilon to Publicis Groupe (OTCQX:PUBGY) for $4.4 billion ($3.5 billion net of taxes and fees), which the company plans to use for share repurchases and debt paydown. The market was disappointed with the sale price, as prior valuations had pegged Epsilon's value as being higher, and the stock has fallen further to its currently depressed levels. The sale of Epsilon was duly completed on 1 July 2019.Irrespective of whether the sale price is disappointing, we think that at this stage the business is unambiguously cheap. According to our calculations, which adjust 2018 annual earnings for the Epsilon sale and subsequent debt paydown and share repurchases (assuming they happen around current price levels), the remaining credit card and loyalty businesses are trading at around 6.5-7 times trailing earnings.Several assumptions underlie this analysis: in particular, use of a trailing multiple may not make sense if the trend of falling credit card receivables seen during 2018 continues. However, the decline in balances during 2018 was the result of a deliberate move by the company to clean its portfolio of failing and underperforming retailers, and the company is confident it can continue to grow receivables over time by signing new clients with better growth profiles and ramping up recently signed clients. If the company's estimates for 2019 prove accurate, it will have grown the balances by a compound annual growth rate of 17% over 8 years:Since the end of 2018, several new signings have already been announced, which gives us confidence that the company will be able to return to growth in receivables. We've also taken the company's estimates for corporate expense reductions resulting from the sale at face value. Here, too, signs are encouraging: in particular, ADS already eliminated one layer of management by replacing the CEO and CFO with the previous CEO and CFO of the card business, both of whom have been with the company for many years. This move also suggests - although nothing concrete has been confirmed by the company - that the loyalty business may also be sold, further simplifying the company's narrative and freeing up more capital for share buybacks which, at these levels, are likely to prove extremely accretive.The restructured ADS remains cheap within a cohort of inexpensive credit card/payment providers. The group represents a stark contrast to the aforementioned new-age companies that ostensibly provide some sort of credit disguised as annuity:It should be noted that the consensus numbers above assume differential and varied assumptions on share buybacks to our own. Additionally, the opportunity for industry consolidation or further divestments by ADS remains a live one making prevailing valuation metrics very attractive.Editor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."

The company has a solid history of generating impressive earnings growth, and the future growth ratios point to continued growth over the next twelve months. I lay out my bullish argument for the company below by reviewing some pertinent fundamental and technical aspects of the stock.My Momentum Growth Quotient (MGQ) plays a critical part when it comes to determining if I am going to go long or short a stock. Generally, I only want to go long a stock with an MGQ higher than that of the S&P 100, and I want to go short a stock with an MGQ lower than that of the index (for a more detailed explanation of how I calculate the MGQ, please see my blog post).As of the end of October 2018, the MGQ for the S&P 100 was 9.21.The current MGQ for ADS stands at 15.42, which implies a 67.53% higher growth rate compared to the S&P 100. This tells us that ADS has strong future growth potential and is a good candidate for a long position.Let's dig a little deeper into the financial data to get a better feel for how the company has performed on certain fundamental metrics and what these numbers imply for future growth.Caveat Lector: I am Quant Trader - that is, I seek to understand market behaviour by using mathematical and statistical modelling, measurement, and research. So, you won't find much qualitative analysis in my work or in my trading process. The goal is to identify optimum entry points for trades based on my quantitative model and execute those trades as efficiently as possible.During the past 12 months, the average EBITDA per share growth rate of Alliance Data Systems Corp. was 23.90% per year. During the past 3 years, the average EBITDA per share growth rate was 19.20% per year. During the past 5 years, the average EBITDA per share growth rate was 16.50% per year. During the past 10 years, the average EBITDA per share growth rate was 17.70% per year. (GuruFocus). Earnings growth has been consistent and strong over the last ten years.The operating margin % TTM for ADS stands at 17.60%. Each dollar of revenue the company generated brought in 17.60 cents of earnings. The company's operating margin is well above the industry average of 4.49%.Knowing how a company has performed in the past is important in order to evaluate management's past record in running the business. But more important to us is how profitable the company will be in the future because we are investing going forward, not backward. And it's the forward-looking metrics that should really get you excited about ADS.I like to use two measuring sticks to gauge the future growth potential for companies: forward P/E and forward rate of return.I prefer to use the forward P/E ratio (current stock's price over its ""expected"" earnings per share) rather than historical P/E to gauge a company's expected future earnings power. A high forward P/E ratio means that investors are anticipating higher growth in the future and are willing to pay more for future earnings - momentum investing is all about following the trend (perceived or real).ADS has a forward P/E of 7.71 compared to a 17.10 forward P/E for the S&P 100. The forward P/E for ADS is lower than that of the index, but I'm willing to overlook this weak data point in light of the strong MGQ for these shares.The forward rate of return for a stock (created by Donald Yacktman) is one of my favorite quotients for gauging the market's expectation for future growth for a company. Yacktman defines forward rate of return as the normalized free cash flow yield plus real growth plus inflation. In simple terms, the forward rate of return can be thought of as the return that investors buying the stock today can expect from it in the future.The forward rate of return for ADS stands at 29.61%. This implies that an investor buying the stock today should expect a 29.61% return over the next 12 months. The average forward rate of return for the S&P 100 as of the end of October was at 8.03%, so ADS has an implied potential rate of return that is 3.68x greater than that of the index.The risk inherent in the forward rate of return is that the calculation is reliable only if the company can grow at the same rate in the future as it did in the past. If the growth rate falters, the projected returns will not materialize. But we are willing to accept this risk as part of the difficult process of forecasting earnings and growth momentum.As per my ChartMasterPro Daily Trade Model, there is a high probability of a rally to the $250.00 level from here - the RSI 14 has just bounced off oversold territory and is now rising; the MACD is rising, and the shares found strong support at the $195.00 level.

The recent price drop in the shares presents an excellent opportunity to initiate a position in ADS.When I go long a stock, I want to invest in a company that provides superior future growth potential, but I also want to time the entry into any position to try to maximize my return.So, I use fundamental analysis to identify shares with a strong future growth rate, and then I apply technical analysis to identify ideal entry points.In my opinion, ADS is a compelling buy at these levels from both a fundamental and technical perspective."
4255092,25120,2019-04-17T20:58:04-04:00,"Alliance Data has sold Epsilon in a fair deal, but deal costs and taxes are very high.This makes investors rightfully disappointed by the deal.Being more of a near-pure play on card services, I see the reasons behind the low valuation multiples, as more clarity could boost valuation multiples over time.","Alliance Data Systems (ADS) has reached a deal to sell its Epsilon business to French-based Publicis Groupe (OTCQX:PUBGY) in a $4.4 billion deal. Despite the multi-billion deal tag, the transaction is not welcomed by investors in part because taxes and deal related costs are very high, and a spin-off might have been a more logical way to go. That route, however, did not provide massive deleveraging options, which are needed amidst a complicated balance sheet and what appears to be lack of trust by investors.Alliance Data has reached a $4.4 billion deal to sell its Epsilon business, but the net proceeds only amount to $3.5 billion. This money will be used for both debt repayments as well as share repurchases. Note that the $900 million deal leakage is very big, equivalent to $17 per share, or about 10% of the pre-deal share price. Ironically enough, shares fell by just about this percentage, as the market seems to agree that the pre-tax deal valuation is fair but that deal-related costs and taxes are simply very high. Furthermore, rumours hit the markets recently that the deal could fetch as much as $5 billion or even more.Little information was provided by the company in connection to the deal other than that the (gross) deal amount is equivalent to about 10 times EBITDA, as the deal could close as soon as the third quarter of the year.For those not too familiar with the company, Epsilon is the provider of loyalty marketing programs and was originally acquired in 2004 by Alliance Data Systems. While that deal at the time only involved a $300 million payment, note that multiple acquisitions have been integrated into Epsilon over time, making it hard to judge how large the success of this deal really was.Early February, Alliance Data reported the results for 2018. Full-year revenues rose by a percent to $7.8 billion as ""pro forma"" revenues rose by 5% to $8.1 billion. The company reports two adjusted EBITDA numbers. The largest is the $2.47 billion adjusted EBITDA number, as adjusted EBITDA net of funding costs amounts to $2.08 billion in 2018.The company was already in the process of selling Epsilon for a while, and the sale is anything but a surprise. The unit saw revenues fall by 4% to $2.18 billion, while segment EBITDA was flattish around $475 million. With net proceeds of just $3.5 billion, that suggests that investors see just a 1.6 times sales multiple and a 7.3 times EBITDA multiple, which means that investors probably desired a spin-off over the outright sale of the unit.Putting the valuation into perspective. Alliance Data Systems has 54.2 million shares outstanding which trade at $180 ahead of the sale of the Epsilon business, for a $9.8 billion equity valuation. Calculating the enterprise value is very difficult given the nature of the (remaining) business, notably card services. This business is the dominant core business with $4.6 billion in sales, complemented by the smaller $1 billion+ LoyaltyOne segment. As the balance sheet is very difficult to read, with huge receivables and payables showing up as a result of the card business, a $10 billion valuation for those two businesses (assuming flat net debt) is equivalent to about 1.8 times sales and roughly 6 times EBITDA - not very demanding valuations.The simple reality is that it seems the market is not trusting the earnings power of ADS, with adjusted earnings reported at $22.72 per share last year, as even the GAAP earnings power of $17.49 per share looks quite impressive.The reality is that much of the remaining business is really a card business which behaves as a bank, including the associated heavy balance sheet that includes nearly $19 billion in credit card and loan receivables. Note that these are not mortgage type of receivables in terms of their safety, with delinquency rates being as high as 5.7% last year and net principal loss rates totalling 6.1%.With the earnings power for all of Alliance Data amounting to about a billion ahead of the Epsilon sale, it is obvious that the balance sheet is large and risks might be high. Note that charge-offs at a rate of 6% are quite high compared to other kinds of receivables in this environment, as doubling these charges could result in a wipe-out of the profits and easily cast doubts on the financial position of the business. This is probably the reason why the business trades at high-single digit earnings multiples, although its cash holdings are improving quite a bit following the latest divestment.So, while the business has become less leveraged and a bit more insightful following the latest divestment, I have to conclude that I still have some principle issues to buy into Alliance Data here, which is really a card business with a high risk proposition. Thus, I am not buying the cheap valuation argument just yet, although I will look forward to the more simplified and less leveraged business following closure of the deal with above-average interest."

The company has a solid history of generating strong earnings, and the future growth rate ratios point to accelerated earnings growth. I lay out my bullish argument for the company below by reviewing some pertinent fundamental and technical aspects of the stock.Over the last few months, I have developed a new approach for my fundamental analysis of stocks: the Momentum Growth Quotient (MGQ). The MGQ is the key metric that I use to gauge the financial health of a company and its potential future growth prospects. The MGQ is calculated using the following company financial data:The goal is to generate a single number, which summarises the relative fundamental strength and future growth prospects for a company compared to an index. For the index, I use the S&P 100 - this index provides a wide swath of companies from different industries representative of the broad US economy. I update the Momentum Growth Quotient for each company in the S&P 100 every month and then use the average quotient as my baseline to compare the relative financial strength of individual companies.As of the end of June, the average MGQ for the S&P 100 was 10.28. So, if a company has an MGQ of 12.00, its individual future growth prospects are around 20% higher than the index. If a company has an MGQ of 8, its future growth prospects are around 20% lower than the index.The MGQ plays a critical part when it comes to determining if I am going to go long or short a stock. Generally, I only want to go long a stock with an MGQ higher than the index, and I want to go short a stock with an MGQ lower than the index.The MGQ for ADS as of the end of June was 15.33, which implies a 49.1% higher growth rate compared to the S&P 100. This tells us that ADS has strong future growth potential and is a good candidate for a long position.Let's dig a little deeper into the financial data to get a better feel of how the company has performed on certain fundamental metrics and what these numbers imply for future growth.The PastDuring the past 12 months, the average EBITDA per Share Growth Rate of Alliance Data Systems Corp was 26.90% per year. During the past 3 years, the average EBITDA per Share Growth Rate was 19.20% per year. During the past 5 years, the average EBITDA per Share Growth Rate was 16.50% per year. During the past 10 years, the average EBITDA per Share Growth Rate was 17.70% per year (GuruFocus). The company has been able to generate earnings on a consistent basis over the long term, and earnings growth has accelerated nicely over the last twelve months. The operating margin % for ADS came in at a 22.08% as of March 2018. Each dollar of revenue the company generated brought in 22.08 cents of earnings. The company's operating margin came well above for the average of 7.45% for the non-bank, non-insurance financial services sector. The FutureKnowing how a company has performed in the past is important in order to evaluate management's past record in running the business. But more important to us is how profitable the company will be in the future because we are investing going forward, not backwards. And it's the forward-looking metrics that should really get you excited about ADS.I like to use two measuring sticks to gauge the future growth potential for companies: Forward P/E and forward rate of return.There are several ways to interpret a company's Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E). One approach is to look for companies that have a lower P/E compared to other companies in similar sectors - the rationale being that the lower the P/E, the more a company is being undervalued by the market, hence, the more value you are buying for every dollar invested. This makes a low-P/E stock a good value, but there is also the other side of the coin - it can also indicate that investors aren't very confident about the company's prospects.I prefer to use Forward P/E (current stock's price over its ""expected"" earnings per share) to gauge a company's expected future earning power. A high Forward P/E ratio means that investors are anticipating higher growth in the future and are willing to pay more for future earnings - momentum investing is all about following the trend (perceived or real).ADS has a Forward P/E of 10.65 compared to a 17.29 Forward P/E for the S&P 100. The Forward P/E for ADS is lower than that of the index, indicating that investor growth prospects for the stock are lower than that of the broader market, but we view any Forward P/E above 10 as acceptable for a long position.The forward rate of return for a stock (created by Donald Yacktman) is one of my favourite quotients for gauging the market's expectation for future growth for a company. Yacktman defines forward rate of return as the normalized free cash flow yield plus real growth plus inflation. In simple terms, the forward rate of return can be thought of as the return that investors buying the stock today can expect from it in the future.The forward rate of return for ADS stands at 28.99%. This implies that an investor buying the stock today should expect a 28.99% return over the next 12 months. The average forward rate of return for the S&P 100 stands at 9.68%, so ADS has an implied potential rate of return that is 2.99x greater than that of the index.The risk inherent in the forward rate of return is that the calculation is reliable only if the company can grow at the same rate in the future as it did in the past. If the growth rate falters, the projected returns will not materialise. But we are willing to accept this risk as part of the difficult process of forecasting earnings and growth momentum.As per our ChartMasterPro Daily Trade Model, the momentum trend for ADS would turn bullish with a break above $245.00. This would signal a bullish breakout above a reverse head & shoulders pattern that has been forming on the daily charts since February 27. From here, we see the shares climbing to the $275.00 level over the next three months.Today, we will buy the ADS 21SEP18 230 Call Options, which will provide us with approximately 12x leverage on our long trade. Our stop-loss exit signal for the trade will be a daily close below $220.00. When trading options with leverage, a stop-loss is absolutely imperative in order to avoid oversized losses and wipe-outs.For investors in the shares, we recommend that you hold for 3 months or $275.00, whichever comes first. For longer-term investors, I believe ADS is a solid addition to any growth portfolio over the next 12 months.In 2013, the CEO of Alliance Data Edward Heffernan stated: “We’re probably the largest company that nobody’s heard of. Our job is to be invisible.” And they've done a good job at remaining invisible. I have to confess that before researching the company for this article I had no idea who they were or what they did!ADS specialises in data-driven marketing and loyalty solutions by providing branded private label credit cards and loyalty programs for businesses. Alliance Data offers a service that it is critical for businesses to stay relevant in today's hyper-competitive retail world - and this makes me like the company's prospects moving forward. In a world where data is king, as a business you want to ensure that you making the best use of the data that you have about your clients, and this is exactly what ADS does for its clients. It's estimated that one-third of the companies on Fortune 1000 are clients of ADS. And the company just recently added two high profile retailers to its list of clients: Ikea Group US in January 2018 and Lucky Brand in February 2018. ADS also offers the AIR MILES rewards program in Canada - it's estimated that 70% of Canadians are enrolled in the AIR MILES program - that's the kind of market penetration that I love to see in companies that I invest in. And there's room for the company to grow - ADS keeps currently keeps tabs on the spending habits of approximately 26 million American households via their private label credit cards - but there are around 126 million households in American. There is still plenty of opportunity for the company to gain market share going forward. And let's take a quick look at the company's most recent quarter. For Q2 2018 the company beat on revenue and earnings, but more importantly it projects earnings to increase 14% to 16% and revenue to increase 6% in the second half of 2018. When I add my strong MGQ number to the 2018 forecast, there is a lot to like about this company at its current share price. When I go long a stock, I want to invest in a company that provides superior future growth potential, but I also want to time the entry into any position to try to maximise my return.So, I use fundamental analysis to identify shares with a strong future growth rate, and then I apply technical analysis to identify ideal entry points.In my opinion, ADS is a strong buy at these levels from both a fundamental and technical perspective."

Penney's (JCP) transaction services business (BSI Business Services, Inc.) and Limited Brands, Inc.'s credit card bank operation (World Financial Network National Bank). In 1998, ADS added Canada’s growing AIR MILES program to their portfolio through the purchase of the Loyalty Group Canada for $250 million. In 2004, ADS purchased the marketing firm Epsilon (Source: ADS SEC Filings).Compiled by Author (Source: ADS SEC Filings)ADS has posted mid-teen CAGRs for net income and revenue since 2005, with their credit card receivables growing from $3.1 billion in 2005 to $15.1 billion at the end of 2017 (Source: ADS SEC Filings). Currently, the company is made up of the following 3 divisions:Card Services – ADS currently manages over 160 branded credit card programs. Under this division, they process credit applications and issue credit that is provided to consumers. In 2017, their Credit Services group contributed about 54% of the company’s total revenue. One publicly traded entity that this division can be compared to is Synchrony Financial (NYSE: SYF).Epsilon – This is ADS’ marketing agency which consults with clients on managing their entire customer marketing lifecycle. In 2017, Epsilon contributed about 29% of the company’s total revenue. Some publicly traded peers that Epsilon competes with are Omnicom (NYSE:OMC) and WPP Plc (NYSE: WPP).LoyaltyOne – This division controls ADS’ loyalty program businesses which includes AIR MILES, dotz and BrandLoyalty. Together, they contributed about 17% of the company’s total revenue. The publicly traded entity that most closely resembles this division is Aimia (OTCPK: GAPFF) which owns Canada’s Aeroplan points program.In the past decade, most of ADS’ growth can be directly attributed to their Card Services business. In 10 years, this division has grown from about $0.5 billion in revenue to $4.1 billion (Source: ADS SEC Filings). This growth has been the result of the acquisition of several credit portfolios and the gradual recovery/expansion of credit in the United States since the financial crisis.Divisional RevenueCompiled by Author (Source: ADS SEC Filings)Proportional Revenue by DivisionCompiled by Author (Source: ADS SEC Filings)With a market capitalization of approximately $13 billion and a CAGR of 13% for revenue since 2008, one has to wonder how much further ADS has left to grow. Maintaining a mid-teen growth rate seems a bit of a stretch considering we are likely at the tail end of a bull cycle in the US economy. Based on the 2008 recession, ADS’ Card Services revenue could drop by up to 25% if consumer spending descends into this specific type of environment.There are several risks associated with ADS that could cause their revenue to drop significantly in the future. For example, with the American economy growing at 3-4%, for ADS to continually grow at double digits, they are going to have to expand sales on their credit card by encouraging larger expenditures from existing customers or acquire more undervalued portfolios from existing competitors. However, this will become increasingly more difficult to do over time as the capital that ADS has to work with increases and appropriately sized opportunities decrease in order for them to achieve a meaningful return. If they can’t find new opportunities, their growth will suffer and the multiple people are willing to pay for the stock will go down. In the short run, this type of problem can easily be overcome by loosening the credit quality required for their customers, but eventually this strategy will come back to haunt the company.Revenue and Net IncomeCompiled by Author (Source: ADS SEC Filings)Another important risk to consider for ADS is how their reward programs must remain relevant. The loss of Air Canada as an anchor customer to Amia recently can also easily happen to ADS’ AIR MILES program. This could cause a spiral effect downwards in ADS’ revenue for their loyalty program divisions and possibly in their marketing firm. Effective loyalty programs depend on consumers being able to collect benefits at multiple retail outlets so that they can earn meaningful rewards. If ADS were to lose a major partner, it may leave the AIR MILES program irrelevant for point accumulation for many collectors.In ADS’ 10-K, they describe themselves as a “global provider of data-driven marketing and loyalty solutions serving large, consumer-based businesses in a variety of industries” which I feel is a bit misleading when over 50% of their revenue is derived from financing charges. In my view, ADS can be better described as a bank which issues private label credit cards and has the ability to leverage knowledge gained from their marketing firm and loyalty programs to maximize growth in their banking division. While it can be argued that ADS earns a significant amount of revenue from consulting, I believe that a large majority of the risks associated with the stock has to do with the lending portfolio. This doesn’t mean we should ignore the other parts of the business during the evaluation or ignore the fact that there could be some very big synergies between all the businesses. It means that we should recognize that ADS could see a lot more downside in a recessionary environment due to the risk profile of their banking operations than if one were to consider it a diversified data mining company or marketing agency.By looking at ADS’ businesses separately, you can see their marketing and loyalty rewards divisions shouldn’t really attract large multiples on their earnings as they are not experiencing the same level of growth anywhere near their Card Services division. For example, since BrandLoyalty became a part of ADS in 2014, their Redemption revenue has been decreasing year over year. The top line growth for their marketing business was a measly 4% last year which at best should command a multiple of 15x earnings when you look at peers in today’s market. So, ADS management may be viewing these two businesses as assets that drive growth in their credit card business through the intricate knowledge they have gained from transaction data. The question for an investor is if we have enough information available to us to believe that this is true. I don’t believe investors do. I am more inclined to believe that the relationship between the two businesses is not as strong as it is assumed to be. For one, many other companies have access to customer behavior data similar to ADS and use it to figure out how to use it to their advantage. This strategy is not new and it’s hard for me to believe that somehow ADS is significantly better at interpreting and applying this data profitably than their nearest competitor Synchrony or any other card issuer. So, for these reasons, I would estimate the current value of ADS’ Epsilon and LoyaltyOne divisions to be around $5-6 billion based on their combined EBITDA of close to $750 million. This valuation would leave us to determine the probability that the Card Services division is worth at least $7-$8 billion based on the company’s current market valuation of $13 billion. If I take the Card Services 2017 EBITDA of $1.3 billion and subtract their interest expense, I get about $850 million. I would then factor in that this number may be a bit inflated due the credit cycle being in the later stages and apply a 25% margin of safety, bringing me to a value of $637 million. I would then apply a reasonable multiple of 8 to 10 to receive a value of approximately $5.0-$6.3 billion. The combined value of all the divisions under my calculation works out to be $10-$12.3 billion which equates to a share price range between $180-$222. (Source: ADS SEC Filings)10 years ago, ADS was a much different company. Not only did banking and marketing not make nearly as much of their total revenue, but their business was also much more heavily tied to Canadian consumers due to their reliance on the AIR MILES program. In 2008, Canada was able to outperform all other G8 countries due to its reliance on oil and other commodities which did not immediately crash along with the finance industry. So, in relation to the US consumer, the Canadian consumers spending levels remained strong. It would be a mistake for an investor to assume that management could easily navigate another recession in the United States with the same minimal impact as in 2008. I believe an investor's best course of action is to wait out investing in ADS at this time until it becomes more of a clear value play."

4273284,103213,2019-07-03T08:05:53-04:00,"Alliance Data Systems has been in free fall for a while.While the company might have potential as a dividend-paying stock, there is not enough dividend history for me to be confident.Despite seeming undervalued, the stock could get a lot cheaper before recovering.","Written by Sam KovacsAs I was looking at stocks with exposure to advertising and marketing, I came across Alliance Data Systems (ADS). While the stock was most known as the owner of LoyaltyOne and Epsilon (which it sold this year), it has now become more of a credit card company stock than a marketing company. I explain this below.ADS is currently trading at $140.13 and yields 1.80%. Based on my M.A.D Assessment ADS has a Dividend Strength score of 72 and a Stock Strength score of 45.This article will present and discuss the factors which show why I believe that dividend investors should avoid Alliance Data Systems for the foreseeable future.Source: mad-dividends.comAlliance Data Systems provides marketing, loyalty, and credit solutions in the United States, Canada, and other countries. The business activity of the group is functioned through LoyaltyOne and the company’s Card service segment.And might I point out, from the start of this article, that since completing the sale of Epsilon to Publicis, the company isn’t the marketing company it used to be. When Epsilon was part of the company, the two marketing divisions made up around 40% of revenue. Now without Epsilon, LoyaltyOne is worth only 15% of revenue. The rest of the company’s revenues come from their Card service branch. So this is in fact a credit card company, which also owns some marketing operations. Not the other way around.This article will analyze ADS’s potential as an income-producing investment as well as its potential for capital growth.Given that ADS has a low sub 2% yield, we’re looking for the dividend to be super well covered. This will be addressed in the section about dividend safety. We’re also looking for double-digit dividend growth potential, north of 15% per year. This will be addressed in the section about dividend potential.To assess dividend safety, I check whether the dividend is well covered by earnings and cash flow.13% of Alliance Data Systems’ earnings are paid out as dividends. This is a more attractive payout ratio than 89% of dividend stocks.ADS pays 5% of its operating cash flow as a dividend, putting it ahead of 94% of dividend stocks.Alliance Data Systems has a free cash flow payout ratio of 8%, a better ratio than 94% of dividend stocks.Alliance Data Systems’ payout ratio is very satisfying according to these 3 metrics.Source: mad-dividends.comADS’s dividend, which was initiated in 2016, represents only a fraction of the company’s earnings and cash flow.However, ADS can pay its interest 2.8 times, which is better than 24% of stocks. This level of coverage can be considered worrying, as it implies that the financial burden on the stock’s earnings is quite high. This is to be expected however, given the nature of the company’s business. To offer credit, it must borrow money.Looking at payout & coverage ratios together would suggest that ADS’s dividend is safe. The dividend is insignificant compared to earnings and cash flow, which means that if management is committed to paying a growing dividend, they should be able to do so even despite the high amounts of interest payments.When ADS initiated its dividend in late 2016, it yielded around 0.8%.Source: mad-dividends.comBut ADS’s dividend yield is now 1.80%; better than 36% of dividend stocks.This last year, the dividend grew 10% which is in line with the previous year’s dividend hike.Source: mad-dividends.comOver the previous 3 years, Alliance Data Systems has seen its revenues grow at a 4% CAGR and net income by a 17% CAGR. We will need to cut the Epsilon revenues this year. Epsilon’s revenues had been decreasing (down 4.3% in 2018). LoyaltyOne’s revenues have also been decreasing these past few years (down 18% in 2018). All of the company’s growth has been fueled by the credit card service which was up 10% in 2018 although it was down 1.2% for the first 3 months of 2019.If the company can continue to grow its revenue and net income at the current rate, ADS’s dividend has good potential for growth. However, with a sub 2% yield and such a recent history of paying dividends, I need to see management be committed to growing the dividend more than 10% per year. If the company is serious about their dividend, they could easily afford to ramp it up to 30% of free cash flow (3x higher than today) within the next few years. This won’t happen with 10% dividend growth.The combination of the data presented above gives ADS a dividend strength score of 72/100.While the dividend is super well covered, and the lucrative credit card business has been generating large amounts of free cash flow, I need either dividend growth potential or dividend yield to go up. To learn more about how I decide what level of dividend growth I need for a given dividend yield, read this article: “Dividend Investing Strategy For Individuals Like You And Me.”This means that while ADS has the potential to grow its dividend, there isn’t enough history for me to place my trust in the future growth, which needs to be higher than current levels.Conversely, if the stock price came down more, a higher dividend yield could make the investment more appealing.In the meantime, I’ll likely be on the sidelines.If I am to remain on the sidelines, how close should I watch ADS? If the stock is likely to decrease in price, it could reach a yield which would get me interested once the stock has bottomed out and recovered a little. To assess capital gains' potential, I will look at four factors which have shaped movements in the stock market: value, momentum, financial strength and earnings quality.Stocks which are undervalued tend to outperform their peers. Eventually, ratios experience regression to the mean, and depressed stocks can go up significantly. To assess value, I look at the stock’s multiples of earnings, sales and cash flow. I also look at the stock’s shareholder yield. I compare all of these to the ratios of 3,500+ U.S. stocks to assess relative value. To understand how the value factor creates excess returns, read the following article.These values would suggest that ADS is more undervalued than 98% of stocks, which usually means that the stock is being hated by the market. Despite the super low multiples, the stock boasts an attractive shareholder yield. Stock buybacks at lower prices make sense to try and apply some upwards pressure on the stock.Source: mad-dividends.comThe chart above suggests that ADS is trading way below its 5-year average PE. In fact, at 8x earnings, ADS has never traded lower. This raises the question: how much lower can the stock price go? ADS seems super cheap now, but cheap stocks can get a lot cheaper before recovering.Value Score: 98/100Short-term price movements (over 3, 6 and 12-month periods) are highly correlated with next year's performance. Stocks with the worst relative strength tend to continue underperforming while those with the best relative strength continue to beat their peers.Alliance Data Systems' price is down -18.71% these last 3 months, -6.47% these last 6 months and -40.51% these last 12 months and now currently sits at $140.13.Source: mad-dividends.comADS has better momentum than 12% of stocks, which is very worrying. 88% of all U.S. stocks have better momentum, meaning the investment community hates ADS right now. Stocks with the very worst recent performance are usually awful investments. It is very likely that ADS continues down from current levels. You can click here to read why we stopped buying stocks on the way down.Momentum score: 12/100By now, regardless of ADS’s financial strength, I wouldn’t recommend buying ADS because of the combination of value and momentum. However, if I were to reconsider ADS at some point in the future, it would be good to have a point of reference which I can compare with future numbers.ADS's Debt/Equity ratio of 12.1 is better than 3% of stocks. Alliance Data Systems' liabilities have decreased by 1% this last year. Operating cash flow can cover 10.0% of ADS's liabilities. These ratios would suggest that Alliance Data Systems has better financial strength than 47% of stocks. The high level of gearing is a concern. However cash flows are so large that in relation to liabilities, they are only slightly less than amounts seen in the median US stock.Combining the high leverage with the awful momentum isn’t reassuring. It will be worth monitoring how ADS fares in the next few years to make sure the leverage isn’t threatening the stability of the business.Financial Strength Score: 47/100Finally, I make a few checks to assess the company’s earnings quality. Alliance Data Systems’ Total Accruals to Assets ratio of -11.3% puts it ahead of 60% of stocks. 87.2% of ADS's capital expenditure is depreciated each year, which is better than 37% of stocks. Each dollar of ADS's assets generates $0.2 of revenue, putting it ahead of 29% of stocks. Based on these findings, ADS has higher earnings quality than 38% of stocks.Earnings Quality Score: 38/100When combining the different factors of the stock's profile, we get a stock strength score of 45/100 which isn’t great. The only thing the company really has going for it is its extremely low valuation. And there is some value there, like James Grant said: “there are no bad assets, just bad prices.” At some price even the worst assets are worth buying. But ADS is not a great quality asset, has poor momentum and is likely to continue tumbling. Investors were unsatisfied with the sale of Epsilon, as is explained in the following article by fellow Seeking Alpha author, The Value Investor.With a dividend strength score of 72 and a stock strength of 45, Alliance Data Systems is a dividend stock which I can simply not endorse. I see nothing compelling enough to justify purchasing the stock at this level. Why not place it on a long-term watch list, and revisit in a year or two?ADS’s investment thesis has more holes than a Swiss cheese, and I believe dividend investors will do a lot better focusing on other stocks.Liked this article?

4181923,104099,2018-06-15T11:40:40-04:00,I think shares of Alliance Data Systems represent good value at these levels for a few reasons.This is a growth company that has done well in rising interest rate environments in the past.I think we should take note of the fact that a number of very talented institutional investors have been aggressively adding to their positions lately.,"Over the past 12 months, the shares of Alliance Data Systems (NYSE:ADS) are down about 11%, and this price move put the company on my radar. The reason for this pullback relates to fears about interest rate risk, but in my view, that fear is overdone. I think the current price represents a good entry point for investors, and I would suggest taking a position in the company. I'll go through my reasoning below by focusing on the financial history and by trying to model a reasonable forecast of future price based on likely dividend increases. I'll then focus in on the stock itself, suggesting strongly that the market has gotten ahead of itself with its interest rate worries. As I frequently do, I'll make an appeal to authority. I'll then conclude by calling into question the relatively simple ""higher rates are bad"" thesis. History seems to suggest a more complicated relationship. In sum, I think there's much greater reward than risk present in Alliance Data Systems at these prices.A quick review of the company's financial history demonstrates pretty clearly that this is a growth company. Over the past five years, revenue has grown at a CAGR of about 12%, and net income has grown at a CAGR of about 9%. It should be noted that the company achieved this growth in the face of an often rising interest rate environment. Also, there's reason to believe the company continues to grow given that both revenue and net income are up nicely in the first quarter of 2018 relative to the same time last year.I think a company having a shareholder-friendly management is a necessary precondition to make an investment. The reason for this is that an unfriendly management almost guarantees substandard performance in my view. It seems that management at ADS is actually quite shareholder friendly, as evidenced by its buyback and dividend policies. Specifically, over the past five years, management has returned just over $2.9 billion to shareholders. The vast majority of this ($2.7 billion) has come from stock buybacks, and the balance from a recently introduced dividend.Because of these stock buybacks, per share results look even more impressive. Earnings per share are up at a CAGR of ~13.7% over the past five years. In addition, free cash flow per share has grown at a CAGR of about 27%. These ""per share"" results are critical in my view, as they are the source of future dividend increases.Nothing is perfect, though, and Alliance Data Systems is no exception. I see a problem with the capital structure, specifically the level of debt present. The company has levered up fairly massively over the past five years, with the result that the interest expense has grown at a CAGR of about 13%. The current interest expense is about 72% of net income, so I think a significant challenge for the company over the next few years will be to de-lever the balance sheet somewhat.I'm not exceedingly worried about this situation, though, for two reasons. First, fully 77% of the debt is due in 2022, suggesting that there's time to reverse trend. Second, the company is paying ~2.7% in interest, so it's not egregiously expensive. The fear is that if the company must refinance at a higher rate in 2022, earnings and free cash flow will come down. All that said, we should put the debt in perspective. Although higher interest rates will obviously put a damper on earnings, debt would need to get dramatically more expensive before the dividend is threatened. In my view, if the weighted average cost of debt would need to reach ~6% before the dividend itself is threatened. That's not impossible, certainly, but it's far from where rates are at the moment.Source: Company filings, 10-K, 10-Q, free cash statistics from GuruFocusAlthough the financial history here is compelling, investors are obviously more concerned with the future than with the past. For that reason, I need to spend some time making a forecast of what I'm expecting from the shares going forward. Whenever I make a forecast, I try to keep the exercise as simple as possible by engaging in a ceteris paribus assumption. This just means that I hold all but one of the variables in my forecast constant. I think the dividend is the most significant variable, so I'm going to forecast it while holding all else (i.e. yield) constant.The question is by how much should I move the future dividends, given that there's little history to guide us here. Given the relatively low payout ratio (15-19%), I think there's room for some dividend increases, so I'll model a future dividend increasing at a rate of 8%. Please note that this rate of growth is far lower than the (admittedly short) history of dividend increases. This may be an overly conservative estimate, but I prefer my surprises to be pleasant ones. I'd rather err on the side of caution and be pleasantly surprised when the company grows dividends at a much higher rate.When I perform a forecast assuming 8% dividend growth, I assume a total return that grows at a CAGR of about 8.5% over the next four years. I consider this to be a healthy return.Source: Author forecastSuccessful investing is about more than finding a company that grows its cash flows and buying. Most investors access a company's future cash flows via the stock market. The challenge is that the stock is often a poor proxy for what's going on at the firm. This disconnect can be frustrating in the short term, but at the same time has the potential to be quite profitable, as price and value eventually meet.The primary way in which I determine whether a current price is misaligned from reality is by looking at the price to free cash flow relative to the overall market and relative to the company's own past. At the moment, ADS is trading near 5 times free cash flow, making it cheap relative to the market and to its own history.Source: GuruFocusThose who know me best know that I have the capacity to drone on about something. One of my favorite topics at the moment is about the diversity of skill levels amongst investors. Some, because of a combination of training and attitude, are simply better investors. Some, by virtue of where they work, might be better investors in a particular stock. These investors are so important to the process of discovering reasonable prices for shares that our lawmakers have decided that they need to share their buy and sell decisions with the rest of us after a certain amount of time. I like the fact that we can piggyback on others' insights a great deal, and I take advantage of it when I can.With all that said, I would point out that there have been significant institutional buys at ADS since March of this year. Specifically, Leucadia National, Michael Price, Ronald Muhlenkamp, and Glenn Greenberg have added to their positions. In addition, Joel Greenblatt and Arnold Van Den Berg have both initiated positions. Together, these institutional investors now own about 2.05 million shares.When the most talented money managers in the world buy shares in a company, it behooves us to at least take note.I want to spend a bit of time trying to put interest rate concerns in perspective. The overnight rate at the moment is 2% in the United States and the 10 Treasury bond is priced to yield ~2.95%. A year ago, the overnight rate was ~1.2% and the 10-year was yielding ~2.19%. That's a substantial rise in percentage terms, but it must be said that interest rates are still historically low and are expected to remain so for some time.Looking back at the relationship between Alliance Data Systems and interest rates, it's not obvious that rising rates, or higher 10-year yields, are necessarily bad for the stock. The image below has a few more series than I generally present in a Seeking Alpha article, but I think it's telling. The blue line is the 10-year constant maturity rate, and it shows that higher yields may not be bad, and lower yields may not be good. Notice that as the 10-year moved lower into January 2016, the stock price moved down in sympathy. Also, there may not be as predictable a relationship between stock price and the overnight rate. The period May 2016 to May 2017 shows that the overnight rate (i.e. the only rate the Fed actually controls) basically doubled, while the stock price generally held up.I'm not suggesting that there's no relationship between this stock and various rates, but I'm calling into question the simplistic narrative that states ""higher rates are bad."" It seems that declining yields have coincided with declining stock price, and a rising overnight rate has coincided with rising stock price. Thus, it's a bit more complicated in my view. It may be that there's a tipping point above which higher overnight rates drastically harm this company, but we need to remember that higher overnight rates are generally symptomatic of a more robust economy and that a strong economic growth is not a terrible thing for a company like Alliance Data Systems.Source: GuruFocusI think Alliance Data Systems is an excellent buy at these levels. The stock has weathered rises in the overnight rate in the past, and it has held up well when the 10-year was flirting with 3%. Additionally, the stock sports a very well-covered dividend. The stock is cheap both relative to the overall market and its recent past. Perhaps most compelling of all is the fact that some of the world's greatest investors have bought. I think we would be wise to follow them before price inevitably rises to match value."
4137381,104099,2018-01-13T03:41:28-05:00,"The market is forecasting Alliance Data Systems to grow at only 2.5%, which makes no sense to me.The assumptions around growth are ahistorical, in light of the fact that the business has grown earnings at a CAGR of about 4.5% for years.The shares are trading near the low end of their price to free cash flow per share measure. By definition, that reduces the risk to new shareholders.I model a future price of about $330 based on some very conservative assumptions.","The shares of Alliance Data Systems (ADS) are up about 16% over the past year, and in spite of that fact, I think it's a good time to buy. The shares are ridiculously inexpensive relative to their long-term growth potential. In my view, ""Mr. Market"" is in a particularly dispirited frame of mind in regard to this stock. I'll go through my reasoning below by focusing in on the financial history here and comparing that to the market's current growth assumptions. I'll also create a forecast for future price based on a dividend growth model. In my view, when investors perform analyses like these, we must look at both the growth drivers of the business itself and the relative valuation of the stock. It's all well and good to find a great business, but if the stock price doesn't make sense, a great business will be a terrible investment over time. In my view, Alliance Data Systems checks both boxes. This is a wonderful combination of a great business and an inexpensive stock.After a quick glance at the financial history of Alliance Data Systems, it becomes obvious that this is a growth company. Since 2012, revenue is up at a CAGR of about 14%, and net income is up at a CAGR just over 4% over the same period of time. In addition, the growth driver seems to be intact, as the first nine months of 2017 were good relative to the same period a year ago.There are some risks here, obviously. Internet advertising potentially allows businesses to target potential customers relatively easily, bypassing ADS in the process. In addition, rising interest rates may increase delinquencies which would negatively impact the business. Finally, it's an immutable law of economics that excess profit attracts competition, which would obviously erode ADS's profitability over time. In my view, though, these risks are more than priced into the current stock price.The last thing to say about the financial history is the fact that management seems to be quite shareholder friendly, in light of the fact that it has returned so much wealth to owners over the past six years. Specifically, the firm has returned just over $3 billion since 2012. In addition, the company just recently started paying a dividend, which I consider to be a tremendous support for the shares (see below).Source: Company Filings, 10-K, 10-QI really like the elegance of fellow contributor John DiCecco's dividend growth model. As DiCecco points out, investors are more interested in the future than the past, so we must spill some virtual ink on trying to predict the future price. DiCecco engages in a ceteris paribus assumption, meaning that he holds all else constant, and models future price based on a reasonable growth assumption.Although the dividend per share is obviously relatively new, I think it's reasonable to infer a growth path of future dividends based on assumptions about continued share count reductions and earnings growth. I think it's reasonable to assume that the immediate future will resemble the past, and I think it's also reasonable that I should err on the side of caution when it comes to making forecasts on the assumption that pleasant surprises are much better than unpleasant ones. When I build this forecast, my underlying assumptions are that the very conservative payout ratio of 28% will be maintained. I'll also assume that earnings will grow at the long-term rate of about 4% a year. I'll also assume that the share count will drop at the long-term rate of about 2.5%. When I take the payout ratio, earnings growth rate, and share count reduction into account, I assume dividend per share growth rate of 4.8% annually over the next four years.When I run this forecast, I infer a CAGR return on the shares of about 5.5%. This is a very conservative assumption, based on some very strict assumptions, and it represents a base case in my view. As I mentioned, I prefer to be as conservative as possible in my assumptions, and a 5.5% return from this investment is reasonable, given the moderate level of risk present.Source: Author ForecastI say that the risks are priced into the stock with relative confidence because I always look at the growth expectations the market has priced in. The way I do this is by engaging in the methodology developed in Stephen Penman's ""Accounting for Value"". This model involves isolating ""g"" in a relatively standard finance model to determine what the market assumes the perpetual growth rate embedded in the price. At the moment, the market is assuming a perpetual growth rate for this business of about 2.4%. This is a very low rate of assumed growth, given that revenue and net income have grown the way they have over the years.For those who are more interested in more traditional measures, I would also point out that the shares are trading relatively inexpensive on a price to free cash flow basis. In my view, investors who buy now are buying future cash flows at a (relative) discount. This is the definition of a lower risk proposition.Source: GuruFocusIn my view, investing requires us to think about the underlying business and the stock that is a supposed proxy for that business as almost separate phenomena. Profit potential happens when the market is too optimistic or too pessimistic about the underlying business, and that mistake is reflected in the stock price. At the moment, the stock of this growth company is priced as though it's a low growth so-called ""value"" company. In my view, investors would be wise to jump in now before price and value inevitably intersect."

He alleged, in his straightforward and folksy style, that the company should be valued like a credit card issuer based on where its revenues come from (approximately 55% credit card business) but is valued like a tech company (because approximately 45% of its revenues come from its data/loyalty/analytics business).By his estimate, the company's shares were 30-50% overvalued. Although crashing to $196 initially, the shares have not managed to stay below $200 for any sustained period since. Mr Left's analysis, thought-provoking as it was, did not cause the stock to immediately drop to the $100-$125 he has it valued at.John Maynard Keynes famously remarked that the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. Mr. Left's short is going to cost him a bit more money now that the company just paid its first dividend ever on Nov 1 2016. I'm not sure if he saw that coming in August. Some examples of things companies in trouble do include exploring asset sales, looking for white knights to buy them, re-negotiating their credit facilities, or laying off employees; they don't usually start paying a dividend.I knew this company had gone on an incredible run and, at the surface, it seems justified. After all, a company doesn't usually triple its net income and its free cash flow in a 5 year period, while maintaining above 35% ROE and without making any major acquisitions, and see its stock price stand still:Alliance Data Systems is the only company like itself in the S&P 500. It has two data-driven/analytics/loyalty lines of business, Epsilon and Loyalty One, and one private label credit card line of business, which is called Comenity bank in its financial statements. This entity serves as lender and administrator to a group of more than 125 co-branded credit cards under its umbrella. It is true that the company does not go out of its way to publicize this entity. Mr Left is offended that despite this card business contributing more than 50% of ADS's bottom line, the company is not only not included in the S&P Financials Index, but explicitly included in its ex-financials index. Probably a fair point.Except that this company has not changed in its composition one bit in at least six years. If the company isn't shouting that it owns this bank entity from the rooftops, it's not exactly hiding it either. It's been all there to see for years in the reports, quarter after quarter, year after year. If this ""wolf in sheep's clothing"" is a screaming short now, it's the same screaming short it was six years ago in 2010, when the company's structure was exactly the same:(Source: My calculations from the 2010 and 2015 annual report data)Look at the growth in the lines of business. Is the high margin credit card business papering over the ""front"" of the loyalty businesses? Hardly. In fact, Epsilon grew the most on a percentage basis over the past six years.Here is the valuation tool he uses on his analysis which you can find on Seeking Alpha by looking for Citron Research.(Source: Citron Research Alliance Data Systems article)It is pretty interesting, and I used it myself to crunch the numbers from six years ago. Here we can concede a point to Mr. Left. Effectively, the company traded at a small premium at that time and trades at a large premium today if we are to value the card businesses as a bank with traditional metrics used for private label credit card companies like Capital One/Synchrony, etc.(Source: My calculations from 2010 Annual Report)But what is going to happen now that is going to push this overpriced stock hiding in plain sight over the edge? If you read through the annual report from six years ago, just like the annual report at the end of last year, the bank entities and their obligations are all disclosed. They are required to meet the capital and regulatory requirements and put aside provisions for loan losses as any other consumer lender is in the US. They transact with various parties to securitize their debt and fund their loans just as any other financial company would. There is no fraud going on here, though the hyperbolic nature of the article is very suggestive in this regard.Whether the market is mispricing the bank aspect of the company will remain to be seen. But because it is a company with such a unique business, competitors are not easily identified. Ycharts comes up with Cintas (NASDAQ: CTAS) (not even close) and Fidelity National Information Services (NYSE: FIS) (a little bit closer) and Google Finance comes up with Amex and Discover. Mr Left mentions Aimia in Toronto (OTCPK:GAPFF) in his analysis, but only for 1 sentence. In fact, there are two comparable businesses, and both are based in Canada, the same place where the Loyalty One business that ADS acquired in 1998 originated. I think their track records are very illustrative for comparison purposes to Alliance's business.The competitors are Points International (NASDAQ: PCOM), which has a $137M Market Cap, and AIMIA which has a $1B CDN market cap. Points provides analytics and manages loyalty programs for companies, as well as running different websites such as Points Hound. Aimia, formerly known as Groupe Aeroplan, offers Aeroplan points which are the main competitor in Canada to Air Miles, Loyalty One's Canadian flagship product. You have to try really hard to find two worse companies to have been in the last 5 years:Mr. Left gives Aimia a passing reference in his article, stating it is the only comparable business ADS can be valued against. Well, by doing the same thing and targeting the same clientele (people who spend thousands to earn a few hundred dollars of airline points), Aimia has been an absolute basket case. The company has barely made a profit in 5 years. In 2013 it generated double digit ROE for a brief time and the stock surged from $15 to $19 on the Canadian stock exchange. Since then it has been a falling knife and today sits at its 52 week low of $7 while yielding 12%. The companies' inability to generate any consistent return on equity explains a good part of their performance woes above:The high yield on Aimia is a sign that the market has lost confidence in the company. Several SA contributors have published articles stating that it is greater than the sum of the parts and management will pull it off because of ""free cash flow""; I respectfully think this is baloney. Years of losses are years of losses and the company is going to have to cut this dividend if things don't change soon. Refusing to acknowledge this reality while moving into a brand-spanking new office tower in Downtown Montreal tells you how much this company cares about its shareholders.Meanwhile, Points at least makes a profit and doesn't destroy its balance sheet paying a monster dividend, but ROE has been stagnant for several years. The company has plateaued at about $3.5 Mil net income per year. The 15 year old company took until the mid-2000s to become profitable, traded in the mid-30s during the brief time it managed to generate above 30% ROE, and has been bumping downward along with its lumpy revenue ever since. It would make an interesting takeover target, if this wasn't such an obscure industry.Net Income is just that: Income. There are all sorts of companies out there that break new highs or go on win streaks despite negative and/or shrinking earnings. If you want to short a company that has grown its income like this compared to its two competitors, that's brave. Personally, I think there are better opportunities in the market.On income growth, ROE, shareholder friendliness, and competent management teams Alliance easily leaves these two competitors in the dust. It holds a leadership position in its field and has no real competitors.Except for Capital One and Synchrony Financial. But if the spectre of an economic crisis/credit event is enough justification for you to be short, short Capital One. It went down to $12 during the financial crisis. It's easy to say people won't pay their credit card bills if the economy tanks.Remember Alliance is on probation from the market because the stock rose too far, too fast. This is why it hasn't really gone anywhere in two weeks despite delivering record earnings and an estimates beat on October 21.I undertook this analysis to show where I believe Mr. Left is right. Are there risks? Yes, always. Is the business fundamentally mispriced? Maybe. But that didn't stop it from growing and executing very well doing the same thing its doing now over the past 20 years. Even if we strip out and ignore the credit card business, you cannot ignore this: the company has been earning stable and growing profits on the loyalty business in an industry where the two companies most like it are its two former compatriots, whose market successes were pixie dust flash in the pans. If you think Aimia and Points have bottomed, ADS should handily outperform them, just as it did last time this sector was hot. Out of the three loyalty businesses, it is the only one that has a platform to drive results going forward instead of a bunch of buzzwords and conditional sentences.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

It’s not for everyone, especially if you’d simply prefer to spend your time doing something else.Our regular participants have trading ideas reflecting contrasting styles.","The Stock Exchange is all about trading. Each week, we do the following:We also have some fun. We welcome comments, links, and ideas to help us improve this resource for traders. If you have some ideas, please join in!Our previous Stock Exchange reviewed the “less than smooth” ride during the multi-year bull-run and how the bumps in the road create opportunity. If you missed it, a glance at your news will show that the key points remain relevant.It seems counterintuitive to make changes when things are going well, but that’s often the right course of action whether you are an investor or a trader. As an investor, you may be enjoying the sun that continues to shine brightly as the market regularly makes new highs with very little volatility. But let’s not forget the old saying “the best time to fix the roof is when it's sunny.” And, from a trading perspective, it often makes sense to sell on the way up (before your profits are gone) and, conversely, enter your positions on a cloudy pullback.Trading in and out of positions is not for everyone. It requires doing a lot of work and watching the market closely. Before you even think about entering a trade, make sure you have the patience to see it through and not the complacency to let it fail.According to Brian Portnoy, a contributor at Forbes:His article from last week describes “The Good and Bad of Doing Nothing,” and it’s worth a read if you’re starting to feel perhaps a little too confident about this market.In the same vein, Wayne Thorp offers some sage advice in this article on when to nail down your trading profits (hint: “while you still have them”). And conversely, Aleksey Tatsitov describes his favorite tactic for identifying trading entry points in this article about “pullback trading.” Aleksey runs through specific examples of pullback trades describing the strengths and weaknesses of the strategy.And, The While Coat Investor (Jim Dahle, board-certified emergency physician) reminds us all (in this article) that trading is a job that requires watching the market closely. It’s certainly not for everyone, especially if there are other things you’d rather be doing.This week’s Stock Exchange is being edited by our frequent guest: Blue Harbinger (also known as Mark D. Hines). Blue Harbinger is a source for independent investment ideas focused on value and income opportunities.Holmes: This week, I bought Alliance Data Systems (ADS). Are you familiar with this company?Blue Harbinger: Yes. It’s basically private label credit cards. They take shopper data and create marketing and loyalty programs. For example, the company’s Canadian Air Miles program is a popular one.Holmes: Well the stock’s dip over the last month is the sort of setup I like to see. From the chart below, you can see it is below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages. And, it has attractive upside over the next six weeks.BH: From a fundamentals standpoint, this stock looks like it has some upside too, but that is assuming the company’s strong credit performance won’t slide. For example, I saw some recent data that says deliquencies have ticked up at ADS. However, the steadily climbing EPS and the share price pullback are interesting. Here is a look at the FastGraph.Holmes: As you know, my style is based on dip buying and mean reversion. However, you may not be aware that I’m really into protecting assets too. My process drastically reduces vulnerability to drawdowns while attempting to stay invested for the longest possible period of time. I use a mix of advanced trading techniques (including profit taking, stops, and trailing stops) and technical analysis to help protect if the stock price starts to fall from, for example, an uptick in delinquencies, as you described.BH: From what I’ve been reading, ADS continues to sign new deals with additional retailers, and that’s a good sign. The forward P/E is near the lower end of its range this year, which is also a good sign, but I know part of the reason is because of the risks (e.g. rising delinquencies, the potential for more competition).Holmes: I’m only looking to hold this position for about six weeks. And during that time period, I suspect ADS will rise despite your concerns.BH: Thanks. I’ll watch this one closely. And honestly, I think this is a decent pick. However, I prefer to hold my positions for longer than six weeks. How about you RoadRunner - what have you got this week?RoadRunner: I like Take Two Interactive (TTWO) again. As you know, I’ve been having success with this one in recent months. I like to buy stocks that are at the bottom of a rising channel, and if you look at the chart below, you can see why I like TTWO again this week.BH: Well, our theme this week is to know the difference between patience and complacency. You don’t seem to be complacent, considering this is your third TTWO trade since May. And, you’ve been very successful with these trades, I might add. But have you considered using a little more patience such as simply buying and holding TTWO? Considering this rising channel you keep bragging about, you’d have don’t pretty well with a buy and hold strategy, don’t you think?RR: Buy and hold is not my style. I typically hold my positions for about four weeks. Besides, I have a track record of doing a lot better by buying low and selling high within the rising channel, even after taxes and trading costs.BH: Well, I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again, Take Two seems fairly risky to me. I agree the price has been rising steadily, but the company’s earnings are volatile, and the entire franchise is heavily dependent on the success of one video game, Grand Theft Auto. Any missteps with the next release of that game could spell disaster for Take Two. Plus its price-to-(forward)-earnings ratio is already rich, and it has an earnings announcement expected on approximately October 31st that could add to volatility. Here is a look at the Fast Graph.RR: I am aware of all the things you mentioned, but I mainly like this stock over the next four weeks, based on its location within its rising channel. I’ll be in and out before that earnings announcement you mention. Plus, I have certain risk management procedures in place if anything goes wrong (e.g. I limit my position size, and I only trade highly liquid stocks).BH: I prefer to have a little more patience with my picks, but your strategy seems to be working well for you, RoadRunner. How about you Athena, what have you got this week?Athena: I don’t have any trades this week, and I’m not going to force anything.Felix: Same here. No trades stood out for me this week, and I’m not going to force anything either. However, for your reference, here is a look at my rankings this week.BH: Thanks Athena and Felix. How about you, Oscar, what have you got?Oscar: I still like the iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX).BH: You also picked this ETF a couple times already this year, first in March and then again in early September. I know you like to hold these for only about six weeks at a time, and six weeks after your March pick, the shares were up big. And so far, you’re doing great on your early September pick, as well.Oscar: My style is momentum, and I like to rotate to another sector after about six-weeks. And of course, I use stops to control for the risks.BH: Well, I like your pick, but I don’t like your style. How can you possibly know where this stock’s price is going to be in six weeks? I have a pretty good idea that the semiconductor industry will be much higher in six years, considering the growing uses and complexity of semiconductors in everything from cell phones, to data centers, to self-driving vehicles, and eventually, the arrival of 5G networks. But six weeks from now? Come on Oscar, don’t you think you need a little more patience?Oscar: You‘ve already acknowledged I’ve done very well with my two previous SOXX recommendations, and I have a track record of success across all of my picks, for that matter. I don’t get them all right, but my winners are bigger than my misses. Plus, buying and holding something for six years like you suggest seems a little complacent, in my view.BH: Interesting, Oscar. I wouldn’t buy the entire semiconductor industry anyway. There will be clear winners and losers in this space. Some of the smaller semiconductors included in this ETF don’t have the sophistication to keep up with evolving technologies, and their shrinking margins are already showing that.Oscar: If you’re curious, here’s a snapshot of my rankings for this week:Holmes and RoadRunner both use an element of “dip buying” to enter their trades, and they don’t get complacent considering they generally hold their positions for no more than four to six weeks before they take their profits. Oscar tends to be more purely momentum-driven, but he also knows not to get complacent and looks to take his profits after about six weeks. No matter what your style, there is an element of patience involved with participating in the market. However, too much patience can become complacency, and that can become detrimental to your financial health.Each week, Felix and Oscar host a poker game for some of their friends.

4175241,101693,2018-05-17T16:31:22-04:00,"ADS operates on three separate segments, but the Card Services section is the most significant.Although the Card Services segment is growing at a stable double-digit rate, it exposes the company to systemic risks.Further rate hikes from the Fed can materially influence the company's results.Nevertheless, after the recent selloff in the stock's shares, the company looks cheap based on its multiples.","Alliance Data Systems Corporation (ADS) has traded much lower through 2018. Market-wide worries about rate increases pulled back valuation premiums overall.The company's market is particularly exposed to interest rate risks. This situation justifies a pullback, but I believe that the dramatic selloff it's currently experiencing is unwarranted and overdone.Source: Finviz, Quote ADS.ADS is a marketing consulting firm that utilizes data analytics to provide its clients with market insights and other services. It's also exposed to the financial sector through unsecured credit, which is dependent on consumer spending on associated stores.Their market mainly consists of big corporations and business that require consulting services. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), General Motors (NYSE:GM), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), Kellogg (NYSE:K), and Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR) are among their clients. ADS provides them with customer loyalty programs from data captured in client interactions. With this data, it can run algorithms and extract insights that are valuable for clients.Source: Alliance's logos.Naturally, ADS has longstanding client relations, which makes it a relatively predictable entity. Business wise, they operate in the following segments: LoyaltyOne, Epsilon, and Card Services.Source: Alliance Data Systems 2017 annual report and author's elaboration.Out of the three segments, Card Services is the most prominent component of the company. In 2017, it reported total revenues of $4.17 billion. The same year the other two segments, LoyaltyOne and Epsilon, reached $3.58 billion together. The card services business is the most important for Alliance Data Systems.Source: Alliance Data Systems 2017 annual report and author's elaboration.Going more in-depth into this segment, I found that the credit they give to their clients is unsecured. Because of this, they have to go to underwriters to securitize the debt and be able to sell it more efficiently. For this reason, ADS behaves similarly to a credit card company, where it has to run its big data algorithms to select the amount of exposure to each client and account approvals.Source: Alliance Data Systems 2017 annual report.This process of selection with big data analytics helps ADS keep its client delinquencies down. Last year, that figure sat at roughly 5%, but it's slowly rising year over year. This massive exposure to the Card Services market and their high levels of debt makes the company particularly sensitive to interest rate fluctuations.Management recognizes that higher interest rates will reduce their FCF. Furthermore, it could derail any potential acquisitions or delay capital expenditures. Just for 2017, their interest expense was a whopping $564.4 million (7.3% of total revenues).In other words, almost 35% of their operating expenses are paying off interest and other costs on their debt. This expense covers securitization funding costs, interest on deposits, and interest on long-term debt.From their balance sheet, we can see that deposits (36%), their debt (20%), and other borrowings (29%) fund 84% of the company's assets. These percentages indicate that ADS is a highly leveraged company, although these figures are somewhat acceptable for businesses within the credit market.Source: Alliance Data Systems 2017 annual report.However, as interest rates rise, this could pose a severe problem for ADS. A mere 1% increase or decrease in rates could have a change in interest rate expense of $112 million. I expect interest rates to continue to rise this year. The ten-year could reach even 4% by EOY 2018. This market risk is material for ADS. Although, management expects to be able to hedge for this risk through derivatives and other interest rate securities.I think that it's probably for this reason that ADS has traded lower this year. The crack in the bull market happened last February. It's always hard to pinpoint a specific cause for the pullback, but many agree it had something to do with rates rising. The 10-year treasury bond cracked 3% and that influences market prices.The problem is that ADS stock has additional interest rate risk for the reasons I previously pointed out. On top of that, it's exposed to the credit card market, which is experiencing an increasing delinquency rate. As the Fed continues to tighten, ADS should see its costs and delinquencies rise, which could have a negative impact on results. As an added worry, the LIBOR is also increasing, which should drag results even further.President Trump has brought with him a new age of deregulation and lower taxes for corporations. These should benefit particularly to ADS. Firstly, because Alliance Data previously paid one of the highest tax rates among Fortune 500 companies, hence, because of the tax cuts signed in 2017, it'll add $100 million in FCF for 2018.Moreover, on the regulatory side of the business, the company's Card Service segment is subject to the Dodd-Frank regulations. These rules will most likely be reversed or eliminated soon. Hence, Alliance's business should benefit because of deregulation.Source: Statista - Management consulting market size.Also, the other two segments of ADS should be ok in my opinion. The marketing and management consulting market is expected to keep growing at a reasonable pace for the next few years. Secular growth should occur even despite the rise of ad blockers, cookie blockers, and tracking protection lists (TPLs). Nevertheless, those unlikely risks could render the company's marketing services obsolete.Furthermore, other systemic risks shouldn't affect the company. For example, management claims that inflation is unlikely to hit their results for the time being.Also, the AIR MILES and BrandLoyalty programs will benefit from the 2018 FIFA World Cup. This event should increase consumer spending with ADS and help generate double-digit growth in both of these segments.ADS is a very shareholder-friendly company. It has a stock repurchase program and recently announced quarterly dividends payable to shareholders. Their stock repurchases were done at the 225-240 range. These transactions give us an idea of where we're likely to find buying pressure.Source: Alliance Data Systems 2017 annual report.During 2017, ADS bought back 2.3 shares of its stock to the tune of $553.7 million. It still has left $446 million in dry powder to keep repurchasing its shares. Have in mind that it previously bought its shares at the 225-240 price range. Because of this, I'd imagine that management should find the current share price very attractive.Source: Alliance Data Systems 2017 annual report.ADS is a good value option. It's a stable business that's growing reasonable overall. At its currently low multiples, it looks like an attractive candidate for a value portfolio. ADS sports a meager PE ratio of 15.72, and its forward PE sits at 8.20.It's also a company that has shown interest in its shares at higher levels than its current price tag and has enough free cash flow to buy back more shares. Also, its recent dividend announcement adds another shareholder-friendly aspect to the stock.Nevertheless, investors should take caution with ADS because it's particularly exposed to interest rate risks. The firm's management has shown prudence and skill so far in this area. Moreover, they're aware of such systemic risks, and they're hedging their business through derivatives and other interest rate securities. Still, further rate increases should slow down Alliance's secular growth.All in all, ADS presents risks that justify a slight pullback. However, after such a massive selloff, it currently offers an attractive value proposition for investors."
4083189,102896,2017-06-22T09:42:46-04:00,"ADS has enjoyed robust growth, highlighted by a first quarter top and bottom line beat.Reduced fee structure, data-driven marketing, and high switching costs provide their private label rewards program with a significant moat.Increasing competition, rising costs, and potential loan quality dilution pose significant risks.","Alliance Data Systems Corporation (NYSE:ADS) excited investors with a top and bottom line first-quarter beat. Earnings per share beat consensus estimates by $0.05 and revenue grew by nearly 12% year-over-year. The company's success has largely been driven by strong competitive advantages in its private label rewards program business. However, their success has attracted competition and rising interest rates may combine with their growth-diluted loans to form a perfect storm.A primary driver of growth for ADS has been its private label rewards program. Retailers love these programs because they save them considerable fee expense and enable them to better track customer purchases through ADS' Epsilon program, thereby building a data bank for future targeted marketing. The combination of saving on fees and data-driven marketing gives ADS a considerable competitive advantage in this field.Another factor supporting growth are the high switching costs associated with ADS's business model of running a client company's card, customer service, data, and marketing services. These make it extremely unlikely that companies will switch to another service or establish their own as it would cost them considerable time and resources to build the corporate infrastructure necessary to effectively replace ADS' services.Despite the strengths of their business, ADS faces some significant challenges. Internet advertising agencies (including Google and Facebook) have enabled many companies to relatively inexpensively target customers without relying on a data marketing company like ADS. Though this has likely eaten into growth, Alliance has still managed to continue to increase revenues and earnings at a robust rate. Additionally, the high returns and growth ADS has enjoyed in the private-label rewards space is likely to draw competition from other card issuers.Another risk posing a threat to ADS' sustained success are possible dilutions to its loan quality. Though delinquencies have appeared to hit a plateau at 4.8% over the past half year, down from 5% last summer, rising interest rates (making it harder for consumers to pay off loans and funding receivables more expensive for ADS) and the company's surging growth (causing concerns of quality dilution) could likely combine to cause rising delinquencies.A third potential challenge is the high cost of funding receivables. Instead of funding receivables through low interest deposits, ADS raises money in competitive capital markets which require it to pay higher interest rates, particularly as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates. This raises its cost and risk of doing business relative to some of its competitors, eating away at profits and its competitive advantage.Though analysts forecast strong growth over the next five years (12.29%), the significant risks demand a significant margin of safety to warrant an investment. With a current P/E of 34, the company appears overvalued as it would need much greater growth to provide satisfactory returns on such a high valuation:SourceWhile the company seems to have considerable growth strength, the significant potential headwinds and its steep valuation should keep investors on the sideline until valuations reach more reasonable levels."

This neutral-sounding moniker is occasionally an accident... but rarely. Most often it exploits the shallowness of Wall Street's ""insight"" wit management's intentional hype, misdirection or just plain fraud. It has become too profitable taking advantage of a bullish market environment to ever let the truth get in the way of a good story.And then comes Citron Research.In the case of Alliance Data Systems (NYSE:ADS), Wall Street is just now waking up to the misrepresentations that have been promulgated by ADS management. At best, this is a mis-categorized company which should immediately be priced 40% lower. At worst management is covering up a business that has an entirely different risk profile... and is one big credit event from derailing into a devastating downward spiral.What makes this story timely is that it is not just Citron but Wall Street analysts who are finally catching up to the story, as reflected in this week's note from Credit Suisse, which states:SourceCitron could not have said it better. However, although Credit Suisse did acknowledge the elephant in the room, they stopped short of driving their verdict to its inevitable valuation conclusion.""Increasingly Viewed As A Lender""Let's begin with the background for those who are not familiar with Alliance Data Systems. This is what management claims they do in their most recent 10-K:SourceThis would lead most investors, and importantly, indexers, to categorize ADS as a business services company, which deservedly trades on earnings rather than book value, and be assigned a higher multiple than a bank.But as Credit Suisse noted, the lion's share of earnings do in fact come from the banks they operate. The myth of ADS being a business services company has been widely accepted because the company is in the S&P 500 Information Technology Sector Index but not the S&P 500 Financial Sector Index. Alliance Data Systems has no incentive to correct this obvious mis-categorization - management prefers the higher valuations that are associated with tech companies.Three divisions of ADS must be considered separately when valuing the company:So while LoyaltyOne and Epsilon can fairly be valued as members of the Business Services (NYSE:IT) cohort, ADS is more and more a bank wrapped in the Halloween costume of a business services company.The Obvious Next Question: What's The Breakdown?As we can see, ""Card Services"" are more often than not discussed last, but is by far the most important division of Alliance Data Systems. The bank - like portion of the business, is almost two-thirds of the business. From the chart below you can see why ADS would rather be considered a tech services firm than a bank:There aren't too many tech companies out there that report zero Research and Development costs... but it gets even more obvious than that.What Does Alliance Data Systems Really Do? Numbers Don't Lie!The majority of its income being generated from its banks, ADS is clearly not primarily a technology company. As the operator of Comenity Bank, ADS issues credit cards from Victoria Secret, JCrew, Ulta, and a list of other retailers.For those who defend the company claiming it should trade at a premium because their might be synergies between the two business … this is simply untrue. Citron's investigation makes clear that the crossover between clients is statistically insignificant; instances can be counted on one hand. The only ones of note are Express and New York & Co.Management Has Promoted This DeceptionMeanwhile, the company stopped reporting free cash flow in its Q2 2016 investor presentation (the last time it was not disclosed was Q4 2014).Generation of free cash is NOT what a bank should be focused on.More importantly the company is categorized into the Info Tech part of the S&P Index. (see here)Worse, ADS is explicitly in the ""S&P 500 Ex-Financials"" IndexYet, until now analyst have still been complacent spouting off free cash flow when discussing the financial health. Almost like having a conference call about how fast Usain Bolt can swim: WHO REALLY CARES...?Plain and Simple:ADS sells the investment community on cash flows, not return on equity or return on assets, metrics that a bank would be valued on. Instead they refer to financial metrics that are akin to a technology company.The Only Intellectually Honest Way To Value ADSWhile Credit Suisse got the ball rolling... Citron now completes and publishes the obviously needed analysis. Because of its two completely different business units, the only way to value ADS is a complete sum of the parts analysis - looking at the bank and the tech operation separately. To be fair, we assign the non-bank business a fair multiple of 10x EBIDTA, which is widely accepted for this type of business. This is right in line with Amiya (AIM in Toronto), the largest of all customer loyalty data driven companies. We will add that to the value of the banks, assigning them a 2x book value, which is the same as Synchrony Financial, the gold standard of private label credit cards.*NOTE: The corporate debt must be assigned to the loyalty business. Due to Section 23 of the Federal Reserve Banking Regs, banks cannot hold corporate debt. They certainly can't raise debt to buy back shares. This concern is acknowledged in the GS research report on ADS.Because its more than half a bank, not a tech firm, the valuation models of Alliance are miles from reality!Realigning Perceptions and RealityIn a best-case scenario, ADS should trade at $100 per share - $125 tops - which is more than fair. Worst case scenario, it could go much lower with a credit event. While this story does need to explain what could happen, investors would be foolish not to pay attention to a lender with more red flags than the Beijing Olympics... all which could trigger a credit event and send the stock lower than our projections.The Single Most Disturbing Data Point About ADS:ADS DOES NOT disclose FICO scores of their borrowers. They are the only credit company in the S&P 500 that does not... this is beyond disturbing, because they intentionally cater to a lower than prime client. See the ""Shopping Cart Trick"" below.And the Other Red Flags:Charge-offs are growing:Lastly, and the Biggest Red Flag of them All, is Comenity's Prominent Use of the ""Shopping Cart Trick""Citron believes that a big part of the online credit card business of Comenity is based on a widely known trick among the subprime community which allows consumers to get credit, especially high fee retail-branded credit cards, without a credit request ever getting put on your credit records or lowering your FICO score. Comenity is well aware of this credit loophole - you will be amazed of how popular it has become with the subprime community. Below are just three but there are literally hundreds of sites and videos dedicated to this Comenity ""loophole."" Folks this is the Holy Grail of subprime lending:(Source)Other links documenting the same nonsensical sleight-of-hand - an engraved invitation to subprime customers - here and here.So Why Do Investors Own ADS?Simple: Investors buy ADS as a yield name as it boasts 10% free cash flow yields. Yet, using this metric for a bank instead of its price to book is like asking Ryan Lochte how his night was. You'll get an answer; it's just that reality might be a different story.The company has said numerous times in SEC filings that in 2015 they generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow. This is not only misleading - in our opinion this is borderline fraudulent.In a time where we all increasingly struggle to understand or delineate GAAP vs. non-GAAP figures, the SEC has attempted to add clarity with Regulation G. This regulation forces companies to ""show their homework"" when disclosing any non-GAAP financial measures, in this case when disclosing cash flows - Alliance Data Systems should show investors how they were calculated. They should provide a reconciliation of free cash flow to provided GAAP figures (as free cash flow is a non-GAAP figure). But Alliance Data Systems does not do this.Research done by numerous accountant and industry experts has concluded that the actual free cash flow of ADS is less than half of what is disclosed, just $539 million … and here is the homework.While ADS wants investors to believe that free cash flow = EBITDA less taxes, capex, interest - in reality and in their own former calculation it is… Net dividends from the two banks to the parent plus the free cash flow of the non bank businesses.DUH!!!Everyone knows that EBITDA is the most useless metric when looking at a bank ... everyone except maybe ADS.ConclusionCitron has attempted to present this story as simply as possible. Goldman Sachs already understands the mispricing of ADS, and reports even its Sum of The Parts analysis is significantly lower than the stock's current lofty levels. Now Credit Suisse is on board. Pretty soon, all of Wall Street will wake up and understand that at best - Alliance Data Systems is a $100 stock. And if we see a recession or other threat to consumer credit default rates, the floor becomes the ceiling ... overnight."
3318835,78725,2015-07-13T06:53:25-04:00,"Alliance Data Systems has efficiently grown revenues at a >20% CAGR for the past five years on the back of strong industry tailwinds and successful corporate execution.
        The company's rapid growth is also easily sustainable, and recent developments bode well for the company's long-term growth.
        Because of this, the company currently trades at a premium valuation, especially when considering its exceptionally weak balance sheet.","Alliance Data Systems (NYSE:ADS) is a leading provider of data marketing and loyalty solutions. The company primarily serves consumer-directed companies. They operate in three segments: LoyaltyOne, which offers various loyalty and customer analytics services, Epsilon, which offers marketing solutions, and Private Label Services and Credit, which offers various credit, billing, and credit processing services.First, the growth: Alliance Data Systems is the truest definition of a modern age growth company, having grown its share price 400% over the past 5 years and its revenues nearly 100% in the same timeframe.This was on the back of multiple industry tailwinds that still exist today, such as a global company shift from traditional marketing to the kind of targeting and data-driven marketing that Alliance Data Systems provides. The company expects this trend to continue with a 6-8% CAGR over the next few years. They also estimate the current targeted marketing industry to be worth ~$260 billion, although, because Alliance Data Systems mainly focuses on consumer-directed companies as clients, their TAM is only a fraction of the $260 billion. Historically, the company's Epsilon and LoyaltyOne divisions have been able to effectively capitalize on this general marketing shift to data-driven, targeted marketing, as is shown by the company's past few years' >20% revenue CAGR. I believe that this trend of above-industry growth should continue because of the company's high quality offerings and multiple other positive traits.First, as the company continues to grow and acquire more customers, they can also capture more and more customer information, thereby allowing them to expand even further and serve more companies with their marketing solutions and information. This could also serve as a competitive advantage for the company; as a large and powerful data-driven marketing firm, the information the company has collected about consumers is invaluable to companies serving those demographics, and is inaccessible to new startups and/or smaller competition.The company also believes that they currently have the industry's most ""comprehensive suite of targeted and data-driven marketing solutions"" (10-K), which gives them a substantial competitive advantage in that they have a 'one-stop-shop' for all the marketing solutions that their clients could need. I believe that the company will only continue to expand on their product offerings as time goes on and they earn more money, thereby separating themselves even more from competition.Also, recent developments bode very well for Alliance Data Systems's growth in the long-term. The company acquired Conversant less than a year ago. This acquisition was both strategic and cheap. Strategically, Conversant is highly complementary to Alliance Data Systems's business, and significantly expands Alliance Data Systems's industry reach and power. Also, Conversant operates in many high-growth industries, such as mobile, and the combined companies can effectively secure dominant market positions in these industries.Furthermore, recently, Alliance Data Systems increased their stake in BrandLoyalty, a Netherlands-based loyalty marketer, from the previous 60% to 70% (10-K). This move, although small, could be the first step in significant international expansion for the company. Alliance Data Systems already has a foothold in Europe with BrandLoyalty and South America with a 37% stake in CBSM-Companhia Brasileira De Servicos De Marketing, a Brasilian loyalty provider. There is significant untapped growth potential in international markets for Alliance Data Systems, showing that the company's growth does not end with North America, and that there is significant and sustainable high-growth potential for the company in the long-term.Also, recently, the company increased their share buyback program by $600 million to $1 billion for 2015, showing that management believes that shares are undervalued and that an investment in the company today is worth more than another acquisition or other capital spending. This increase is substantial because it would take the company's entire current cash reserve to finance, again showing that management must think that current stock valuations are too low.Contrary to the company's management, however, I believe that market valuations of Alliance Data Systems are quite fair for a high-quality, growing company like itself. Ignoring one-time acquisition related charges, the company earned $12.56 in EPS last year. This represents a trailing P/E of 24. Adding on projected earnings of $0.50 from the acquisition of Conversant, the P/E would still be 23, hardly grossly undervalued, even for the strong growth trends of Alliance Data Systems.Furthermore, this valuation is ignoring the company's excessive $14 billion in debt. Factoring this in, the company trades at an EV/EBITDA multiple of 22. This is an extremely high valuation for any company. I believe, however, that an argument could be made for this kind of a premium valuation being attached to Alliance Data Systems, although the numbers are simply too excessive for my taste.Because of the company's relatively high valuation multiples, I would avoid it for now. A reducing of debt or a decline in stock price would solve this problem. However, because of the company's strong industry position and growth trends, I would be interested after a ~25% decline in share price or a substantial reduction in debt, as it is an impressive long-term growth story."
2685295,20411,2014-11-15T15:58:42-05:00,"ADS has been growing solidly.The stock has been volatile though.We would consider buying on dips, but don't chase.","Alliance Data Systems (NYSE:ADS) is a company with excellent earnings growth and corresponding revenue growth, a relationship that we think is excellent. Our observations also suggest that the stock is an excellent trading vehicle, while being fundamentally sound.First, we evaluate earnings growth using trailing 12 month data and we exclude one-time events to properly identify earnings from operations. We compare the data on a yearly basis to compile yearly EPS growth trends and as of the last report Alliance Data Systems was growing at 15.26%.There has clearly been multiple expansion over the past few years as the stock went from 15 times earnings to about 25 times earnings, but the multiple expansion was warranted given the growth rate and if Alliance Data Systems is capable of maintaining its growth rate it will appear attractive on a fundamental basis.Technical take:According to our real time trading report for Alliance Data Systems the stock is very close to a level of longer-term resistance after testing longer term support a few short weeks ago. The upside, as a result, looks limited on a fundamental basis and that means the upside price target is close. Given the volatility associated with the stock and the potential for declines from resistance to support, we would, by rule, suggest selling this stock at resistance with the intention of buying back when support levels were tested.Summary:Alliance Data Systems is growing nicely, it is attractive on a fundamental basis, but the stock has recently increased aggressively and it is much closer to resistance than support. As a result, we expect limited upside and we would be sellers of the stock at resistance with the expectation that the stock decline back to longer term support again thereafter. Given the attractive fundamental characteristics, the stock would be attractive as a buy again at longer term support."
550151,24320,2012-05-02T05:41:01-04:00,,"Treacherous times like these demand not just good stocks, but great stocks. We need growth and value and, ideally, something that’s been popular of late…but not scalding hot.As you know, it’s May, and so we’ve been told ad nauseam to go away, after the first not-great month in the last four. And though the entire market sells at just 14 times apparently bulletproof earnings, and might just be taking a hard-earned rest, we’ve almost tricked our worried selves into stuffing cash under the mattress.I took this problem to the stock screener over at finviz.com, and it turns out there’s at least one name out there worth investing in. Actually, my screen returned ten names based on the following metrics:I would have asked for a pony as well, but a deep-pocketed private equity group paid a 30% premium to ride it straight to the glue factory.Old friend CF Holdings (NYSE:CF) was one of the names to pop up on the screen, but I’ve already discussed its advantages. Today, I want to focus on another stock that made the cut: store credit-card and loyalty program marketer Alliance Data Systems (NYSE:ADS).It was put together by a private equity group in 1996, via a merger of J.C. Penney’s (JCP) transaction processing subsidiary and The Limited’s private-label credit-card bank. Private-label credit cards remain Alliance Data’s main moneymaker, accounting for just under half of revenue, and Limited Brands (LTD) cards still provide 18% of the business in that segment. But ADS has also branched out to run Canada’s largest air miles customer loyalty rewards scheme, as well as Epsilon, which specializes in e-mail marketing. Each of those units brings in just over a quarter of corporate revenue.E-mail marketing and data analytics have become fashionable with speculators of late—witness the success of such recent initial public offerings as Exact Target (NYSE:ET) and Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK). The latter helps companies mine every byte that travels through their computer systems for nuggets of potentially useful data.Exact Target is an e-mail marketer more comparable to Epsilon. Over the last 12 months, Exact Target had less than a quarter of Epsilon’s revenue, but it now boasts more than a quarter of the valuation—not just of Epsilon but of the entire Alliance Data Systems. (Which didn’t stop several analysts from heartily recommending ET this morning.)Still, shed no tears for ADS. The stock has been on a relentless march from less than $24 a share at the market bottom in 2009 to the recent record high of $130. It’s up 24% year-to-date and 39% from its late-November low.Quarterly results reported two weeks ago showed a 20% sales gain (boosted a bit by an acquisition). Net income rose 33%, and what the company considers “core earnings” rose 30%. Income per share was up a mere 19%, because of dilution with “phantom shares” tied top convertible debt maturing over the next two years. These shares don’t represent an economic claim on earnings, and in the meantime are masking Alliance’s earnings gains.The gains are coming from the accelerated spending within Alliance’s private-label card portfolio, alongside sharply diminished credit losses. Changes in the Canadian loyalty program’s redemption terms may have provided a temporary boost, while Epsilon continues to be pitched as a story for 2013 and beyond.The company comfortably topped profit and revenue estimates, and is forecasting a further 22% core earnings gain this year. Several analysts subsequently boosted their price targets into the $145 to $150 range, though nine of the 20 following the stock still rate it as only a Hold.The private-label cards business figures to remain a real cash cow as consumer spending and borrowing recovers from the Great Recession. And Alliance’s close relationship with many of the leading retail chains should give its budding data-analytics business a leg up against more specialized competitors.As for Canadians, they’re a good bet to continue earning and cashing miles no matter what happens to global growth.Add it all up and you have an inexpensive stock and a company growing fast in a promising field where it already has scale and plenty of sales leads among its current customers.It’s probably best not to stuff that mattress with cash just yet, while stocks like this are still around.Disclosure: None"

For the Enterprising Investor, the only requirement the company doesn't meet is the dividend payment. As a result, Enterprising Investors following the ModernGraham approach based on Benjamin Graham's methods should feel comfortable proceeding with further research into the company and comparing it to some competitors through a review of ModernGraham's valuation of American Express (NYSE:AXP) and a look at 5 Outstanding Dow Components. As for a valuation, the company appears to be overvalued despite growing its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $2.73 in 2009 to a whopping $5.99 for 2013. While this level of demonstrated growth is outstanding, the market's implied estimate is of 17.68% earnings growth, which is above ModernGraham's margin of safety when it comes to estimating a growth rate. As a result, the ModernGraham valuation model returns an estimate of intrinsic value that falls below the current price.The next part of the analysis is up to individual investors, and requires discussion of the company's prospects.

2300255,52262,2014-07-07T15:00:00-04:00,"Alliance Data Systems is growing fast, but probably is around fair value right now.
        The firm is seeing rapid profit growth, but continued performance depends in part on an improvement in the overall Canadian economy.
        Air travel in Canada and the continued growth in the use of branded credit cards are the key drivers to watch for the firm.","Most people have never heard of Alliance Data Systems (NYSE:ADS) despite the ~$13B company being a company that a large proportion of the public interacts with regularly. The fast-growing provider of transaction, credit, and marketing services to large consumer businesses is an interesting investment opportunity that is a bit expensive right now, but is getting close to fair value in my view. I don't often write about technology focused companies, but ADS peaked my interest as it fits a unique niche and sports a heady profit growth rate.Alliance provides marketing and loyalty solutions including customer loyalty programs (e.g. airline miles programs), database marketing services, direct marketing services, and private label and co-branded credit card programs. North America accounts for about 80% of revenues including roughly half of revenues from ten top companies such as Bank of Montreal (NYSE:BMO). The company has three major segments: (1) LoyaltyOne helps clients acquire and retain customers through programs like the Canadian AIR MILES Reward Program which ADS owns. (2) Epsilon is the marketing services segment of ADS which offers targeted solutions like email marketing to large customers such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) (~10% of segment revenue in the past). (3) Private Label and Credit helps retailers provide private label and co-branded credit cards by offering receivables financing, processing services, and marketing services. The segment is ADS' largest with more than $7B in principle receivables as of the end of 2013 spread across 30 million plus accounts. The company supplies its services to major retailers like Limited Brands (NYSE:LB) and Ascena (NASDAQ:ASNA). The segment's portfolio of receivables is particularly significant to the overall firm as they form the basis of much of ADS' more than $2.5B in asset backed securities debt. This debt represents a major risk for the firm as a whole which would almost certainly act as a weight around the company's neck in the event of another recession.Alliance has seen rapidly growing revenues over the last few years with growth north of 22% on average since 2009. When the firm released Q1 earnings in April, the company reported 17% total revenue growth/8% organic YOY (which as enviable as it was for many firms, was still 2% below analyst estimates). ADS' Brand Loyalty acquisition in particular has aided revenues recently, but hurt margins. The firm's Air Miles and email marketing areas are also looking challenged. Despite these headwinds though, it's hard not to be impressed with ADS' track record. With credit card use likely to continue expanding in the future, the company is a nice stealth play on this trend.Overall while ADS has been caught up in the negative downdraft related to all momentum stocks this year, the price has not come down enough to be interesting to me. Nonetheless, an investment in the stock at any time over the last five years would have been highly profitable if held for any length of time. With that in mind, if analysts are right and ADS does earn north of $12 a share this year, the stock probably gets to be worth buying if it comes down perhaps another 5-8%. The company did raise guidance for the year by a nickel in April. This was mostly related to an incremental $50M in Brand Loyalty revenue at the company. This type of raise is not a surprise for a company like Alliance. Acquisitions are a key part of the firm's growth strategy and without them growth would probably be in the mid-single digits this year and next rather than the 20% that most analysts are looking for.Alliance is clearly well-positioned to see double-digit EPS growth with the Private Label segment continuing to outperform. If the Air Miles business starts to turn around over the next 12 months, this growth is definitely repeatable next year. The key to a turn-around here is really an improvement in the overall Canadian economy. The depreciation of the Canadian Dollar (mainly due to a weak economic outlook) hammers the Loyalty One segment in Q1, and frankly miles issuance is fairly light due to a lackluster spending environment among Canadian consumers. Overall then Loyalty One continues to hold back ADS' potential with organic growth having trouble breaking out of the low-to-mid single digits. Frankly, if ADS were to divest the division, I suspect many shareholders would cheer. Again, Air Miles is one key to a turn around here.On the other hand, Private Label will probably growth north of 15% this year and is the star segment at the firm (13% revenue growth in Q1), but margins are likely to suffer due to a decline in gross yields on holdings as well as increased headcount at the firm. If Private Label is the all-star at ADS and Loyalty One is the weight on the firm's proverbial neck, then Epsilon is solidly in the middle. Revenues in the segment are probably poised to grow low-double or high-single digits this year after a 9% start in Q1.In sum, while ADS does certainly have some company specific challenges, there is a lot to like about the business, and with the stock where it is now, it is worth considering as a stealth play on credit cards, and longer-term, a recovery in the Canadian economy. While Alliance is not cheap enough right now to be a screaming buy, it could get there soon, and longer term investors could certainly consider starting a position now with the possibility of adding to it in the future.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Because while the story sounds good on paper, the stock price of ADS has been lagging below recent highs.ADS Business OverviewADS is a global provider of data-driven marketing and loyalty programs. Its primary clients are large consumer-facing companies. As a consumer, you might be impacted by ADS. For example, its Loyalty One business runs the AIR MILES and BrandLoyalty reward programs. And its Epsilon business operates behind the scenes, helping 15 of the top 20 global brands more effectively engage, and sell to their customers.ADS reports results across three different segments; LoyaltyOne, Epsilon and Card Services. LoyaltyOne provides short-term loyalty programs through the Canadian AIR MILES Reward Program and BrandLoyalty. Epsilon utilizes the data these programs collect, and provides integrated marketing solutions to consumer-facing brands. It's a pretty interesting two-sided model. Card Services goes a step further and provide private label and co-branded credit cards.As you can see below, the revenue split between the different segments isn't too drastic, But when you look at operating income, Card Services contributes around 5 times more than the other two segments (source).While Card Services seems to be an immensely profitable investment, it does blur the line between whether this company is a bank, or a big-data-driven marketing firm. This could make it tough to value the company, but more on this later.Now given the highly specialized nature of the ADS business, I'm curious to dig deeper into the financial data. I'm looking to see if this qualitative narrative is supported by trends in financial and operating results. Based on the sticky nature of the client relationship and the high barrier to competition, I expect ADS should be able to earn a healthy margin on sales.ADS Financial HistoryWhen looking at long-term financial trends, I like to start at the top line. By looking at results over the last ten years and trailing-twelve months (source), I can get a better picture for how the business has met market demands. So here's how it stacks up for ADS:In my opinion, this trend is headed in the right direction. I'm always encouraged when a company has a consistent track record of being able to grow sales. After all, it doesn't happen by accident. And an increasing top line can be a backdoor out of a lot of problems. Most recently, growth has been fueled by acquisition in the Epsilon business unit. While this appears to be an accretive addition, the company will need to keep growing sales organically going forward to complement opportunistic acquisitions.But growth is only worth pursuing if it's profitable. And in the case of ADS, I suspect this will be the case. Consider that the company has warehouses of data and provides a tough-to-replicate service that directly influences purchasing decisions for millions of consumers. I think the ADS business model could capture a lot of value. Do gross margins reflect that?Here again, I think the trend looks strong. As you can see, ADS has been able to consistently earn high margins and impressive returns on equity. That said, I take ROE with a grain of salt in this case due to the bank-like nature of the Credit Services segment and accompanying debt load.Nonetheless, the profit margins are impressive, and I think so far, the data seems to support the idea that ADS is providing a value-added and hard-to-replicate service. To confirm further, here's a look at earnings and free cash flow.As you expect, the bottom line reflects the growing sales and consistent margins. Once again, I'm putting a bit more weight in the EPS numbers in this case because of the bank-like-nature of the Credit Services segment. But either way, the trends are consistent. And I think this is appealing because it can make projecting past results into the future a little more reliable.Speaking of future returns, it looks like shareholders of ADS have had to satisfy themselves with share appreciation, as the company does not issue a dividend. However, equity holders have also seen their relative stake of ownership increase, as share count has been reduced by 26% over the last 10 years.To my eye, these key data points paint a pretty appealing picture for investing in ADS. But as with any potential venture, ADS shares come with risk.Potential Risks to Investing in ADSAs alluded throughout, there are a number of potential risks facing ADS. Maybe there is a reason for that shrinking share price after all. But right now, the biggest risk seems to be the fear of risk more than anything else.Recently, ADS shares were hit with a downgrade based on a sum-of-the parts analysis, valuing the Credit Services segment in line with other banks (source). And there are some very smart names touting this thesis too. So if it turns out to be correct, then shares of ADS could take a plunge.In addition to this unique risk of perception, there are some other serious obstacles that challenge ADS on a daily basis. First of all, a few of its segments are concentrated on only a few key programs. If these marquee channels start to lose their luster, shareholders could see a big hit.There are also a number of operational risks. While there does not seem to be data on credit scores of its Card Services clients, the company likely does have some credit risk. It also faces everyday risks like foreign currency exchange risks, disruptions in the overall economy and even cyber attacks.So with all that in mind, are shares of ADS worth purchasing?Conclusion: Antsy on the Sidelines with ADSADS looks like a great company. There is ample working capital, strong historic trends and what appears to be a formidable economic moat. I also think the company is reasonably valued based on recent performance. But as of today, I don't own any shares of ADS.This is primarily because I'm fully invested at the moment, but I'm looking to buy shares of ADS in the future. I'll also continue to monitor the risks to try and understand how the market perceives ADS. But what do you think? Are you an ADS shareholder or does it not deserve a spot in your portfolio?"

One such company is Alliance Data Systems (NYSE:ADS), which benefits from higher ad spending and improving consumer balance sheets.Alliance operates three segments, including Epsilon, LoyaltyOne and its private label credit card business. Each segment is projected to top $1 billion in sales in 2012 as consumer spending improves and companies invest in programs to capture, analyze and exploit customer data for sales growth.Alliance has never been shy about reinvesting in its brand. Whether through acquisitions to build out its product line or share buybacks, Alliance has demonstrated a commitment to earnings growth. Epsilon is a great example. Alliance was faced with an admitted talent gap in ad development at Epsilon, so it acquired Aspen Marketing for $345 million. This deal brings along 800 people and $250 million in revenue and significantly boosts Alliance's presence in automotive - a marketing friendly industry. During the recession, Alliance spent $2 billion buying back stock, equal to 40% of its shares. As a result, the company saw its earnings grow, despite the recession, from $4.42 in 2008, to $5.16 in 2009 and $5.87 in 2010, respectively. Alliance's balance sheet will improve over the next two years too, thanks to $800-$900 million in free cash flow generation on over $3 billion in annual sales. A new $1.6 billion credit facility in May will repay maturing notes and add liquidity. In 2011, Alliance's revenue will increase 8%, driving earnings per share up 20% to $7. Its Q1 revenue was $740 million, up 12% year-over-year and earnings per share in the quarter were up 47%. Epsilon is forecast growing 20% annually for the next few years as companies increase ad spending across web, mobile and permissioned email. The segment has 2200+ customers across retail (NWY), lodging (NYSE:HLT), finance (NYSE:KEY), packaged foods (KFT), healthcare (NASDAQ:AZN) and other sectors. Last quarter, Epsilon sales rose 23% to $156 million, thanks in part to last summers Equifax's Direct Marketing Services acquisition, which added $15 million in sales. The company's database and digital businesses sales were up 21% to $98 million while its data and other businesses sales rose 28% to $58 million. Over at its LoyaltyOne segment, which serves primarily Canadian households, sales were up 9% to $218 million. Quarterly AIR MILES issued were up 7%, reflecting improving consumer credit card spending trends. Canadian GDP, consumer sentiment and unemployment are all better than most of the G7 nations, which will help Alliance grow in the high single digits organically over the coming years, particularly as Alliance expands LoyaltyOne across industries. One of the most interesting growth opportunities for LoyaltyOne, however, isn't Canada, where it already commands 10 million households as clients. Instead, it's in replicating the program in Brazil using its Dotz platform. Brazil, expected to grow 4.1% this year, offers a much larger market than Canada for LoyaltyOne. With Alliance's newly inked deal to market Dotz to Banco do Brasil's 30 million-client database, growth in the region should be dramatic. Alliance expects the Brazilian expansion will drag on results over the next 18 months and then boost results nicely in 2013 and beyond.Alliance is also seeing easing headwinds in its private credit card business, which manages some 90 card programs for various retailers. In Q1, segment sales were up 9% to $369 million. Risk metrics at its World Financial Network National Bank continued to improve with tier 1 risk based capital, tier 1 leverage and total risk-based capital at 15%, 14% and 16%, respectively. In the company's May update, private label credit net charge offs were 7.2%, down from 9.1% year-over-year. This is a drop from 7.4% in April and 7.9% in Q1. The delinquency rate also fell to 4.5% from 5.3% year-over-year in May. Exiting Q1, $266.6 million remained on its buyback authorization, suggesting the company will provide support on pullbacks. But, providing even more demand could be the 11.4 days of average trading volume still held short. With Alliance beating the street in each of the past four quarters, including a 20.8% beat last quarter, analysts have boosted their 2012 forecasts to $8.06 per share, up from $7.85 a share 90 days ago. Shorts could get caught in a substantial squeeze if the company continues to post better-than-expected results. Already, in the past month shares short have dropped to 11.5 million from 11.9 million. Investors buying today will pay 11.3x expected earnings next year, very reasonable for a company offering double digit top and bottom line growth.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in ADS over the next 72 hours."

Five minutes later, a block of about 250,000 shares was purchased.The delta on the puts was -0.23, meaning they will rise $0.23 for every $1 that ADS declines. The volatility trader used this number to implement a delta-neutral strategy, buying 23 times more shares than options contracts, leaving them hedged against movements in the share price.Because he or she owns options but isn't exposed to the stock rising or falling, they have a long position purely in the company's volatility. They also chose long-dated options that will lose very little time value for several months.ADS rose 1.51 percent to $65.97 and is up about 9 percent in the last month. The company, which runs store-brand credit cards for businesses such as retailers and hotels, reiterated its guidance the last time it reported earnings on Feb. 2. Its next release is scheduled for April 21.The options trader is apparently betting on the common trend that implied volatility will increase heading into the announcement. Volatility on the stock has fallen by more than half in the past year, but failed to push below 30 percent last month.Another way to ""get long"" volatility is to buy calls and sell shares. Conversely, traders can bet on lower volatility by purchasing stock and selling calls, or by selling puts and shares at the same time.The trade pushed overall options volume in ADS to 11 times greater than average.(Chart courtesy of tradeMONSTER)"

The key rationale of Citron's call is that ""the majority of its income being generated from its banks, ADS is clearly not primarily a technology company."" As such, according to Citron, ADS should be valued as a bank.Citron Research used a sum of the parts analysis, using both: 1) an EV/EBITDA multiple; and 2) a P/B multiple to arrive at his valuation of ADS. As a reminder, ADS's business is organized in three distinct segments: 1) Private Label Card Services; 2) Epsilon; and 3) LoyaltyOne. Citron Research assigned the non-bank business (LoyaltyOne and Epsilon) an EV/EBITDA multiple of 10.0x and also applied a P/B multiple of 2.0x to book value of banks (Private Label Card Services).We do agree that Aimia (OTCPK:GAPFF) is likely the only publicly-traded company with a core business similar to LoyaltyOne. Having said that, for Epsilon, we would use more suitable comparables - Dun & Bradstreet (NYSE:DNB), IPG (NYSE:IPG), Omnicom Group (NYSE:OMC), Publicis Groupe (OTCQX:PUBGY), and WPP (WPPGY), which are marketing or digital analytic agencies with similar product and service offerings.The following table shows that Aimia is trading at a 32-42% discount on an EV/EBITDA basis. Hence, we would assign Epsilon a higher multiple as suggested by the segment's peer group.Source: BloombergThat being said, what is more important is the Citron's valuation of the banking business. Citron Research assumes that the Synchrony Financial's (NYSE:SYF) P/B multiple of 2.0x should be applied to book value of the company's banks.In our view, the most important thing Citron Research has not taken into account is the fact that ADS has the highest return on equity among its peers. It is well known that a return on equity is the most important profitability metric for banks. There is a direct relationship between the return on equity of a stock and its price to book value and, as a result, a high RoE stock commonly has a correspondingly high P/B multiple.The following table shows that ADS has the highest return on equity among its peer group. But the company trades at a 4.6x 2017P/B multiple. Is the multiple justified?Source: Bloomberg, Renaissance ResearchWe illustrate below that a regression between a return on equity and a P/B multiple suggests that the company's valuation is justified. ADS is fairly valued, trading close to the sector's regression line.Source: Bloomberg, Renaissance ResearchBottom line: ADS is not our top pick in the sector as we think American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Synchrony Financial present better opportunities. That being said, we do not agree that the company is grossly overvalued. Traditional banking metrics suggest that ADS is fairly valued, trading in line with valuations of comparable peers.Thank you for reading.

62461,21620,2008-01-31T07:38:52-05:00,,"By Kris TuttleKris Tuttle submits: After having some success bottom fishing American Express (NYSE:AXP) and MBIA
(NYSE:MBI) recently, we started to look at AllianceData (NYSE:ADS) post the drop from the
potential failure of the Blackstone (NYSE:BX) deal.Our interest was piqued because before the deal was announced ADS
was considered to be a great business and had a long record of
consistently good performance (27 consecutive quarters).The recent Q4 report and outlook for 2008 make it clear that the
company did not have their operations or planning disrupted by the
activity surrounding Blackstone.Due to the situation with Blackstone, there was no Q&A on the
call but the level of detail was fairly high. Management did have a
little bit of an edge in their tone suggesting that they are clearly
annoyed with their experience so far with their ""partners"" in the
private equity world.These are not the type of situations in which we are likely to do a great
deal of unique work or detailed financial analysis but we can do some
quick figuring. Given 20%+ growth we’d say a 15x multiple on current
year cash eps is reasonable. Taking a 10% haircut on management
guidance gets us to about $4/share this year and suggests a $60 share
price. It’s lower than the $81 proposed acquisition price but a good
deal better than the current $43 or so the comapny is fetching in the
market.We established a long position in the market on January 30th looking
more for a short term bounce in the shares from these levels.  More news on the legal and acquisition front may push the share price
around but fundamentals will eventually carry the stock to higher
levels."
62040,21448,2008-01-29T08:19:45-05:00,,"The current market correction claimed yet another victim on Monday – Alliance Data Systems (ADS 42.48).  With the announcement that the Blackstone Group (NYSE:BX) felt the conditions of their merger agreement could not be met, ADS’ stock plummeted 23.12 – a whooping 35%. In their press release, ADS said that Blackstone “does not anticipate the condition to closing the merger relating to obtaining approvals from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency [OCC] will be satisfied.” ADS indicated that it felt the conditions could be met, which seems reasonable, considering the thousands of bank mergers that have been executed over the last 15 years. It’s hard to point to another bank deal that couldn’t get done because of a regulatory issue that didn’t involve market share. And it’s not like Blackstone is new at doing deals. It seems more likely that the 81.75 looked a little to rich considering market conditions. On Monday, the market reacted as if the deal is dead, which it probably is.   Although the news is disappointing to investors who were hoping to receive the 81.75 merger price in the very near term, these developments open the door for other investors seeking an outstanding company at a very reasonable price. ADS provides marketing, credit and transaction services to over 600 clients. These services include the AIR MILES Reward Program (the largest coalition loyalty program in Canada) and providing retailers with private label credit card programs. More generally, ADS helps its clients find new customers and build loyalty in their existing customer base. It is primarily a relationship business, with most of ADS clients signed to contracts of three to five years in duration. ADS has two bank subsidiaries – lack of approval from bank regulators killed the merger deal, according to Blackstone. With yesterday’s announcement and the 35% drop in price, ADS now trades at just 9.9 times consensus 2008 EPS. It seems to be incredibly cheap for a company with historical five-year growth rates of 21% for revenue and 40% for EPS. Looking forward, the consensus estimated EPS five-year growth rate is 18%. So far, ADS has not reported any problems related to credit quality issues. On May 16, 2007, the day prior to the merger announcement, ADS closed at 62.96. While the S&P 500 has declined 10.6% from that date, ADS has sunk 32.5%. And though the outlook for many companies, especially those tied to retail and finance, has weakened considerably since that time, ADS has reported two strong quarters and has preannounced results for the December quarter, which are right in line with expectations. No doubt yesterday’s stock price movement reflected the exit of short-term players, including hedge funds and arbitrageurs. Over the course of the next several months, these traders should be replaced by both long-term value and growth investors. In addition, it would not be surprising to see ADS aggressively purchase its own shares at these levels. Indeed, while it seems clear that Blackstone was no longer interested in buying ADS at 81.75 per share, one would have to believe that they would find a way to close the deal if they could do it at 43 – that would be a steal. Luckily, it’s a price that is available to everyone else today."

    As has been discussed throughout this deal, the Utah DFI and FDIC reviews are somewhat complex in this case and are essentially being conducted on a parallel course b the regulators. While the FDIC is technically the lead regulator here, the Utah DFI is the primary timing factor, as the FDIC will not act until the DFI reaches its decision.

It will be noted that the Utah DFI is conducting this review at the same time as the Sallie Mae (NASDAQ:SLM)-[JC Flowers] deal, which was announced a month earlier and is in itself a very complex transaction. This must be considered a delaying factor for the reviews of this deal, although DFI officials have not directly indicated this to be the case.

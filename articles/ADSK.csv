The company reported solid Q2 results, outperforming on several important metrics. Autodesk notably increases revenue by 14.6% Y/Y to $913.1 million, beating expectations by $11.34 million. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, Autodesk is well-positioned moving forward.Autodesk has performed incredibly well over the past few years. The pandemic will likely only accelerate trends that are favorable to Autodesk.Source: YChartsThe adoption of cloud-based technologies has been accelerating for years now. Autodesk is successfully capitalizing on this trend as a leader in cloud-based solutions. Autodesk has been investing in the cloud for years now, putting it in a far better position than its competitors. In fact, Autodesk launched the cloud-based forge initiative, which included a $100 million investment fund, back in 2015 in order to accelerate its cloud ecosystem.Cloud solutions have become more important than ever as a result of the pandemic. Social distancing measures have made cloud collaboration tools particularly attractive especially in the workplace. Autodesk's cloud collaboration solution BIM 360 Design, for instance, has seen its usage almost double over the past year.With major industries like manufacturing moving towards a more distributed network, cloud technologies will only grow demand moving forward. Autodesk already spent years investing in cloud technologies, putting the company in a great position to grow its customer base especially during the pandemic.Autodesk's investments in cloud technologies are paying off, particularly during the pandemic.Source: technexaDigitization in AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction) has started to accelerate in recent years. Given how much more powerful tools like computer-assisted design have become, it is not surprising to see the AEC industry continue to digitize.Considering how much time and money is saved by using products like AutoCAD, organizations will be increasingly incentivized to use such tools. Autodesk is a great position to capitalize on this trend as a provider of some of the most powerful software tools in AEC.Autodesk is growing at a healthy pace despite pandemic-related headwinds. Not only did Autodesk grow its revenue by 15% Y/Y in its latest quarter, but it also increased its GAAP operating margin by seven percentage points Y/Y. However, Autodesk's billings expectation for fiscal 2021 has been lowered despite strong quarterly growth results.Autodesk's billing decreased 12% Y/Y to $787 million during the quarter. The fact that Autodesk's billings growth is falling far behind its revenue growth is somewhat troubling. Although Autodesk has in part explained this by stating that the pace of closing larger transactions has slowed down, investors should still keep an eye on the company's billings trend over the next few quarters.If Autodesk's billings continue on a negative growth trend, it is hard to see how the company would hit its revenue targets. Autodesk did, however, see double-digit billings growth on its online channel in Q2. With how important online channels are becoming, the company's growth in this area is encouraging.Autodesk has lowered its billings expectations for fiscal 2021.Source: AutodeskAutodesk still has upside at its current market capitalization of $50 billion. While Autodesk has a relatively high forward P/E ratio of 59, the company's long-term potential more than justifies it. Autodesk is a leader in the fast-growing industries like CAD and continues to successfully capitalize on secular trends."
4352700,74695,2020-06-09T00:59:04-04:00,Autodesk is cementing its place as a premier software giant.It is being bolstered by long-term societal and technological trends.The company's move towards a subscription model is paying off.,"Autodesk (ADSK) is a software giant that services the manufacturing, architecture, construction, and entertainment industries, among many others. The company utilizes computer software to perform a plethora of tasks for customers, from designing to modeling. The advancements being made in AI, virtualization, and general computing are making Autodesk's products more relevant than ever in modern industry.While the stock initially plunged as a result of the coronavirus, it has since surged even higher than it was prior to the outbreak. Although most companies are experiencing a partial rebound, very few are experiencing the upward momentum that Autodesk is experiencing. It is now valued at $51 billion, making it one of the largest software companies in the world.Autodesk has experienced a stunning rebound in recent months.Data by YChartsAutodesk is arguably in a better position than it was prior to the pandemic. The current period of social distancing is accelerating the adoption of more virtualized technologies. The ability to design, model, and render in a virtual setting is becoming an increasingly invaluable component of many companies. Autodesk is an industry leader in such software. Moreover, the technology behind its products is advancing at an increasingly fast pace.It is far more cost-effective to design, prototype, and model in a virtualized setting, for obvious reasons. As computing technologies advance even further, the benefits of performing such activities in a virtual setting will become even greater. Many of the most advanced technology companies, like Tesla (TSLA) and Northrop Grumman (NOC), are already heavily reliant upon such technologies.Popular Autodesk products like AutoCAD and Revit helps customers design and model projects by utilizing sophisticated computer software. Such products are rapidly becoming an integral tool for engineers, architects, designers, contractors, etc. Autodesk is also successfully diversifying its product offering to more fully capture the market for software solutions.Products like the AutoCAD allow customers to operate in an increasingly sophisticated virtual environment.Source: AutoCADThe exponential progress being made in AI, machine learning, cloud technology, and advanced computing will only further bolster Autodesk moving forward. The company's tools and services will become more powerful and complex as these technologies progress. The application of Autodesk's software is only growing with every passing year.Autodesk recently reported strong Q1 results amidst the pandemic. The company largely beat expectations with non-GAAP EPS and revenue of $0.85 and $885.7 million, respectively. It also improved its operating margin by 11%, resulting in a Q1 operating margin of 15%. The global pandemic did not appear to have a large negative impact on Autodesk in Q1.Autodesk's move towards a subscription model is starting to pay off. In fact, the company's subscription plan revenue grew 35% to $803 million. The company's growing focus on a cloud-based subscription model is allowing for a greater degree of predictability and stability. This proven model, which is also being employed by software giants like Microsoft (MSFT) and Adobe (ADBE), could help push Autodesk to greater heights.The coronavirus adds an element of uncertainty to Autodesk. The company could start to feel the negative impacts of the coronavirus over the next few quarters, especially considering its exposure to construction and manufacturing. While many investors clearly believe that COVID-19 concerns are overblown considering Autodesk's recent recovery, COVID-19 still poses many near-term risks for the company.Fortunately for Autodesk investors, the company has much to look forward to over the long run. As a certain degree of social distancing will likely become the norm in the workforce, demand for its services should grow over time. In fact, the pandemic could be a catalyst for companies to adopt more virtual solutions. The virtual and digital nature of Autodesk's product are perfect for the new normal facing the global workforce.Autodesk could see growth in demand as new norms develop in the workplace.Source: GrenslerThe advancements in machine learning, AI, and advanced computing is allowing for software to simulate reality to greater degrees of accuracy. The amount of money saved from designing, modeling, and rendering using software will likely only grow moving forward. Most advanced technology, construction, and manufacturing industries are already starting to rely heavily on virtual software technologies.Autodesk still has more upside even at its current market capitalization of $51 billion and forward P/E ratio of 61. Current societal and technological trends all point to more virtualized and digitized work solutions. As a leader in the virtual software space, Autodesk is well-positioned to capitalize on these emerging trends."
4351765,105306,2020-06-03T13:36:58-04:00,"Autodesk's gradual shift to a predominantly subscription business model improved the resilience of the company.Structural tailwinds, such as the digitalization in the AEC segment and the adoption of cloud-based applications to the manufacturing field, should drive growth in the years ahead.Current valuation multiples are a little stretched, as an attractive upside would be only justified after assuming a strong top line growth that may be challenging in the near term.","It was admittedly a solid quarter to Autodesk (ADSK), as the software design and engineering provider beat estimates and renewal rates held up well. While underlying fundamentals remain constructive, Autodesk's current valuation appears to reflect a strong recovery in construction and manufacturing that may fail to materialize in the short term. Therefore, investors should consider buying shares of Autodesk only as a long-term investment before we have more clarity about the shape of the economic recovery.The fiscal quarter ended on April 30th highlighted the resilience of Autodesk's business model, as subscription revenue increased on a sequential basis, following a strong Q4, and led total revenue to rise 20% year-over-year at $885.7 million, beating estimations by 2%, despite a drop in maintenance revenue during that period.This steady revenue performance amid pandemic-related shutdowns should be credited to Autodesk's gradual shift to a predominantly subscription business model, as subscription currently represents nearly 90% of total revenue, as opposed to 62% two years ago.Positive subscription revenue results were driven by renewal rates, which were relatively stable in the quarter, including partial renewals. On the other hand, there was a modest decrease in multi-year deals and a slowdown in new business in the second part of the quarter, affected by the peak of the pandemic and economic restrictions in that period.That said, revenue breakdown by product showed strong growth across the board, driven by AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) with growth of 26% over a year ago to $382.7 million, while AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT family rose 23% to $262.2 million. Meanwhile, MFG (Manufacturing) grew 9% to $182.9 million and M&E (Media and Entertainment) increased 16% to $52.6 million.Moving to the P&L, non-GAAP operating margin remained stable at 15% on a sequential basis, but increased sharply from 3% a year ago, driven by revenue growth and contained total spend, which increased only 6% year-over-year. As a result, diluted non-GAAP net income per share was $0.85, surpassing estimations of $0.79 and nearly doubling from $0.45 a year ago.Meanwhile, the disruption in the normal working environment caused by COVID-19 boosted the usage of Autodesk's cloud collaboration applications, such as BIM 360 in construction segment and Fusion 360 in manufacturing.Autodesk expects that it will be not a temporary trend, as many companies will realize the benefits of the cloud-based offerings and will not go back to the previous operating environment in the future. This will be a very positive development for Autodesk, as the company has increasingly focused on cloud and digitalization to boost growth going forward.On the other hand, another strategic front for Autodesk, the conversion of non-compliant users, has been impacted by the current economic scenario. Meanwhile, Autodesk remains focused on building a pipeline of new opportunities, looking to conclude potential deals in a more appropriate moment in the future.Overall, in spite of some challenges, the management team remains confident in its fiscal 2023 plan, as structural tailwinds, such as the digitalization in the AEC segment and the adoption of cloud-based applications to the manufacturing field, should accelerate and drive growth in the years ahead.With regards to fiscal FY 2021 outlook, Autodesk is forecasting revenue growth in the range of 12% to 15%, assuming net revenue retention remaining between 100% to 110% and a partial recovery in fiscal Q2, despite the impact in the new business volume. In addition, operating margins are expected to expand by 200 to 400 basis points, as gross profit margins should remain stable and expenses contained at $60 million.In order to assess Autodesk's profitability on a relative basis, I will compare the company with a close peer like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) as well as the software peer group, using as reference the group of software companies that constitute the XLK - Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF.As we can see below, over the past 5 years, Autodesk's operating margin has increased at a faster pace compared to the software segment, although it is currently below the average yet. In addition, revenue growth has accelerated somehow in the recent 3 years, surpassing software peers. Of note, Autodesk has lagged Adobe in most metrics here evaluated.Turning to the valuation analysis, Autodesk is trading at higher P/E, EV/EBITDA and EV/Revenue Forward multiples compared to the software segment, with premium ranging from 14% to 28%.Source: Data from Finbox, consolidated by the authorAlthough shares of Autodesk look overvalued on a relative basis, it does not mean that there is no upside left. Instead, it reflects the strong growth expected in the future. As we can see below, analysts covering the company are forecasting top-line growth in the mid-teens over the coming years, even after recent downgrades.Source: Seeking AlphaAssuming that Autodesk can actually deliver revenue growth in the 15% range over the coming years, we can estimate the influence on company earnings and use the 5-year DCF model to project the fair value of the company.In addition to the revenue growth of 15%, the following assumptions will be considered: 1) Operating margins will increase by 200 basis points this year, as forecast by the management team, along with incremental increases of 200 basis points each year over the next years and 2) Terminal EV/EBITDA multiple of 53x, which is the average of the software segment of XLK ETF.Thus, after applying these inputs to the DCF model, the projected fair value of Autodesk would be $270.00, implying nearly 28% upside over the current price level.I see two main considerations regarding this model that it is worth sharing. Firstly, valuation multiples of the software industry are admittedly high, given strong growth forecasts. In case we see peers missing estimations at some point in the future, the whole software industry may be subject to multiples compression, including Autodesk.The second point is related to the Autodesk's top line growth potential. While it looks attainable, given the vast potential for digitalization in the AEC field and also virtualization / cloudification in the aftermath of the pandemic, we cannot rule out potential headwinds in case of a slower economic recovery, as it would moderate manufacturing activity and keep investments in construction subdued.While Autodesk's subscription revenues offer extra resilience to the company's business, structural tailwinds such as cloud and digitalization should help drive growth over the coming years.However, I see current valuation multiples a little stretched at the moment, as an upside nearing 25% to 30% would be only justified after assuming a strong top line growth that may be challenging for the company, especially in the near term, given the uncertainties related to the economic recovery."
4355661,104744,2020-06-25T13:19:48-04:00,"ADSK is an industry leader with double-digit revenue growth prospects and surfeit FCF.However, the growth has decelerated this year due to the macro headwinds.The share price has surged, as the market has priced in a too-quick recovery.I will be better to stay on the sidelines until the correction.","Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK), a company that offers software of choice for architects and engineers, has seen its stock price rallying to the all-time high since a deep dive in March when it plunged together with the S&P 500 amid the market hysteria sparked by the coronavirus pandemic. Among the catalysts were the Q1 EPS and revenue beat, which signalized that the end-market demand had not sunk as deep as analysts expected, and, despite its exposure to cyclical industries, the company had been relatively immune to the softness in the economy. At the same time, bearish voices were mostly ignored. With ~63.9% price return since March 29, the stock had easily trounced Microsoft (MSFT), Adobe (ADBE), Salesforce.com (CRM), and, sure, the S&P 500 (SPY).Data by YChartsI would not say that the recent rally was potentiated by the fundamentals only (there are types of investors who have never read a Form 10-K, focusing solely on the news headlines). However, Autodesk is still a free cash flow machine, and investor perception of its solid financial performance had definitely somewhat contributed to the rally. Nevertheless, I would like to highlight a few issues that bullish investors should keep in mind before going long now. In a nutshell, I acknowledge the unquestionable merits, but building a position after the stock touched an all-time high is reckless. It is far better to wait until a buying opportunity emerges.First and foremost, ADSK is a relatively rapidly growing FCF positive company with a leading position in the industry. Since 2018, after a thorough strategic overhaul, it has been converting nearly all its cash flow from operations into FCF, and, due to minuscule capital intensity, it will likely continue delivering resilient cash surpluses going forward.Data by YChartsAnalysts are predicting consistent double-digit revenue growth in the medium term, and I reckon it will likely be assisted by simultaneous increases in net income and cash flow. These merits alone make ADSK a perfect investment and a long-term shareholder value-generating engine.Source: UnsplashHowever, we need more context here. First, the robust Q1 FY21 results instilled confidence and somewhat eased fears that softness in the construction industry amid the economic downswing can ruin Autodesk's top line. Despite lockdowns and disrupted supply chains, its segments demonstrated astounding growth, while Architecture, Engineering, and Construction, the flagship segment regarding revenue, outperformed others, delivering around 26% sales growth rate. The AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT segment was up 23%. Moreover, double-digit growth was achieved across all regions. Though APAC is not its principal market regarding sales, the regional revenue is expanding at a faster pace if compared to the Americas and Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. The only division that posted a single-digit improvement was Manufacturing, which offers such products as CAM Solutions, Fusion 360, Inventor, and Vault.Yes, it's overall great. However, as a reminder, earlier this year, the analyst community expected the Q1 revenue to surpass $912 million, while ADSK disappointed Wall Street and lowered its first-quarter revenue expectations to between $880 million and $895 million. The Q1 total reported revenue amounted to $886 million. It also anticipated FY21 (ending January 2021) revenue to rose by 20%-22% (see slide 8). Since then, the growth outlook has drifted materially lower, as, according to the changed guidance, Autodesk expects to increase the top line by 12% to 15% (see slide 8). Most importantly, though, in February, ADSK anticipated FY21 billings to increase 11%-13%, in May, it acknowledged that double digit-growth is unachievable and 3% contraction is possible in the worst-case scenario.At the same time, the share price has touched an all-time high. So, it appears the market is irrationally pushing equity value higher rewarding the company for much weaker future growth than previously anticipated. Of course, this cannot continue ad infinitum.Though ADSK posted strong results in the April quarter, it does not mean the rest of the year will also be that stellar. Among the financial industry, there are a few bearish voices who have highlighted the significant risks associated with Autodesk's end users stemming from the macro headwinds. To have a grasp of what is happening in ADSK's end markets, for instance, inside the construction industry, we can assess a few indicators like the Architecture Billings Index, the one I highlighted in my article on Carlisle Companies (CSL). The ABI touched a historic low in March, which points to the fact that architectural firms are in dire straits because of cratered demand for design services. The data published recently demonstrated that the sentiment recuperated only marginally. The ABI score for May was 32 vs. 29.5 in April and 33.3 in March; any figure lower than 50 signalizes a decline in billings. For a broader context, in January, the score was 52.2. Hence, since orders plummeted, most firms have neither reasons nor cash to hire new employees and, hence, renew/extend AutoCAD subscriptions. There is no coincidence ADSK significantly downgraded its FY21 growth outlook.I believe my dear readers have likely noticed that Autodesk has a somewhat puzzling financial position. Though it has been consistently generating cash surpluses, its book value is sub-zero, while Debt/Equity equals 1,176%. So, we simply have no denominator (shareholder equity) to assess Return on Equity or go a bit deeper and scrutinize CROE or even FCF ROE.Data by YChartsThe principal culprit is deferred revenue, which the company recognizes as both long-term and short-term liability. E.g., in Q1, current deferred revenue was $2.16 billion. Another culprit is notes with different interest rates that were issued in 2012, 2015, 2017, and 2020 (see page 57 of the annual report). Sure, sizable total borrowings do not pose significant risks, as, after deduction of cash & cash equivalents, the net debt stands at just $169 million, a tiny fraction of its enterprise value of ~$51.3 billion. Obviously, hefty cash pile and copious FCF instill confidence ADSK will have no issues with the repayment of the principal.Though growth stocks are quite often valued on a P/E basis, I believe we cannot ignore Autodesk's immense debt, so, it is better to tap its valuation using Enterprise Value-based multiples. These ratios signalize the stock is significantly overvalued both compared to the sector and 5-year averages. Moreover, as EV/Sales illustrates, the company is almost 1.5x more expensive than MSFT and close to 2x more expensive than CRM. At the same time, bulls may riposte that Adobe, a software company akin to ADSK, is even more expensive with EV/Sales of ~17.3x. But ADBE is less exposed to the macro headwinds because of its much lower dependence on the cyclical industries. To sum up, at these levels, it is better to avoid ADSK.Autodesk's revenue growth had not been linear in the past. In the second half of the 2010s, when the company has initiated an inevitable but long and challenging transition towards a more profitable recurring revenue model, it experienced tough times. Its revenue contracted, thus adding pressure on margins. Because of lackluster sales, its net profit together with cash from operations and FCF dived to sub-zero levels. However, the company successfully turned around and embarked on a path of robust top-line and cash flow expansion.ADSK can be a lucrative investment. However, given valuation and the short-term challenges, it is worth staying on the sidelines."
4371944,103480,2020-09-01T12:19:27-04:00,"Autodesk is trading very closely to all-time highs despite some recent soft billings trends.
        While Autodesk has maintained positive revenue growth throughout the pandemic, its billings growth rates have steadily fallen (down to -12% y/y in Q2), foreshadowing revenue deceleration.
        The fact that Wall Street consensus is expecting 18% y/y revenue growth in FY22 despite the recent soft billings trends may be a stretch.","Autodesk (ADSK), the vendor behind one of the most popular and broadly used CAD systems (computer-aided design) in the world, has hit a rough spot this year as the coronavirus directly impacted its customers in the manufacturing, construction, and engineering verticals - all of which are the heaviest users of Autodesk products. Still riding on a high from last year as Autodesk found success in shifting its customer base over from a primarily license-based model to a cloud-based model in-line with most modern SaaS peers, Autodesk has sounded off cautious warnings on the state of its end-markets even as the company called out strong execution amid the pandemic.With shares trading at all-time highs, however - and barely receding after the soft Q2 results - I'd be cautious on Autodesk.As can be seen in the chart above, Autodesk is a stock that is trading very richly at ~14.5x forward revenues. That is already a stretch for a company growing revenue at only ~15% y/y (what Autodesk's top-line growth slowed to in Q2), but it's an even more outlandish multiple for a company whose billings growth has turned negative. In other words, Autodesk's underlying revenue growth trajectory looks set to sour, while the stock is already pricing in some very optimistic scenarios.The bottom line here: keep an eye on how Autodesk's billings growth is tracking, as it has fallen substantially below revenue growth in recent quarters and may impact the company's ability to hit its revenue numbers. Investors should be careful banking on a continued rally in this stock.As most software investors are aware, recurring revenue/subscription software companies recognize revenue ratably over time. While revenue growth is a useful metric, it's really billings growth that better captures a company's underlying sales momentum and points to future revenue growth trends. When billings growth substantially exceeds revenue growth, it means that the company is building up a deferred revenue base that will be recognized as revenue in future periods.But the exact opposite is happening for Autodesk. At a top level, it looks like Autodesk is doing fine amid the pandemic. Revenue growth in Q2 clocked in at 15% y/y to $913.1 million, nominally beating Wall Street's expectations of $901.8 million (+13% y/y). Yes, Autodesk's revenue growth did decelerate five points relative to 20% y/y in Q1, but we've seen much steeper deceleration in other companies, so revenue doesn't leave us too concerned.Figure 1. Autodesk revenue by productSource: Autodesk Q2 earnings release What you're actually seeing here, though, is the benefit of Autodesk's shift to recurring revenue (subscription revenue made up 92% of Autodesk's Q2 total, up substantially from 83% in the year-ago quarter). Under a license-based revenue model, a slowdown in deal closings would have an immediate, lumpy hit to near-term revenues. But under the subscription revenue model, the impact of slipped deals is deferred over time.So the billings growth rate in Q2 helps us to better understand what's going on. Unfortunately, Autodesk's reported billings of $787 million declined -12% y/y, a twenty-four point decline relative to +11% y/y in Q1 - showing the exact kind of lumpiness that is now obscured in the revenue. Figure 2. Autodesk billings commentarySource: Autodesk Q2 earnings release On a dollar basis as well, Autodesk's $787 million of billings fell short of $913 million in revenue - meaning that instead of building up deferred revenue, Autodesk is draining it. Last quarter, meanwhile, Autodesk's revenue and billings in dollar terms were approximately even ($886 million in revenue versus $884 million in billings). This is an almost certain indicator of deceleration.Some commentary from management is helpful in understanding the context behind the softer billings results in Q2. Below, take a look at what CFO Scott Herren said during his prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call:The good news is that Autodesk expects Q2 to be the most heavily-impacted quarter of the pandemic, so we should hopefully not see -12% y/y billings decline again. Supporting that theory is the fact that CEO Andrew Anagnost noted that customer usage of Autodesk products picked up as Q2 wore on (tracking is now possible thanks to most customers residing in cloud versus on-prem Autodesk environments). However, other than this, there is little data to support a certain recovery, as Herren noted that major markets like the US have not shown any ""meaningful improvement.When Autodesk provided guidance in Q1, it originally had a billings range of -3% y/y to +1% y/y. The accompanying commentary at the time held that ""the upper end of our range assumes a swift recovery in new business in the third quarter and continued improvement into the fourth quarter with full year new unit volume growing lastly.""It seems now, however, that this optimistic scenario is no longer possible. Autodesk has taken down the top end of its FY21 billings growth range to -0.5% y/y. In the Q&A portion of the earnings call, Autodesk further explained that in addition to a slower recovery in US/UK, this guidance takedown is also due to the company's expectation of fewer multi-year deal signings.Figure 3. Autodesk guidanceSource: Autodesk Q2 earnings release The question that stems from this, then, is how that will impact FY22 growth rates. Based on Autodesk's optimistic valuation today, it seems that the market is banking on a rebound to revenue in FY22. Wall Street, too, has a consensus FY22 revenue target of $4.42 billion, or +18% y/y (per Yahoo Finance). With billings growth expected to be no better than flat in FY21, however, this target may prove to be a stretch for Autodesk to achieve.Looking at Autodesk's nearly vertical stock chart alone, you wouldn't guess that this is a company that has been substantially impacted by the pandemic, but Autodesk's swift fall to negative billings this quarter tells an entirely different story. Overheated sentiment on many tech stocks has chased the group to all-time highs this year, but investors should be especially careful on the stocks whose fundamentals have seen pandemic-driven dips like Autodesk."
4343855,105400,2020-05-06T19:36:33-04:00,Autodesk has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 10 years.The company has experienced an acceleration of growth rates in recent years and has seen margins expand substantially.It has built strong switching costs and network effects into its products which should sustain its pricing power.,"Autodesk's (NASDAQ:ADSK) stock price has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 10 years, returning 454% compared to S&P's 145%. This is mainly attributed to the improving operating fundamentals over the years. The outperformance really picked up from 2017 when its operating fundamentals improved dramatically due to improving sales and operating margins. The company has continued growing its switching costs and network effects, but valuation is expensive compared to its peers.(Source: Seeking Alpha Data)Autodesk has grown revenue from $1.9B in 2011 to $3.1B in 2019, compounding at 5.5% year on year. Its growth rates have picked up recently, averaging over 20% from fiscal years 2018 to 2020. The most recent results were driven by all regions and products. Diving deeper, we can see that its enterprise business agreement accounts have experienced a 40% CAGR growth rate in the past 3 years. This is one of the main drivers for revenue growth acceleration, which increased from negative growth in 2017 to above 20% growth in the past 3 years.(Source: Investor Presentation)Autodesk has also been acquiring new customers through its digital channels, which shows a 56% ARR growth in fiscal 2019. With 50% of new customers buying through their e-store, it shows that customers are adopting their digital channels. This would help drive down selling costs in the future as sales in this channel ramp up, which would help improve the operating margins for Autodesk. In fact, operating margins are already showing signs of improvement, increasing from -20% in 2017 to 11% in fiscal 2020.(Source: Investor Presentation)Autodesk also estimates its total addressable market to be $59B by 2023. With sales of $3.1B, this puts Autodesk's market penetration at roughly 5%. This gives Autodesk room to grow to further capture market share. Autodesk has options to take market share such as new customer acquisitions, expanding its existing user base, and international expansion.(Source: Investor presentation)Due to its long operating history since 1982, Autodesk has managed to build out an extensive network to distribute its software. As such, it is difficult for new entrants to penetrate into this space with limited reach. Autodesk is aware of this as well and is likely to work very hard to maintain relationships with all its distributors:(Source: Latest 10K)This wide distribution complements the core strength of Autodesk, which is the switching costs associated with its software. Autodesk's software is for technical professionals, and its training can take years to master. The relationships with higher education programs would expose industry professionals to the software before they enter the workforce. This switching cost advantage has also enabled gross margin expansion from 85% in 2017 to 91% in fiscal 2020.By having close relationships with universities, it increases the adoption of Autodesk. This makes the software more attractive to employers, which makes Autodesk more attractive to students in the future. This reinforces the network effects as the software becomes the industry standard for the architecture, engineering, and construction companies, which is the core target market for Autodesk.Peer analysis shows that Autodesk's valuation is not cheap. Its EV/Revenue figure of 10.2x exceeds the peer median of 3.3x. Autodesk's consensus EV/EBITDA and P/E ratios of 30.5x and 42.7x, respectively, are also higher than the peer average and median. The good news is that Autodesk's EBITDA margins and revenue growth of 33.4% and 17.8%, respectively, are higher than the peer median of 30.4% and 5.3%, respectively. Therefore, it can be reasonably justified to be paying a higher price than peers for Autodesk due to its strong operating fundamentals and re-acceleration of sales growth.(Source: Atom Finance)Autodesk has increased its cash position from $886M to $1.7B in the past year. Its debt position also decreased from $2B to $1.6B. According to Seeking Alpha's data, unlevered free cash flow also increased from $332M to $908M in the past year. With a strong cash position and sufficient free cash flow, it puts Autodesk in a strong balance sheet position to fund future growth and handle any operational challenges. The availability of cash and free cash flow also reduces the likelihood that Autodesk would need to raise capital in the near term, which might dilute existing shareholders.(Source: Latest 10K)Autodesk's tools are used frequently in the construction industry, which is considered a high-risk area. If there are negative issues with the software, Autodesk might suffer some repercussions in its brand name. As such, it is crucial that Autodesk does not have any major malfunction in its mission-critical software.Autodesk also faces risk in an economic downturn, which affects the construction industry. If companies in this industry go bankrupt, they might not be able to sustain the payments to Autodesk. However, due to its conversion from a license model to a subscription model, Autodesk should be more immune to a downturn as it is not reliant on new license fees.Autodesk has experienced an acceleration of revenue growth rates as well as margin expansion. The company's switching costs and network effects advantages are likely to help maintain its competitive position and higher margins going forward.Although Autodesk seems overvalued compared to its peers, it has better EBITDA margins and strong revenue growth rates. Its balance sheet has also strengthened over the past year with lower debt and higher free cash flows. However, some risks do exist in the forms of economic slowdown and reputational damage from any potential defective software issues."
4351366,103480,2020-06-01T15:39:06-04:00,"Autodesk's heavy exposure to the manufacturing and construction industries makes it one of the most heavily-impacted software companies to the coronavirus pandemic.
        The company has called for billings to be negative in FY21, starting with Q2. In particular, Autodesk's key multi-year contracts are at risk.
        Shares look expensive at ~10x forward revenue and ~30x forward FCF.
        There's no doubt that Autodesk remains a key technology, but investors will be able to get in at a better price later.","It's almost unfathomable to believe that Autodesk (ADSK), the maker of computer-aided design (CAD) software that is popularly used among engineers across the globe, is back to trading at all-time highs. Shares have rocketed up more than 60% from their nadir reached in March, when investors were rightfully worried about the impacts of construction and manufacturing on Autodesk's end-customer demand. The company recently released first-quarter earnings results that more or less confirmed these concerns. Though Autodesk still remains optimistic on the value proposition and criticality of its product (this was never in doubt; Autodesk remains the world's premier CAD software), its prognostications for the remainder of the fiscal year don't show any clear path to a normalization in its business.Investors, on the other hand, have treated Autodesk's recovery as a foregone conclusion. Shares have risen nearly 10% after the company reported Q1 results alone (which, when taking management's commentary about FY21 into consideration, weren't really that great) and are back at all-time highs.My prior article on Autodesk focused on the company's overweight exposure to cyclical industries, with about two-thirds of its revenue coming from the manufacturing and construction verticals. Now that we've seen Autodesk's Q1 results and updated guidance, we can more clearly flesh out what the remainder of the year looks like for Autodesk.My overall view remains unchanged: though many enterprise software companies have reported that sales trends began to normalize in April and May, the road to recovery for Autodesk remains more unclear. Looking longer-term, Autodesk is still a fantastic company. It has become the gold standard for CAD software, used both professionally and as the program for instruction at many engineering schools across the world. I do think, however, that the stock's rally since March has been indiscriminate given the serious fundamental risks facing the company this year, and investors should be able to nab Autodesk at a better price later on. Let's now take an updated look at how Autodesk's business has trended so far. Surprisingly, Autodesk's first-quarter results came out on top. Take a look at the company's revenue growth by segment in the chart below:Figure 1. Autodesk 1Q21 revenue resultsSource: Autodesk 1Q21 earnings releaseAutodesk still managed to grow revenues at 20% y/y to $885.7 million, beating Wall Street's estimates of $868.0 million (+18% y/y) by a two-point margin. Surprisingly, Autodesk's AEC (construction) vertical still managed 26% y/y growth.However, we must recall that the majority of Autodesk's revenue comes from renewals. Though Autodesk's Q1 did cover both March and April (the months likely to be hardest-hit by the pandemic), Autodesk's renewing customers aren't likely to react that quickly to their subscriptions as to hit Autodesk's revenue immediately in Q1 - indeed, the company commented that so far it hasn't seen substantial changes in renewal rates. However, the company does expect billings and renewal trends to soften in Q2 and beyond. Demand commentary from CFO Scott Herren's prepared remarks on the Q1 earnings call helps to shed a light on the traction Autodesk is seeing among its clients:There's a couple key concerns, highlighted above, to note from the commentary here. One of the successes that Autodesk has achieved in the past couple of years has been its conversion into a primarily subscription-oriented, multi-year contract company (whereas previously companies had purchased Autodesk ""the old way"" via perpetual licenses and support contracts). Obviously, uncertainty over the future of construction and manufacturing projects has made these companies wary of long-term commitments. The shortening of overall contract lengths may spur greater churn/less renewals in the future, in addition to impacting current-year billings. Autodesk's revised guidance for FY21 reflects that grim reality. Take a look at the updated estimates below:Figure 2. Autodesk guidance updateSource: Autodesk 1Q21 earnings deckKey takeaway here: Autodesk expects its billings in the current fiscal year to contract by up to as much as -3% y/y. Meanwhile, the company had originally expected a billings growth range of 11-13% y/y - which means the coronavirus' impact on the company is worth about fifteen points of growth. Of course, some of this is due to the duration impact from customers opting for shorter contracts - but Autodesk's revenue forecast for the year is also down, from a prior guidance range of 20-22% y/y to 12-15% y/y now, or approximately an eight-point impact. Autodesk is also expecting its net revenue retention rates to decline to a range of 100-110%, which is below its historical target range between 110-120%. For a business that relies so heavily on renewals and existing clients, this is concerning.Considering the weight of the pandemic's expected impact on Autodesk, it's unclear why the stock is trading back at all-time highs. Of course, stock valuations are based on future prospects and not just current-year results, especially if this is a year that is colored by pandemic impact. However, history has shown us that the construction industry in particular tends to have long-winded recoveries. In residential construction, for example, even after the housing market crashed in 2008, supply of new homes has lagged behind demand even in the present day, which is one of the main factors pushing up house prices. Autodesk's modeling notes accompanying its guidance, meanwhile, bakes in a ""swift recovery in H2"" for new business - leading us to believe that Autodesk's internal expectations might be a bit optimistic.Figure 3. Autodesk guidance modeling notesSource: Autodesk 1Q21 earnings deckAt present share prices near $210, Autodesk has a market cap of $46.1 billion. After netting off the $1.47 billion of cash and $1.64 billion indent, Autodesk's resulting enterprise value is $46.27 billion. Versus the midpoint of Autodesk's current-year revenue estimates, this represents a valuation of 12.4x EV/FY21 revenues. And against its FCF estimate of $1.30-$1.40 billion, Autodesk's cash flow multiple is 34.3x EV/FY21 FCF. It's worth noting as well that using FY21 free cash flow doesn't necessarily put us in danger of using a deflated trough year FCF, as last year Autodesk also generated free cash flow of $1.36 billion.Despite our belief in Autodesk's long-term value and its criticality in the construction and manufacturing space, we can't help but to think investors will have an opportunity to nab shares of this company at a much lower price later on in the year. As Autodesk itself acknowledged, revenue and billings will become hardest-hit in Q2 - and once investors digest that reality, shares may move downward in tandem.Many software companies have already offered hints that their business is normalizing. By virtue of the verticals it serves, however, Autodesk has a more challenging and unpredictable path to recovery. Yet its share price has made a full bounce back - so continued upside, in my view, will be difficult to come by. Keep a close eye on price movements in this stock, but don't feel tempted to buy into the upward momentum."

(NASDAQ:ADSK) is the market leader in software applications for designing, modeling, and rendering. The tools have become the de facto standard globally in various industries across architecture, engineering, construction, and manufacturing. The company just released its latest quarterly earnings, capping off what was a record year for growth and profitability. Given the ongoing coronavirus outbreak and implications to trends in economic growth, ADSK has sold off and is down by over 25% from its all-time high reached in early February. Balancing concerns of weaker cyclical trends, we think the company's fundamental strength and financial momentum represent a new buying opportunity as shares now trade at a compelling valuation.(Source: finviz.com)Autodesk reported its fiscal 2020 Q4 earnings on February 27th with non-GAAP EPS of $0.92 which was $0.02 ahead of expectations. GAAP EPS of $0.59 also beat by $0.16. Revenue in the quarter at $899.3 million increased by 22% y/y and about 1% above market estimates.The results in Q4 were impressive across both operational and financial figures. The company ended the year with 4.9 million subscriptions. Billings in Q4 totaling $1.5 billion increased by 43% y/y, highlighting what is expected to be continued momentum in the year ahead.The story here is a new phase of profitability that has kicked into high gear. The non-GAAP operating margin reached 25% from 15% in Q4 2018. Free cash flow of $1.36 billion was up from $310 million last year and one of the more positive bullish trends.(Source: Company IR)Growth is strong across product segments and regions. The architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) segment saw a revenue increase of 30% y/y and now represents 42% of the business. The company consolidated various acquisitions in the segment under one platform, now known as 'Autodesk Construction Cloud.' Management notes that the digital transition in the construction industry remains a growth driver with many businesses globally still in the early stages of adopting software solutions.The company's traditional AutoCAD product 'computer-aided design' also saw strong revenue growth, up 24% y/y and 29% of the total. The manufacturing business unit saw 15% revenue growth in the quarter.(Source: Company IR)A positive trend for Autodesk is the higher proportion of subscriptions which now represent 85% of revenues. The company says it has now completed its transition away from the legacy perpetual license model and sees the subscriptions as representing a more consistent recurring level of revenue going forward.Management highlights an expectation that annual recurring revenue is set to increase from $3.43 billion in the last fiscal year to $5.6 billion over the next three years. Other positive drivers supporting growth include the conversion of non-paying users and increasing direct sales mix which generates higher margins. The company is updating its pricing model to capture more non-commercial users who may have been attracted to the limited free versions.(Source: Company IR)Management issued guidance for Q1 and the year ahead fiscal 2021. A revenue target between $3.93 billion and $3.99 billion represents an increase of 20% to 22% from fiscal 2020. The company thinks it can continue to leverage its scale to drive margins and earnings higher. The non-GAAP operating margin is expected to expand towards 30% from 25% last year. EPS target between $4.21 and $4.44 at the midpoint represents a year-over-year increase of 55%.(Source: Company IR)In terms of market consensus expectations, the current fiscal 2021 revenue estimate for growth of 21% and an EPS of $4.36 are within management's guidance. Out through fiscal 2022 and 2023, the market sees momentum continuing with revenue growth of 18.6% and 15.5% each year, respectively.(Source: Seeking Alpha Premium)In light of the ongoing global coronavirus outbreak, we expect there to be downside revisions to these estimates. For all intents and purposes, the estimates above are now stale. The point of mentioning them here is to highlight what we view as positive underlying trends and momentum beyond the current disruptions to the normal operating environment.During the Q4 conference call, management already noted some weakness in the Chinese market but would not commit to quantifying an impact, but ominously warned that should the situation evolve into a pandemic; ""all bets were off.""Of course, this is especially concerning as now 2 weeks since the conference call the World Health Organization has indeed labeled the situation a pandemic. The classification acknowledges the severity of the outbreak affecting various countries and is meant to mobilize public agencies. The silver lining for ADSK as we explain below is that shares are already down by 27% from their highs and 17% from this earnings release, suggesting the stock has already discounted much of the bearish scenarios. We think the long-term outlook is still positive and shares can rebound.Autodesk has benefited over the past decade from a transition towards digitalization and process automation which continue to represent fundamental tailwinds. We believe it is appropriate to remain bullish on ADSK as there is an anti-cyclical component of the business as the core application is almost a requirement for its core customers to conduct day-to-day operations. The same way a business will tend to keep the lights on during a downturn as essentially a fixed-cost, Autodesk is the backbone for any AEC and manufacturing firm.To be clear, the weaker global growth outlook indeed pressures Autodesk at the margin, but we see the business supported by several factors including the momentum of the growing renewal base in the subscription model.In our opinion, the stock's selloff in recent weeks has resulted in a more compelling valuation level. The growing renewal base within the subscription model represents a consistent and recurring level of revenue supporting the financial outlook. Autodesk is not necessarily dependent on how well its customers are doing financially as long as they continue to renew the subscriptions and need the product.ADSK's current forward P/E of 35x, EV to forward EBITDA of 28x are in the context of consensus 22% revenue growth and 57% EPS growth expected this year. These growth rates are some of the most impressive among large-cap tech this year. Even under the assumption that these estimates face downside revisions, the company should still present positive growth and profitability in a bearish case.Data by YChartsThe risk here is that the ongoing global coronavirus outbreak intensifies and outlook for an eventual containment gets pushed further back through late 2020. If global macro conditions deteriorate beyond simply a transitory impact, that would likely further pressure sentiment against ADSK along with the broader market. That being said, we think the company benefits through its quality and segment leadership position and overall solid fundamentals.In the current market environment, investors should be focused on quality companies with a strong balance sheet and positive operating momentum. Autodesk with its market-leading software remains one of the best growth stories in large-cap tech. Recognizing what is likely to remain volatile conditions in the market over the near term, we think any further weakness could represent an attractive buying opportunity in ADSK that has long-term positive outlook. We expect ADSK to lead the market higher when conditions stabilize."
4371070,104744,2020-08-27T09:12:36-04:00,"ADSK reported a 15% revenue growth in FQ2, well above what Wall Street had expected.The growth was supported by strong sentiment across all regions and especially in the Asia Pacific, where sales were up 21%.ADSK also increased the adjusted operating margin to 29%.The company lowered billings expectations for FY21. FCF forecast was unchanged.I remain neutral on the stock, as I reckon its prospects are fully priced in at the moment.","On August 25, Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK), one of the dominant companies in the software industry that clearly needs no lengthy introduction, presented its Q2 FY21 results that were well above the Wall Street consensus estimates. But it appears that traders were more concerned with tepid FQ3 guidance, as the share price dived abruptly after the report was presented.In my previous note published two months ago, I highlighted ADSK's enduring long-term advantages that are fully supportive of material capital gains but also pointed out that the short-term price momentum might be overheating, and it would be reasonable to wait until a downside catalyst precipitates a share price correction and then, of course, consider buying for the long term.Since June 25, the price has risen by ~1.74%. So, the rally has clearly lost steam. The conclusion that can be drawn here is that the market likely realizes that the upside potential is limited, and Autodesk's revenue expansion is fully priced in at the moment.Now, let us examine the FQ2 results in greater depth.The FQ2 performance was impressive in many senses. For instance, Autodesk enjoyed bumper growth in the Asia Pacific, where revenues climbed 21% higher, thanks to the V-shaped economic recovery in the region. And though the dynamics in the Americas and the EMEA was softer, sales there also rose meaningfully, by 14% (thanks to a 16% improvement in the U.S.) and 12%, respectively, thus allowing to deliver consolidated revenue of $913.1 million, which represents a 15% improvement YoY, above the Wall Street consensus estimate and also above the highest end of the guidance (see slide 8).Data by YChartsDuring the earnings call, the CEO made important comments regarding the data on the usage of the Autodesk software in various regions, which shed some light on the pace of the economic recuperation across the globe. He said the following,Speaking about the segmental performance, growth in revenues of M&E and Other (Media & Entertainment) was the weakest, as the segment's sales rose only 4%. The MFG segment (that encompasses computer-aided manufacturing for the computer numeric control, Fusion 360, Inventor, Vault, etc.) also reported only 6% growth, as clobbered manufacturing activity had taken its toll. But, thankfully, it was largely offset by robust performance of AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT (+18% YoY), and the flagship division - Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (abbreviated AEC), which reported sales 19% higher than in Q2 FY20. And apart from that, the expansion was coupled with a strong revenue retention rate, which remained within ADSK's target range of between 100% and 110%.The corollary here is that, even though the economic crisis (e.g., clobbered industrial activity and softness in construction) stemming from the pandemic sharply decelerated Autodesk's revenue growth and made it to trim ambitious sales targets, it clearly has not led to a grinding halt in expansion.It also should not be overlooked that the growth rates mentioned above were achieved because of the improvement in the net subscription revenue, while the maintenance revenue has been declining incessantly (e.g., fell ~51% in FQ2), which is consistent with the company's strategy to maximize the share of recurring sales, thus somewhat eliminating short-term top-line volatility, improving sales visibility, and bolstering long-term shareholder value creation.In my previous article, I mentioned the Architecture Billings Index provided by the American Institute of Architects, one of the metrics that can be used in the assessment of the overall health of the U.S. construction industry, which, in turn, is among the principal drivers of AutoCAD renewals/new subscriptions, and, hence, consolidated sales of ADSK. The July data point to the fact that the worst had likely passed, and the construction industry in the U.S. is gradually recuperating. But the environment remains challenging, as the ABI was 40.0, which means that firm billings declined. Thus, the sharp growth in the demand for professional design software should not be expected (and ADSK had likely factored it in its FY21 guidance.)One of the undoubted advantages of Autodesk is its exemplary profitability. Even by standards of the Information Technology sector, its margins are impressive. For instance, few companies can boast a 91.5% gross margin (even Adobe Inc. (ADBE) has a weaker result). Because of the supply chain disruptions and weaker demand, most public companies have taken aggressive cost-cutting actions this year, but ADSK has not scaled down either its Marketing & Sales or Research & Development costs and even increased them both in FQ2 and FH2, as far as its resilient sales performance allowed to cover them in full and even improve the GAAP and adjusted operating margins. For example, the latter rose to 29%.Even though Autodesk extended payment terms for customers who encounter liquidity issues due to the ripple effects of the pandemic, its cash flows remained resilient. The half-year net CFFO only slightly retreated to $418.5 million vs. the H1 FY20 result of $440.5 million. FCF also weakened a bit but remained well above accounting earnings ($371.8 million vs. $164.7 million), which underpins excellent earnings quality.Using FCF and cash on hand, ADSK also directed $209 million to stock repurchases and $450 million to the debt repayment. No new debt funds were raised.Finally, let us take a look at capital efficiency, which can be assessed through the lens of Cash Return on Capital Employed. According to my calculations, CROCE (Last Twelve Months) stands at 52.6%, which is a phenomenal result.Besides, investors should not overlook that ADSK's shareholder equity has turned positive for the first time since January 2018 and reached $67.3 million, mostly thanks to the repayment of notes. So, this is a healthy sign, and I hope the debt reduction will continue going forward.But what lies ahead in the short term? Let me briefly remind you that the deepest cut to the FY21 forecasts was made in May when ADSK sharply lowered its revenue growth rate for the fiscal year to the 12%-15% range (see slide 8) from previously anticipated 20%-22% range (see slide 17, the FY20 presentation). Expectations for billings, FCF, and adjusted operating margin, and both GAAP and non-GAAP EPS also did not remain unscathed.This time, Autodesk acknowledged that, in FY21, there likely be no growth in billings, at all (see slide 7). Instead, a low-single-digit contraction is in the cards. The guidance on revenue and margins was also updated. The bearish sales growth rate forecast was increased to 13.5% (12% previously), while the lowest end of the non-GAAP operating margin forecast range was lifted to 27.5%.For FQ3, the company is forecasting a 1.9%-3.5% sequential revenue growth and a 10.5% increase YoY in the bearish case.The expectations for the adjusted earnings per share range were also corrected. Now, ADSK is anticipating the adjusted FY21 EPS to equal to $3.72 in the worst-case scenario vs. $3.52 previously.Does this mean the market should punish the stock? Of course, not. Or does the narrowed guidance on margins should bolster the share price? Also likely not.Autodesk has an almost perfect growth stock profile: its A+ Growth Grade is one of the highest in the IT sector and the application software industry, its Value Grade is F, the weakest result possible. By the way, its closest peer Adobe has a D- VG. I would not say that investors should wait until the VG improves to, let's say, B, as I reckon it will never happen. But I believe the stock has only limited short-term upside potential, and it would be reasonable to wait until the dip. So, I reiterate my neutral rating."
4333713,103480,2020-03-23T14:35:30-04:00,"Shares of Autodesk have been among the better-performing large-cap stocks. Though the S&P 500 has fallen ~30% since the start of the year, Autodesk has fallen less than 20%.
        This is despite the fact that Autodesk has plenty of exposure to coronavirus-impacted markets and industries.
        Two-thirds of Autodesk's revenue is derived overseas; more than half is derived from customers in construction and manufacturing.
        Though Autodesk is a subscription business, the underlying cyclicality of its end-customers (and the fact that many go belly-up in a recession) means churn may be higher than at other SaaS companies.
        Upcoming change in maintenance contract terms (in May of this year) may additionally drive greater churn","Every bear market creates winners and losers. In a sell-off as steep as this one, the notion of ""winning"" means that, at the very least, you're not losing as much as the average, and in this respect Autodesk (ADSK) has been one of the biggest successes in the software sector. Despite a market that has crashed nearly 30% since the start of the year, shares of Autodesk (ADSK) have only lost under 20%, outperforming the market by a cool ten points. Autodesk's relatively strong performance would seem to suggest that the company is well-equipped to weather the current downturn. And usually, software companies - SaaS subscription software companies in specific - tend to make for perfect defensive positions in uncertain economic times. When the whole world is collapsing, typically the last thing companies are thinking about is ripping out their core essential software. IT departments are busy figuring out how to make remote working easier for their global workforces; not sorting through RFPs or implementing new tools during this time.Perhaps the sole exception here, however, is indeed Autodesk. Perhaps more so than any other software company, Autodesk is heavily exposed to cyclical industries and geographies. For investors unfamiliar with the company's products, Autodesk's flagship software helps engineers and architects design their projects in a virtual environment. Construction, however, is a notoriously cyclical industry that is prone to the slightest shocks in the macroeconomy. When business as usual is humming along, it seems like new buildings go up on every street; when times are bad, funding dries up and projects get thrown into a standstill. In my view, investors are being overly optimistic on Autodesk's prospects during this difficult time. Autodesk's guidance for fiscal 2021 seems to barely incorporate any uncertainty owing to the global coronavirus pandemic. It's calling for 20-22% y/y revenue growth, with the high end of that range showing barely any deceleration from the 25% y/y growth that Autodesk exited at in Q4. Figure 1. Autodesk FY21 guidanceSource: Autodesk Q4 earnings releaseIf Autodesk was more of a ""horizontal"" software company - that is, a company like Salesforce.com (CRM) or Workday (WDAY) whose broad-use applications are used by a variety of industries with varying correlations to the broader macroeconomy, I'd feel much more confident in this revenue forecast. But when the lion's share of Autodesk's revenue comes from such shaky industries, I'm rather surprised that the stock hasn't seen the wild trading we've seen in other cyclical stocks. Be careful of Autodesk at this point. The stock may undergo a shock when the company releases its first quarter of results impacted by the coronavirus. Divest of this name and buy into other software names instead (I particularly like Workday and Splunk (SPLK) among the large-caps). One simple chart, taken from Autodesk's most recent quarterly earnings release, should strike fear into the hearts of the company's investors:Figure 1. Autodesk revenue mixesSource: Autodesk Q4 earnings deckAs can be seen on the left-hand side of the chart above, the lion's share - 42% of Autodesk's FY20 revenues - comes from its ""AEC"" division, which comprises Architecture, Engineering, and Construction clients. Another 22% comes from the company's manufacturing vertical. Autodesk also called out FY19 as a ""landmark year"" for the Construction vertical. Given how cyclical we know these industries to be, investors should be incredibly uncomfortable with Autodesk's exposure to a deep recession in these industries. The second chart, highlighting Autodesk's revenue by geography, illustrates another equally important problem. Autodesk has far more international exposure than most other software companies. A whopping 66% of Autodesk's revenue is sourced overseas; with 7% of the overall business in the Americas ex-U.S., 19% in Asia, and the remaining 40% in Europe. For comparison - Workday (WDAY), a similarly-sized SaaS company with ~$3 billion in annual revenues, only sources about a quarter of its revenues overseas. We all know China and South Korea have been rocked hard by the coronavirus in the first calendar quarter of 2020; but the impacts of the pandemic to Europe are still building. Entire countries have entered total lockdowns (Italy), hampering an economy that has already been weaker than the rest of the world for the past several years - and unfortunately for Autodesk, Europe is its largest market by far. Autodesk's international revenue exposure has already prompted downgrades by some Wall Street analysts.When Autodesk reported fourth-quarter earnings in February, the company's leadership downplayed the impacts of the coronavirus. Andrew Anagnost, Autodesk's CEO, responded to a Wall Street analyst's question on the Q&A portion of the earnings call as follows:In the weeks that have passed since Autodesk's management made this statement, the coronavirus has indeed evolved into a global pandemic that has forced shutdowns across most developed economies including the U.S. and Europe. Anagnost's comments suggest that the cyclicality triggered by the coronavirus has not been baked into Autodesk's guidance for 20-22% y/y growth, and investors should be prepared for either a guidance cut or quarterly misses in the near term. One other near-term risk on the horizon is Autodesk's decision to stop supporting its maintenance accounts. As most investors are aware, Autodesk has been on a push to convert its entire revenue base to subscription and end the practice of selling license deals with maintenance/support contracts. To a large extent we can say Autodesk has succeeded. As of the end of 2019, Autodesk had an ARR base of $3.43 billion - about 87% of its guidance for 2020 (though we expect some churn due to Autodesk's exposure to cyclical sectors). Autodesk is still determined, however, to convert the remaining swath of its old-school customers into its new subscription packages. As a way to force existing maintenance customers to convert into subscription, the company has announced that it will stop supporting certain maintenance contracts in May 2020, as detailed in the chart below. If customers don't switch to subscription, their maintenance support prices will jump by 20%.Figure 2. Autodesk contract changeSource: Autodesk Q4 earnings deckHardball strategies like these may work during normal times, but as businesses are belt-tightening in order to offset the economic slowdown triggered by the coronavirus, Autodesk's abrupt contract changes may backfire and drive more churn than the company originally expected. Subscription companies are such valuable assets to own during a recession because, if they ""keep their head down,"" enterprise customers will continue to pay their bills - especially if that technology is already deeply ingrained into a customer's operations and difficult to replace. Unfortunately, Autodesk may trigger unwanted consequences by rocking the boat too much.Despite the fact that Autodesk has outperformed major indexes since the coronavirus scare began, the company has several key risks that the market may be underrating at the moment:To me, Autodesk has far more downside risk than the market seems to think. Steer clear here and invest elsewhere."

Several of them can be seen in comparisons of the near-term price-range forecasts made by essential investment market professionals.Figure 1This map locates securities at the intersection of prospective price gains (green horizontal scale) and potential price drawdowns (red vertical scale) based on forecasts from market-maker hedging behavior to protect their necessary endangerment of firm capital as they enable volume trades. Desirable conditions are down and to the right.Our particular interest is in MSFT at location [12] and ADSK at [14], but also includes ADBE at [17], MSCI at [18], CHKP at [27], VRSN and SPY at [31] .To get answers we look to the best-informed market participants â the market-makers [MMs]. These are the dozen to two dozen firms providing price quotations to exchanges and transaction systems as a result of their extensive 24x7 world-wide information collection systems and evaluation resources. It is a community of perhaps 100,000 employees. The largest, Goldman Sachs employs over 35,000 full-time.Present-day markets are driven by major investing organizations commanding multi-billion dollar portfolios with stock contents which can only be adjusted by negotiated volume (block) trades between peers, not by âauctionâ. Such trades set and move posted prices.The individual investor typically is merely along for the ride. He/she needs to have a sense of where the negotiators are likely to head, pricewise. Conventional analysis often provides superficial descriptions and little linkage between operating minutia and price forecasts. As examples:Autodesk, Inc. operates as a design software and services company worldwide. The company offers AutoCAD, a professional design, drafting, detailing, and visualization software; AutoCAD Civil 3D, a surveying, design, analysis, and documentation solution for civil engineering, including land development, transportation, and environmental projects; AutoCAD LT, a professional drafting and detailing software; BIM 360, a construction management cloud-based software; computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software for computer numeric control machining, inspection, and modelling for manufacturing; Fusion 360, a 3D CAD, CAM, and computer-aided engineering tool; and Industry Collections software products for professionals in architecture, engineering and construction, product design and manufacturing, and media and entertainment industries. It also provides Inventor tools for 3D mechanical design, simulation, analysis, tooling, visualization, and documentation; Maya and 3ds Max software products that offer 3D modeling, animation, effects, rendering, and compositing solutions; and PlanGrid, a cloud-based field collaboration software, which provides general contractors, subcontractors, owners, and architects access to construction information in real-time. In addition, the company offers Revit software for building information modeling; and Shotgun, a cloud-based software for review and production tracking in the media and entertainment industry. Autodesk, Inc. sells its products and services to customers directly, as well as through distributors and resellers. The company was founded in 1982 and is headquartered in San Rafael, California.source: Yahoo FinanceUnfortunately, the âsmart moneyâ intentions are intentionally concealed as well as possible, to prevent being âfront-runâ by anyone. Fortunately, the commonly-used means of negotiating volume trades leaves behind information helpful in providing the current intentions and judgments of the participants. Which is what we present, daily, for over a thousand widely-held, actively traded stocks and ETFs, like these.Here in Figures 2 & 3 are relevant examples of their implied forecasts of coming price ranges as they evolved daily over the past 6 months.Figure 2Figure 3The vertical lines in these pictures are not actual past market prices like those seen in âtechnical analysis chartsâ. Instead they are forecasts of likely future ranges of market stock prices implied as probable in coming weeks and near months. The heavy dot in each vertical is the market close price on the day of the forecast. It splits the forecast range into upside and downside price change prospects.The imbalances between up and down potentials are what are useful in estimating both coming price direction and extent of change. Their proportions are measured by the Range Index [RI]. Its value is the percentage of the whole forecast range which lies below the current market quote. A 20 RI has 4 times as much upside prospect as down. A 33 RI has only 2 times as much upside potential as downside.Segregating past MM implied forecasts by their RIs produces clues to how market prices have reacted to the conditions seen by the MM community at various points in time. We use a 5-year sliding window to count how many prior forecasts (the sample size) have been like the current Range Index.From those samples market history tells what the odds have been for profitable buy positions subsequent to the forecast dates, as well as the size of the average position payoffs, including loss positions. Other important decision factors can be evaluated by this type of analysis, and they are shown in the rows of data posed between the two blue-background pictures in each Figure. Those data rows are positioned in Figure 4 to make the comparisons between prospects for ADSK and MSFT easier to perform.Figure 4Here the range forecasts are made explicit in columns [B] and [C] and are split by current market quote [D]. The upside price gain potential [E] is the percentage difference between [B] and [D]. We will come back to [F] later, as the worst-case risk exposure which has been actually experienced. [G] is the calculated Range Index, 22 for ADSK and 28 for MSFT.How likely and how good the profit prospects may be are shown in [H] as a percent of the sample size [L] and in [ I ] as an average profit percent on entry costs of all [L] positions, including losses. The current forecast quality is put in question [N] where [E]âs credibility is compared to [ I ]. MSFT suffers in this comparison where its capital gain payoffs are only 7.6%, while ADSK positions from its 99 20-level-RI forecasts has produced realized profits of 13.0%, net of 8 positions with prior losses, (told by the 91% win odds).To answer questions 4 and 5 about risks in our earlier list of what we ought to know, the complement of [H] â (100-H) â or 100-90=10 for MSFT, tells that we might best be prepared to have our profit hopes disappointed in nearly one tenth of the 129 times we might buy MSFT when it has a RI of 28. For ADSK the experience of having less than one tenth of its 99 prior forecasts at a RI of 20 makes the comparison here with MSFT quite bearable.The MSFT loss exposures of -3.2% [F] were less than the worst-case stress for SPY, as shown in its comparison row of Figure 3. The ADSK loss exposures were slightly larger than those of SPY, but more than made up for that with Realized Gains averaging +13%, about eight times those of SPYâs 1.6% [ I ].The comparisons of ADSK and MSFT stocks with the SPY ETF market-average may be helpful in developing a sense of perspective between these alternatives when the overall market environment is as it is seen as the market pros now do, rather than by the news media or doomsday market observers.Our final question from the earlier âneed to knowâ list is quite relevant in comparing ADSK and MSFT as investment candidates. The average holding period for ADSK to reach its [E] Sell Targets and produce the +13.0% average payoff was [J] 42 market days, or eight+ weeks. MSFT spent nearly eleven weeks, earning only 7.6%.So if the current situations were repeated (in the form of other stocks with identical payoff outcomes to these two) over the course of a year, the [K] compound annual growth rates [CAGR] which would be produced would be +108% for ADSK but only 40% for MSFT. No guarantees, but useful comparative perspectives.When we use the [H] Win Odds and its complement to weight the [ I ] and [F] reward and risk dimensions to produce [O] and [P] we get an odds-weighted net of [Q] which makes the ADSK vs. MSFT look even worse for MSFT.Now it is realistic to question if the ADSK isnât a cherry-picking example designed to make âour favoriteâ MSFT look bad. The answer is no. We monitor over 3,500 stocks and ETFs daily, reject about a thousand of them as unable to justify price range forecasts of any credible nature, and sort the remaining 2,700+ to see what cream rises to the top.The bottom row of Figure 3 shows what that exercise produces today, where the average[K] CAGRS of ADSK are almost as good as the 20 best. This is a fairly normal outcome where dozens of stocks with 3-digit CAGRs are encountered.On many dimensions of investment decision the near capital gain prospects for Autodesk, Inc. (ADSK) are more desirable than those of Microsoft, Inc. (MSFT) at this point. In the case of new capital to be put to work or freshly liberated cash needing assignment, an active investment strategy decision of commitment in ADSK is a desirable decision for the near term looking to a sell target conclusion, not as a long term hold.Disclaimer: Peter Way and generations of the Way Family are long-term providers of perspective information, earlier helping professional investors and now individual investors, discriminate between wealth-building opportunities in individual stocks and ETFs.

4311210,100666,2019-12-07T13:13:45-05:00,"Autodesk is a quiet software giant and it's in full transition to a SaaS model.Autodesk's flagship product is AutoCAD, but it has more than that, including Maya to make animation movies like Frozen.The transformation to the SaaS model gives higher margins and more predictability.Autodesk's valuation is moderate, although you have to look under the hood to see it.Autodesk invests in AI, AR and VR, which are perfect fits for its construction branch.","Sometimes you notice companies that have a big market cap but still are not often discussed. Autodesk (ADSK) is certainly such a stock. When I looked at the stock's page here on Seeking Alpha, I saw that it was about two months ago since there was an article about Autodesk. But this is a software giant: it has a market cap of $40B. The reason most people probably don't know it is because, unlike its big brother Adobe (ADBE), for example, it doesn't make products that consumers come into contact with.(Source)But I own it. I think it's a perfect example of 'boring is good' and it has proven that it outperforms the market substantially. I expect that trend to continue.Now that the company has had its Q3 2020 earnings release, I think it's time to dive into this interesting stock.While the name Autodesk may not ring a bell, Autodesk's flagship product is probably a more familiar name: AutoCAD. CAD stands for computer-assisted design. Especially if you have something to do with construction, architecture, woodwork or even in the design of computer chips or cars, you probably have used AutoCAD. (AutoCAD, source)The company was founded in 1982 by John Walker, who also helped develop the first version of AutoCAD. AutoCAD is used for everything from a small project to huge stadiums, Tesla cars, and the One World Trade Center.But Autodesk has diversified in a huge way over the years. Its Wikipedia page lists tens of products and the number of discontinued products is even a lot longer. But the company stays in its core business. Besides its AutoCAD platforms, it provides training for AutoCAD, products for architecture, engineering and construction, media and entertainment, (cloud) rendering and visualization.(A shot from Autodesk's Revit, a building information model program, source)Another product I really like is Maya, which is used for 3D animation movies and CGI in other movies. It's almost impossible not to have seen a movie from the huge list of movies that have used Maya. The list includes Oscar-winners and blockbusters such as Monsters, Inc., The Matrix, Spider-Man, Finding Nemo, Up, Avatar, Ice Age, Frozen and many more.(Source)The other products are the reason that Autodesk has a balanced revenue mix:Note: AEC is architecture, engineering and construction, M&E is media and entertainment, MFG is manufacturing group (Q3 2020 earnings call slides)As you can see and as can be expected, the manufacturing group grows the slowest of the different branches, but we're still talking about 15% YoY growth, which is very decent growth.The stock made its IPO in 1985 and it has rewarded investors. These are the 5-10- and 20-year charts:Data by YChartsData by YChartsData by YChartsAutodesk is becoming a SaaS stock and that is always a difficult transformation. Just as Microsoft's (MSFT) Office franchise and Adobe's Suite, Autodesk's products are making the switch from a licensing model to a subscription model. And that switch comes with a difficult transition period, in which the numbers look bad. You basically eat your own legacy business alive and the subscription model needs time to be able to replace the license model. But ultimately, it's what you want to see from a company like Autodesk. Subscriptions provide more predictable revenue streams, are easier for upsells and have higher margins.This is what Autodesk's revenue has done since 2016, the year the company started to switch to a subscription model:Data by YChartsYou can see the impact of the conversion to a SaaS company in the decline of the revenue. But you can also see that the plan is starting to work out. It took three years, from January 2016 to January 2019, before the company could pull in its previous revenue. In investing, three years can seem like an eternity.The pain seems to be over, though, and I think Autodesk can start to gain after the pain. The Q3 2020 (Autodesk lives a fiscal year ahead of us) revenue came in at $842.7M and it was up 27.5% YoY. These are the numbers for past years:(source: tikr.com)You can see that revenue only reached high growth (25%) at the beginning of this year, the end of Autodesk's fiscal year. What also jumps out to me is the really high gross margins, typical for software companies. But still, Autodesk trumps Adobe's 85.20% gross margin, which is telling. And that is why Autodesk's earnings are expected to explode over the next five years by almost 81%(Stockrover.com)And then you should know that just 40% of Autodesk's customers have made the transition to the subscription model. Management really focuses on this, but the transition simply needs time. Autodesk increased the prices for the old model by 20%, which makes the subscription model more cost-effective for its customers.The implication here is that 60% of Autodesk's clients still haven't made the transition to the subscription model, which leaves a lot of growth potential for Autodesk. After all, the old versions of AutoCAD will become outdated at some point and they will have to be replaced. The beauty of that is that Autodesk's margins will expand even more and the stream of recurring revenue will be very predictable.When those customers migrate to the subscription model, they sometimes upgrade the product as well. In Q3 2020, 21% of those who made the transition also took a higher-price plan. That's one of the reasons why Autodesk's net revenue retention rate, one of the most important metrics for SaaS companies, came in between 110% and 120%. Management doesn't give the exact number, but the 110% to 120% range is the goal and Autodesk continuously meets this target.Autodesk's growth is not completely baked into the price yet. As you can see from the FAST Graph below, the company is expected to grow its earnings by huge numbers: 174%, 57%, 36% and 33%. With a PEG of just 1.27, the stock has the potential to return 20% or more per year over the next five years:So don't let yourself be fooled by the present 'overvaluation': the P/E of almost 1,000, the PEG of 13, the P/S of 12.5. They don't say that much about the future of this company. Just for context: the forward P/E is at just 39 and that means that the trailing twelve-month numbers don't mean that much. The legacy customers, which are usually the big clients, are still in full transition to the SaaS model, so that distorts the numbers. After all, if you paid a high fee just a few years ago for a license and the program still works, why would you already switch to the cloud offering. I expect that it will take another 7 to 10 years before all legacy clients are subscribers Autodesk's SaaS.Autodesk has a rather high debt level. This is the net debt over the last four quarters. Just to make sure: net debt is total debt minus cash and equivalents.But the good news is that in the last quarter, Autodesk raked in $1B in free cash flow over the last 12 months. It expects to accumulate $1.3B in FCF in the next year. So the full debt could be paid off in just a year.Something else to draw the attention to is that Autodesk doesn't dilute its shareholders. These are the numbers of shares outstanding since January 31, 2015:You can see that Autodesk slowly reduces the outstanding shares and that is always good for its shareholders.Also remarkable is that the stock is held for more than 99% by institutions:(source: Simplywall.st)Autodesk is investing heavily in artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality. This looks like a natural fit with the construction branch of Autodesk. Now you have 3D visualizations of your future house. Wouldn't it be very exciting to be able to walk around in it even before you build it? It would also help to avoid mistakes that you or your designer make in the conception phase of your new home because imagining it is not the same as really walking around in the house.AI can also compute certain elements that become more and more important in housing. Energy efficiency, for example. Or what the best source of energy is in a particular building site, the most efficient material for walls and how to construct the house to be as cheap as possible for the same quality. There are plenty of options.Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost on new products on the Q3 2020 earnings call:If you look at Autodesk's numbers, you might not get excited. On the surface, the stock seems expensive. But if you look under the hood, you see that it's not that expensive at all and that the company is expected to post high earnings growth for years to come.The transition to the subscription model gives Autodesk a much more predictable revenue stream and higher margins. 60% of clients still have to make the transition and a lot of them also upgrade while they switch. VR, AI and AR will play an important role in Autodesk's future and the company is working hard to have a lot of products that fall into those new trends.If you have enjoyed this article and would like to read more articles from a long-term perspective, feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button next to my name.In the meantime, keep growing!"
4284827,102912,2019-08-12T10:31:26-04:00,"We used machine learning algorithms to explore over a hundred financial metrics and predict future annual stock returns for large-cap computer software stocks.We recap the most important financial metrics to evaluate technology stocks based on prior research.We rank computer software stocks based on our machine learning-driven predictions and focus our attention in this article series on the 3 highest-ranked stocks: ADSK, SSNC, and ADBE.In this article, we take a deep-dive into the numbers on our top-ranked computer software stock: ADSK.Based on our analysis, ADSK's debt-fueled explosive growth exceeds our level of risk tolerance, and we choose to invest capital elsewhere.","In the last 5 years, the computer software industry has more than doubled the returns of the S&P 500 (162.3% vs. 64.5%, respectively). Furthermore, the computer software industry continues to outperform the overall market with YTD returns of 31.3% as compared to 18.5% for the S&P 500. As technology continues to revolutionize every aspect of business operations and our everyday lives, the computer software industry remains an attractive investment opportunity for investors.This article is part of a series where we examine large-cap computer software stocks using machine learning techniques to measure predicted future annual returns. We rank 19 computer software stocks according to their predicted future returns, and then we focus our analysis on the 3 highest rated stocks: Autodesk, Inc. (ADSK), SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. (SSNC) and Adobe, Inc. (ADBE). Finally, we take a deep dive into the numbers of our top-ranked stocks and further analyze the recommendations made by our machine learning algorithms. In this article, we examine the highest-ranked computer software stock: Autodesk.In order to predict future annual stock performance of large-cap computer software stocks, we used neural networks to analyze a massive financial database containing over a decade of historical financial data. We trained a hundred neural networks to uncover complex associations between over a hundred financial metrics and a binary indicator of strong annual stock returns. The probability of strong annual stock returns was calculated as the average predicted probability across all neural networks. Finally, results were internally validated against a test set of the data using a 75%/25% training/test split.Figure 1. Expected annual returns betting alongside predictionsAs shown in figure 1 above, the expected annual returns of investing in baskets of stocks with a high predicted probability of future annual returns (blue line) greatly exceed that of the overall market (red line). Furthermore, the difference is significant as suggested by the shaded blue region representing the 95% confidence interval of expected returns. From a Bayesian standpoint, it follows that stocks with higher predicted probabilities are likely to outperform peers. Additional information on the performance of our neural networks is available in our previous article 3 Semiconductor Stocks To Buy Today, And 1 To Avoid: Machine Learning-Driven Insights.The rankings and key metrics of large-cap computer software stocks are summarized in table 1 shown below. In this series, we will cover computer software stocks with a predicted probability greater than 60% including Autodesk, Inc., SS&C Technologies Holdings, Inc. and Adobe, Inc. Honorable mentions in the computer software sector that almost met our cut-off include: Synopsys, Inc. (SNPS), Citrix Systems, Inc. (CTXS), ANSYS, Inc. (ANSS), Electronic Arts, Inc. (EA), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), and The Trade Desk, Inc. (TTD).Table 1. Rankings and key metrics of large-cap computer software stocksIn order to determine key drivers of long-term returns for computer software stocks, we used bootstrapped regularized lasso regression to determine linear associations between over a hundred financial metrics and a binary indicator strong annual stock returns of technology stocks. Only metrics retained in over 80% of trained models were considered significant in this analysis.Table 1. Best metrics to evaluate technology stocksOur findings are summarized in table 1 above. An increase in the P/S ratio, beta, net income growth, free cash flow growth, and market cap was positively associated with the predicted probability of strong annual returns. On the other hand, R&D expense growth and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) costs to revenue were negatively associated with future returns. Furthermore, the most impactful metrics are the P/S ratio and beta as suggested by the high magnitude of association for these metrics.We go over the implications of these findings in further detail in one of our previous articles: 7 Best Metrics to Evaluate Technology Stocks: Machine-Learning Insights. The two main conclusions of this analysis were that technology stocks with high-profit margins and recent quarter growth in net income and free cash flow are likely to outperform peers.1. Autodesk, Inc.Autodesk, Inc. is an important competitor in the computer software space with a market cap of $36.8 billion and represents our highest ranked stock in the sector. The company is an international software corporation that makes software services primarily for architecture, construction, manufacturing, media, and entertainment. Its software applications enable users to generate 3D models and animations of their projects. The company was founded in 1982 and is headquartered in San Rafael, California.Based on our analysis, ADSK has a predicted probability of strong future annual returns of 76.2% indicating it belongs to a basket of stocks with an excellent risk-reward profile. By comparison, the average predicted probability of strong annual returns of peers is 46.2%. ADSK's stock price has run up 27.2% year-over-year and has shown significant gains of 14.1% in the last quarter. The stock currently does not offer a dividend yield.Figure 2.1. Valuation and Financial Strength: Autodesk, Inc.ValuationWith a trailing P/E ratio of 560.0, Autodesk, Inc. has the 2nd highest trailing P/E ratio among large-cap computer software stocks and trades at a large premium to peers (average trailing P/E ratio of peers = 488.9). The large average P/E ratio among peers is primarily due to Splunk (SPLK), which currently has a trailing P/E ratio of 7,027. Nevertheless, based on prior analysis, the P/E ratio offers limited utility in evaluating technology stocks.More importantly, ADSK has a higher P/S ratio relative to peers (14.3 vs. 10.8, respectively). Based on prior analysis, the high P/S ratio may be viewed as a positive marker when it occurs jointly with high profit margins, which we will explore later in the analysis.Financial StrengthLooking at measures of financial strength, ADSK currently has a negative debt-to-equity ratio indicating it has been very aggressive in its use of debt financing and currently has more total liabilities than total assets. In terms of measures of short-term liquidity, ADSK's current ratio (1.4) and quick ratio (0.6) are ranked 7th and 1st lowest among peers. While its current ratio indicates the company should be able to meet its current obligations, the quick ratio indicates it may struggle to do so.Overall, metrics of financial strength for ADSK paint a grim picture. The negative debt-to-equity ratio and low quick ratios both present glaring red flags. Nevertheless, our neural networks heavily outranked ADSK relative to peers by a large margin suggesting that the company may offset its poor financial strength by performing well in other areas.That being said, we note that our neural networks were trained on data collected during a time of economic expansion and the risks associated with high levels of leverage may not be fully appreciated in our results. While recommendations from our machine learning algorithms may assist focus research and provide useful insights, this case highlights the importance of performing additional due diligence.Figure 2.2. Profitability and Management Effectiveness: Autodesk, Inc.ProfitabilityADSK has a higher gross profit margin relative to peers (89.6% vs. 76.9%, respectively) indicating it has more cash to spend on business operations relative to peers. On the other hand, it has a lower operating profit margin to competitors (8.8% vs. 14.7%, respectively) showing it has higher business costs and expenses. The companyâs lower operating profit margin may be the direct result of its elevated selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses to revenue (57.2%). While it is not unusual for computer software companies to have high SG&A expenses, ADSK ranks 17th out of a group of 19 peers in this metric.Management EffectivenessAutodesk, Inc. generates both a lower return on assets (-1.7%) and a lower return on equity (-38.3%) as compared to other computer software stocks. This indicates management is less effective than other companies in the sector at producing returns for shareholders.It is important to note that returns and equity for the company are both negative, which technically calculates to a large positive return on equity. In this case, ADSK would appear to have an impressive +38.3% return on equity despite being in a dire situation. As such, we have adjusted our return on equity calculations to handle double negatives in our calculations and to more accurately portray the negative circumstance.Figure 2.3. Compounded Annual Growth Rate: Autodesk, Inc.GrowthAutodesk has experienced explosive growth in the recent year-over-year (138%) ranking 2nd in this metric only behind Symantec Corporation (SYMC) (150%). In the long-term, the company has shifted from earning a positive net income in the past to a negative net income today. Similar trends can be observed looking at operating free cash flow growth; while the company has had explosive year-over-year OCF growth (292.8%), OCF growth is negative over a 3-year period (-7.3%).Further investigation reveals that the companyâs current negative earnings are accompanied by solid operating free cash flow. Given the amount of total liabilities on its balance sheet, this leads us to believe that recent explosive was fueled by debt of which the company is struggling to repay interest.We used machine learning algorithms to focus our research on large-cap computer software stocks to 3 companies. In this article, we analyzed the fundamentals of the top-ranked computer software stock by our neural networks: Autodesk. Based on our analysis, we were able to get a clear snapshot of the company as it stands today.The fundamentals indicate a story of explosive short-term growth fueled by debt in a company that is currently struggling to meet its interest expenses partially due to large SG&A expenses. Nevertheless, management could turn this story around if they are able to maintain their current growth trajectory or cut costs. Our machine learning algorithms, which analyze complex interactions between over a hundred financial metrics and future annual stock returns, seem to think management is on the right track and that the stock offers a favorable risk-reward profile.As for us, we have reservations about the predictions made by our neural networks; our algorithms were trained on data from a period of economic expansion. As such, they may not fully appreciate the risks associated with high levels of debt and the possibility of a weakening economy. For this reason, while we keep the company on our radar, we are uncomfortable with the current level of risk associated with this company. As such, given the hundreds of other leads generated by our neural networks and our limited capital, we choose not to invest in Autodesk at this time.For readers invested in Autodesk, we wish you the best of luck. The company has had an impressive increase in price over the years, and our machine learning algorithms certainly seem to give the company a vote of confidence. We hope that management is capable of executing on their vision and generate large returns for shareholders by doing so."
4293058,103480,2019-09-23T13:20:18-04:00,"Shares of Adobe have pulled back after the company cut its growth estimates for FY20.Management is citing heavier macroeconomic headwinds, affecting end-customers in the manufacturing and construction sectors.Because a large portion of Autodesk's revenues are tied to cyclical industries, Autodesk is more prone to economic shocks than other software companies.Autodesk's European revenues, in particular, have seen a dramatic seven-point sequential decay in growth. With U.S. manufacturing data coming in weak, Autodesk's Americas revenues are also at risk.Shares still look pricey at ~11x forward revenues.","This article was shared with PRO+ Tech subscribers - find out more here.Traditionally, investors have thought of the software sector as a recession-proof industry. This is especially true in the subscription-oriented, SaaS-dominated era of the day - many software applications have become so deeply embedded into its customers' processes and operations that it would be impossible to uninstall them. Cost-saving measures during economic recessions will almost never touch mission-critical software applications.While this adage holds true for most of the software sector, Autodesk (ADSK) is one notable exception. The longtime software giant, known best for its CAD products that have become the gold standard for engineers, is heavily reliant on the manufacturing and construction industries for its revenue.So it's unsurprising that, in the face of a U.S.-China trade war that has upended global supply chains and cast a chill over the global economy, that Autodesk would be one of the few high-growth software companies to actually cut its growth outlook for the year. Software investors are accustomed to a steady pattern of ""beat-and-raise"" quarters - so when a growth stock like Autodesk cuts its forecast, the market pays attention.Data by YChartsAutodesk has shed ~15% from its April highs, though the stock remains up 19% in the year-to-date (roughly on par with the S&P 500). In my view, the stock has further to fall.Make no mistake - Autodesk is an iconic technology company with precious little competition that is worth buying on the downswing. But it's as prone to cyclicality as its customers (recall that the company went through a round of mass layoffs last year, causing the stock to drop in the double-digit percentages), and this cycle hasn't bottomed out yet.And despite recent weakness in the stock, an ~11x forward revenue multiple (as shown in the chart above) is still too rich a price to pay for a company that's facing a secular slowdown and has already seen revenue growth slip to ~30% y/y (three points weaker than last quarter). It's worth noting that over the past year, Autodesk has benefited greatly from its transition from being an on-prem, license-based software company to a SaaS-oriented subscription product. The tailwinds from that transition, however, have likely topped out. Autodesk's percentage of recurring revenues is already at 96% in its most recent quarter, flat compared to the year-ago quarter.I'm a buyer of Autodesk shares if it falls to the low $120s, which would indicate a more reasonable valuation of ~8x forward revenues. Otherwise, I'm staying put on the sidelines.Let's start with the big picture, a story that is familiar to every investor: the global economic expansion is getting long in the tooth, and several key economic indicators are showing signs of bearishness. Of particular note for Autodesk: two weeks ago, the U.S. manufacturing index contracted for the first time in three years. The ISM index fell to 49.1% (any reading below 50% indicates a contraction), ending a 35-month expansionary phase in which the average reading was 56.5%.Simply put, Autodesk had historically strong conditions supporting its bull run over the past three years. Construction firms and manufacturing companies were adding capacity to satisfy global demand, propping up the need for Autodesk's software. The U.S., in particular, has been a beacon of strength even as growth stagnated in Europe and decelerated in China - but to see the U.S. contract is a chilling signal indeed.Fears of a slowing economy are one of the key reasons that the Federal Reserve agreed to cut its benchmark rates last week, by a quarter point to a range of 1.75-2.00%. Unfortunately, the biggest driver behind the slowing global economy - the U.S.-China trade war - is no closer to being solved. Last week, China walked out of a key visit to U.S. farms.Sensing the macro slowdown, Autodesk's management sliced down its full-year growth outlook, one of the major drivers behind the stock's recent weakness.Figure 1. Autodesk guidance updateSource: Autodesk 2Q20 earnings deckThe company's new revenue outlook is $3.24-$3.27 billion, versus a prior view of $3.25-$3.30 billion; its billings outlook has also fallen o $4.02-$4.08 billion, versus a previous outlook of $4.05-$4.15 billion. Wall Street consensus, meanwhile, had hoped for full-year revenues of $3.28 billion - above the high end of Autodesk's latest guidance.In cutting its full-year revenue outlook, Autodesk doesn't expect to also cut its expense growth - the company is still planning to grow GAAP and pro forma expenses by 12% and 9%, respectively - consistent with its prior outlook. Free cash flow guidance has fallen, meanwhile, to $1.30 billion - versus $1.35 billion in Autodesk's prior outlook.While acknowledging that management has become less bullish on the near-term horizon, Autodesk CEO Andrew Anagnost tried to deflect the idea that the company is positioned for a sustained slowdown. Per his remarks on the Q2 earnings call:Uncertainty, however, is the key word. Manufacturers and construction firms are incredibly sensitive to cycles and react immediately to economic slowdowns, slowing capital investments (including IT purchases). There's no use in buying Autodesk software if no buildings are going up.Autodesk's guidance cut isn't just an expression of conservatism - we can already see hints of deceleration in the company's current results. Over the past year, one of the key metrics in Autodesk's subscription growth story has been its ARR. In Autodesk's most recent quarter, total ARR growth decelerated to 30.7% y/y, 240bps weaker than Q1's ARR growth rate of 33.1% y/y:Figure 2. Autodesk ARR trendsSource: Autodesk 2Q20 earnings deckGrowth also slowed down, as expected, in Asia and Europe. Autodesk's Asia Pacific revenues slowed down to 33.5% y/y in Q2 (a sequential decay 160bps), while European revenues slowed to 27.3% y/y (a far more dramatic slowdown of 720bps versus growth of 34.5% y/y in Q1).Figure 3. Autodesk revenue by geography trendsSource: Autodesk 2Q20 earnings deckAmericas revenues, meanwhile, have been more stable, growing at 31.6% y/y in Q2 versus 26.7% y/y in Q1 - but with U.S. manufacturing data slipping, Autodesk's U.S. growth may be hampered over the next few quarters, pulling down the only support pillar that the company had between its three key geographies.Be cautious of investing in Autodesk during such an unstable time in the global macroeconomy. Autodesk has been one of the few software companies to cut its full-year outlook, a move that's underlined by performance that is already weakening, especially in Europe. With many manufacturing and construction companies on the rocks, I'd shy away from buying Autodesk at a still-high valuation of ~11x forward revenues. Keep watching for this stock to fall further before buying."
4281555,103711,2019-08-06T11:00:00-04:00,"ADSK provides a niche software which is critical in the creation of blueprints and engineering plans.ADSK is best of breed in the sector with strong tailwinds.If management can hit its own FY23 targets, then shares look very cheap.ADSK is a buy.","Autodesk (ADSK) is a best of breed software company with a âstrong buyâ rating in our Best of Breed Universe. The company sells software which is critical in the creation of blueprint papers and engineering plans. In this article, I explain why shares are a buy.(2019 Investor Day)ADSK primarily sells its Autocad software which basically is a 2D and 3D âcomputer-aided draftingâ software application used in architecture, construction, and manufacturing, especially in the preparation of blueprints and other engineering plans.ADSK estimates its total addressable market (âTAMâ) to be $48 billion and for this to grow to $59 billion by 2023. This includes $27 billion from the architecture, engineering, construction (âAECâ) industry and $31 billion from manufacturing industries.(2019 Investor Day)ADSK products are used extensively for simulation, manufacturing, and design:(2019 Investor Day)ADSK also benefits from the digital trend in a less commonly discussed manner: architecture design and construction. Countries are instituting Building Information Modeling (âBIMâ) mandates which essentially involves digitizing construction projects in order to, among other things, reduce costs and improve execution:(2019 Investor Day)BIM penetration remains scarce, indicating that demand for 3D modeling software should explode for the far future:(2019 Investor Day)With so many existing infrastructure not yet mapped out with CAD software and many more buildings and roads to be built in the future, the market for digital 3D modeling software is enormous. ADSK is the best of breed name in this field and is poised to benefit from this powerful and long-lasting tailwind for decades to come.ADSK is a company which, similar to Microsoft (MSFT), at one point wasnât a software as a service (âSAASâ) company. It has since worked hard to transition towards the SAAS model, and now sees subscription revenues making up 75% of total revenues:(2019 Investor Day)This led to near-term pain in the form of deteriorating profitability, as earnings per share went from $1.00 in 2013 to a $2.58 loss in 2018. However, the company is now reaching an inflection point and profitability should be on the horizon.(2019 Investor Day)While ADSK has always had high gross margins, it has seen margins rise even higher after its transition to close to 90%. The most important benefit of the SAAS model, however, is more smoothness in annual revenues as investors wonât have to worry so much about trying to guess âpeakâ and âtroughâ years. Such smoothness usually warrants a premium valuation multiple due to the revenue closely resembling ârent.âUnlike many other high flying tech names, ADSK does have some debt due to acquisitions and share repurchases. Including long-term lease obligations, ADSK has $2.2 billion in long-term debt versus $970 million in cash and marketable securities. That said, I am not worried about balance sheet risk as ADSK has guided for short-term debt to decline by $500 million this year and it is already free-cash-flow positive.In comparison with other high-flying tech names, ADSK appears to be run by a shareholder-first management team: it actually buys back stock. ADSK did repurchase 2.2 million shares of its stock in 2018 and continued its buyback program with $100 million in buybacks in the first quarter. These buybacks make sense due to ADSKâs reasonable valuation - Iâd much rather excess cash to be put towards buybacks than piling up in a checking account.ADSK has given full-year outlook of $3.525 billion in subscription sales, or 28% growth YOY. GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.20 at the midpoint and the company expects to generate $1.35 billion in free cash flow. I should emphasize the significance of such guidance as this implies deep and growing profitability. We can see below that ADSK has extracted tremendous âoperating leverageâ as growth in revenues hasnât seen an associated growth in operating expenses:(2019 10-K)This has led to operating income growing dramatically and 2019 looks like the beginning of GAAP profitability.Further, ADSK has set long-term targets of $5.6 billion in annual recurring revenue and $2.4 billion in free cash flow for fiscal year 2023 (basically by the end of 2022, or just over 3 years from now). This represents a revenue CAGR of just under 17%. While this does represent a slowdown in revenue growth from this yearâs 28% guided figure, managementâs commentary on margins was particularly surprising. It has guided for non-GAAP operating margins of 40% and more importantly, GAAP operating margins of 33%. In my original valuation models I had used 30% operating margins as its long-term benchmark - if the company really can achieve 33% operating margins by FY23 then that would imply that my figure is way, way off and a more appropriate number would be perhaps around 40% or even higher. 33% operating margins on $5.6 billion in revenues would be $1.85 billion in operating income, or $8.32 in EPS per share if we assume shares outstanding remain constant (seems reasonable given its buyback) and interest expenses come down (also reasonable considering the current free cash flow generation). If we assume that ADSK could grow revenues 10% annually after FY23 in the near term, that would represent projected EPS growth of 27% assuming gross margins of 90% and operating leverage. I could see ADSK deserving an earnings multiple anywhere between 27 and 54 based on that growth rate. Right in between would be an earnings multiple of 40, which would equate to a price to sales multiple of 13.2 and share price of $332. This would arguably still be a conservative valuation, given that the high operating leverage would promise at least high teens earnings growth for many years later. A $332 share price by the end of 2022 would mean annual returns of around 27% from current share prices.Without current GAAP profits, much of the buy thesis relies on management's guidance. Might 17% revenue growth through 2023 be too aggressive?I am not a fortune teller, but there is one important lever which may help ADSK reach its targets. As we can see below, ADSK has about 14 million of existing users from which to convert to subscription services:(2019 Investor Day)These are users which are already familiar with ADSK software but have not become paying subscribers. I am confident that ADSK will be able to prove value in its updated software versions to convince this user base to make the switch.ADSK appears to be benefiting from strong tailwinds which look to only get stronger as the world moves towards digitizing everything related to blueprints and engineering designs. In spite of the strong recent share price performance, shares still appear materially undervalued. I rate shares a buy.(Tipranks: Buy ADSK)"
4278603,105265,2019-07-29T09:13:53-04:00,"Autodesk is its industries leader. Its products are very sticky.
        Autodesk is transitioning from a licensing to a SaaS model. This has hurt the financials but will soon pay dividends.
        The valuation is rich, it exposes the price to pullback risks. There are examples which show that price can keep rising nevertheless.
        We recommend buying half stake now, and saving the rest of capital to take advantage of a pullback.","We recommend buying a partial stake in Autodesk (ADSK) and holding some capital for a pullback. We like Autodeskâs story of a switch to a SaaS model and have confidence in its future given its leadership, lack of competition, stickiness of product, and large and untapped addressable market. Weâre not happy about the valuation, we think that the price is exposed to a pullback in the event of a revenue miss, but still see upside potential.Autodesk is the leading software company serving the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media, education, and entertainment industries. Architecture, engineering, and construction products of Autodesk, in particular, are the absolute leader in their respective fields and have been for a while. The Company has been the industry standard for decades.Similar to other ex-software licensors out there (Adobe (ADBE), Microsoft (MSFT)), the recent history of Autodesk has been one of switching to the SaaS model. This switch is highly valued by the market as it increases the stickiness of product as well as revenue visibility. By bringing confidence in future financials, recurring revenues lead to a higher multiple.Autodesk is earlier in the switching cycle compared to its peers. Due to decades of licensed sales, and a recent switch to a subscription based model, most of Autodesk customers have not made the switch. Although subscription revenues currently make up 75% and recurring revenues (subscriptions + maintenance plan) 96% of total, the Company has 4.3 mn subscribers out of 18 mn active users. Most of Autodesk users havenât made the switch to the new model. One can see hints of this in the financials with FY 2019 revenues below those of FY 2015. As licensorsâ versions get outdated, they will have to subscribe and thus bring organic growth.Autodesk is looking to make its product even more of a staple than they already are. It is making smart investments in AR and VR. The Company has already rolled out some products and is looking to expand its capabilities using the technology. We view this as a very savvy investment as we think that a solid AR / VR product would significantly increase the Companyâs productsâ effectiveness. Imagine if an architect could get their client to stand in the room that she is designing or if a construction designer could get their client to see the product like in real life, how much of an improvement itâd be on the current visuals.Management calculates a very large and growing addressable market. They see their core market opportunity today at $48 bn and growing to $59 bn by 2023 and note that their calculation is conservative. The management cites infrastructure, global rising in middle class, and a push toward green design as reasons for growth. Given that the revenues for FY19 amounted to $2.4 bn, the room to grow is clearly very largeThe transition phase took its toll on Autodeskâs financials both in lost revenue and in investment. After years of showing solid growth, Autodesk revenue fell from $2.51 bn in 2015 all the way to $1.55 bn in 2017 before climbing back to the current $2.44 bn. Until late 2015 the company had been posting positive TTM net income since 1997 except for a brisk 6 month period during the GFC.The transition phase is ending though as the company turns profitable once again. This year is expected to be the year in which Autodesk posts a positive EPS. Consensus estimates that the profitability of the company will grow fast however, reaching ~$10/share by 2024 boosted by accelerating revenue growth expectations.Source: SeekingalphaAutodesk has been issuing $90-$120 mn worth of stock annually over the past 3 years. This is very high and should be watched going forward. But currently we see no risk regarding the issue thanks to the Companyâs shareholder friendly capital allocation strategy. Within the same time frame, Autodesk has purchased between $300 - $700 mn of equity annually leading to a steady decrease in shares outstanding from 224.5 mn to 219.5 mn shares.Autodesk is trading at 61x forward P/E, 45x forward EV/EBITDA, and 12x forward P/S. This is very rich by any measure. However, the world we live in doesnât work with the conventional value / price correlation, and many expensive companies keep showing price appreciation despite astronomic valuations.We think that Adobe is a very appropriate example. It was also a legacy vendor of industry leading products and switched to an SaaS model recently. Below are price and fundamental charts of Adobe. We see an initial phase of very lofty valuations subsequently brought down considerably by the company growing into the said valuations. The process was accompanied by impeccable price performance.Source: Seeking AlphaIn our view, Autodesk is in the phase of filling the valuation. Looking at the chart below, we see strong P/S (the appropriate multiple due to negative profit quarters) multiple expansion followed by stable multiples thanks to strong growth in revenue. This process was also accompanied by a steady increase in price. We think that Autodeskâs price will follow the path of Adobeâs, that is up and to the right.Source: GurufocusAutodesk has multiple premium earning characteristics as well, similar to those of Adobe. Its leadership in its niche cannot be understated. Its products define the market. It isnât easy to use its software either, customers need education to use design software. Itâs very difficult for a designer to switch software. The high switching costs, combined with very high revenue visibility justifies a relatively high valuation premium.We are in no way arguing that Autodesk is trading at an attractive valuation. But we do argue that Autodeskâs price will likely rise as long as it executes, and we see no reason for it not to. Its path to growth and profits are clear with a large untapped market and no competition. We do think, however, that the current valuation exposes the price to steep corrections.Based on our conviction in the attractive growth story of Autodesk, we are buyers of the stock at current levels. We think that continued execution will bring with it price appreciation. We do, however, recommend a unique strategy in purchasing to limit risk. We suggest identifying the portfolio allocation that will be dedicated to the name and buying half the allocation now. We recommend buying the other half during a potential pullback related to a revenue miss. Even if we donât get the pullback, we are happy campers as the price will likely keep increasing since Autodesk will be executing."
4244966,20715,2019-02-27T18:07:04-05:00,"Autodesk is set to release earnings after the closing bell on Thursday.The stock has doubled in the last two years and has jumped 38% since its low in December.The sentiment toward the stock is mixed, while the fundamentals have improved in recent quarters.","Application software firm Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is set to release earnings after the closing bell on Thursday, and the stock is carrying a lot of upward momentum into the report. The stock has jumped over 38% from its December low, and that suggests to me that investors are pretty optimistic about the company's fiscal fourth quarter results.The recent past shows a mixed picture for Autodesk's earnings growth. Over the last three years, the earnings growth has been flat, but in the third quarter, the earnings grew by 342% over the year earlier.The company's sales growth is also somewhat perplexing as sales have declined by 4% per year over the last three years, but sales were up by 28% in the third quarter.The sales and earnings growth in the most recent quarterly report is very encouraging, but the fact that sales were declining and earnings were flat in the past three years is a little concerning. The global economy has been growing in the last three years and is now starting to slow down, which is why I say the last three years numbers are a little concerning.The management efficiency and profitability measures for Autodesk are also somewhat perplexing. The return on equity is zero because the company was losing money in fiscal 2018. The profit margin shows as a negative 7% due to the losses.Autodesk has made money in each of the last three quarters, and it is expected to post EPS of $0.42 for the fourth quarter. This could cause the ROE and the profit margin to move to positive ground. Investor's Business Daily, Yahoo Finance, and the Wall Street Journal all three have the ROE and profit margins as negative or zero.While the company may have struggled in fiscal 2018, the stock did not. From February of 2017 through the present, the stock has doubled in price. The trend is clearly to the upside, and the stock remained above its 104-week moving average during the fourth quarter pullback.As I mentioned earlier, the stock has jumped over 38% from its December low, and that furious rally has caused the weekly stochastic readings and the 10-week RSI to move into overbought territory. Looking back at 2017 though, the stock spent a great deal of time in overbought territory, and it wasn't much of a concern.We see that the stock was moving higher within an upward sloped trend channel from 2016 through the fourth quarter. The stock did move above the upper rail of the channel in August and then fell below the lower rail in December. The stock has rallied so sharply it is now approaching the upper rail of the channel.Turning our attention to the sentiment indicators, we see a mix of optimistic and pessimistic views. The analysts are pretty optimistic, while option traders are rather pessimistic. The short sellers are neutral.There are 23 analysts following Autodesk, and 19 of them have the stock rated as a ""buy"". Of the other four, three have the stock rated as a ""hold"", and one has it rated as a ""sell"". I have gone over this repeatedly, but it is worth reiterating. A company with above-average fundamentals tends to have between 65% and 75% of total ratings in the ""buy"" category. In this case, we are looking at 82% buy ratings, and as was discussed earlier, the fundamentals are improving, but I wouldn't call them above average just yet.The current put/call ratio is at 2.09, and that is twice as high of what I consider extreme pessimism. There are 44,839 puts open at this time and 21,478 calls open. This is a significant level of open interest for a stock that averages 1.7 million shares traded per day.The short interest ratio is at 2.69 currently, and that is an average short interest ratio. Over the past year, the short interest ratio for Autodesk has been as high as 5.2 and as low as 1.36. The number of shares sold short has been trending lower since the end of October. On October 31, there were 7.45 million shares sold short, and as of January 31, that figure stands at 4.59 million.The incredible momentum the stock has right now is hard to bet against. The stock is overbought and approaching the upper rail of the trend channel, but the trend is still to the upside.The sentiment is mixed with a slight skew to the optimistic side, thanks to the analysts' ratings and the falling short interest.The fundamentals aren't as good as I would like for a long-term investment, but they are improving. To give you an idea of the fundamental ratings, Autodesk scores a 72 on Investor's Business Daily's EPS rating system, but it gets a D in the SMR rating system.A 72 EPS rating is good, but not great. The D SMR rating is poor, and that is due to the lack of an ROE and a negative profit margin. Should the company close fiscal 2019 (yes, this is considered the company's fiscal Q4 2019) with a solid report, we could see the SMR rating improve dramatically.As an investment, investors are betting that the fundamentals will continue to improve and that the technical momentum will continue. Personally, I am not sold on Autodesk as a long-term investment just yet. For me to consider the stock for the Hedged Alpha Strategy, the ROE and profit margin would have to improve dramatically.While I am not sold on the stock as a long-term investment, it is good for a short-term trade, and I think the safest play is a straddle with the options that expire on March 15.The stock does have a history of gapping after its earnings reports - it gapped sharply higher in August and last March, but it gapped sharply lower in November 2017. With this history, it isn't surprising to see that option premiums are rather high right now. The stock is currently trading at $163, and the $162.50 strike calls that expire on March 15 are fetching $8.45. The puts at the same strike and in the same series are at $7.75.Given those prices, you are looking at $16.20 for an at-the-money straddle. That means the stock would have to move over 10% in one direction or the other. The three instances where the stock gapped that I mentioned earlier saw moves of 15.86%, 14.87%, and 15.3%, so it is possible to make money off of a straddle priced this high.The stock didn't gap after the earnings report in November, but the stock did move up by 20% in the two weeks following the announcement. The one outcome that would kill this straddle idea is a repeat scenario of what we saw last May. The stock didn't gap after earnings, and then it remained in a $10 range for the next few weeks."
4246956,58641,2019-03-07T11:55:51-05:00,"ADSK already has YTD return of 22.69%. I am still endorsing this stock as a buy.Strong annual recurring revenue growth is a very compelling reason why ADSK has long-term upside potential.Autodesk added 418k subscription customers while shedding 166k from maintenance plans in Q4 2018. SaaS is winning maintenance holdouts and new customers.Q4 2019, Subscription plan ARR was $2.2 billion, +87% Y/Y. This growth rate can improve from Autodeskâs generative 3D CAD/CAM/CAE design technology.Autodeskâs AEC, Manufacturing, and AutoCAD/AutoCAD LT product segments' revenues are growing in spite of cheaper rival products.","Autodesk (ADSK) had an amazing Q4 2018 earnings report that flew under the radar here at Seeking Alpha. Itâs a shame because ADSK is emerging as a potent Software-as-a-Service company. The company transitioned to full subscription-only software licensing last January 2017. Its quarterly annual recurring revenue ((ARR)) in Q1 2017 was only around $1.4 billion. ADSK is a compelling buy right now because the subscription business model helped it deliver $2.72 billion in Q4 2019 ARR.Subscription plan ARR for Q4 FY 2019 was $2.2 billion (+87% Y/Y). The growing ARR is what makes ADSK a strong buy. The old maintenance plan annual fees now account for less than 20% of Autodeskâs revenue.(Source: Autodesk)My fearless forecast is that Autodesk has a good chance of becoming a leader in the $20 billion/quarter enterprise SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) industry. The enterprise SaaS business has a CAGR of 32%. Autodesk was a latecomer to the SaaS game that is why Adobe (ADBE), Salesforce (CRM), and MSFT (MSFT) are now the runaway leaders of enterprise SaaS.Two or three years from now, barring no major headwinds, Autodesk could tout a 2% or 4% market share of enterprise SaaS spending ($100 billion in 2018). Autodeskâs product segments are posting growth. The FY 2018 chart below convinced me that there are more enterprise/business users adopting Autodesk products for their 3D CAD/CAM/CAE design and product management cycle needs. There are free and much cheaper alternatives to AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT and yet this product familyâs revenue grew 26% Y/Y in 4Q FY 2018.(Source: Autodesk)Autodesk is a great long-term investment because the AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) software industry is growing at 12% CAGR. It will have a market size of $46 billion by 2022. Autodeskâs annual revenue right now is just $2.57 billion. Autodesk clearly has more growth/upside potential from the fast-growing AEC software market.Like it or not, four decades-old AutoCAD remains the leading industry standard for Computer Aided Design artists. The latest February 2019 ER slide below showed AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT posted 36% Y/Y growth in 4Q19.(Source: Autodesk)There are dozens of free and or cheaper 3D modeling/Animation and CAD/CAM software products. However, Autodeskâs AutoCAD, AEC, and Manufacturing software products remain a favorite among customers. Dassault Systemes (OTCPK:DASTY) and PTC (PTC) canât seem to slow down the growing revenue of Autodeskâs AEC products. From Q4 2019 report, AEC product family grew 21% Y/Y. This winning track record is important because AEC is Autodeskâs biggest revenue generator.(Source: Statista)The software products of Autodesk appeal to corporate users, freelancers, educational users, and home users. It is therefore best to evaluate Autodeskâs long-term investment quality by accepting it as a full-pledged SaaS provider. The overall SaaS industry is expected to have a market size of $170 billion this year. It will grow to $346 billion by year 2027.Going forward, Autodesk carving out a consistent 2% share (conservative guesstimate) in SaaS can possibly lead to it making annual revenues of $3.4 billion (FY 2020), $4.1 billion (FY 2021), $4.7 billion (FY 2022), $5.33 billion (FY 2023), and $5.78 billion (FY 2024). New Autodesk followers should understand that Autodeskâs fiscal year earnings report is 3 quarters ahead of current calendar year.My exuberant forward estimates of a full-pledged SaaS Autodesk is reasonable. Statistaâs projection chart above obviously came from very knowledgeable experts. I only used a 2% market share basis to derive the forward-looking annual revenue estimates above.Becoming a full-pledged SaaS player means Autodesk will ultimately become a highly profitable company. Renting out software is a high-margin pursuit. Like other SaaS companies, Autodesk operates on 80% or higher gross margins. The SaaS model eliminates the overhead cost of producing, boxing and shipping out software installation discs.The SaaS model also reduces the headwind of software piracy. Engineers, architects, draftsmen are no longer required pay $5k upfront to own AutoCAD. It can be rented for $195 per month. SaaS gives affordable access to software. Individuals and corporate customers will no longer be tempted to use pirated copies (often burdened with virus, malware, Trojans) of Autodesk products.An AutoCAD draftsman here in the Philippines can earn P155k ($3k) P953k ($18.33k) per year drawing residential/building floor plans. My point is that Autodeskâs emergence as a SaaS software leader also increased its total addressable market. Its products are now affordable to use even for customers in developing countries.Let us never forget that Autodeskâs computer aided engineering and BIM (Building Information Modeling) software products have a giant tailwind from the growing $17.14 trillion global construction industry. The construction industry needs Autodesk. This is the other factor that makes ADSK a strong buy.The massive spending in global construction is why Autodesk can easily rent out its AEC products for $2,755 per year per user. Civil engineers, architects, and draftsmen make so much money they can easily afford the luxury software products of Autodesk.(Source: Autodesk)The cloud-based Fusion 360 is another emerging giant tailwind for Autodesk. It only costs $60/month to use Fusion 360. The generative technology of Fusion 360 will further boost Autodeskâs ARR growth. Deadline-pressured engineering and architectural firms will love the time-saving features of a generative CAD/CAM/CAE design workflow.Generative means the software will automatically produce multiple 3D product designs based on real-world manufacturing limits and encoded product performance requirements/specs. This is something that Fusion 360âs rival, Onshape does not yet have. (Source: Autodesk)The draftsmen/engineer/architect can then choose among the multiple CAD/CAM generated designs. The chosen AI-generated design can be further customized manually. (Source: Autodesk)The artificial intelligence algorithm behind Fusion 360 can output thousands of robot or spaceship designs (for game assets creation) in minutes. Me, it took me more than an hour just to conceptualize one 3D spaceship mock-up for a mobile game.Autodeskâs growth as a transitioning SaaS company can be derailed if Adobe (ADBE) starts buying CAD companies. Adobe, if it wants to, can really compete with AutoCAD and Autodesk AEC Products. After spending $1.68 billion for Magento and $4.75 billion for Marketo last year, Adobe still has more than $1.6 billion in cash & short-term investments.My takeaway is that Adobe needs 3D modeling/animation and CAD/CAM software products to improve its no.3 ranking in Enterprise SaaS. Dimension CC and Mixamo are Adobeâs early assault on Autodeskâs industry standard 3D design software products, 3D Studio Max and Maya.Autodesk should be scared if Adobe decides to merge with Dassault Systemes or with PTC. The CAD/CAM and product management cycle software products of Dassault or PTC can be marketed alongside Adobeâs Creative Cloud suite of print/mobile/web content creation software products. A future scenario could be Adobe charging $199 per month for Creative Suite products plus SolidWorks CAD apps.Autodeskâs stock has a YTD return of 22.69% but Iâm still endorsing ADSK as a buy because of its fast-growing subscription software business. Autodesk ended FY 2019 with 4 million subscribers (20% of which are maintenance plan customers). Two or three years from now, Autodesk could be monetizing from 7 or 8 million software subscribers. (Source: Seeking Alpha) Adobe Creative Cloud ended 2018 with estimated 15 million subscribers. Adobe shifted to full SaaS last May 2013. This convinced me that Autodesk (who only went full SaaS in January 2017) can still grow its software subscriber count to 7 or 8 million. My exuberance over ADSK is also because of its game-changing generative 3D CAD/CAM/CAE Fusion 360 cloud software product. Generative AI in tedious CAD/CAM/AE software will help accelerate the workflow of engineers, architects, draftsmen. Time is money in construction and product design/prototyping.Generative AI in CAD, Maya, 3D Studio Max have long-term potential in the $148 billion/year video games and movie ($43 billion/year) industries. I can rent Fusion 360 for one year for $495. Using the generative AI, I could possibly automatically and quickly create 10,000 commercial 3D environmental video game assets. I can then monetize these AI-generated assets via Shutterstock (SSTK), Adobe Stock, and Unity Marketplace.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Source: VentureDeal Venture Capital DatabaseAccording to a market research report by Technavio, the global construction management software market is projected to grow to $1.8 billion by 2022.The main factor driving expected market growth is the increasing requirement for large-scale project management.The builders and contractors segment accounted for the largest share of growth - 46% of industry revenue in 2017.Major vendors that provide construction management software solutions include:Autodesk disclosed the acquisition price as approximately $875 million in cash, which will be paid for with cash on hand and a short-term loan.Management expects PlanGrid to generate 2020 ARR (Annual Recurring Revenues) of $100 million, so the deal was priced at approximately an 8.75x price/sales multiple. While not cheap, this multiple is not unreasonable for a well-known software in the sweet spot for Autodeskâs requirements.ADSK said it also expects the deal to âbe slightly dilutive to profitability and cash flow. Inclusive of the transaction, the company [Autodesk] is maintaining its free cash flow goal for the year.âA review of the firmâs most recent10-Q filing indicates that as of July 31, 2018, Autodesk had $1.17 billion of cash, equivalents, and marketable securities.Free cash flow during the six months ended July 31, 2018, was a negative ($10.3 million).Autodesk is acquiring PlanGrid to beef up its construction software capabilities with general contractors.PlanGrid has approximately 12,000 customers and 120,000 paid users via its software-as-a-service system.ADSK plans to integrate PlanGridâs system with its Revit and BIM 360 platform and to roll out the improved offering to domestic U.S. customers as well as international clients.As Andrew Anagnost, Autodesk CEO stated in the deal announcement,Jim Lynch, Autodesk Construction General Manager, added,In the past 12 months, ADSKâs stock price has risen 2.3% vs. the S&P 500 Index 1.2%, as the chart below indicates:Source: Seeking AlphaNotably, ADSK has a nearly consistent recent history of quarterly earnings surprises, as shown below,Source: Seeking AlphaWith the deal for PlanGrid, ADSK is continuing its transition to and focus on a subscription-based, recurring revenue-focused approach to its revenue model.By doing so, the firm will provide greater visibility for shareholders (and analysts) and presumably greater consistency in results, at the cost of less upfront cash flow.Analysts appear to like this transition, and have steadily increased their consensus target price, as shown below,Source: Seeking AlphaWith a current consensus target price of around $163 per share and current stock price of $137 per share as of press time, analysts are saying that ADSK has room to grow.Assuming a prompt deal close and integration, management's rationale appears solid."
4266356,103480,2019-05-24T12:04:12-04:00,"Shares of Autodesk crumbled nearly 10% in after-hours trading after reporting a miss on Q1 revenues and EPS.
        Billings and ARR growth remained strong at 40% and 33% y/y respectively, though the latter decelerated one point from last quarter.
        Autodesk's growth in FY20 is heavily subject to risk in the slowing construction sector, which has become a greater portion of revenues since the acquisition of PlanGrid.
        Autodesk's double-digit forward revenue valuation continues to weigh on the stock's capacity to rally further.","After enjoying a seemingly uninterruptible rally throughout the year, shares of Autodesk (ADSK) have experienced their first real reckoning alongside the release of its Q1 results. Though investors have long praised Autodesk's growth - both organic and acquisition-driven - as it continues to convert the majority of its revenue base onto subscriptions, Autodesk suffered a substantial disappointment this quarter as revenues came in below Wall Street's expectations. Reality has come to bear on Autodesk - at its ~$3 billion annual run rate, Autodesk's ~30% y/y growth rate isn't safe forever.Unsurprisingly, shares of Autodesk shed nearly 10% in after-hours trading as the results were published:The question for investors now, however: has Autodesk fallen far enough? Judging by its ~12x forward revenue valuation (which puts Autodesk in the echelon of highest-valued software stocks, alongside other perennial high-flyers like Adobe (ADBE) and New Relic (NEWR)), I'd say there's plenty more risk on the downside for this stock.Autodesk's tepid guidance is the first indicator that 2019 may not be Autodesk's year. Here's a look at the company's latest guidance update below:Figure 1. Autodesk guidanceSource: Autodesk 1Q20 earnings presentationAutodesk failed to raise its FY20 outlook this quarter, sticking to its original forecast of $3.25-$3.30 billion in revenues, representing a growth range fo 26-28% y/y (six points weaker at the midpoint versus 33% y/y growth this quarter). This disrupts the ""beat-and-raise"" cadence that investors have come to expect of growth stocks like Autodesk (and in fact, Autodesk didn't manage to beat nor raise this quarter). Wall Street had expected $3.29 billion in revenues, higher than the $3.275 billion midpoint of Autodesk's range. There are real risks to be wary of as we digest Autodesk's poor growth forecast. The major red flag here is China. Widespread sentiment has it that China, and particularly its construction sector, is expected to see a substantial economic slowdown. The recent noise around tariffs and the escalating tensions between the White House and China certainly aren't helping, either. Autodesk is a well-globalized company, with Asia-Pacific revenues comprising a substantial 20% of total revenues. Any material slowdown in China will pose a serious headwind to top-line results. Common wisdom has it that software companies are among the least exposed to trade tensions. After all, tariffs only affect hard imports like farm goods and semiconductor chips - but in this case, Autodesk's reliance on the construction industry does produce a correlation. Construction, in fact, has been one of Autodesk's key strategic priorities, and the company doubled down on construction with its ~$1 billion purchase of PlanGrid.Figure 2. Autodesk construction strategySource: Autodesk 1Q20 earnings presentationConstruction isn't just facing headwinds in China; it's a global risk. U.S. residential construction, in particular, is another sore spot. The U.S. Census Bureau just reported that new-home sales fell in April, due in part to a shortage of inventory and insufficient new construction. The key point here: Autodesk's disappointing guidance ranges isn't just a reflection of management's conservatism, but bona fide macro risks in the global economy. As a software vendor that derives a good portion of its revenues from infrastructure and construction companies, it wouldn't be surprising to see Autodesk's billings pull back. Note also that Autodesk has a fairly aggressive billings growth target of 50-53% y/y this year (the nominal range is $4.05-$4.15 billion), which the company may be hard-pressed to meet. Let's now parse Autodesk's Q1 earnings results in greater detail. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 3. Autodesk 1Q19 resultsSource: Autodesk 1Q19 earnings releaseRevenues grew 33% y/y to $707.8 million, missing Wall Street's expectations of $703.2 million (+32% y/y) by a point. billings, fortunately, painted a stronger picture - up 40% y/y to $798 million, clocking in a first-quarter record:Figure 4. Autodesk billings trendsSource: Autodesk 1Q20 earnings presentationScott Herren, Autodesk's CFO, additionally noted that Autodesk performed well on renewals. He reported that the company's net retention rate stayed within the target range of 110-120%, driven by better-than-expected renewals from a cohort of customers that bought into Autodesk at a promotional rate three years back. Per his prepared remarks on the Q1 earnings call:What is disappointing, however, is the rate of deceleration in Autodesk's ARR growth - which, for a company whose narrative focuses almost entirely on subscriptions now, is a huge blow. Total ARR grew 33% y/y to $2.83 billion, as shown in the chart below:Figure 5. Autodesk ARR trendsSource: Autodesk 1Q20 earnings presentationThis represents one point of deceleration from 34% y/y growth in Q4. However, when we account for the fact that organic ARR growth was only 29%, the story becomes much worse. Autodesk completed its purchase of PlanGrid in December, and expects the acquisition to contribute three points of ARR growth in FY20. It contributed four in Q1 - so on a net basis, organic ARR slowed down by five points this quarter. On the margin side, though Autodesk managed to drive substantial improvements to both gross and operating margins, the company still missed Wall Street's earnings targets. Pro forma gross margins rose two points to 91% (a sky-high number) from 89% in the year-ago quarter, while pro forma operating margins saw a 13-point jump from 5% in 1Q19 to 18% this quarter. You'll recall that Autodesk incurred heavy expenses last year in laying off 13% of its workforce, and has begun to reap the cost benefits of its slim-down this year.In spite of these margin gains, Autodesk's pro forma EPS of $0.45 still missed Wall Street's mark of $0.47. The double whammy of a revenue and EPS shortfall - alongside a disappointing guidance outlook - put a huge damper on Autodesk shares. I remain fundamentally positive on Autodesk and its positioning in the software landscape - Autodesk is without a doubt the best-in-breed vendor for CAD tools, and the gold standard by which all engineers are trained in college. That being said, the company is facing substantial macro headwinds in the coming year, with twin risks of a slowing construction sector and economic chaos in China. In light of these risks, Autodesk's 12x forward revenue valuation appears rich, especially at a time when the market is pulling back from frothy growth stocks. Even after we account for Autodesk's post-earnings pullback, the stock is still up nearly 25% year-to-date, nearly doubling the performance of the S&P500. I'm inclined to stay on the sidelines until a better price avails itself."
4234809,104099,2019-01-22T15:57:40-05:00,"The shift in business model makes comparability challenging, but, as of now, the company is expensive on a price to cash flow basis.I think investors would be wise to sell shares now, given that there's far more risk than reward present.That said, the crowd is manic, so I offer a way to ride this wave at much lower risk.","Over the past year, the shares of Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) are up about 21%. I think investors would be wise to sell at these levels as there's more downside than upside ahead for the company in my view. I'll go through my reasoning below by looking at the financial history here and by looking at the stock itself. I'll also comment on the strange fetishization of AAR. The manic crowd seems to love this stock, though, so it would be foolhardy to short it. For those interested in remaining long, I think call options are an obvious way to reduce risk. Given that investing is about preserving capital, I think investors would be wise to sell the shares and buy a proxy call option. This strategy entails getting most of the manic upside at far less risk.Before getting into the financial analysis proper, I must acknowledge the problems of comparability here. In February 2016, the company ceased selling new perpetual licenses of most individual software products, and that obviously makes comparability with prior periods challenging. The company has transitioned away from selling a mix of perpetual and term limit licenses, and now sells based on a subscription model. During the first three years of the transition, financial performance is obviously impacted as more revenue is recognized ratably, rather than upfront.Because of this disruptive change, many investors give the company a ""pass"", as it moves to a lower revenue, lower margin model. In my view, we haven't enough information to see how the future of this subscription model will play out for the firm, which obviously magnifies the risk.A quick review of the financial history here demonstrates the (hopefully) short-term pain associated with this change. For example, over the past five years, revenue, gross profit, and cash from operations have declined at a CAGR of 2%, 4%, and 263% respectively. Five years ago, the company sported earnings per share of $1, and the most recent annual figure is a loss of $2.58. I've looked at hundreds of financial statements over the past year, and I can't remember one that ""boasted"" such poor trends. Some investors may take heart in the fact that shares outstanding have dropped at a CAGR of about 1% over the past five years. While I generally like to see companies buying back stock, I really don't like it when a company retires stock at what is arguably a premium price. Of course, you have to assume my conclusion to agree with me on this point, but I think buying back stock at these multiples is a waste of investor capital.One series that is showing a very positive trend is stock-based compensation. Per employee stock-based compensation has grown at a CAGR of about 11% over the past five years.Source: Company filingsI'm willing to admit when I don't understand something. One of the things that's baffling to me is the fetishization of subscription revenues, and the idea that we should pay a premium for same. Investors and analysts make much of the fact that Autodesk's revenue is based on a subscription. This allows some of them to make the (in my view) ludicrous claim that the stock is cheap (!). What's interesting about this is that AAR is nothing more and nothing less than revenue that is... recurring. It seems that the ""going concern"" assumption from accounting class has been spruced up into something near magical, and we should all be impressed. For example, a railroad with a customer that buys transportation services every year won't receive a premium for its revenues. While it's true that the transportation leviathan has an unassailable moat, the giant transportation machine can't classify its revenues as ""subscription"", so it's not given the same premium as companies like Autodesk.To offer a thorough analysis, I must also review the stock itself as a thing distinct from the underlying business. This is because an uninspiring business like this one might still be a good investment if the price is right. If we can buy even a money loser like this below intrinsic value, we'll likely do well. The problem is that the shares here are quite expensive.Source: GurufocusA price to free cash flow of over 370 is the definition of expensive in my view. I think that the more an investor pays for a stream of future cash flows, the lower will be their subsequent returns.Although I think the shares are badly overpriced, I must acknowledge that it's generally a bad idea to bet against the crowd. Although I think they're naive for doing so, ""analysts"" are touting this stock. They influence the crowd, and that drives prices. A central premise of my investing strategy, though, is to buy with as little risk as possible. With that in mind, I think investors would be wise to replace every lot of their shares with a call option. As of this writing, the last price on Autodesk July calls with a strike of $140 (i.e. at the money) was $14.55. These would give the holder of the call most of any continued mania-driven upside while only exposing about 10% of the capital. In my view, this asymmetric risk-reward opportunity is too great for a current shareholder. If you are right in your bullish thesis, and the shares drive higher, you'll capture most of that upside. If you are mistaken and the shares drop, you'll be harmed far less.I think the shares of Autodesk have been driven higher on the back of an unproven business model shift. The financial performance is obviously less good now than it was years ago. While there's no significant proof that it'll work, investors seem optimistic about the changing revenue model. They may be correct to think this way, but there's insufficient evidence for me to join them. For those who are much more optimistic than me, I would strongly recommend avoiding the shares in favor of the call options listed. These give most of the upside at far less downside. Given that investing is as much about minimizing risk as it is maximizing returns, I think calls are the way to go in this case."
4255244,103480,2019-04-18T12:13:19-04:00,"Since the beginning of the calendar year, shares of Autodesk have jumped 33%, making it one of the strongest performers among large-cap software stocks.The company has certainly merited a rally, having performed incredibly well in Q4 with acceleration in revenue and ARR growth.Autodesk has largely completed its subscription transition, however, so the uplift from that catalyst has expired for 2019.In addition, Autodesk's focus on cyclical sectors such as manufacturing and construction (especially with its ~$1 billion purchase of PlanGrid) puts it at greater recessionary risk.","Autodesk (ADSK), the large-cap software publisher best known for its CAD tools that help engineers test virtual designs, spent much of 2018 in the dumps. A company-wide restructuring that laid off thousands of workers and a fear that Autodesk would begin to peel off revenues as it transitioned to a subscription-based model put the stock on the skids for most of the year.Ever since the market-wide rally that has taken hold in 2019, however, Autodesk's stock has come roaring back. In the year-to-date, shares of Autodesk are up 33% - doubling the performance of the S&P 500, and still vastly beating the broad software stock index (IGV) by more than ten percentage points.Data by YChartsThere's certainly merit in Autodesk's year-to-date stock surge. The company has successfully executed on a number of strategic priorities, including and especially its transition to a subscription-based model. The market has generously rewarded ""legacy"" software companies like Adobe that have managed to completely uproot their customer bases and convert them to a subscription model, and Autodesk's move to do just that will pay dividends in the future through a revenue base that's now almost completely recurring. On top of that, the company has been aggressively pushing into new markets and verticals to expand its TAM - per the company's latest Investor Day update, Autodesk estimates its global TAM at $59 billion. If we take the company's estimate at face value, then Autodesk's projection for ~$3.3 billion in revenues barely scratches 5% of the total available market opportunity.The slide below, taken from Autodesk's Q4 earnings deck, highlights the company's strategic priorities over the past year and its progress to date:Figure 1. Autodesk key prioritiesSource: Autodesk Q4 earnings materialsThere are a few financial results from Autodesk's fourth quarter that are worth highlighting as well. Showcasing the strength of Autodesk's subscription transition, the company achieved 34% y/y growth in ARR in the fourth quarter:Figure 2. Autodesk ARR growthSource: Autodesk Q4 earnings materialsNote that this 34% y/y growth represents three points of acceleration over Q3's growth rate of 31% y/y. For a company with a ~$3 billion ARR base, any amount of sequential acceleration is incredibly impressive. And due to the fact that Autodesk's ARR is theoretically ""revenue forever"" (as long as churn rates don't suddenly increase), Autodesk's ARR growth is far more important than actual revenue growth (which, unsurprisingly, also beat estimates in Q4 - clocking in at $737.3 million, or +33% y/y versus Wall Street's expectations at +28% y/y).Note as well that Autodesk exited the fourth quarter reporting a record quarter for Billings, clocking in at well over $1 billion and up 39% y/y. A fourth-quarter Billings spike is normal for both Autodesk and most software companies (IT executives tend to burn through remaining fiscal-year budgets in the months of November and December), but this year's uptick is far more pronounced than in years past, setting Autodesk up for strong revenue growth in FY20:Figure 3. Autodesk billingsSource: Autodesk Q4 earnings materialsThere's no doubt that these are all strong indicators for Autodesk. But in my view, a 33% year-to-date rally has already appropriately priced in all these strengths. I'm a former bull who is now concerned by Autodesk's valuation, especially as the Street has incredibly high expectations for the company against an uncertain macro backdrop. In my view, despite recent enthusiasm for Autodesk shares, investors would do well to start locking in gains and investing elsewhere.It's unsurprising that shares of Autodesk have reached all-time highs, and in the process of doing so, the company's valuation has stretched faster than its fundamental performance has improved.At present, Autodesk's share price of ~$170 indicates a market cap of $37.43 billion. After netting out $954 million of cash and $2.09 billion of long-term debt (a net debt position of $1.14 billion), Autodesk's enterprise value is $38.57 billion.Here's how that stacks up against the company's targets for the coming fiscal year:Figure 4. Autodesk FY20 guidanceSource: Autodesk Q4 earnings materialsThe simplest valuation metric we can use for Autodesk is its P/E ratio, though for Autodesk and most other software companies, it's a blurry measure of true valuation. Against Autodesk's midpoint pro forma EPS estimate of $2.81 for the coming year, the stock trades at a 60.1x forward P/E ratio. Many other software and high-growth technology companies, like Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN), trade at similar P/E ratios, so this isn't too scary. Against the company's free cash flow estimate of $1.35 billion, however, Autodesk's valuation is still inflated at 28.6x EV/FY20 FCF. Compare this to another large-cap software company like Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), which is trading at under 20x FCF:Data by YChartsNote also that Autodesk's FCF target for FY19 implies a quadrupling over FY18 FCF of $310 million. While it's true that FY19's cash flow was heavily impacted by Autodesk's ongoing subscription transition as well as its company-wide restructuring, there's little history to support that Autodesk can actually grow its FCF that quickly in the coming year.Autodesk's revenue multiple is also quite extended. Against the midpoint revenue estimate of $3.275 for FY19, Autodesk trades at a valuation of 11.8x EV/FY20 revenues. For a company expecting sub-30% y/y revenue growth, that seems a bit inflated. Compare that against other software companies with growth in the ~30% range:Data by YChartsBased on where comps are trading, it certainly seems that Autodesk's valuation has reached an upper bound.Apart from valuation, Autodesk's other major concern is purely fundamental. There's no doubt that the company has notched incredible results over the past two quarters, but how long can it continue?Investors should be aware that the lion's share of Autodesk's revenues are tied to cyclical industries. As seen in the chart below, nearly three-quarters of Autodesk's fourth-quarter revenues were derived from manufacturing and construction:Figure 5. Autodesk revenue mixSource: Autodesk Q4 earnings materialsAutodesk has also doubled down on its construction efforts (it listed construction, in fact, as one of its key strategic priorities) through its $875 million acquisition of PlanGrid. While the acquisition is certainly accretive to growth (Autodesk expects the company to contribute $100 million in ARR in FY20, adding about three points of inorganic ARR growth).While residential homebuilding in the U.S. has seen a minor recovery due to lower interest rates, there is certainly room to be concerned about the health of the global economy and particularly the construction sector. We've been hearing about weakness in China's construction sector for months, as economic deceleration and questions of affordability in China's priciest cities (Hong Kong) weigh on builder sentiment. China aside, the global macro picture seems to be slipping as well. In early April, the International Monetary Fund cut its global growth outlook to 3.3% - and this is after already cutting it to 3.5% in January, from a prior October view of 3.7%.We typically think of the software sector as recession-proof. We've seen from prior cycles that revenue declines in software giants such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle (ORCL) are more modest relative to the broader market during economic downturns. However, the same cannot hold true for Autodesk if the majority of its revenues are tethered to cyclical clients. Autodesk's growing focus on manufacturing and construction has been an important source of growth over the past year, but as global growth risks come to the fore, the company may find its churn rates increasing and ARR growth slowing. Viewed from this lens, the company's financial targets to accelerate both revenue and ARR growth in FY20 seems a bit optimistic.There's no doubt that Autodesk has performed extremely well over the past year, but it's unclear whether strong fundamentals can continue in FY20. If global growth continues to stumble and the construction sector's worries continue, there may be spillover into Autodesk's results - its focus on manufacturing and construction makes it one of the most economically-sensitive software stocks in the market.Especially due to the fact that Autodesk has reached all-time highs and notched a stretched valuation, I'm more inclined to lock in gains and stay on the sidelines."
4224624,98236,2018-11-26T18:56:00-05:00,Autodesk continues to show accelerating growth from an ever higher base.The company's pivot to a subscription model is on the cusp of showing impressive headline numbers.The company continues to achieve accelerating growth as a combination of a higher level of subscriber growth compounds the impact of higher revenue per subscription.The company is gaining market share in its home base of CAD.The company is showing even more impressive percentage growth in the construction vertical which is starting to take off at this point.,"Last week, amidst the run-up to Thanksgiving, two substantial IT vendors, Autodesk (ADSK) and Pure (PSTG), reported their results. Once again, the theory that IT demand is flagging was dealt a blow by the evidence. Autodesk shares have responded to a blow-out quarter. But overall, the shares remain at levels that have become more attractive as earnings have grown and the share price has stagnated. Autodesk (ADSK) shares have managed to advance 7% from their recent low, but their recent low was 21% below their recent high. Overall, Autodesk shares have appreciated 25% in 2018, and that's something to give thanks for, given that the appreciation of the software index is now down to 10% for the year.It has been about six months since I last wrote an article on ADSK shares. Since that time, earnings estimates have grown, the ARR growth, the preferred way to measure the sales performance for a company such as this, has shown noticeable acceleration and the company is seeing a sharp acceleration in operating cash flow generation, driven by higher levels of profitability coupled with improvements in the deferred revenue metric.Are Autodesk shares cheap enough for most investors? There are observers who look at the EV/S number, which at over 9X may seem quite high for a company with this level of growth, and look for a better entry point. But those observers are basically not paying attention to the results of this companyâs pivot. The results of the pivot, to be discussed below, are just now becoming evident in the reported numbers with EPS showing substantial increases period by period, and likely to show a dramatic breakout in the coming fiscal year.The company has forecast that it will achieve free cash flow of $1.35 billion in fiscal 2020 (1/31/20) and that it will generate free cash flow of $2.4 billion by fiscal 2023. Given that the current enterprise value for ADSK is $29 billion, the results projected by the company would produce a free cash flow yield of greater than 8%, That would be a significant attainment for a company with the opportunity to maintain 20% growth for years to come and provides substantial appreciation potential that is difficult to identify in other IT names of this size.Is that valuation cheap enough? I think the investment case makes itself with that level of free cash flow generation. Will ADSK reach that level of free cash flow generation within the projected time periods? I believe it will, and part of the balance of this article is an attempt to support that contention. But whatever else is true, the results of the past quarter and the guidance the company supplied last week certainly represent a solid way post on its journey to $2.4 billion of free cash flow.Many investors know of Autodesk as a leader in the CAD/PLM space and of course it is that. But the CAD space is not one that can support the growth and profitability targets of this company unaided. To the extent that Autodesk is known in the broader world, it's because of its AutoCAD franchise. AutoCAD architecture has been around for 20 years now and it has become the industry standard for most drafters who never consider anything else. If readers have an architect in the family, then almost certainly, there is a copy of AutoCAD in the house.Obviously the practice of architecture has seen its ups and downs over the years, and along with that sales of AutoCAD have shown cyclical trends.This being software, and AutoCAD having celebrated its 20th birthday, there are alternatives. SketchUp is said to be very easy to use. On the opposite end of the range there's TurboCAD Pro Platinum. There are freemium products that can be acquired. But looked at on a holistic basis, AutoCAD and its children and siblings have something like an 80% market share.Some years ago, ADSK acquired a company called Revit, which had been developed by Charles River Technology. Revit was one of the pioneers in developing a capability that's today known as BIM (Building Information Modeling.) The company believes that the market for BIM will reach $10 billion over time, up from about $500 million currently. (The results are those compiled by ADSK as opposed to a third party but I have no reason to question the validity.)More recently, ADSK launched BIM 360. The new version of BIM started as an SaaS offering and has made it easier for users to consume the technology at an accelerating rate. The latest version was introduced about one year ago. This is a platform that's tailored for the construction industry and allows users to develop a Business Information Model. It's a process designed to ensure that information loss between a design team, a construction team and a building owner/operator is minimized.BIM 360 growth showed steep acceleration last quarter, even compared to fiscal Q2, based on the commentary from the companyâs conference call. Overall new cloud subscribers climbed from 31k in Q2 to 53k in this just reported quarter and most of that increase is coming from the growth in BIM subscriptions. ADSK doesnât break down its revenues or ARR into buckets based on specific product lines, and I suppose it's reasonable to expect that this will not change in the future. That said, overall cloud ARR grew 36% last quarter and much of that growth - perhaps the preponderance of that growth, is coming from the BIM platform. Some larger and better-known names in the construction industry including AECOM (ACM), Arcadis, Swinerton and Layton have begun to adopt the new platform. A large Japanese win last quarter was Daiwa House, a business that sells prefabricated homes in east Asia and has a goal to extend their geographic footprint. Daiwa is sort of a poster child for ADSK in that it uses AutoCAD, Revit and BIM 360 as well as Inventor.I think many readers are not totally aware of the potential ADSK has in its construction software business. I do not want to suggest that PLM or CAD arenât growth opportunities for ADSK, but they are not of the magnitude that will take this company to the next level. It's the construction management space that's likely to be the most significant growth driver for this company over the next several years.As part of the recent earnings release, the company announced its intention to acquire PlanGrid as part of its focused investment in this area. I suppose PlanGrid might be characterized as a mid-sized acquisition for a company of the scale of ADSK. From a financial perspective, PlanGrid is forecast to add about 3% to revenues in fiscal year 2020 and it will probably be slightly dilutive in terms of margins.That said, PlanGrid has been a competitor of BIM to a greater or lesser extent and there are substantial revenue synergies that will be realized, I believe. The consideration for PlanGrid was $850 million, or an EV/S of around 8X on the revenue that ADSK management believes will come from that entity over the coming year. But it seems likely that a reasonable expectation will be for quite a bit more revenue growth than that, based on less competition in the space and on the ability to develop a combined offering. (I have linked to some comparison between BIM and PlanGrid which might provide those users interested with a pictograph of the competition between the two vendors.)PlanGrid, as a company, is just a few years old at this point, and has focused on synchronizing construction files in real-time over wi-fi and mobile networks. It's basically used on job sites and it currently has 120k paid users. It puts ADSK into a market space where it has not had an offering, and is likely to enhance the consumption of other ADSK construction software products by current PlanGrid customers.There are quite a number of BIM 360 alternatives although interestingly PlanGrid is listed in most of the studies including the one I have linked to here as being the most highly regarded BIM 360 alternative. To the extent that the survey is accurate, then the synergies that will develop from this acquisition are substantially underappreciated at this point - the benefits of buying oneâs principle competitor transcend just adding the revenue of the acquired party.One of the major issues regarding investing in ADSK that often perturbs certain commentators as well as other stakeholders is the risk of cyclicality in what has been a very cyclical business. Certainly the historical record is replete with just how cyclical demand can be in the CAD space - CAD is, after all, used to design products and demand for that is tied to the industrial economy. I think rather than me imposing or suggesting my own point of view in this discussion, it's better by far to let a vendor contribute his/her own impressions of how the market is evolving. And thus we find this comment from ADSKâs CFO Scott Herren: ""Yes. Sterling, we are not seeing any impact on macro at this point, itâs something that obviously I think everyone is looking very closely for. Weâve been watching since the beginning of the year, frankly, to see if thereâs any effect in the UK or across the northern Europe from Brexit. Weâre not seeing that, weâre not seeing it in demand. Weâre not seeing it in pipeline build. Weâve also been watching very carefully with the trading tariff situation, the way itâs escalated over the last couple of months, weâre not seeing any impact there. There is the anecdotal here and there, weâre not seeing any impact on demand and weâre not seeing any impact on pipeline build at this point. So, to this point the demand environment still remains robust and from what we can see it will continue that way.âThere have been more than a few posts on this site and articles in business publications and business newspapers about chances for a recession. And if readers believed a recession was impending or might be likely, I can think of investments other than ADSK that will be better aligned with that kind of expectation. But I have to say that the plethora of articles and doomsayers and economic savants calling for a recession simply donât adduce any evidenceâ¦ not colorful charts or pictographs or correlations but evidence that users are starting to slow their growth in IT spending.Anyone who has followed this space well knows the magic words that will be spoken, i.e. more levels of approvals, less discretionary spending authority, elongated decision making. There are many different ways that companies have to signal that the economy is hurting their business. But this is exactly the opposite of that.This is what the CEO Andrew Anagnost had to say about macro issues during this late conference call. âSo really itâs not affecting their ability to execute on projects relative to their competition. So theyâre still investing in technology from our side because they are all seeing the same kind of small impact in their material costs, but itâs not translating into any kind of impact on our business because the people have to get their job done.âBeyond the comments about the macro, it seems likely that Fusion 360, the Autodesk solution that runs in the cloud for CAD/CAM, is chipping away in terms of building a strong market share. Overall, the company reported growth of 20% in its manufacturing space in what it calls its products family, which doubled the growth it reported in the prior quarter. Autodesk reports lots of numbers - and then doesnât report some numbers that might be of particular interest to observers - but I'm quite convicted that a 20% growth in products is substantially faster than the market as a whole and is clearly greater than the companyâs longer-term plans for growth in this space. (Some CAD is obviously sold as part of what ADSK calls an enterprise business agreement - but just by definition it's impossible for anyone to determine how much of an EBA can be assigned to CAD or to other ADSK offerings.)I do not know that I could provide readers with an overall guide as to why ADSK is seeing the kind of market share gains it has recently achieved. I did try to write on the subject in past articles on ADSK. For those interested in the subject there are blogs written by SIs, primarily, that identify advantages and disadvantages between the 3 best-known public competitors in the space. But it seems that ADSK is growing at rates about two times as fast as its well-known public competitors, PTC (PTC) and Dassault (OTCPK:DASTY). And that advantage seems to get larger based on the size of user - ADSK appears to be winning the mind share battle among the largest CAD users.I do not propose to try to review all of the numbers that ADSK presents. I think that most readers simply need to see is that this company reported growth of 33% in ARR at its scale last quarter to determine the scope of the blowout in the numbers just reported by this company. But that said, some readers may crave more quantitative support for my positive outlook on the shares - OK a bit of ""LOL"" there. But digging a bit deeper, there are a few numbers that interested me.Many observers of ADSK still look at the number for net subscription adds. There are reasons not to focus on that metric. But this quarter did happen to see a strong 252k increase in total subscription plan users - a number that includes both what the company calls M2S as well as product users. The company continues to migrate its installed base of maintenance customers to a subscription plan, albeit at an uneven rate, and this is a major factor in that metric. Importantly, about 30% of new subscribers coming from maintenance agreements have been upgrading from individual product support to support for what is called an industry collection.The company saw an increase of 17% in ARPS (annual revenue per subscriber) last quarter. Obviously that's not a sustainable cadence, nice as it would be for shareholders. Some of the reported growth in ARPS is a function of mix and some of the growth comes from tweaking the pricing models and providing a lower level of discounting.The company also was able to sign 50% more EBAs in the quarter compared to a year earlier. Some of that success is the success of Fusion 360 in terms of its competitive positioning. Again, it isnât possible for EBA growth to remain at 50% for any substantial period - it's simply that both the market was strong for CAD and ADSK is executing/gaining share - your choice as to what is exactly happening.Obviously, there's an enormous difference between the companyâs YTD cash flow and its forecast of $1.35 billion in fiscal 2020 free cash flow. Most of that difference is going to come from an improvement in profitability, now that most of the transition to a subscription model is complete. But the rapid increase in EBAâs is going to generate very substantial increases in deferred revenue balances, both short and long term.The improvement in cash flow both recently and into the future is not and will not be a function of any substantive changes in stock-based comp. Stock based comp is declining in absolute terms and has reached levels of only 10% of revenues. The cash flow story will be one of growth in EBAs and growth in deferred revenues. It's always a bit difficult to handicap the cadence of a target that's moving rapidly. My belief, however, is that ADSK will be able to noticeably exceed $500 million in free cash flow this year, the first positive attainment for that metric since the start of the companyâs transition.At this point in many articles I write, I go through an analysis of expected future growth and the outlook for spending and margins. With regards to this company, those kinds of details are very straightforward. It seems as though revenue growth is almost certain to be well above 20%/year for the next several years for reasons cited earlier in the article. Just how much above is not really knowable at this point. Last quarter saw revenues grow at 28% as reported. The company is forecasting that revenue growth next quarter will be 28% and the consensus growth for fiscal 2020 is now 27%. I would not be terribly surprised if growth was a bit faster than forecast simply given the comments from the CFO regarding the pipeline of EBAs for this current quarter. I would also be unsurprised to see top line growth reach 30% next year given the prospective merger with PlanGrid and its strong potential revenue synergies. The re acceleration of ARR growth to 33% from 28% last quarter and the companyâs commentary about its outlook seemingly ensure that growth expectations will continue to rise. And because revenue growth is so fast and spend increase is so low, the FCF margins are almost certain to accelerate to 40% or higher next year.That kind of performance seems highly likely to be recognized by investors. The goal the company has to increase free cash flow to $2.4 billion by fiscal 2023, basically a little over three years from now, may seem ambitious to some. However, it appears no more ambitious to this writer than the goal ADSK had of reaching $1.35 billion in free cash flow when it started its transition. The company has gotten a substantial benefit from the transition and from the ability of its enterprise users to move their consumption models to Enterprise Business Agreements. The impact of the companyâs product cycles, while not easy to measure given the data available, suggests material market share gains have been achieved in both the CAD and architecture space, with the architecture space now starting to drive overall growth to a higher level. The company has maintained spend discipline to an extent rarely seen in most companies that are maintaining this level of growth.While the EV/S at over 9X is certainly noticeably above the average for a vendor with mid-20% growth, the value of this investment will lie in its ability to see very high levels of free cash margin that are rarely achieved by other high-growth IT vendors. Beyond next year, ADSK is forecasting that its free cash flow will grow by another 22%-23% in the following three years on a compound basis. I think that kind of performance will be more than adequate for the shares to create positive alpha for holders and I think the business model, the product strategy and sales execution suggest that the company is more likely to exceed that kind of target. At some point, I think investors will realize that ADSK shares are a veritable bargain, highly likely to produce positive alpha"
4224040,103480,2018-11-22T04:28:50-05:00,"Autodesk's shares jumped nearly 10% after reporting strong Q3 results.Aside from beating Wall Street's revenue and EPS estimates for the current quarter, Autodesk also managed to accelerate its ARR growth to 31% y/y.Growth in ARR is Autodesk's single most important metric ever since it embarked on its transition to cloud.The stock still remains more than 15% down from peak value.","While many other technology companies are showing signs of sluggishness on the top line, no such thing is happening at Autodesk (ADSK). The iconic vendor of CAD (computer-aided design) software is growing faster than ever, buoyed by a successful push into a cloud-based consumption model that has taken the bite out of Autodesk's traditionally expensive upfront install costs. Further pursuing growth into new markets, Autodesk also announced a splashy $875 million all-cash acquisition of PlanGrid, bolstering its push into the construction vertical.Needless to say, things are going well for Autodesk. Barely less than a year ago, Wall Street was concerned over Autodesk's plan to lay off 13% of its workforce - a plan that has slowly been put in motion over the course of 2018. I argued back then that Autodesk was effecting those layoffs from a position of strength - and now, we can see that Autodesk is both accelerating its growth rate and boosting its free cash flows.Like the rest of the technology sector, Autodesk suffered a gripping pullback in the months of October and November, briefly entering a bear market before its Q3 earnings release put it back over the top. Shares are still down about 15% from peaks reached last quarter, and in my view, Autodesk's strong execution in Q3 and bullish forward guidance give it the perfect catalysts to make a rapid, full rebound.ADSK data by YChartsThe recent pullbacks have created buying opportunities in many perpetually expensive cloud names - Autodesk is one of the prime examples, along with Adobe (ADBE), DocuSign (DOCU), and Alteryx (AYX). In my view, investors should snap up as many shares of these stocks as possible (many of which are still trading in bear market territory, down 20-30% from recent peaks) before growth returns in vogue.Ever since Autodesk made the decision (rather late, relative to peers) to switch its business model to cloud, ARR became the most important metric to watch. For non-tech investors, ARR stands for annualized recurring revenue - which is essentially the sum of what each of Autodesk's subscription contracts is worth in a year. Measuring the growth in ARR is a better way of tracking the growth of Autodesk's cloud business compared to looking at a single quarter's revenues.Last quarter, Autodesk's total ARR hit $2.35 billion, up 28% y/y. During this quarter, however, Autodesk added $170 million of ARR to $2.53 billion, which is up 33% y/y. After we net out the effects of Autodesk's accounting change to ASC 606, the bona fide growth is 31% y/y. The three-point acceleration in ARR is one of the key reasons that Autodesk's stock popped ~10% after releasing Q3 results.The significance of this ARR is that it fully supports Autodesk's bullish guidance outlook for FY19. This year (in which one quarter is remaining), Autodesk guided to finishing out FY19 with revenues of $2.53-2.54 billion in revenues - which is now the size of Autodesk's ARR base.Figure 1. Autodesk FY19 guidanceSource: Autodesk investor relationsWhen Autodesk charts out its growth plan for FY20 (we're expecting the guidance to come out alongside next quarter's results), the company already has $2.53 billion of ARR locked in. Any new business is extra, plus any revenues from PlanGrid. This gives Autodesk an extremely strong platform with which to seek incremental revenues.The problem with the Autodesk of old is that it was hard to convince customers to become repeat buyers, so Autodesk would try to drum up as much recurring businesses as it could through maintenance and support - which invariably carry lower gross margins than subscription/SaaS revenues, as is the case across the software industry. Now, when Autodesk's core software generates recurring revenues as well, the company doesn't have to worry about keeping its revenue base full.Scott Herren, Autodesk's CFO, also noted that retention rates remained sky-high, per his prepared remarks on Autodesk's earnings call:It's also worth noting that this quarter, Autodesk generated revenues of $660.9 million, up 28% y/y as reported (+26% y/y on an ASC 605 basis). This soared past Wall Street's expectations of $641 million, or +24% y/y on an as-reported basis, by a wide four-point margin. Recall that it was barely a year ago that Autodesk's movement of customers from license deals to cloud caused flat year-over-year revenue comparisons - now, the company is firmly back into growth territory.Figure 2. Autodesk revenues, 3Q18Source: Autodesk investor relationsNote also that last quarter, Autodesk generated just 22% y/y revenue growth - so alongside a three-point acceleration in ARR, the company also managed a four-point acceleration in revenue growth.Aside from top-line revenue and ARR strength, Autodesk also achieved meaningful bottom-line wins as well this quarter.For starters, gross margin saw an enormous improvement up to 89.1% this quarter, up 410bps from 85.0% in 3Q17. Autodesk already had one of the highest margin profiles in the SaaS sector, a lead that has now just expanded. The major driver here is Autodesk's transition to SaaS - by reducing its mix of lower-margin maintenance revenues, Autodesk has greatly boosted its unit economics.The company's cost-down efforts have also helped to boost Autodesk's profits, as promised at the tail end of calendar 2017. Pro forma operating expenses grew just 7% y/y to $504.9 million, despite the much quicker pace of revenue growth. Overall, pro forma operating expenses represented 76.3% of revenues, down sharply from 91.6% in the year-ago quarter.Aside from producing a strong pro forma EPS beat ($0.09, versus analyst estimates of $0.07), Autodesk was also able to drive material improvement in its cash flows.Year-to-date, Autodesk has produced $68.3 million of operating cash flows - up from a loss of roughly equivalent size in the year-ago period:Figure 3. Autodesk cash flowsSource: Autodesk investor relationsThough the cash flow margin is still slim, continued gross margin improvements and an increased rotation away from maintenance and support revenues should continue to boost Autodesk's cash flow profile heading into FY20.Autodesk has continued to show that it is executing admirably on both growth and profitability initiatives. Investors should hold Autodesk for the long term. It has virtually cornered the CAD market, and its shift to cloud allows it to extract more value from customers over time while near-90% gross margin will eventually allow Autodesk to become a hugely cash-flowing business, in the same league as other companies of its size like Workday (WDAY) and Red Hat (RHT). With shares still off from peak values and quickly positioning themselves for a rebound, investors should look for a buying opportunity in this stock."

Including the current funding, Rhumbix is believed to have raised $28.6 million in investment since inception. (Crunchbase)ADSK is investing in the company to combine Rhumbixâ system with Autodeskâ BIM 360 construction project management platform.As Jim Lynch, VP Construction Products, Autodesk stated in the deal announcement,Autodesk has been a moderately active corporate investor in technology startups, investing in at least 14 companies since the beginning of 2015.The graphic below shows a sample of its recent investment history by various metrics (click to enlarge):(Source: VentureDeal Database)The data indicates that Autodesk has invested primarily in the industries of Electronics, Enterprise IT and Digital Media.Additionally, most of the firmâs investments have been at the early stages of Seed or Series A; geographically, ADSK has focused its efforts on California and Massachusetts.Autodesk has only made one disclosed investment so far in 2018 but was consistently active in the years 2015 through 2017.Notably, it recently acquired one of its investee companies, Assemble Systems. This deal was also in the construction workflow technology sector, so it appears ADSK management is focusing its efforts on creating efficiencies in construction project management.The Rhumbix relationship provides Autodesk with a mobile-first piece of the construction site data collection and management process. Rhumbix is essentially the âtop of the funnelâ for maximizing the value of obtaining real-time data as it occurs in the field.I expect to see additional moves by Autodesk, whether by acquisition or investment, as it continues to build out its construction management offering to prospects and customers."
4202036,103480,2018-08-25T03:26:39-04:00,"Autodesk shares touched a new all-time high after Q2 results blasted past Wall Street's expectations.Revenue growth accelerated from the prior quarter, and losses slimmed dramatically. The company's cloud transition is bearing immense fruit.Subscription ARR more than doubled from the year-ago quarter, while the subscriber base grew more than 10% from the end of Q1 alone.The transition to cloud-based revenue and away from maintenance contracts has also dramatically improved Autodesk's margins.A restructuring that Autodesk embarked upon late last year is also producing tremendous cost discipline, and Autodesk's CFO expects spend to remain flat for the remainder of the year.","Over the course of the past year, Autodesk (ADSK) has put in a lot of work in converting its customer base away from perpetual license deals and into recurring subscription contracts. Autodesk is one of the last major SaaS companies to embark upon the shift, and it hasn't always been easy - for much of last year, revenue growth was negative as Autodesk slowly weaned itself off large upfront deals, and many investors doubted the company could pull off the transition successfully.Now, it seems the company is beginning to enjoy the fruits of its cloud transition. Revenue growth has accelerated yet again and pushed beyond 20% in stark contrast to an FY17 where Autodesk posted negative comps in almost every quarter. Autodesk has also taken advantage of the higher margins inherent in subscription deals to cut its losses and improve its margins.Rightly so, Autodesk shares surged more than 15% after reporting Q2 results, touching new all-time highs:ADSK data by YChartsI wrote last quarter that Autodesk's post-Q1 pullback would be short-lived - at the time, the company had slumped to below $130. Even now at all-time highs, however, I believe Autodesk has tremendous upside left. The company is back into growth mode, and its subscription metrics still show plenty of room for improvement.Stay long on Autodesk. A raised guidance outlook is yet another indicator that the company hasn't slowed down. I've long compared Autodesk to Adobe (ADBE) in terms of returns potential - after Adobe's cloud transition began showing signs of promise, its shares multiplied. Autodesk, in my view, is still in the early phases of its stock rally. This is a company with a top-tier product and very few meaningful competitors in its space. Autodesk is the software of choice for training engineers in universities as well as practicing engineers and designers - and now, they'll be paying Autodesk monthly fees. The company's prospects have never looked stronger.It's probably needless to say that Autodesk's ARR hit a new record this quarter (when subscription ARR is growing at a ~2x rate, every quarter will produce records). This is Autodesk's most important metric now, as it represents the amount of business that the company has converted to recurring revenues. CEO Andrew Anagnost echoed that view on the earnings call, noting that ""we view ARR is the best proxy for measuring our progress in the overall health of our business.""Total ARR hit $2.35 billion this quarter, up 28% y/y. It's important to note that Autodesk's entire revenue guidance for FY18 is hovering around only $2.5 billion. A $2.35 billion ARR indicates that nearly as much revenues have already been locked in - every other new deal signing becomes solely accretive to the top line. This is the power of a subscription-based model - yes, revenues in the near-term might be smaller, but Autodesk will no longer have to start each year from scratch.Subscription ARR, on the other hand, increased 115% y/y (more than 2x) to $1.68 billion, now representing more than 70% of total ARR. Management noted that this was the sixth time in seven quarters that subscription ARR grew by more than 2x. Total subscriptions also rose 290k to 2.86 million from the first quarter alone. Since the company began pivoting toward subscriptions in 2014 and cutting off perpetual license deals, it has added more than 1.7 million net subscriptions.Autodesk's CEO went on to note that it's focusing its next leg of growth into expansion in the construction vertical, a $10 billion market opportunity. Needless to say, Autodesk's subscription growth phase is not yet over.Here's a look at Autodesk's full Q2 results:Figure 1. Autodesk Q2 resultsSource: Autodesk investor relationsRevenues grew by 22% y/y to $611.7 million, surpassing Wall Street's expectations of $600.0 million (+20% y/y) with a comfortable margin. Even more impressive, Autodesk's billings grew 27% y/y to $605 million. For a company that now hinges on subscriptions, an outpacing of billings growth relative to revenue growth is a good indicator that future quarters' revenues may continue to accelerate.One quote from Autodesk's CFO neatly sums up this quarter's results:One other important point to note here is that the subscription transition isn't all about the top line growth - it has a meaningful impact on margins as well. The shift away from lower-margin maintenance and professional services revenues has put greater emphasis on Autodesk's most profitable revenue stream - subscriptions. GAAP gross margins this quarter hit a sky-high 88.5%, up 370bps from an already-high 85.1% in 2Q17.Moving down to operating costs, we also see that the company's total operating spend on a GAAP basis has only increased 6% y/y to $541.9 million. At the end of last year, Autodesk announced a surprise layoff of ~13% of its workforce and announced its commitment to restructuring the company's headcount - an announcement that at the time caused the stock to crash more than 20% (at the time, Autodesk was trading just slightly over $100 - if only we'd bought more then!). Now a year later, we can see that Autodesk made that call from a position of strength. The layoffs were not indicating a business slowdown, but a renewed commitment to profitability for a company that had been shunning profits to focus on cloud growth for several years.The results are tremendous. Operating losses were cut down to just -$24.7 million this quarter, about a quarter of last year's losses of -$107.6 million. Pro forma EPS of $0.19 also broke positive and beat Wall Street's estimates of $0.16 with 19% upside. In the six months year-to-date, Autodesk has also begun generating positive operating cash flows of $26.4 million again, up from a near-equivalent loss of -$27.3 million in 1H17.One other point is worth mentioning: Autodesk's CFO noted that despite a return to growth, Autodesk still intends to keep strict cost discipline:The company isn't using its accelerated growth as an excuse to grow its spending and hide it behind richer margins - it's focused on delivering profits and cash flow. In my view, Autodesk's rally is still in its early days. Stay long."
4190368,103231,2018-07-26T08:38:53-04:00,The new subscription-based model gives Autodesk a solid base for recurring revenues and long-term sustainable growth.The product portfolio and its cloud services now offer a higher switching cost for customers.Some of the risks currently faced by the company are the lack of profit and the high dependency of its indirect sales channels.,"Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) went through a significant change in early 2018 in terms of growth, marking a turning point after some difficulties, which resulted in its transition to a business model based on subscription contracts. While current revenue remains below the record levels of 2015 and 2016, the company has experienced a renewed demand for its products and an increasing amount of subscription agreements with its customers during the year.Despite the fact that Autodesk benefits from a wide portfolio of products and a strong cash position that can fuel further acquisitions, the stock still holds high levels of uncertainty because the company is not yet profitable. Even though Autodesk presents a strong investment thesis that can materialize in the long term, the company faces risks that must be addressed.Autodesk's main advantage is the wide range of products it offers. The company has been able to position itself as a market leader in the computer-aided design (CAD) market, thanks to its ability to adopt new trends. The company has been able to enhance its product portfolio over the years by means of an aggressive acquisition strategy which has recently been focusing on mobile and social markets. The executives' strategy is to look for small businesses that can easily integrate into the company's products and services, and that offer low integration costs for it.During 2017, the firm acquired several small start-ups, spending a total of $87.0 million, that further complement its cloud and mobile-based offerings. Furthermore, the company continues to hold a strong cash balance, the first quarter of 2018 having ended with $1.3 billion in cash and marketable securities. This capital will allow the company to finance more acquisitions in the middle term and to continue providing its customers with more value by means of this strategy.These recent investments in mobile platforms and cloud technology further consolidate Autodesk's leading position while the company attempts to increase its presence in the construction and manufacturing sectors in an effort to further diversify its revenue. For now, the company is focusing on gaining territory in the cloud market by quickly integrating these technologies into its main products with the most important of them being the Fusion 360 software (Autodesk's 3D CAD, CAM, and the CAE tool), and the BIM 360 software (a 3D model-based product for the design, construction and management of buildings). The company seeks to benefit from a growing adoption of its cloud-based products by its customers since the industry is transitioning from the personal computer to the cloud.In addition to this transition to digital processes, the company has been venturing out to the construction and manufacturing markets with its relatively inexpensive and easy-to-implement products, especially its BIM offerings. This robust collection of products and the value they give to customers are likely to ensure long-term growth as past investments begin to generate tangible benefits. Meanwhile, the company is continuing to move towards its subscription plan and is attempting to increase its revenues in the emerging market as short-term measures to generate top-line growth.Source: Data extracted from filing from the SECAnother one of Autodesk's advantages is its recent adoption of a more attractive model based on recurring revenues. This new model will not only provide the company with sustainable revenue in the long term, but will also give its financial statements more certainty and will provide the company with the possibility of reducing its costs and increasing its margins in the middle term. However, although this business model, based on subscription and consumption-based pricing, promises to be a positive factor for the company, it has taken a toll in the short term, especially during the past two years, given the new changes in revenue recognition.Despite these difficulties, the company seems to be back on the right track now. The double-digit growth reported in the last two quarters was mainly attributed to its recurring revenues as a result of this business model transition. During the first quarter of 2018, the company reported total revenues of $560 million, from which $532 million were recurring revenues. This result now reflects the maturity of the business model since this figure represents a recurring revenue rate of 95%, up from about the mid-50% range in 2016.Source: From Autodesk's 2018 Investor DayLooking forward, the transition of the business model is expected to generate an annualized recurring revenue (ARR) growth rate of 25%, which is based on current trends, and boost cloud subscription growth as well. Executives expect to achieve profitability for the first time in 2020 as the company continues to gain significant momentum in its ARR and benefits from a better, long-term value pricing model.For the past 30 years, Autodesk has been dedicated to creating a strong customer base which has given it a strong competitive advantage against its competitors. This customer base has been reinforced thanks to an active training campaign in educational institutions on the use of 3D animation and visual effects tools created by Autodesk. This approach has reinforced the company's relevance in the CAD industry for several years.Furthermore, the comprehensive product portfolio and the adoption of the new subscription model are further increasing the switching costs for Autodesk's customers. This competitive advantage will most likely continue as customers are being persuaded to change Autodesk's CAD solutions due to the time it takes to learn how to use a new platform, in addition to the impact that implementing a new solution would have on operations in the short term.Although the company's future looks promising, investors must be aware that the company faces certain risks that may negatively affect its results in the near term.The company's main issue has always been its lack of profitability and its uneven revenue growth. In the past, management has used cost-saving programs to improve profitability, although these efforts have been offset by the large number of investments and acquisitions the company has made to boost its growth. Furthermore, Autodesk's recent investments in infrastructure and marketing initiatives to drive its cloud-based offerings are currently weighing down on margins, causing concern in the company's recent results. The company is trying to motivate its clients to transfer from maintenance subscriptions to product subscriptions by offering discounts which, despite having increased the subscription base, has also weighed down on the results. Therefore, these cost restructuring programs have only been temporary corrective measures, and this risk will persist until the company begins reporting organic revenue growth.In addition, some analysts believe that the company's revenue depends on its indirect sales channels to a large extent. This has resulted in risks in the past due to the fact that the majority of its distributors and resellers do not have much capital and have experienced difficulties in times of economic contraction which has affected Autodesk's results. In spite of the efforts to migrate towards a direct distribution model, 70% of the sales reported by the company come from these indirect channels, which results in a costly dependence for the company that has affected its top-line results year after year.Source: From Autodesk's first quarterly report of 2018Overall, as a result of the acquisitions made in recent years, and following the adoption of the new business model, the high stock price now reflects the expectations that investors have placed on Autodesk. Valuations seem to reflect this renewed optimism in the company, leaving little room for further price increases in the short term. While the company seems to be well positioned to generate sustained revenue growth over the next years, its biggest challenge will continue to be to achieve profitability. Meanwhile, the price will maintain a high degree of uncertainty that investors should consider.ADSK PS Ratio (TTM) data by YCharts"
4177035,103480,2018-05-25T01:33:11-04:00,"Autodesk shares slipped after a strong Q1 earnings season, with investors mulling over in-line guidance for Q2.Focusing on Autodesk's actual results, however, shows a company in the midst of a strong transition toward recurring revenues and greater profitability.Subscription ARR doubled from the year-ago period.Autodesk is also making good on its restructuring promises, slicing its operating losses in half.","The theme has been pretty much the same for all of the Q1 earnings season - no matter how strong the earnings, good technology companies have sold off after reporting results. Autodesk (ADSK), the dominant computer-aided design software (CADS) company is no exception. Despite exhibiting double-digit revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, shares still suffered a steep drop-off after the company released its quarter:ADSK data by YChartsDouble-digit growth may be no big deal for most companies in the SaaS software sector, but it is quite an accomplishment for Autodesk, which spent much of the last year in negative y/y territory. The company's near term results have been heavily impacted by its strategic decision to pursue a subscription business model, aligned to the software consumption trends of the current IT environment. Because this shifts large one-time deals away from the present quarter and splits up those revenues over a longer period of time, Autodesk has seen slow or negative growth for quite some time. This quarter and last, however, Autodesk seems to have turned the corner, wherein its sustained subscription accounts are providing enough billings to support a consistent revenue pattern. In fact, Autodesk's subscription growth is probably the most important metric coming out of its Q1 release, and the company has continued the strength it's exhibited over the past several quarters. Subscription ARR (annual recurring revenue, or the total revenue potential of all of its subscription accounts in one year) grew 103% y/y to $1.40 billion. Total ARR, including other Autodesk services that the company considers to be recurring revenue, grew 22% y/y to $2.13 billion.The bottom line on Autodesk stock: shares are probably reacting in a ""buy the rumor, sell the news"" pattern, especially as Autodesk is racing to all-time highs. A pullback in the stock is healthy, but investors should be on the lookout for entry points if the shares keep dropping. Like Adobe (ADBE) during its transition to a SaaS model, Autodesk continues to see an expanded valuation as more and more of its revenues shift into its ARR base. A near-term recovery is nearly inevitable.It's important to get an indication of the sizing of this annual recurring revenue. For FY19, Autodesk's guidance is as follows:Figure 1. Autodesk FY19 guidanceSource: Autodesk investor relationsWith Autodesk's total ARR at $2.13 billion, that essentially means that more than 80% of Autodesk's FY19 guidance of $2.495-$2.545 billion (+22% y/y) is essentially taken care of. This is revenue that Autodesk doesn't have to chase; revenue that is effectively locked in, absent any significant customer churn (which, in the past, has been extremely minimal).The fact that Autodesk also expects to grow its ARR by 28-30% y/y is another strong signal, as ARR growth at that rate would take Autodesk's ARR to above even its FY19 revenue target. As Autodesk more or less reaches the tail end of its cloud transition in the coming year and next year, it's reassuring to see that the company is still forecasting strong ARR and billings growth.Equally important to notice is that Autodesk is forecasting a 150-250bps reduction in spending, at least on a GAAP basis. A couple quarters ago, investors dumped Autodesk stock on fears that its restructuring plan was an admission that circumstances were turning south on Autodesk. Now, and especially in this quarter's results, we can see the beneficial effects of these cost reductions start to kick in.Scott Herren, Autodesk's CFO, said the following on cost management during the quarter's earnings call:In my view, even with the growth continuing at double-digits this quarter, the spending discipline and margin improvements seen in the quarter were much more accretive to Autodesk's bullish narrative. Here's a look at the company's Q1 results:Figure 2. Autodesk Q1 resultsSource: Autodesk investor relationsTotal revenues grew 15% y/y to $560.0 million, with much of that growth focused on recurring revenues, and continuing the strong trend that Autodesk initiated last quarter (in Q4, Autodesk had grown at 16% y/y. The quarter before that, growth had been a mere 5%, and before that, revenue had been in decline). Analysts had only expected $557.4 million in the quarter, or about 60bps lower than Autodesk's actual results.It's important to note also that Autodesk began adopting accounting standard ASC 606 this quarter, as have many other software companies with recurring revenue components. Though the change doesn't have an earth-shattering impact on Autodesk's financials, it's worth noting that the company disclosed it would have grown revenues at 18% y/y if it were still adopting under the old standard.Where I think Autodesk shone this quarter, however, was in its cost management. Gross margin ticked up to 88.2%, improving markedly from an already-high 83.9% in 1Q17. Autodesk's gross margin, hands down, is one of the highest in the software industry - and as the company shifts more of its revenue base into higher-yielding subscriptions and away from services revenue (the ""other"" line), which is waning anyway, this margin strength will continue.Operating expenses, too, showed massive improvements. Despite the 15% y/y revenue growth, Autodesk managed to grow sales and marketing revenues by only 8% y/y to achieve that growth, indicating far improved sales leverage. Research and development, as well as general corporate costs, also saw an 8% and 7% y/y reduction, respectively, consistent with the company's stated intention of restructuring to bring down operating costs. As a result, operating losses slimmed to just -$55.3 million, half of last year's loss of -$119.6 million and representing a near-breakeven operating margin of -9.9%, a marked improvement from -24.7% in the year-ago quarter. Pro forma EPS of $0.06 also beat analyst expectations of $0.03 by a wide margin. The modest top-line beat but strong bottom-line beat indicates that Wall Street hadn't been expecting this level of cost savings from the company.And while Autodesk is a bit too large of a company to still be wallowing in losses, its guidance calling for 150 to 250bps of opex decreases in FY19 points to the hope that the company can hit breakeven very soon.Autodesk shares are taking a much-needed breather after strong year-to-date performance in 2018, but there are no red flags coming out of its Q1 earnings season. In fact, the company's bullish narrative only seems to have gotten stronger, with its subscription ARR growing 2x from 1Q17 and margins improving significantly toward breakeven. More than anything, it's key to understand that Autodesk more or less owns the market for CADS software, and its dominance can't be understated. With the company moving to a recurring revenue base atop much more profitable subscription contracts, it's impossible to see a scenario in which Autodesk shares don't recover from the current blight."
4177934,98236,2018-05-29T19:40:00-04:00,"ADSK was in a group of many IT vendors reporting its Q1 earnings on May 24.Like many companies in that cohort, the results were fine, yet the share price reaction was negative.So far as it goes, and after looking at the adjustments for new accounting rules, the company beat expectations and raised guidance - really!The company is apparently achieving market share growth in its mature segments and is opening up opportunities with some of its newer solutions.The company's shares are actually modestly valued considering its cash flow margins and revenue growth.","May 24, 2018, is not quite a day that will live in infamy, but it is certainly a day that many investors in the IT space would like to forget. Among the casualties of market perceptions of their earnings reports were Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) and 8X8 (NASDAQ:EGHT). Even Veeva (NYSE:VEEV), which struggled to end the day unchanged, saw its valuation compress notably. And then, of course, there was Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), the subject of this article.Autodesk is a company in transition - not from a product/strategic point of view, but in terms of how it offers its products to its customers. It's not really an unusual transition, given that one of its principal rivals PTC (NASDAQ:PTC) has undertaken the same journey with success both operationally and even more in terms of share price appreciation, and that countless other IT vendors are in the midst of switching from a business model that's based on perpetual, on-premise consumption to one that's based in the cloud and involves subscription offerings. In general, investors have been wiling to pay up for new business models - sometimes too much so, in my opinion, but even the shares of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) have achieved their current valuations because of the transition.In addition, like all IT vendors - and others besides - ADSK has adopted ASC 606, an accounting standard that focuses on recognizing both revenues and commissions from multi-year agreements. I personally think ASC 606, and its corollary, ASC 340, are more appropriate standards to use, but their adoption has created a fair amount of confusion in making year-on-year comparisons. Obviously the new accounting standards do not change the business realities, just how they are reported. And for the most part, the changes involved are relatively small. But this company chose not to recast historical information - that election hasn't been uncommon, and because of that, some of the comparisons were skewed at the margin. It was those two factors that led to the so-called mixed quarter, and in turn to the share price pull-back and to the opportunity for investors. In my view, Autodesk had a strong quarter that was almost surely above internal projections in terms of sales execution and final demand. Its product strategy, about which more later is resonating strongly with users. And this is a good time to be selling product design and development software. Is ADSK gaining market share? That's a bit difficult to determine - but the wheels of this companyâs set of solutions sit firmly on the track, and the engine appears to be accelerating.Why all this preface? Well mainly the background best explains why the financial headline writers chose to call the financial results of Autodesk as mixed, and singled out the reduced EPS expectation Autodesk produced for its Q2 earnings as a cause of disappointment. The reality is somewhat different. On an apples to apples basis - one that adjusts for the adoption of ASC 606 and is based on constant currency, ARR (annual recurring revenue) grew by 25% this past quarter. That's certainly not a disappointment - indeed quite the opposite. The companyâs total deferred revenue balance, that includes unbilled but contracted revenue, rose by 24% - again, quite healthy. Billings rose by 12% on an apples to apples comparison. Opex decreased by 1%, again after adjusting for the new accounting standards. These are all numbers that objectively considered were better than expected, or in some cases much better than anticipated, and suggest that ADSK is executing successfully. And all of this suggests that this might be a good opportunity for investors to consider entering - or perhaps re-entering this name at this time.For the record, Autodesk actually reported revenues of $560 million, up 15% year-on-year and consistent with prior First Call consensus expectations. The company reported non-GAAP earnings of $0.06 compared to a year earlier loss and to a prior First Call consensus estimate of $.0.03. It is worth noting, I think, that absent the transition to ASC 606 and ASC 340, the company would have actually reported EPS of $.16, rather than $.06, and had it done. So, I think there is little doubt but that the shares would have appreciated on Friday.Guidance for this current quarter is for revenues of $600 million (growth of 20%) with EPS projected to reach $0.13-$0.16 compared to the prior consensus estimate of $0.19. The company is now forecasting total revenues for the full year of fiscal 2019 (ends 1/31/19) under the new ASC 606 standard of about $2.48 billion at the mid-point with non-GAAP EPS in the range of $0.77-$0.95 and with ARR growth of 28%-30%. The adoption of the ASC 606 standard has reduced revenue expectations for the full year by 2% and the full-year non-GAAP EPS forecast by $0.15.On an apples to apples basis, the companyâs new forecast for revenues is about 2% above the prior consensus, while Autodesk has increased its EPS forecast by $.11/share. Again, there is a lot of noise as to what is an apple, and what is a pear, but the fact is that Autodesk is seeing the future a bit more positively than it had been, and it is not really lowering guidance, except perhaps for this current quarter, although we do not have precise metrics for what expectations for Q2 might have been using the prior accounting standards. The companyâs total deferred revenues grew by 21% as reported and by 24% on an apples to apples basis. Again, that is a very strong number for a company such as this which has been in business quite a long time.Unlike some companies such as Splunk which reported on the same day, Autodesk has not provided a full retrospective view of its results under ASC 606. This does make the comparisons somewhat speculative until the quarter in question is reported. But again, investors should focus on the appropriate fruit and not get themselves off track looking at spurious or irrelevant comparisons. Autodesk reported a strong quarter that beat expectations and it has provided a forecast that is an upside compared to its previous expectations.The company reported negative free cash flow for the quarter compared to a positive results in the year-earlier period. This was primarily a consequence of a very substantial reduction in accounts payable. In addition, the net change in deferred revenues during the quarter as reported was negative. This too was a consequence of the new reporting standard. Autodesk does forecast billings. In Q1 it reported that billings decreased year-on-year. Again, this is a consequence of the new accounting standard which required the company to write off previously deferred revenue. Autodesk billings did increase 12% on an apples-to-apples basis, and that was also better than its prior expectations for that metric.Autodesk does not explicitly forecast free cash flow, although during the call management said it would be positive for the balance of the year. In any event, the companyâs free cash flow forecast is not impacted by the change in the accounting standard. The company has continued to forecast free cash flow of $1.4 billion next year and is still forecasting that it will reach cash flow of $2.4 billion by its fiscal 2023 year which starts in less than four years. That is the likely the primary reason for the companyâs positive share price performance recently and remains the measure, along with ARR growth that's used by many institutions in valuing these shares.I most recently wrote about Autodesk in the middle of last December. Back at that time, the shares were trading at $106 in the wake of what was perceived as a disappointing quarter. It proved to be a decent entry point with the shares up by almost 25% over the past six months compared to the appreciation of 17% over that same span for the IGV. The shares were down 4.5% on Friday in the wake of the quarterly earnings release, and are down 5% from their all-time high. In this case, the quarter was ânoisyâ but quite supportive of the recent progress of the shares, when considered carefully.But the real issue is how does this company keep growing - whatâs happening in the business to make this an attractive investment and how much confidence should investors place in the $1.4 billion free cash flow forecast for next year and the $2.4 billion free cash flow forecast for fiscal year â23 that supports the current $29 billion enterprise value and allows for a reasonable upside.Autodesk is a bit of a complicated company for its size in that it has more than a few different areas of concentration. Most investors, if they know this company at all, are familiar with AutoCAD, first released in 1982 and still a standard in the CAD space. AutoCAD is used as a toolset in architecture, where it is a standard, and in mechanical and electrical design. It is still available with a variety of vertical integration developed by ADSK as well as man of its partners. Currently, most of ADSK installations have been converted to desktop subscriptions which start at $50/month for an LT (light) version.While AutoCAD is most likely what investors know, the companyâs growth is coming from a host of newer offerings, some acquired, other built from scratch. One such offering is offered by Autodesk is called BIM 360, a set of solutions aimed at improving business processes in the construction industry. Almost everyone in the construction industry other than laborers is highly likely to have some familiarity with AutoCAD - most aspiring architects and construction supervisors have trained on the product while getting their degrees. So, BIM 360 has an excellent introduction to many potential buyers.The offering has seen widescale acceptance with licenses having grown by 10X over the past three years, with subscription growth still accelerating. Construction is one of those areas of the economy that's ripe for digital transformation as productivity growth has been minimal. Using solutions like BIM 360 and its analytics and Forge layers is a process that can significantly improve productivity based on user experiences. BIM 360 is offered by subscription only. It is a set of solutions that are focused on providing users with a Building information Model. Overall the construction/design software space is said to have a TAM of $22 billion/year, with much of the growth forecast to be in construction through 2020. Autodesk solutions are said to be those that are focused on what is called âindustrialized construction"" in which ADSK can utilize its manufacturing expertise to build solutions that encompass new ways of getting things built. The concept is to treat the construction process as equivalent to a factory assembly line.Given the company's background, and its competitors, it is realistic to expect that ADSK can achieve a leadership position in the space. There are a number of competitors, but most approach the problems involved in managing construction from a more âsiloedâ viewpoint, and many cost far more than BIM 360.The CAD space has been around for a long time now and it has many components and sub markets. There are many competitors in the space including PTC, Siemens, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP (NYSE:SAP), and Dassault (OTCPK:DASTY). Most market research reports say that PLM, the modern equivalent of CAD, is growing in the high single digit range. Cloud-based PLM is growing far more rapidly with the latest market research reports suggesting that the space will achieve 22% growth through 2022. Perhaps the leading cloud CAD/CAM offering is Fusion 360 which was a pioneering offering by ADSK when it was first released about four years ago. Cloud-based CAM got off to a slow start, but it is rapidly becoming standard in the field. Fusion 360 has quadrupled its active users in the past 14 months, and its user base growth continues to accelerate. I'm not going to try to evaluate Fusion 360 against other cloud CAD tools. I'm not qualified to do so, and even if I were, it wouldnât directly help in making an investment judgment. But it is pretty straightforward to suggest that ADSKâs cloud CAD product is driving lots of growth and is most likely going to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.The reason why I think the growth projections of this company are credible are basically that it offers disruptive and market leading solutions in construction and in cloud-based CAM. These are exceptional opportunities, and ones that Autodesk seems to be exploiting with decent execution. I really am not going to try to evaluate all of the solutions in the PLM space in the sense of declaring which one is better - at the least it is fair to say that ADSK is amongst the leader group in PLM overall and it has been the industry pioneer in cloud-based PLM since that category first emerged. It doesnât seem likely that it the company will not be able to maintain its leading competitive position into the foreseeable future.The company has built its plan on growing the ARR for the next few years at a 25% CAGR composed of increasing its ARPS by about 6% annually, while increasing the number of user seats by 18% per year. The company has started to wean itself off its historic practice of excessive promotional discounts and to sell users on âCollectionsâ which carry a higher revenue per user. The company is having significant success in moving its maintenance base to a subscription model which emphasizes collections. And, as has been the case for some time, the company is still converting non subscribers from legacy engagements and from piracy use cases into paying subscription customers.Autodesk is a bit difficult to value because of its transition. Most of the typical metrics at this point are more misleading than enlightening. Part of what's happening is that the companyâs top-line growth, forecast to exceed 20% over the next several quarters, is reflecting the transition to a subscription model. The company has calculated a 14% growth in the CAGR in its core business, and that's probably a good starting point, in looking at how to value this company. When the transition is complete, it ought to be able to grow its revenues in a currency neutral organic model somewhere in the mid-teens percentage.The company has enforced expense discipline for some time now. Its non-GAAP expenses, with some quarter-to-quarter perturbations, have been flat to falling. No reason to think that this trend, a principal component of the companyâs business outlook, will not continue for some time. The shares were buffeted a couple of quarters back because of the way the company announced part of its cost containment strategy, but the fact is it will and should continue to reallocate its investments and its strategic priorities.These days forecasting billings is a difficult undertaking for most software companies and some have dropped that metric in terms of their forecast. It is simply not possible to forecast billings duration with any degree of accuracy. Autodesk has gone out on a limb and is forecasting a strong growth in deferred revenue/billings as a key component in terms of reaching its cash flow goal. This past quarter saw a very strong increase in unbooked deferred revenue. These will âbleed-backâ into cash flow going forward.Part of the impact of the business model transition is that renewals are likely to grow dramatically, and some of that growth will show up in long-term deferred revenues from multi-year subscription arrangements. The company is now projecting that its non-GAAP operating margins will reach 28% next year, and will probably keep rising steeply thereafter as renewals become a greater component of revenues.Just for the record, the companyâs current projected EV/S in the wake of its earnings release and on a 12-month forward basis, is about 11X. It is evident, I imagine, that this is not a metric considered by many in evaluating the worth of ADSK shares. Using the fiscal 2020 revenue forecast, the EV/S ratio drops to 9X, and going out an additional year, would drop the ratio to around 7X. That latter metric is clearly below the mid-point of SaaS software vendors with mid-teens growth.I think the current P/E ratio is not meaningful in terms of a valuation exercise because it is going through such a dramatic evolution. The companyâs EPS projection next year is for $3.25, and most analysts will be raising their estimates and price targets in the wake of the reported numbers - which really were quite good. So, the P/E ratio is 40X or less, and probably quite a bit less when the dust settles on all of the analyst estimate changes.As mentioned earlier, the valuation of this business has been predicated for some time now on its free cash flow goals of $1.4 billion in fiscal 2020, and more recently, for a projection of free cash flow of $2.4 billion by fiscal 2023. The free cash flow yield projection based on next yearâs free cash flow is about 5% and would rise to 8.4% by fiscal 2023.During this past analyst day, the CFO presented a series of charts that should be of interest to investors in projecting relative valuations. The metric relationship that best fits the ADSK model is that of revenue growth + free cash flow margin vs. revenue multiple. It is not a common value to calculate, but it apparently has a relatively high accuracy value (at least in terms of the traditional calculation of regression coefficients). The chart, to the extent that readers and investors accept its conclusions, suggests that ADSK shares have significant relative upside potential, and that's particularly the case when looking at other businesses in its space such as PTC and even Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS).Regardless of the methodology used, I think that the pullback seen on Friday is a decent opportunity. Should investors buy ADSK shares now - I think they should and I think the shares will produce significant positive alpha going forward."
4139078,52012,2018-01-22T09:30:52-05:00,I update my ADSK short thesis by debunking the idea that ADBE's success foretells ADSK's success;Reviewing stock-based compensation and recent ARR numbers;Discussing the effects of prioritizing sales over product development.,"Let me begin this article by acknowledging that the category of short that Autodesk (ADSK) falls into has not been working over the past several years. I consider ADSK - as well as two of my other ill-fated shorts, ServiceNow (NOW) and Proofpoint (PFPT) - to fall into the ""growth at any price category"" as all three have, in my opinion, engaged in practices that don't take short-term or even long-term profitability into account; a thesis which I've tried to establish in a number of articles.And while I'm still short the names, I recognize that the arguments I've made simply aren't important in today's monotonically rising market. To wit, I started my ADSK short when it was trading around $85, and it's now above $115. I started NOW and PFPT several years ago, and both have run against me substantially. In order to keep position sizes commensurate with my portfolio size, I've had to stop out of a portion of my NOW and PFPT positions and will do the same with ADSK if it continues to rise.That said, at the very least, I think it's worthwhile to continue to follow these stocks, for should there be any break in market sentiment, all three have plenty of room to fall. And for anyone like me who thinks valuations have been stretched way beyond any reasonable level, then holding a small short in these names could pay off sooner rather than later.With that introduction, let's now turn to my update on ADSK, in particular, articulating reasons why I am still short the name.Let's begin with a central bullish argument viz. that because Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE) so successfully transitioned from a perpetual license model to a subscription model, ADSK making the same transition will automatically result in the same results.For those unfamiliar with the ADBE story, here's a good article detailing the risk the company took and the ultimate rewards it reaped. It also highlights the initial resistance users had in making the switch from perpetual licenses to a subscription model (including 50,000 signatories to a petition ""demanding the company abandon the scheme"".)While it's true that ADBE masterfully navigated the transition from perpetual license to subscription model, in my view, this fact is irrelevant because ADSK sports nowhere near the financials that ADBE does: before, during and presumably after the transition. I'll highlight four pairs of graphs here with some commentary following each. When comparing the graphs, please keep in mind that ADBE began its transition to subscription in mid 2013, while ADSK began its transition in early 2016.ADBE Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsADSK Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsThe first takeaway is that while ADBE did see an initial drop in revenues, it wasn't -20% as is the case for ADSK. As we see below, this greater drop in top-line revenues, trickles down to the other important financial measures, including balance sheet health.ADBE Cash from Operations (Quarterly) data by YChartsADSK Cash from Operations (Quarterly) data by YChartsAgain ADBE saw a drop in operating cash flows when it made its transition, but the drop never came close to producing negative cash flows. ADSK, on the other hand, is solidly negative. These negative cash flows limit ADSK's flexibility in modifying the details of its transition (for example, it will allow less future discounting to ""push"" perpetual licensees into the subscription model). It also limits how well ADSK can respond to competitive threats from its competitors who, as I've previously noted, are trying to take advantage of small and medium-sized users' discontent with the forced transition to the subscription model. (Importantly, ADBE didn't have as significant competitors to fend off.)ADBE Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsADSK Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsSimilarly, ADBE maintained positive profit margins even in the depth of its transition, while ADSK entered its transition with periods of substantial unprofitability, and it still sports profit margins of -20+%. This is a key difference, as ADBE was always a healthy and profitable company which undertook its transition from a position of strength, while ADSK appears to have entered its transition with little choice (some might say out of desperation). Given its starting point, there's no telling if ADSK will ever achieve meaningful profitability.ADBE Current Ratio (Quarterly) data by YChartsADSK Current Ratio (Quarterly) data by YChartsIn terms of balance sheet health, we see that ADBE maintained a current ratio over 2 at all times, while ADSK's current ratio has plummeted to border 1. This, coupled with its lack of cash flow generation and double-digit negative profit margins, may foretell future dilutive financings down the road.Taken as a whole, these charts show how much stronger ADBE came into its transition and how much less the transition negatively affected its financials relative to what has occurred at ADSK. As I said at the top of this section, ADSK is no ADBE.I've often decried the farce of using non-GAAP accounting numbers to accentuate a company's better profitability and cash flow numbers by simply ignoring SBC. I found this nugget in the latest 10-Q which helps illustrate this point, i.e. what would be the difference in simply paying the same amount in salary as issuing stock and then repurchasing the same stock on the open market? (Of course, the answer is, in one case, the company gets a pass by issuing non-GAAP numbers, while in the second, it would have to own up to its full costs and resulting greater unprofitability.) With my emphasis:Here are the updated numbers on ADSK's ARR vs. its initial projections. Overall, I'd say that ADSK is doing better than I'd expected, since I thought the initial numbers would be easier to attain than would the subsequent quarters. Nonetheless, they are still behind schedule, and it's a metric to keep an eye on.As part of its third quarter results, ADSK also announced a substantial restructuring which also included a 13% staffing reduction. However, in this case, I take the company's assessment at face value and don't read too much into it. From the Q3 earnings call:One of the (many) criticisms of the subscription model (from the point of view of users - not of analysts) is that there is no real incentive to improve the product, since revenues are guaranteed no matter what the company does. The obverse view is taken by analysts. For example from a well-written bullish SA article:From a short-term perspective, this viewpoint is probably justified. But if one believes, as I do, that competition is looming and that subscribers aren't as trapped as the company (and bullish supporters) believe, then long term, this emphasis on sales vs. actual product improvement will prove detrimental.To appreciate why I believe that competition exists and why product development still matters, consider this technical blog post from an ADSK critic which begins:Finally, let me end this update with a user comment to another ADSK article which sums things up well from the small and mid-sized user community. (And remember that many of these users will ultimately migrate to larger companies where they may also have a say in product purchases/renewals):Despite a very unfriendly climate to this type of short, given the facts adduced above, I remain short ADSK with an ultimate target of <$40."
4132710,101735,2017-12-19T10:20:01-05:00,"In my opinion, the shares of Autodesk have further to fall for a variety of reasons.Management seems to be treating themselves better than common shareholders.The market seems to be excessively optimistic about this name, assuming a long-term growth rate of 8%, in spite of a history of lackluster performance.","In my view, investors would be wise to avoid the shares of Autodesk (ADSK) at the moment. The market has an excessively optimistic view of the long-term growth rate of this firm, in spite of that lackluster performance. In addition, management seems to act in a manner that is unfriendly to shareholders in my opinion. The relationship between the past performance and the marketâs expectations about future performance makes no sense to me. Itâs as if the crowd is assuming that this sow's ear can transform into a silk purse. In my view, more than half of investing involves not losing capital, and itâs for that reason that you should avoid Autodesk until thereâs proof of a solid transformation.I think the history of a public company can give us some insight into the current and future state of the business.After a quick glance at the last several years of financials here, itâs obvious that this has not been a growth company. For instance, revenue was lower in the year ending January 2017 than it was in 2013. The decline in revenue seems to be continuing, as the most recent three quarters compare negatively to the same period a year ago. Perhaps predictably, net income is also lower now than it was in 2013, although it has picked up most recently. Equally troubling to me is the fact that the debt load has increased massively over the past nine months. This obviously increases the level of risk present.One potential plus is the fact that the company has reduced the share count at a CAGR of about 1% over the past six years or so. Looking below the surface reveals an alarming (and shareholder-unfriendly) tendency, though. These actions speak to managementâs behavior. The details gleaned here can be found on page 95 of the most recent 10-K, and the Cash Flow Statement.At the end of 2016, there were approximately 226 million shares outstanding. At the end of fiscal 2017, that number had dropped to 222.7, for a net reduction of 3.3 million shares. In Fiscal 2017, the company spent $621.7 million to buyback approximately 9.5 million shares at an average purchase price of $64.73.At the same time, the firm issued 6.4 million shares for proceeds of $18.69 per share. This gets us to the net reduction in share count, but in my view, buying shares at $64.73, while selling shares at $18.69 does not increase shareholder wealth. The capital employed in these buybacks could have just as easily been spent on a host of shareholder-friendly initiatives like a special dividend. Management chose a different path, and I think thatâs telling.In addition to the issues associated with share repurchases, management seems to have treated themselves well as the revenue at the firm declines. In particular, stock-based compensation has increased from $165.6 million in 2015 to $221.8 million in 2017 (a CAGR of 10.23%), while total revenue has declined from $2512.2 billion to $2031 over the same period (itâs declined at a CAGR of 7.34%). It seems that management is treating themselves well, regardless of how well (or poorly) the firm does.This is troublesome for investors in my view, as it is enough proof that management is not as shareholder-friendly as Iâd like to see. This alone is a reason to avoid the name, but, of course, thereâs more.Source: Company Filings, 10-K, 10-QThe most recent quarter saw Autodesk report both revenue and earnings that both beat expectations. Revenue beat by ~$1.83 billion, and EPS beat by a penny. In spite of this, the shares took a 12.6% tumble. This is an example of when the marketâs expectations get out of whack. When the market is too optimistic about a given company, even a relatively good performance can be punished.With this as backdrop, Iâd like to talk about the current expectations surrounding Autodesk. In order to check the market expectations about a company, I employ the methodology outlined in Stephen Penmanâs excellent book âAccounting For Value.â Although the specifics of this methodology are beyond the scope of this article, the idea is that we can unbundle the âgâ (growth) in a standard financial model to work out what the market is assuming about the future.The method requires some basic algebra, but is quite a powerful way to avoid overpaying. At the moment, the market is forecasting a long-term (i.e. perpetual) growth rate for this business of about 8%. In my view, this forecast would be excessive for the most profitable of firms. For a company with Autodeskâs spotty financial history, this forecast is downright ludicrous.In my view, excessive optimism, a spotty financial history or a management team that seems to treat themselves more equally than other shareholders, are all each excellent reasons to avoid a given company. In Autodesk we have an example of a company that has all three characteristics, and so I strongly advise investors to avoid this name.While I donât short companies, as I donât trust that the market will suddenly turn rational, I am willing to place a bet using a put option or two. Specifically, I will be buying the January 2019 puts with a strike price of $105. I will pay approximately $1200 for these puts, which should turn out nicely if the market eventually realizes its mistake with this name. If, by January of 2019, the shares are not below $103.80, I will start the process again at a higher strike price, and thus higher potential profits.For those investors who are nervous about options, my advice is simply to avoid this name until the new subscription model proves itself somewhat. Avoiding loss is more than half the battle when it comes to investing, and avoiding loss is going to become a greater and greater challenge as this market marches higher. Avoid capital loss by avoiding this name."

Several years ago, the company announced that it is transferring to a subscription model, like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and others.Implementation of the plan to increase revenue and profitability is still at an early stage. The transition model has not yet proved its effectiveness: new model annualized revenue per subscription (ARPS) growth is stagnant, and the growth of new customers is slowing. ADSK tries to increase prices by eliminating discounts provided to customers, but this negatively affects net subscription additions:Note: ADSK financial year ends on Jan. 31 (for example, FY 2018 ended on Jan. 31, 2018). Source: Created by author using company data and Bloomberg. Source: Created by author using company data.Autodesk's competitors are also enhancing their efforts to increase their customer base and switch to a subscription model (PTC Inc., etc.). However, those competitors have already achieved positive profitability and have a higher margin of safety to withstand potential pricing competition.The company's plan implies a lack of growth in non-GAAP expenses during the 2018-2019 fiscal years. This looks unrealistic given the rapid growth of the IT industry and the forecast growth in the customer base. Investors were taken unawares by the company's decision to restructure and reduce personnel by 13%.This represented clear evidence of the difficulties the business faces in controlling expenses. The company will focus on investments in construction and manufacturing industries, as well as expansion of their own digital infrastructure (""E-store"").At the same time, the company will abandon some markets, reduce the volume of research and development projects, will not support websites in countries where there are no Autodesk representative offices, and close their program to attract new talent. In the long run, these changes are likely to weaken ADSK's market position and decelerate revenue growth.During Q4 FY18 conference call, the management ""reset expectations"" regarding ""super low value"" cloud subscriptions, in addition to slashed research and development expenses in Q3. These actions undermine long-term prospects of the company which is very much in need of new business development to achieve the FCF $11/share goal in FY 2023. The main positive cash flows are expected only in FY 2020. This means high volatility of the share price and increased uncertainty.Now, let's review the financials of Autodesk to assess the feasibility of the targets set by ADSK management for FY 2020. Compare ADSK's ""Plan 2020"" with actual results and current targets of the management:* Annualized recurring revenue; ** Annualized revenue per subscription; *** My estimate. Source: Created by author using company data.ADSK ""Plan 2020"" implied an interim target of $6 free cash flow per share in FY 2020. In FY 2017, the management didn't reach its ARR target of 25%, so in FY 2019 to FY 2020 ADSK needs accelerated growth in ARR of approximately 30% each year to reach the interim target of $6 FCF/share. That is why ADSK needs such high ARR and ARPS target growth for FY 2019 - 29% and 11%, respectively (figures in red).At the same time, client base growth is expected by ADSK to remain constant in absolute terms quarterly throughout FY 2019: +127k in Q4 FY 2018 and 500-550k for the whole FY 2019. ADSK wants to set prices higher by 11% and still assumes a stable flow of net additions. This looks unrealistic. In FY 2018, the trend of net adds was discouraging amid a much less upbeat ARPS growth of 6% Y/Y:Source: Created by author using company data.The final target of $11 free cash flow per share in FY 2023 looks even more unreachable: ADSK needs FCF CAGR of 22% in FY 2021-23 to achieve this from the starting point of $6 FCF/share in FY 2020. I don't believe this is realistic.Predicting a more realistic but still optimistic (in my view) ARR growth target of 19% in FY 2019-23 (equal to core subscription base growth in 2016-20 plus ARPS growth in 2020-23 projected by management), I derive fair price of ADSK shares as follows:ARR in FY 2023:$2,054 mn * 1.19^5 = $4,941 mnOther assumptions used: operating costs at $3,378 mn, depreciation at 0.7% of revenue ($35 mn), target cash tax rate 17.5%, capex at 2.3% of revenue ($114 mn) and working capital cash inflow at around 12.8% of revenue = $632 mn (these assumptions are based on the Credit Suisse (NYSE:CS) financial model, which is available to the clients of this bank). So FCF in FY 2023 is as follows:FCF = (Revenue - Operating Costs) * (1 - Target Cash Tax Rate) + Depreciation - Capex + Working Capital InflowFCF = (4,941 - 3,378) * (1 - 17.5%) + 35 -114 + 632 = $1,842 mnFCF/share '23 = $1,842 mn / 218.3 mn shares = $8.4FCF yield of 5% will be the most appropriate for FY2023 (current average FCF yield of IT giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), etc.). Based on my calculations, ADSK cost of equity is 11.74%.Share price = $8.4 / 5% / (1+11.74%) ^ (2023-2018) = $96 (current price is $126).Autodesk is a great company with popular and competitive products, but taking into consideration current market turmoil there may be more lucrative investment opportunities when compared to ADSK. I assume that the current ADSK price is 31% higher than fair value. Based on my calculations and analysis, I think investors may want to consider to take a short position in this stock."
4154554,103480,2018-03-08T09:44:04-05:00,"Autodesk's bullish Q4 results sent shares flying 15%, as the company showed concrete evidence of acceleration in its subscription transition efforts.Autodesk returned to growth with a 16% y/y increase in revenues this quarter, driven by subscription adds and up from 5% last quarter.Recurring revenues are now 93% of the company's total revenue base, up 7 points y/y. Subscriptions (versus maintenance) are becoming an ever-larger part of the mix.The company's losses slimmed dramatically (on a pro forma basis), showing the effectiveness of its restructuring efforts.","It wasn't so long ago that Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK), the giant maker of design and CADS software, was being tossed into the dumps by investors afraid that a round of layoffs would threaten the company's growth. The layoffs were announced in a good earnings quarter, and despite management's note that the restructuring was being implemented from a ""position of strength"" (unlike restructuring forced by necessity like that at Blue Apron (NASDAQ: APRN) or Snap (NYSE: SNAP)), investors dumped shares of Autodesk.It was a good time to buy into the company. Year to date, Autodesk shares have rallied an astonishing 30%, erasing the losses from last quarter's selloff and putting shares at a new all-time high. But with such strong fundamentals emanating from Autodesk's quarter and guidance, the stock still has plenty of rally left in it.One of the major things investors cheered this quarter, of course, was the growth in Autodesk's subscription business, the primary focus for the company. And despite the progress Autodesk has made over the past ~12 months, there's still plenty of room for Autodesk to continue on this road and capitalize on the investor goodwill associated with it. Of all the ""legacy"" technology companies to embrace the shift to the cloud and to the subscription model pioneered by Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) in the early 2000s, Autodesk has perhaps been the last laggard. The company realized a little too late where the market was headed and was content to sit on its desktop and on-prem software - but now, Autodesk has woken from its slumber. As we've seen with the likes of Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE), which is a very compelling comp to Autodesk for its similar size and application category, Wall Street rewards the transition to the subscription model extremely generously. Autodesk, in my opinion, is still at the base of this tailwind. Unlike Adobe, Autodesk's subscription transition still has quite a ways left to go.While the company's recurring revenue mix is now 93% of its total revenues, the subscription/maintenance split of ARR is still just a little over 50/50, as shown in the fourth quarter chart below:Figure 1. Autodesk recurring revenue splitSource: Autodesk Q4 press releaseAs Autodesk continues to wean customers off of its on-prem license/support contract combinations (which drive maintenance plan revenues) and into cloud subscriptions, the higher-margin SaaS subscriptions will take over the recurring revenue ARR mix. Until SaaS revenues take on a majority (say, 80-90%) of ARR, Autodesk still has unfinished business in this department.That's not to say that growth in the subscription model wasn't fantastic in the quarter. The company (as seen in the above chart) grew its subscription ARR by 106% y/y, and added 371K subscribers in the quarter, bringing the total subscription customer base to 2.27 million. One thing new followers of Autodesk may not realize is that the subscription transition is actually a near-term headwind to revenues. On-prem licenses book a lot more revenue upfront (but are less desirable because they are much shorter-lived and have lower margins in the long run), so trading in these revenues for subscription revenues that get spread out over a longer period of time is actually a drag on Autodesk's top line. The aggressiveness with which Autodesk has pursued the subscription transition this year is the reason its revenues for the full year (just north of $2 billion) was relatively flat y/y.Despite the transition, however, Autodesk has returned to growth in Q4. Figure 2. Autodesk revenue growthSource: Autodesk Q4 press releaseAs seen in the chart above, Autodesk grew total revenues in the quarter by 16% y/y to $554 million, far outpacing the measly 5% growth it saw last quarter - and again, this is despite the headwinds caused by the subscription transition. Wall Street analysts had penciled in a consensus figure of $544.7 million, or 14% y/y growth. Total ARR at the end of the quarter, by the way, was $2.05 billion - that's nearly the size of Autodesk's FY18 revenues. This is revenue that Autodesk doesn't have to chase again in a new fiscal year, giving it a very powerful lever for growth with a baseline revenue secured.Another nice thing to see in the quarter: after a year of stagnant y/y growth comps, Autodesk is projecting a return to growth in FY19. See the company's FY19 outlook below:Figure 3. Autodesk FY19 guidanceSource: Autodesk Q4 press releaseThe midpoint of Autodesk's $2.455-$2.505 billion range for FY19 implies 21% y/y growth over FY18 revenues of $2.056 billion, a refreshing outlook for a company that has been flat for so long. The 28-30% growth in ARR is perhaps even more important; as is the 500-550k expected adds to the subscriber base.Also note the fact that despite the company projecting a return to growth, it's doing so with only a 1-2% growth projection in expenses (net of stock comp). This illustrates the power of a subscription model - with recurring revenues as a majority of the business, it doesn't take much in incremental cost to drive modest growth, implying large profit expansion.In addition to the strong growth metrics that Autodesk has posted in the quarter, the company has also made good on its restructuring efforts to drive the business closer to breakeven. Note also that gross margins at the company have lifted to 88% (pro forma), up 3 points y/y and reflecting the strength of subscription margins over on-prem:Figure 4. Autodesk profitability metricsSource: Autodesk Q4 press releaseLikewise, Autodesk's pro forma operating margin has slimmed down to a near-breakeven -3% (from -17% in the year-ago period), excluding the impacts of restructuring charges and highlighting the benefits of its ~1,000 headcount layoff. With the low spend growth projected in FY19 and a return to positive pro forma EPS, Autodesk's momentum on the profit growth front also seem robust and are further icing on the cake.With strong results in Q4 driven by accelerated subscription growth, an upbeat outlook into FY19 that marks a return to positive y/y comps, and a slew of upgrades from Wall Street, Autodesk looks set to continue rallying well into 2018. Recall that Autodesk is a company whose flagship CADS software has become nearly synonymous with the engineering discipline. The strength of this brand - used by nearly all electrical or hardware engineer - carries over extremely well into a longer-lived subscription model. While the stock is no longer ""on sale"" as it was after last quarter's selloff, Autodesk remains a strong horse to bet on. Remain long on this name as it continues to transition its business into a pure subscription model and reaps the benefit of multi-year contracts and huge profit margins."
4129331,103480,2017-12-04T04:25:17-05:00,"Autodesk reported a small beat in its Q3 earnings, but also announced a round of layoffs that has sent the stock down nearly 20% post-earnings.The layoffs affect 13% of its workforce (approx. 1,150 employees), though management says this move is not a cost reduction and is coming from a ""position of strength.""Autodesk is still in the midst of transitioning its sales model to a subscription-based cloud delivery model. Subscription revenues increased 106% y/y in the quarter.Total revenues also returned to growth (+5% y/y) in the quarter, coming from several quarters of decline in the year.Though Autodesk has historically been an expensive stock, the recent pullback makes shares appealing.","Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), the dominant developer of CAD (computer-aided design) software and technology tools for architecture and engineering, has been a complex company since it announced its transition to the cloud-based subscription model several years back. Such a transition is not for the faint of heart - weaning a company off of lucrative perpetual license deals, where a huge sum of revenue is recognized upfront, and transitioning instead to piecemeal monthly subscription payments hurts a company's financials in the near-term. Longer-term, however, subscription contracts generate more sustainable revenue and higher profit margins, which is why for the most part, investors have given Autodesk the benefit of the doubt.So far, the companies that have undergone such a transition - Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), most notably - have been extremely successful, and now almost 90% of Adobe's revenue comes from recurring subscriptions. Autodesk isn't quite there yet: 45% of its $515.3 million in Q3 revenues derived from subscriptions, though that's up significantly from 23% in the prior-year Q3. Meanwhile, Autodesk's traditional license revenues have been faltering as it convinces clients to move to subscription, which has caused a total top-line decline for several quarters - until Q3. Though Autodesk's 5% y/y growth rate this quarter is minuscule, it shows that the company is climbing from the bottom of the trough that it inflicted upon itself in its decision to switch to subscriptions.Most of Wall Street and investors believe in Autodesk's future, and the company's naming of a new CEO (Andrew Anagnost, former CMO, was promoted to the top job in June) was well received. The stock was up nearly 75% year-to-date alone, until Autodesk's post-Q3 fumble sent shares spiraling.ADSK data by YChartsDespite the fear that has rekindled in the markets, however, I believe this is an opportune time to buy into a powerful franchise. Autodesk is the gold standard of CAD software, the bread and butter of engineering schools across the U.S. and even abroad. Autodesk software is responsible for designing landmarks as iconic as the Freedom Tower in New York City, breaking ground in 2006 over the site of Ground Zero. I once had the opportunity to attend a cocktail hour at the Autodesk Gallery in San Francisco, which showcases not only other architectural accomplishments such as the Bay Bridge but also applications of Autodesk software in car design and filmmaking. An image of one of the gallery exhibits is shown below:Source: AutodeskThough Autodesk does have competition - primarily SolidWorks, a product of France-based Dassault SystÃ¨mes (OTCPK:DASTY) - its dominance in design and engineering cannot be overstated, as it's the design platform of choice in American universities. Autodesk's flagship product, AutoCAD, is the engineering discipline's equivalent to finance's Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Excel, and Forbes estimates it to have an 85% market share. Furthermore, third-party research estimates that the total market for CAD software will grow to $11.21 billion by 2023, indicating that Autodesk (at a ~$2 billion revenue run rate) still has plenty of room for growth.Yes, it's unfortunate that the company is laying off more than a thousand workers. But as investors, we have to take a cold approach to the event. It's unlikely that Autodesk will cut sales reps, whose field activities are critical in ensuring the continued success of its transition to subscription sales, so Autodesk's growth is not at risk. With a company as large as Autodesk, with 9,000 employees and more than $2 billion in overhead spending in FY17, a restructuring of this scale is extremely healthy for the business. Autodesk hasn't turned a GAAP net profit since FY15, and with a move like this, the company is taking a step toward the future, with high-margin subscriptions and a lower cost structure powering expanded earnings.Autodesk posted total revenue of $515.3 million in Q3, up 5% y/y. As previously mentioned, though this amount of growth is meaningless, it represents a shift from the decline it's seen throughout the year. Year to date, Autodesk's revenues are still ~3% down from the comparable period last year, indicating a turning page for the company in Q3. Analysts had only expected $514 million in revenues this quarter, and Autodesk itself had guided to $505-515 million in revenues for the quarter, achieving the high end of its guidance.Subscription revenues, of course, are the key focus for investors during Autodesk's transitionary period. Subscription revenues climbed 106% y/y to $231.1 million this quarter, representing a 45% mix of total revenues (up from 23% in the prior-year Q3).Figure 1. Autodesk revenue resultsSource: Autodesk earnings releaseOther subscription metrics trended well. Autodesk reported total subscription ARR (annualized recurring revenue) of $924 million (also a 106% y/y growth rate), effectively signaling that it has ~$1 billion of contracted subscription revenues. This means that each year, Autodesk already has $1 billion in revenue locked down (barring any cancellations), and any new business that it brings in is purely incremental. With its subscription ARR having grown so large, Autodesk can more easily stem the declines in its license revenues (which have declined ~$300 million year to date).Autodesk also counted 1.896 million paying subscribers at the end of the quarter, a 307k increase from the previous quarter. Deferred revenues, which represent Autodesk's ""backlog"" revenue that has yet to be recognized as revenue, grew 17% y/y to $1.76 billion.One other note on recurring revenues - while maintenance revenues aren't technically ""subscription"" revenues, they are ratably recognized over a long-term service period similar to a subscription. When accounting for maintenance revenues as part of the recurring revenue base, Autodesk actually generated 92% of its revenues this quarter from recurring sources, as shown in the chart below:Figure 2. Autodesk ARR walkdownAs Autodesk pivots increasingly away from term license/maintenance sale combinations and more toward subscription contracts (where maintenance is largely included), its subscription revenue piece will absorb more of the declining maintenance revenues.The table below, which shows Autodesk's revenue by product, also illustrates an important point: as previously mentioned, Autodesk isn't just AutoCAD - it has vast opportunities in a variety of industry verticals and functional applications, and nearly every product segment showed both sequential and y/y growth this quarter.Figure 3. Autodesk revenue by productThe transition to a subscription model is as much about revenue stability as it is about profitability. Long-term subscription customers, after all, pay more over time and don't require expensive sales dollars to renew contracts, making them far more profitable over the years. The chart below, also taken from Autodesk's earnings release, shows the company's progress toward profitability on a quarterly basis:Figure 4. Autodesk margin walkdownThe first thing to note is that Autodesk's gross margins have increased from already-high to super-high, 83% in 3Q17 to 85% in 3Q18. And note that this is Autodesk's total gross margin, which includes the lower-margin license component. As Autodesk pivots more and more toward subscription revenues, it should see gross margins closer to the 90s.And while Autodesk is still generating operating losses, its operating loss of $100.0 million in Q3 is slimmer than $119.9 million in 3Q17, and its operating loss margin of -19% is a huge improvement over -24% in the prior-year Q3. Autodesk's profitability is moving in the right direction.Autodesk's pro forma EPS (non-GAAP metrics primarily add back stock comp) was -$0.12 in the quarter, which was a beat over analyst consensus of -$0.13.And a quick word on the upcoming layoffs - though Autodesk hasn't yet announced which jobs are affected or the size of the annual cost savings, a reduction of ~13% of Autodesk's workforce would likely save around ~$300 million, doing a back-of-the-envelope calculation on Autodesk's annual overhead of $2 billion. That amount of savings would put Autodesk back into the black, where it hasn't been since FY15.Despite the seeming setback triggered by Autodesk's coming layoffs, I believe the company's core business fundamentals are intact. Autodesk is an iconic software franchise that appropriately has contributed to the design and construction of iconic landmarks across the world. The company's Q3 results reveal that Autodesk's subscription transition is on track and that customers are responding enthusiastically to the new delivery model, with 307k subscriptions added in the quarter.Valuing Autodesk at the moment is a difficult exercise; due to its revenue model shift and related negative cash flows, coming up with a ""steady-state"" picture of its business for the purpose of calculating revenue or earnings multiples is unlikely to produce an accurate result. As Autodesk scales further and builds toward a ~$5 billion subscription revenue base in the next few years, however, it's easy to recognize the value of such a dominant business with sky-high gross margins in the high 80s.Investors who are willing to look beyond short-term pain can enjoy many years of outperformance as Autodesk reasserts itself in the cloud era."

Even the stunning visual effects in movies like Inception, Avatar, and Titanic were created using Autodesk's software.At this point in time, the company's business model is undergoing a drastic transformation into a subscription-based one. Whether this radical change will ultimately pay off or not remains to be seen, but the transition so far has gone relatively smoothly. Most notably, shareholders have benefited from this, with the common shares more than doubling in value since the transition was announced in 2015.A lot of optimism has been priced into Autodesk's current market valuation, and now would be a good time to lock in profits. There is simply not enough upside to justify the large potential downside, which could be massive if there are any unforeseen hiccups while the company's business model changes. With so much optimism already priced into the current share price, the current risk-reward ratio is asymmetric with a lot more downside than upside.Shares of Autodesk have rallied by nearly 50 percent since the year started, alone outperforming all 3 major indexes easily. The rally was given more life recently, with shares rising even higher after the company released its earnings report. Autodesk reported earnings on the 17th, and needless to say, the market was more than satisfied with the report.There's no doubt in my mind that the most recent earnings report was impressive, but it only raises the ceiling for expectations. With a poor balance sheet loaded with debt, no positive earnings, and a negative P/E ratio which exceeds 40, it's hard to justify holding shares at this valuation, let alone open a long position. However, it's still worth looking at the earnings report to see if the most recent rally is justified or not.Both earnings per share and revenue for the 2nd quarter exceeded analyst expectations. Analysts were expecting EPS to be -$0.15 and revenue to be $495 million. Autodesk gave analysts more than they expected: revenue for the quarter was $501.8 million and EPS was -$0.11. Although total revenue was down on a yoy basis by nearly 9 percent, it's fair to say it's not as bad as it seems. Autodesk is still in the process of its business model shift, and it should be expected that the company may have minor revenue bumps along the road.It's more important to look at subscriber growth instead of looking at total revenue. Annualized recurring revenue (ARR), a metric which can gauge the health of a subscription model, was $784 million. Subscription plan subscriptions increased drastically since the last quarter by 270,000 to 1.59 million. The number of total subscriptions grew 153,000 sequentially from the last quarter to 3.4 million in total. About 63,000 maintenance users converted to product subscriptions under Autodesk's new Maintenance to Subscription (M2S) initiative this quarter. I will go further into detail about the significance of this program later, but for now, I think it's important to focus on subscription growth in general.Annualized recurring revenue from Autodesk's subscriptions nearly doubled on a constant currency basis yoy. Total product subscriptions saw triple-digit growth in each major region, with a lot of it coming from new customers. New customers made up roughly 30 percent of growth, a very healthy amount. Subscriptions for the company's cloud-based products increased 200 percent on a yoy basis, showing exceptional growth. The bulk of this cloud growth comes from BIM 360, a cloud-based construction management/collaboration software product. BIM 360 gives construction teams the necessary tools to coordinate their efforts to effectively work together. It enables users to work more effectively in a more centralized way. This innovative piece of software will likely be a key driver in growth in the future because of the strong demand for its service in the construction field. Autodesk has an early lead versus its competitors and has the ability to snatch up large construction contracts early. Enterprise business agreements, another important component of subscriber growth, is also seeing strong growth and renewal rates. The average contract size for each agreement has now increased by roughly 30 percent, with account usage from these agreements also growing 10 percent on a yoy basis.The company also launched the M2S initiative recently to encourage old maintenance users to switch to its subscription system. Before 2016, users could opt for a renewable maintenance plan instead of a subscription-based service. Under this maintenance plan, users are given access to perpetual licenses. The main benefit of a perpetual license is that when you fail to renew, you can still use the software. When you renew a maintenance plan, you gain access to software updates, bug fixes, and customer support. Under a normal subscription you gain access to all of that, but you need to continually renew in order to gain access to the software. This can be a pain for customers, but it is in Autodesk's best interests for maintenance users to switch over and become subscribers. Having and managing two separate business models can be more costly than just having one business model. Having one business model can reduce operating costs. Subscribers are also a much more captive customer base with higher renewal rates, since they need access to the software. It is more flexible for the customer and allows the company to raise prices more easily.Autodesk has already stopped selling its maintenance plans, and the company has an ongoing program to change the remaining maintenance users into subscribers. The program gives current maintenance users a discounted price if they choose to switch to a subscription instead. As an added incentive, Autodesk is also raising the cost of its maintenance plan by 5 percent this year, 10 percent next year, and 20 percent the following year. This transition seems to be going smoothly - each quarter, it is transitioning more and more people. It's likely that in the future Autodesk will raise prices even more and offer more discounts in order to pressure more users to switch. If it all goes as planned and the company is able to eliminate its maintenance users, the benefits would be huge.A full subscription-based model gives shareholders the ability to better predict revenues, since the revenue would all be recurring. This should create long-term stability, consistency, cut down on costs and allows Autodesk to better price its products competitively through methods such as bundling. With a subscription model, it's easier to scale your business down or up in order to adapt as well. A stronger relationship between the customer and the service provider is also established - one that can potentially boost Autodesk's customer retention rate. It's better for the company, and it can be better for the customer too in some cases. Once this business model transformation is fully completed, it will practically pay for itself with the added benefits and increased revenues.So now the only question remaining is, why sell your shares now? It seems like Autodesk is on the verge of something great. Why sell now when everything is going so well? I think Murphy's Law sums up the situation perfectly - anything that can go wrong will go wrong.An example of something which can go horribly wrong lies in the company's M2S program itself. People are outraged - a lot of people with existing perpetual licenses don't want to bear such a large price hike in the coming years. They could be completely discouraged by the price hike and just not use Autodesk's products from now on. A lot of people don't like the new subscription system in the first place, and if the backlash grows and becomes strong enough, we will see it hurt the company's earnings. This is just one example of the many things which could go wrong for Autodesk.The saying is an adage and should not be taken literally, of course, but the idea is definitely worth thinking about. Bottom line is that shares of Autodesk are at all-time highs right now and have more than doubled since the company announced its business transformation. That is not healthy, especially when you consider the fact that the company has only been losing money and having its financial situation worsen over that period of time. With the recent rally, it seems like the benefits from the new business model seems to already be reflected in the current stock price. Shares of Autodesk are trading at a price-to-earnings ratio which exceeds -40. Simply Wall St's discounted cash flow model indicates that shares are significantly overvalued relative to the company's future cash flow model too. Autodesk also has a PBV (price based on the value of assets) multiple of 79, well above the software average that is below 10.(Source: Simply Wall St)Ever since Autodesk decided to change its business model, the company has been losing more and more money. What's startling is that the company's net income loss actually widened on a yoy basis by over 40 percent! It's true that its business transformation is not fully done yet, but shouldn't Autodesk earnings start improving before the company sees its stock rise in value?(Source: Simply Wall St)From a balance sheet perspective, things are not looking any better either. Autodesk is seeing its cash position weaken while its debt position increases - a very precarious situation to be in when you make no money. The company has a debt load of $1.58 billion to pay down and $1.71 million in cash and cash equivalents. Free cash flow this quarter was in the red by nearly $90 million as well.If Autodesk's business transformation fails to live up to the hype, or if there are any bumps along the road, the common stock could depreciate significantly from the current highs. Buying a stock is only half the battle, knowing when to sell is the other half. Now is a good time to sell, when you have a gain that exceeds 50-100 percent. It's simply unlikely for the stock to increase in value that much again next year. If anything goes wrong, we could see shareholder value get decimated by the market. There's simply too much downside and not enough upside left to warrant not selling your shares."
4131716,98236,2017-12-13T18:18:00-05:00,"Late last month, Autodesk reported the results of its fiscal Q3.Some elements of the earnings report were considered disappointing, despite the overall numbers that showed the company beating on revenue and EPS and nudging its operating earnings forecast higher.The company enjoys a strong competitive position within its three major operating spaces - CAD/PLM, visual effects and engineering and construction.These areas, themselves, are all seeing faster growth, partially as part of a secular trend and partly as a function of normal demand cyclicality.The company's results, far from being a disappointment, would seem to revalidate the path the company has to achieve its $6/share free cash flow goal in fiscal 2020.","It has been more than a year now since I last used my keyboard to declaim about Autodesk (ADSK). At the time, I basically commented that I thought the shares had gone too far, too fast. Of course, subsequent to that call the shares raced upward and finally peaked at $130, more than 64% above the price they had attained when I decided to be âprudentâ in assessing fair value for this name. The other week, my call got a little bit of redemption when the shares slumped 18% in the wake of a poorly received earnings forecast. At this point, the shares are only 34% above where they were when I advised readers to take profits. Not the best piece of valuation work to paste in my scrap book. About all I can say in self defense is that the IGV index, against which ADSK share price performance would be logically measured, has appreciated 40% over the same 12 months.But regardless of my blunder back then, the issue to be addressed in this article is what happens next. Is Autodeskâs transformation on target? What does the so-called ânet sub addsâ miss mean to investors? And what interpretation should be placed on the companyâs announcement of a restructuring. Ultimately, it is these three factors that have been responsible for the shares losing almost 20% of their value in just a few days, with some signs that they (the shares) have entered investor purgatory. From my perspective, investor purgatory is probably a reasonable place to look at ADSK shares - not when they are broadly beloved and making almost daily new highs. As it happens, the shares are still well beloved by analysts who werenât too worried about what disturbed investors. For a change, I'm in sync with the preponderance of analysts.One analyst described this latest quarter as messy. The messiness, so called, is really in the eyes of the beholder. As ADSK continues through its transition, some metrics that have historically been of significance are no longer useful in analyzing the companyâs business. This following section attempts to clean-up the so-called âmessinessâ of the quarter.Autodesk shares are a bit hard to value in the midst of the transition. The consensus forecast for revenues in the fiscal year that starts February 1 is for 25% growth top-line growth, with revenues reaching $2.55 billion. The First Call consensus EPS projection for fiscal year 2019 is $1.22 although there's an unusually wide dispersion of forecasts that make up the consensus. For what it is worth, the calculated EV/S on next yearâs revenues is 9.2X. As the business model transition matures, revenue growth will remain elevated above longer-term trends and will reduce that metric substantially. Investors are really looking at the company's current projection of $1.4 billion in free cash flow in 2020 - basically little more than a year from now, and are looking at what is likely to be a free cash flow yield of more than 6%. Given the many levers available to management to meet or exceed that target, the valuation has become far more reasonable than it was when I last wrote about this company and its shares.The latest company projection calls for free cash flow of $11/share five years from now (fiscal 2023). If it happens that way, clearly ADSK will turn out to be a very attractive investment. My own read of this latest quarter, highlighted below suggests that the preponderance of the evidence will support this kind of financial evolution.Just for the record, the numbers that ADSK reported last month were a modest beat compared to the mid-point of the companyâs prior forecast. Specific numbers that are usually considered to be headlines included total revenues of $515 million for the period, and a non-GAAP loss of $.12. These compared to the companyâs prior forecast for revenues of $505-$515 with a non-GAAP EPS loss of $.16-$.12. The quarter did mark a return to reported year-on-year revenue growth, suggesting that the business model transition is starting to achieve its objectives. At this point, recurring revenues have reached 92% of the total compared to 78% of total revenues in the year earlier period.Autodesk guidance was mainly positive. The company marginally increased the mid-point of its forecasted revenue range for the current fiscal year. The company improved its earnings forecast which had called for a per share loss for the year of $.57 to a new projected loss of $.51. The company decreased the top end of its net sub add forecast from 675k to 650k. Subscription adds during the quarter decreased from 153k in the companyâs fiscal Q2 to 148k. Subsequent to the earnings release, in a presentation at a large brokerage, management made the point that it had made a conscious decision to reduce its promotional activity at the lowest end of the market and has decided to focus more on acquiring new mid-market cloud subscribers. For many years, counting subscribers was a significant component of analyzing ADSK - that has now changed to looking carefully at ARR metrics. A more relevant statistic, annual recurring revenue, which is probably the most accurate representation of the companyâs performance during this transition, reached $1.9 billion, up 25% from the year earlier level, expressed in constant currency. The company maintained its forecast for total ARR growth of 24%-26%. On a sequential basis, ARR increased by $70 million, or about 4%. The percentage increase in ARR accelerated from the 23% level achieved in the companyâs fiscal Q2.The companyâs short-term deferred revenue balance rose by 21%, an accelerating trend from the 17% increase seen in the prior quarter. Unbilled deferred revenues rose sharply on a sequential basis reaching $148 million, up from $63 million in the prior quarter. Overall, calculated bookings, including unbilled deferred revenue rose noticeably in the quarter, reaching $883 million, an increase of 9% from the year-earlier calculated bookings metric.As the CEO pointed out, Q3 last year included $38 million of license backlog that was included in results during that quarter which marked the end of perpetual license sales. Normalizing for that anomaly, actual revenue would have grown 14% year over year. Autodesk signed its two largest contracts in its history in Q3, both renewals and both of which included increases of more than 50% in annual contract value.Many investors focus attention on different iterations of annual revenue per subscriber (ARPS) and some analysts seem to consider it to be a lodestar as well. The metric in this area on which the company focuses, product subscription ARPS rose by 20% year-over-year. The metric that analysts like to look, overall ARPS was down-mainly due to seasonal factors according to the CFO. The CFO said that overall ARPS would rise in this current quarter, something likely to be greeted positively by investors. From my perspective, the âissueâ of ARPU has more to do with the methodology of its calculation than any negative business trend. I'm far more focused on the growth of ARR and bookings than numbers that seem to move with a life of their own and do not forecast future business trends. Overall, the company was not quite able to post a positive cash flow from operations (CFFO), primarily due balance sheet changes, particularly a rise in accounts receivables. Management has forecast that CFFO will turn positive next year as a whole, but the CFO also suggested that CFFO would most likely not be positive in this current quarter. There are some specific factors including a transition to annual contracts, from multi-year business arrangements for both large customers and in the maintenance are as a result of what this company calls its M2S (maintenance to subscription). The details of cash flow in the current quarter were not indicative of any negative long-term trend. The company has forecast that it will generate $1.4 billion of free cash flow in FY â20 and many analysts and investors own the shares because of that projection. The path from the current level of cash generation to a $1.4 billion forecast will be mainly a function of a steep rise in projected profitability and maintaining the growth in deferred revenue balances. As mentioned earlier, there was nothing in this quarterâs results that might change anyoneâs views on the companyâs likelihood of achieving its target free cash flow - and for what it's worth, both the CEO and the CFO reiterated that goal.The issue that seemed to spook some investors the most was the companyâs announcement of a modest layoff. I'm not too sure why investors reacted as they did to this announcement. Arch-rival PTC (PTC) has announced more restructuring than the number of hot dinners most of us choose to consume. Overall, ADSK has presented investors with an outlook that calls for flat spending overall, both this current fiscal year and in fiscal 2019 as well. Inevitably, with that kind of an envelope, there are a series of changing priorities that need to be funded and that means some other activities will have to be curtailed.Autodesk has had its share of restructuring activities over the years. Last yearâs layoff was around 10% of the total employee base. This year, the layoff is 13%. Most investors have focused on the quantitative measures of the company's transition. That's why I initially got interested in looking at this name. But for some time ADSK had been a typical older software vendor, not quite keeping up with its competitors in some of its different solution categories. Re-prioritizing spending, painful as it is for some of the employees who have been re-prioritized out of a job, is a necessary adjunct to a transition that at the end of the day, has to include more than simply getting all of the customers to consume ADSK solutions ratably.The CEO, in his script, described the layoffs as âcoming from a position of strength.â I'm not sure I could readily agree with that assessment entirely, but there is no way to escape necessity in a software vendor of this age dealing with markets that have accelerated their evolution. Frankly, according to some reviews on Glassdoor, the company could use new talent in some business areas.Whatever else might be said, there's no objective basis for suggesting that the results of this past quarter were either a disappointment or represented any kind of negative inflection. The share price, from my perspective, had become disconnected from the reality of this companyâs business. ADSK competes in some high-growth markets but it is not now or will it be in the future a hyper-growth company. The shares are now better aligned with realistic assessments of this companyâs growth opportunities.I think investors can often get hung up on the mechanics of a transition and lose sight of the fact that vendors actually have to sell solutions to real users, regardless of how the users wind up consuming the products they buy. So, I have included some brief descriptions of what this company actually sells and who it competes with.Autodesk is best known as a leader in the CAD/CAM space. It has three offerings in the space which include AutoCAD, Inventor and Fusion 360. Fusion 360 is its leading product these days. According to the survey linked here, ADSK in all of its iterations is the leading vendor in the space, a bit ahead of Dassault (OTCPK:DASTY) which offers Solidworks. Fusion 360 runs in the cloud and gets very positive reviews such as the one linked above. The CAD space is notoriously cyclical with its violent ups and downs. Given the seemingly buoyant conditions in the global economy, it seems fair to think that Autodesk should be benefiting from market share gains in an expanding market.Autodesk also has a significant position in the PLM space. Its product, PLM 360 and PLM Fusion, are cloud based and get exceptionally strong reviews. I have linked to a set of reviews published by a third-party regarding PLM 360. In addition to CAD, Autodesk competes in several other areas. It has an exceptionally strong position in the Visual Effects software space (VFX). Many movies, games and other streaming media sources use the product as well as what is called Computer Generated Imagery (CGI). As some readers will know, there is essentially an Internet sub-culture that exists far beyond the consciousness of this writer.The company has long been a leader in the architecture, engineering and construction space. AutoCAD is part of the standard toolkit of architects these days. Some of the tools are fascinating to see in operation. ADSK offers a product called Revit which facilitates Building Information Modeling (BIM). The tool can design a building using some pre-defined building blocks literally before oneâs eye. Revit has a huge market share in its space and will probably remain the leader in the BIM market for the foreseeable future. Autodesk offers a platform called Forge which seems a reasonable name for a platform designed to share data to support the needs of construction work flows.The CEO of Autodesk believes that the architecture/construction space can drive $1 billion/year of revenue over time. Given that the overall CAGR of the space in the low teens, which includes products designed for the oil and gas industry as well as more specifically defined construction software, the projection doesnât seem quite so farfetched.Autodesk plays in markets with enormous TAMs relative to its size. It has strong competitive positions in all of its markets and in some it is a well-acknowledged leader. The company has never articulated a goal for a particular CAGR and it is more or less impossible to for a writer situated as I am to conjure a specific number. I think a reasonable guess for a CAGR for the entire totality of what ADSK offers and absent any transition effects is probably in the low double-digit range or possibly a bit higher as the companyâs cloud products start to become significant. Management spoke during this latest conference call about the growth of its cloud subscription base of 150% year-on-year, although, without some context in terms of the size of the base, it is hard to calibrate the overall impact of cloud solutions on ADSK revenues.I like to use three major valuation metrics as well as looking at the discounted cash flow in arriving at some kind of a conclusion regarding valuation for a name. That isnât feasible to do at this point looking at Autodesk.At this point, the company has made some rather aggressive projections with regard to its future operating model. Management is projecting that its non-GAAP operating margins will reach 34% in fiscal year 2020. For what it is worth, management raised its operating margin targets about one year ago and has reaffirmed its new targets consistently, both during this current earnings release and also in presentations made to investors in the last few days. The operating margin targets are basically a function of holding spending flat - still the stated goal and one that will be better facilitated by the planned layoffs, while revenues rise rapidly because of the growth in ARR and the end of the optics drag that comes from lapping the period in which the company was offering perpetual licenses. The business trends in the last quarter would actually seem to this writer to be substantiation that the company will most likely achieve its operating margin model in fiscal 2020. Management indeed held its GAAP spend to an increase of 2% last quarter, and the layoffs will cut GAAP operating expense to a run rate below year-earlier levels. Overall, GAAP spending is running below the level of the prior fiscal yearThe company has put some of its own stakes in the ground by making somewhat detailed and quite specific forecasts that relate to free cash flow in both its fiscal 2020 and in fiscal 2023. Most analysts, and most investors, seem willing to accept that the company will achieve both of the targets that it has set. The real question for investors at this point is just how much of the companyâs projections are embedded in the share price at this time. To reiterate, the company is forecasting that it will achieve $6 per share in free cash flow in its fiscal share 2020 and then achieve $11/share of free cash flow in its fiscal 2023. It has presented a quite specific bridge that illustrates the components of its anticipated cash flow performance in fiscal 2020.I have linked to the presentation above, but basically the company expects that its business model will generate $800 million in net income in 2020. The company is projecting a rather significant amount of depreciation, quite a bit higher than current levels, and a very substantial increase in deferred revenue growth which is projected to reach more than $500 million. The company also has forecast that A/R will increase with rising revenue, and with little change in DSO, and has projected a very modest level of capex. All of this yields a free cash flow projection of $1.4 billion, or more than $6/share.The company has been able to repatriate a substantial amount of cash to branches of Autodesk U.S. Much of this has been facilitated by the use of ADSK NOLs. In any event, the company has continued to buy back shares and to modestly reduce its outstanding share count. Despite the impact of share based comp, which is not insignificant at 13% of revenue, the company has decreased its outstanding share count by about 1.5% this fiscal year and it would seem reasonable to expect a similar trend through at least fiscal 2020 and most likely beyond that point.I saw the results of fiscal Q3 as more of a validation of the efforts of Autodesk to complete its business model transition than any kind of disappointment. I would far rather see the company focus on acquiring higher value net sub adds with less discounting, even if it means reporting a lower headline number for that metric. I think the controversy about the calculation and headline for ARPU is not germane to a discussion about the outlook for Autodesk. And while no one likes to see layoff - particularly layoffs of 13% in a business, that kind of action is consistent and necessary for the company to achieve its operating margin and cash flow targets.I wish I had a bit more visibility into the companyâs actual organic growth rate. It simply is not feasible for any outsider to specify, with any degree of accuracy, just how fast demand for the totality of ADSK solutions is rising. But I think, given the companyâs competitive positioning in what are relatively high-growth markets, projecting low-to mid double-digit organic growth is not unreasonable.There are certainly investors who have ingrained, self-imposed rules against catching falling knives. I often agree with that. But given some of the more speculative valuations that have emerged after what is now an 18-month tech rally, I think investors have to modify some of internal rules to find shares that are not valued at excessive levels. Autodesk makes that cut for me and I think at the current share price it is in a position to produce positive alpha for investors."

The system also helps organize content to help companies retain field documentation and glean insights from activities.Management is headed by Josh Kanner, who founded the firm in 2015 and previously founded Vela Systems, a construction project software firm that he sold to Autodesk in 2012. Autodesk also invested in Vela Systems before it acquired the firm.Below is a brief video on Smartvid.ioâs system:(Source: Smartvid.io, Inc.)According to a report, Smartvid.io currently has approximately 10 customers, but two of those customers, Suffolk Construction and Skanska, are large construction companies.Notably, in February 2017, Autodesk and Smartvid.io partnered to integrate Smartvid.ioâs machine learning and tagging system with Autodeskâs BIM 360 Field safety software to make videos and images searchable for safety and risk management purposes.Investment Terms and RationaleIn addition to Autodesk, investors in the current deal included Converge, Stage 1 Ventures, Launchpad Venture Group, Borealis Ventures, and Castor Ventures.Post-money valuation was not disclosed, although given Smartvid.ioâs early stage of development, it is likely under $40 million.The support of Autodesk is an important development for Smartvid.ioâs potential in the marketplace since Autodesk is a well-known and highly regarded name in project design software.Smartvid.io CEO Kannerâs previous relationship with Autodesk by his experience in the construction software business was also a help, as he is a âknown quantityâ to Autodesk.So how does Autodesk stand to gain from such an investment? Corporate investors are increasingly active in startup investing to gain insight into new applications of technology, new business models, and potentially disruptive impacts on their business.Autodesk also appears to increasing its investment activity in 2017, with four investments to-date, as the Excel spreadsheet shows below,Autodesk_Investments.xlsx(Source: VentureDeal)It isnât surprising that Autodesk continues to embrace new technologies that promise to affect the various business sectors it operates in; rather it is to managementâs credit that it is working to facilitate deal flow in order to stay abreast of new opportunities.Additionally, corporates such as Autodesk also receive âoptionalityâ in the form of potential strategic partnership opportunities and right of first refusal to acquire a promising startup if it is successful.Attracting new technologies, engineering and business talent to corporate operations is a necessary part of remaining relevant to never-ending customer demands for increased value from the software and services they purchase.In my view, Autodesk management is on the right track with its stepped-up technology investment and partnership activities.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, and IPOs.

4077637,52012,2017-05-31T10:22:20-04:00,"ADSK's conversion to a subscription model has been largely accepted by larger users but vehemently opposed by smaller customers.ADSK has reduced its R&D spending in order to manage costs.ADSK's financial position continues to worsen, such that its current ratio now borders 1.These factors combine to help push smaller customers to competitors and leave the company vulnerable to any headwinds, whether from execution risk or an economic downturn.","Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) recently released its Q1 earnings and hosted the associated earnings call with analysts. The new information includes several developments which impact my short thesis (and its update) which I discuss below.The PositivesThe biggest positive (for the company, not for my short position) was that promotions during the quarter managed to convert a number of legacy users into the subscription model. These new subscribers had been running perpetually licensed software with a median age of 7 years old.One of the biggest advantages that the subscription model has is its low upfront cost, which presumably persuaded a number of legacy users to turn in their old licenses in order to have access to the newest software paid on an ongoing subscription basis. The program's success was particularly noteworthy given that it was the second time that the company had held a similar promotion. Here's the excerpt from the earnings call describing this (with my slight edit to the voice to text translation):These wins are decidedly positive, but I do wonder what the churn rate (after the 3-year discount is over) will be for these new customers.The second positive was the company's excitement about the acceptance of its newer products, particularly its BIM collaboration and construction management tool ""BIM 360"" and its integrated product design and development software ""Fusion 360"". Since ADSK's earnings report isn't granular enough to break out these software sales directly (it breaks out revenues by product family only), the best I can do is to quote the earnings call transcript again to give a flavor of its optimism:This second point is much less quantitative than the first, and as I've mentioned in previous articles, ADSK's management is always ""pleased"" by its results, so though this too is a real net positive, it's much more difficult to know by how much or how to weight it in an overall appraisal of the company and its prospects.NeutralADSK has a road map for its fiscal year 2020 ARR, and the latest update is a classic ""glass half full/half empty"" situation where the most recent quarter has gotten it closer to being on track but still not there.Unfortunately for ADSK, the next quarter isn't likely to make up the gap as the company guided for a decrease in subscription additions:As a result, I personally still lean to the ""glass half empty"" side of the argument because I think that to get an overall CAGR of 24% over the projected time, you have to start out ahead of the curve (when the base numbers are small and there's low hanging fruit to be plucked), but I can understand those who might argue that it takes time to get a program rolling, and not until everyone is ""on board"" do you really begin to pick up steam. Hence, my ""neutral"" classification.The NegativesThe biggest negative is one that the company acknowledges but doesn't seem particularly concerned about. I deem it ""customer stratification"".Large customers have generally been accepting of the transition to the subscription model, presumably because the possibility of turning on and off seats is appealing to them, as is the cloud model. They will never be faced with the binary decision of paying for a subscription this month or not paying for it, so for them there's no real issue regarding what will they do if they can no longer afford to pay for the software at all. (That is, as long as they're willing to pay for a single seat, they'll have functional access to all the work product they've previously created.)Not so for smaller customers. Not only are they balking at the huge increases in the lifetime cost of the software, they're also feeling held hostage by the new paradigm as their entire historical library of work product will be as good as useless if their subscription (rental) lapses.In a previous article, I'd highlighted such customer reaction, and the company admitted as much on its call. Here are a few excerpts that capture the company's stance on this issue (with my emphasis):The bulk of the reaction is a bit dismissive of the small user's quandary (notice the use of the word ""noise"" to characterize the backlash), and it's also condescending in that ADSK knows better than its customers what's good for them - despite the much higher lifetime costs it is forcing customers to absorb. (After all, the main driver of the conversion is higher lifetime per customer revenue to ADSK).Moreover, the company doesn't at all address the concern regarding the loss of perpetual licenses and the customer's potential inability to use its own work product in the event it elects to allow its subscription to lapse.Rather, and throughout, ADSK dissembles by solely focusing on the customer's three-year ""benefit"" while the large discounts apply. Yet - when pressed - it does admit that after the three-year discount period, the anvil hits and customers will pay the going (though nominally still ""discounted"") rate for the subscription. Here's the quote from the earnings call with my emphasis:This customer stratification and high lifetime costs is one of the factors that will drive users to competitors over the longer term, but before I get to this, let me discuss a second negative:The company keeps telling everyone to ignore the financials, as they will look bad during the transition, but even understanding that comparisons to previous periods may not be particularly relevant (though we're well into the transition by now), there are still interesting observations to be made.First, the company boasted about its ability to maintain spend:Let's see where that year-over-year reduced spending came from. The two graphs below (one in absolute numbers and one in percentage change) show that the company's biggest expense is sales and marketing, and that that didn't decrease. Neither did G&A expenses. Instead, the ""savings"" came from the R&D side (it decreased by almost 3% over the year while the other two increased 5% and 14%, respectively). Short term, this might not matter, but longer term, this is part of what is opening the doors to competition. I'll discuss that in more detail below.ADSK Research and Development Expense (Quarterly) data by YChartsADSK Research and Development Expense (Quarterly) data by YChartsThe continuing net losses, coupled with steady share buybacks, have brought the company's current ratio down close to 1. Now certainly current liabilities include deferred revenue, and this is worked off by producing the product. But given that ADSK loses money each quarter, the costs of realizing the deferred revenues are likely on the same order as, or even larger than, the deferred revenues themselves.This suggests that there's no remaining liquidity to continue buying back shares in any meaningful quantities, and if trends continue, the company may have to turn to the bond or equity markets for future financing.ADSK Current Ratio (Quarterly) data by YChartsShould there be any hiccups down the road, either in execution of the (undisclosed) strategic plan or - probably more importantly - on the macro front, the company no longer has the financial resilience that it previously had to withstand these negative events. I'm now of the opinion that the catalyst for the short position will be from the normal economic cycle, where as soon as ADSK's customers undergo any type of slowdown or retrenchment, the effect will be enormously magnified on ADSK's stock price due to it currently being priced to perfection and the company having no remaining financial leeway. At that point, the stock price will drop dramatically - I only wish I could be more certain of the timing(!)CompetitionADSK's customer stratification and its curtailing of R&D spending have begun to open doors for competitors to woo ADSK's smaller customers. In particular, a private European firm, Bricsys (developer of the BRICsCAD software), is making a big push to do this, having recently held a user conference with a new emphasis on sales and marketing. Both cadalyst and blogger Steve Johnson covered the event, from which I cull the following comments and observations (all emphasis mine).First, the company's recent emergence as a competitor, partially fueled by its new support of Intergraph's CADWorx, and its commitment to stay focused on R&D, targeting an incredible 80% of it employees being developers:Second, it's run profitably which I personally believe proves that its model is sustainable even during inevitable economic downturns:Moreover, a focus on profitability leads to efficiency which overall leads to better and cheaper products:Finally, and most importantly, the company is committed to continuing to offer perpetual licenses and it claims to be getting positive reactions not just from ADSK's smaller customers but also from some larger ones:ConclusionDespite generating some positives in the most recent quarter, ADSK is, in my opinion, unlikely to meet long-term growth targets it has previously outlined. More importantly, ADSK's financial results continue to weaken its ability to withstand any execution or macro headwinds, and its conscious stratification of customers and its de-emphasis on R&D are opening the doors for competitors to win its smaller customers. It may take a year or more for the market to appreciate these dynamics, but I believe that it will happen, and whenever that time comes, ADSK's stock will undergo a dramatic drop. As a result, I remain short the stock and have actually added to my position at today's prices."
4098605,103555,2017-08-14T08:58:51-04:00,"Autodesk's SaaS transition is deteriorating its financial position more than is reasonable.The company's stock price, as well as the technology sector, is in extremely overvalued territory.A slowdown in the business cycle would create a vicious financial cycle.The best time to initiate a short position may be quickly approaching.","Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is a design software business that is attempting to ""modernize"" its business model through a cloud-focused, subscription-based service. This has drastically decreased margins and is driving the company into insolvency and illiquidity. Some financial deterioration is to be expected from this shift, but the current degree of instability exposes the company to much greater risks in the likely case the business cycle turns over. With a highly overvalued technology sector and preliminary recession signals, I believe Autodesk is an excellent short target.Autodesk management understood that shifting to a SaaS model would adversely impact the company's financials, stating:Management has taken the strategy of offering very large discounts on Autodesk products to encourage users to transition to its subscription model and eventually pay the full value. Before the beginning of the transition in 2014, the company was able to generate exemplary free cash flow margins of 25%. In 2016, that figure stood at a mere 4.6%. The business is still able to generate cash but is at risk of becoming illiquid. Sales have also declined over 20%, from $2.5 billion to slightly under $2 billion, and with many users wishing to switch to competing services, it is unclear if sales can fully recover.This change has also created a nearly $1.3 billion deferred liability, which has driven the liabilities-to-equity ratio to a dangerous 772%. Even this figure is generous, considering about 40% of Autodesk's assets are intangible. The company has cash reserves of $1.2 billion but a falling current ratio currently standing at 1.04.In the past year, it was still able to barely break cash flow even, but if the business model transition veers slightly off plan, then the company may run into liquidity problems and require high-yield financing.Note: All of the company-specific financial data presented here is gathered from SEC filings through Autodesk's SEC Filings.My central short thesis is that the company has dug itself into a hole that it may not be able to climb out of. This is not due to solely to upper management's actions, but also to an extremely overvalued equity market, combined with a declining macroeconomic environment. Autodesk is poised to become a poster child when the current bubble pops.Since the beginning of the year, the company is up 46%, and since the beginning of 2016, it is up a staggering 90%. This is not natural, especially with a large increase in idiosyncratic risks.Source: Technician by ChartIQWhile financials have been rapidly declining, ADSK stock price has nearly doubled. Investors appear to believe that Autodesk has the ability to not only recover financially but also thrive thereafter.The enterprise value-to-revenue of Autodesk is currently a staggering 12.6X, which is 225% of its 5-year average. The free cash flow yield on price is an incredibly low 40 basis points, and on enterprise value (which takes into account the company's precarious debt situation), that yield is a meager 26 basis points. Even if Autodesk could return to its five-year average free cash flow, the FCF/Price would be slightly less than 4%. Even in 2007, before the stock fell around 77%, the FCF/EV was 5.8%. In short, this is an incredibly overvalued company, especially when considering its uncertain financial situation.Much of this bullishness is likely due to the current 2000s-style technology bubble that surrounds the Autodesk ""cloud and social computing"" narrative. Similar narrative-pushing companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are up 50% YTD and should be viewed with similar skepticism. Just like the early 2000s, if a company's upper management convinces investors they are the ""future of an industry"", they will drastically increase the company's market cap and take home large bonuses. ARKW, the ARK Web x.0 ETF that holds many of these ""highly innovative"" stocks (though not ADSK), currently has an average P/E ratio around 40 and is up about 50% YTD. A very low 2.5% earnings yield in these companies could be fine if high sector revenue growth can be maintained for a long period of time. However, revenue growth is dependent on the greater business cycle. Recessions generally occur every five to seven years, and it has been nearly ten years since the last one. The flattening yield curve and a failure in achieving reflation serve as a sign the next bear market may be imminent. We are in another narrative-based bubble, and something will need to pop it.Since its inception 20 years ago, ADSK has fallen over 40% on six occasions and generally exhibits high systematic risk. The largest fall was in the 2008 GFC and took place after a similarly large and prolonged bull trend.Source: Technician by ChartIQGiven the bubble-ish market and slowing macroeconomic climate, it is unlikely Autodesk will be able to achieve its desired revenue stability soon enough. The financial deterioration from the company's SaaS transition has heightened cyclical risks instead of dampening them.If Autodesk management successfully repairs its balance sheet and achieves the desired subscription-based revenue stability, then cyclical risks may be dampened. In the long term, the SaaS model is a better model for the company due to its predictability and should bring greater long-run stability. Even still, I find it hard to believe the company can achieve the catastrophic revenue growth required by its current valuation.The combination of these factors has created a perfect storm for ADSK and makes it, in my opinion, a strong short target. I would give the stock a longer-term price target of $60 at the highest. Technology stocks have been more volatile recently, and it may be a good time to initiate a position. However, a traditional short position may be unwise because of ""blow off top"" risks, where the stock rapidly rises before declining. For this reason, I find long January 2019 $85 put options to be the most enticing. The maximum loss is capped, and if the stock declines as I believe, the option will give an extremely asymmetric payout.(Source: Options Profit Calculator)"

Here's one post from a disgruntled user highlighting various forums where customers are complaining about the forced transition from owner to renter (as the blog's author brilliantly describes the transition). There are way too many threads to address, but here's a screen shot from the ADSK community forum for a taste (taken at 7:15 PM PST on 4/17/17):Now before considering a follow-on post from the earlier referenced blog, remember in the most recent earnings call, ADSK had this to say about its upping the pressure on customers to switch from perpetual licensing to subscriptions (my emphasis):Here's our blogger, updating the "" revolt"" news after ADSK launched this new ""inducement"" (my emphasis):A related point was made in a roundup from ""COFES"" (congress on the future of engineering software, with my emphasis):Suffice it to say, despite ADSK painting the transition to subscription only as a ""win-win"" for the company and customers, there is a large contingent of vocal opposition, particularly among small and mid-sized firms. Moreover, the points they make are valid, and as a result, many of the critics are considering other vendors going forward.Competitor ReactionWe've already seen how BricsCAD is using ADSK's transition as a marketing opportunity, and their site includes discussion of license options and a direct side-by-side comparison to AutoCAD's features to help persuade current AutoCAD users to make the switch.SOLIDWORKS resellers are also using ADSK's transition. See, for example, this site which summarizes the choices with this graphic:Note that the first three items all pertain to ADSK's recent promotion, i.e. they only allow users to ""rent,"" they don't allow even long-term customers the choices they've previously enjoyed, and they're instituting a 38% price increase on maintenance to ""incentivize"" the transition. These themes are exactly the ones ADSK's small and medium-sized customers have been lamenting, and ADSK's competitor are seeking to cash in on it.ConclusionMy initial thesis that ADSK's transition to subscription-only licensing isn't proceeding as swimmingly as ADSK's management claims has been corroborated by user reactions and competitors' positioning. As a result, I am more confident in my ADSK short position and will continue to look for the stock to trade to my ultimate target of $36.50. I will also monitor the forums and blogs for more updated information as it becomes available.* The email came to an address that I use for my engineering work, so it had nothing to do with my writing about ADSK."
4061497,52012,2017-04-18T13:17:32-04:00,ADSK is being given too much leeway during its sales model transition.Current subscription numbers (AAR) aren't tracking well given ADSK's limited projections.The company's valuations are at extreme levels. This is partly disguised by the use of non-GAAP numbers which exclude stock-based compensation.I am short the stock with a price target of $36.50.,"Autodesk's (NASDAQ:ADSK) stock price has been in an uptrend for almost a year now; it hit 52-week highs in March and is still trading within 10% of that new high. Thus the ""Street"" appears enthusiastic about ADSK's prospects. But has the stock risen too far, too fast? I believe so, and I share my rationale in this article.(Source: Yahoo!)Why is the Stock Up?To orient readers unfamiliar with ADSK, here's a short description of the company's business taken from its SEC 10-K filing:The big development at the company over the past few years is primarily in how it sells its software and secondarily in the increased addressable market that the new sales model purportedly allows. Historically, ADSK sold its software as fully paid for with the option to keep the software current and to access technical support by paying an additional annual maintenance fee. This model is termed perpetual licensing since the buyer owned their software license outright from the date of their software purchase. Also, on this model, the software was run locally on the user's machine(s). The new model is a subscription-only model with an increasing cloud component. Users can only use the software while their subscription is current. The model offers much more flexibility in adding or subtracting access to software modules according to the user's current needs, and this flexibility is also expected to increase the TAM since smaller companies will be able to purchase access to needed modules on a project-by-project basis; they won't be faced with the decision of buying a perpetual license for software they may only use occasionally. The cloud features will also enable reduced development costs and increased user benefits, e.g. making mobile-friendly versions and apps feasible.The change in the sales model makes period-over-period comparisons much more difficult. because, in the perpetual license model, most of the cash is received upfront, while in the subscription model, little money is received up front, but there is a strong likelihood of ongoing periodic subscription payments from customers.The effects of the model change are widely known; see for example the three most recent ADSK articles here at Seeking Alpha. In fact, I recommend the most recent article because it presents a very strong part of the bullish argument viz. that other businesses that have undergone these types of sales model transitions have resulted in higher share prices, with Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) being the detailed example presented in the article.But before examining those arguments, let's also summarize the company's take on the transition and the guidance it has given, which I believe is a primary driver of the current stock price optimism. Here are a few excerpts from recent earnings calls (any emphasis is mine):From the Nov. 2015 call:From the Feb. 2016 call:The biggest takeaway is that despite a difficult sales model transition, ADSK is forecasting free cash flow of $6 per share in FY 2020 and $11 per share in FY 2023.Short ThesisHaving indicated reasons why the stock is currently sitting near 52-week highs, let me now summarize my short thesis which I will explore in detail below.Item one is difficult to summarize since the company does offer some revenue and other guidance, but when one reads through all the earnings transcripts, they see that there's really very little given in terms of specific subscription numbers or costs and timelines to transition customers from one model to the other. Instead, the company simply emphasizes how the numbers are consistent with its internal forecasts and it is always ""pleased"" with its ""strong"" results. As we'll see shortly, the one number upon which it says the whole transition depends is not tracking particularly well, so I personally am skeptical of the company's other non-quantitative assurances that everything is going as well or better than expected.My skepticism was further confirmed when, as part of the most recent earnings call, the company announced a huge discounting program to move maintenance customers over to the new model:The model change began in early calendar 2014, yet three years later, the company is offering 60% discounts to migrate customers over to the new model! It's hard to believe that this is all part of the original plan.As to point three, the one number the company has given (see above) is a CAGR on ARR of 24% anchored on FY 2016. Here are the actual numbers versus a smooth projected value:So far, the company is lagging projections substantially. Of course, it will protest that the transition is ""messy"", so there will be a lot of scatter in the data, but the counter argument is that the easiest time to make large percentage gains in ARR is when the baseline comparable number is small, and while there is still low-hanging fruit in terms of easy customers available to transition. If you can't hit the projections in those circumstances, why think you can do it (and catch up for lost time) on bigger numbers and with fewer easy-to-transition customers available? I personally remain very skeptical. Indeed the huge discounting discussed in point two above is much more understandable in light of the current ARR trajectory versus the projections.The next point in the short thesis is ADSK's reliance on non-GAAP numbers, in particular the omission of stock-based compensation. I've written on this topic in detail for several other companies (NOW, PFPT, WDAY, etc.), so I'll simply refer readers to those articles for my arguments on why dismissing stock-based compensation is highly problematic. Here I'll content myself with presenting the absolute and relative amounts of stock-based compensation used by ADSK over time:ADSK Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsThese trends aren't friendly to real (i.e. GAAP) profit margins.Finally, a word about valuations. During ADSK's sales model transition, all of the typical valuation metrics (P/S, P/E, P/CF, etc.) have risen to stratospheric levels, but as we've discussed, this may be attributable to the sales model transition exclusively. I personally think that the metrics have ballooned too high even accounting for the transition, but rather than make that more difficult argument, let's use the heuristic presented in the bullish SA article cited above. How does ADSK compare to ADBE which underwent a similar sales model transition?The answer, as the graphs below attest, is that ADBE never saw the types of valuations (and losses) that ADSK is now exhibiting. Indeed looking at the graphs suggests that ADSK can't hope to achieve the stock gains that ADBE did given the two companies' relative valuations.ADBE PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsADSK PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsMoreover ADBE never saw the negative profit margins and ensuing balance sheet destruction that ADSK is now undergoing:ADBE Profit Margin (TTM) data by YChartsADBE Price to Book Value data by YChartsTrading PlanGiven the information above, I'm currently short ADSK. I will be monitoring the actual vs. projected ARR to modify my price targets going forward, but at this point, I'm setting my price target by using a P/S value of 4 (which would be in line with the average P/S ratio that ADSK sported prior to its sales model transition), giving a current target of $36.5. As with most of my positions, I will/hope to gradually scale out as the stock moves towards my price target, and I may add to the short if the stock bounces from here."
4056477,102923,2017-03-20T10:10:11-04:00,Autodesk's decision to move to subscription model of its major product line will generate more consistent revenue.Autodesk's is showing more promising sales performance in emerging market; Its new subscription model will also guarantee more profit by reducing chance of licence pirating.Autodesk's existing product line will help it win the competition in emerging area such as VR and Photogrammatry.,"By Yingjing Lu, Xinhui Guo, Zichen Liu, and Xingjian YuCompany OverviewAutodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is a company that makes software for the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, media and entertainment industries. In 2016, Autodesk had over 9000 employees and generated $2.512 billion revenue with $228.8 net income. Autodesk has three collections of software products: architecture, engineering and construction; product design; media and entertainment. Each collection has multiple software products. Architecture, engineering and construction collection includes products such as Revit, AutoCAD, InfraWorks 360. Product design collection includes Inventor Professional and others. Media and entertainment collection includes, for example, Maya and 3ds Max. Autodesk's products are widely used in industries. Major industry-leading companies such as Airbus, Disney, deploy Autodesk's products in their business.In February 2015, Autodesk announced the transition from perpetual licensing to pay-as-you-go subscription plans. Under perpetual licensing, users pay one-time upfront fee to purchase legal license to the software. Under subscription plans, users pay for licensing of monthly, quarterly, annual, or multi-year term lengths, depending on users' needs. Subscription plans allow users to have the most up-to-date software without paying extra for updates. Under the subscription plan, users can also take advantage of the Autodesk cloud service that allows them to access software and files from any device they choose to use. In addition to providing payment and location flexibility, subscription plans prevent unlicensed usage of software better than perpetual licensing. The consequential financial benefits of this change of licensing model will be discussed further in later sections.Autodesk has huge growth potentials. Virtual reality has been a growing trend in technology, and Autodesk, having its visual, 3-dimensional design software, will be able to capture large percentage of the market share. We shall also consider the potential sales growth in industrial software. There has been rapid growth in property construction and public infrastructure in developing countries, such as China and India. Autodesk's construction and engineering software will be widely used in those countries to design buildings and transportation systems. The long-term construction growth in developing countries is great opportunity for Autodesk to generate sales revenue for the next decades.The key of Autodesk's success is whether Autodesk will be able to capture the profits from sales of software products in the developing countries. Licensing laws in such countries are incomplete and loosely executed. Many companies may use unlicensed software, which do not generate revenue for Autodesk. However, as we mentioned before, the new subscription plan model can largely prevent unlicensed usage of software. We believe Autodesk's software will be widely used in developing regions and generated increased sales revenue.The risk of Autodesk's future is whether it will be able to maintain its lead in the quickly-changing and highly competitive software industry. Although Autodesk currently has significant advantage, the fast pace of new software development and merger/acquisitions among existing companies and products can change the competitive landscape in a few years. Many leaders in the software industries have lost their advantages in a short period of time. However, we see Autodesk's strong initiative and commitment to stay ahead in the competition, to maintain its advantages and to advance further. With its current physical and intellectual assets, and its commitment to continuing research and development, we think Autodesk will advance faster than its competitors and widen the lead.Financial AnalysisIncome Statement from Yahoo FinanceGross profit had a 24.3% drop (from $648M to $512M) at the first quarter of 2016. It was mainly because the transition from license sale to subscription in the business model together with a big price decline (Yahoo Finance). However, strong subscription numbers increased its gross profit by 11% ($419M to $465M) from Q3 2016 to Q4 2016, and cutting in operating expenses decrease total loss from -$173M to -$93M.Cash Flow from Yahoo FinanceCash flow from operating activities had a 110% drop ($164M to -$18M) in the second quarter of 2016, mainly because the loss in Account Receivables ($397M to -$50.5M). Total investment in cash flow went from negative to positive ($430.8M) in the third quarter of 2016 for the first time within a year. However, capital expenditures remains steady from the fourth quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2016.Balance Sheet from Yahoo FinanceCash flow and equivalents had a 20% increase ($1.2M to $1.5M) during the second quarter of 2016. But short investments had a 43% decrease ($1.0M to $0.6M). So overall, total assets decreased in the second quarter, continuing from the first quarter. Total liabilities remains steady across fiscal 2016 (around $3.8M to $3.7M).Competitive Analysis:AutoCAD and its related product line serving artitecture, manufacturing and construction industries has been the flagship and most profitable product line. Compared to its competitors, AutoCAD is more affordable, easy to learn and competently functional. According to Forbes, Autodesk has achieved more than 85% market share in major areas in Europe and America with its CAD product line in 2015. The stable market share has made AutoCAD series an universal industrial standard which greatly improves user fidelity.Architecture, Engineering and Construction Product Line:AutoCADAutoCAD LTAutodesk InventorAutodesk RevitAutodesk VaultAutodesk Fusion 360Competitors:ANSYS. ANSYS is a company that provides solutions for CAD and simulation for construction and manufacturing. However, ANSYS puts more emphasis on its simulation algorithm instead of its CAD part. On the other hand, Autodesk puts more emphasis on the ease of use of CAD drawing process. As a result, many professional users usually use AutoCAD to brainstorm and to draw the models and them import their model into ANSYS to run simulation. In this most commonly used scenario, ANSYS's and Autodesk's product line are identified as complements than direct competing substitutes.Bentley & AVEVA Systems. The above two companies are both identified as competitors in the manufacturing CAD area with Autodesk. Compared with Autodesk, those two companies are focus more on the users in highly sophisticated industries such as aero plane design, ship design and energy plant design. As a result, they usually deliver more integrated solutions from design software to simulation to visualization. For example, AVEVA's solution for chemical engineer industries delivers CAD software for the design of the plant, thermodynamic simulation of plant, stress test and visualization of plant operation. The holistic solution that those companies deliver make the two competitors occupies a lot of market shares in those industries where they are targeting at. But at the same time, because their solutions are really focused, the pricing of their product is unaffordable for middle scale and small scale design companies. Even in large industrial design institutions, AutoCAD is still the competent one to accomplish regular design work. As a result, Autodesk's product line is more competitive in occupying the mainstream industries and market share.Media and Entertainment Product Line:Autodesk MayaAutodesk 3ds MaxAutodesk Motion BuilderAutodesk MudboxIn the media and entertain 3D software market, Autodesk Maya and Autodesk 3ds Max are unquestionably dominating products in those market. Both of those software delivers fast and easy workflow for animators and modelers. Through third party collaborators such asV-Ray, I-Ray and lighthouse, Autodesk's software can deliver more realistic simulation and more efficient rendering flow (which is one of the most important part for animation industries to optimize their workflow). Also, most peripheral products such as game engines and motion tracking software all natively support models created from Maya and 3ds Max. Furthermore, Autodesk works closely with hardware developers such as NVIDIA and AMD to make sure their newest hardware acceleration features such as AMD OpenCL and NVIDIA CUDA can optimize Autodesk products. All of those aspects make Autodesk M&E software the fastest, most widely used, and most compatible software in the mainstream market.Competitors:Cinema 4D is considered as a substitute product for Autodesk Maya, but not as powerful as Maya. Both of these products provides modeling, animating and rendering features. However, Cinema 4D is not optimized for hardware acceleration. As a result, Cinema 4D right now is only limited in small scale animation production. Furthermore, Cinema 4D does not have a great community of developers to provide motion tracking support and real time rendering such as I-Ray.Another example is Zbrush which can be a great complement for Autodesk 3ds Max in the rapid modeling field. Zbrush provide more intuitive brushing interface that allows creators to sculpt models in a faster way. However, 3Ds Max is stronger in rendering textures. As a result, modelers usually use Zbrush to create models and put them into 3Ds Max for rendering. As a result, the two competing software can work as complement to each other's weakness and thus make their competition in the market less intrusive.Emerging Area (AR; VR; 3D Printing; Photogrammetry) Product Line:Autodesk MayaAutodesk 3ds MaxAutodesk RemakeAutodesk RecapAutodesk 123D CatchAutodesk, compared with other startup companies, have more competitive advantage in the emerging areas such as VR AR, 3D printing, and photogrammetry. For VR and AR development, Autodesk's Maya and 3Ds Max are already the industrial standard for development. Most of the VR and AR engines such as Unity3D, Vuforia, and Cry Engine have innate support to Autodesk's interface. In terms of 3D printing and Photogrammetry, Autodesk's dominating CAD product line and its rapidly developing new products 123D Catch, Remake and Recap are competitively powerful tools for current workflow in those areas. Even though there are more new companies such as 3D Systems, Rhino, and 3D Flow provide more affordable options, we still think that Autodesk, with its already well-rounded design product ecosystem and its industry standard that results in its dominating market share, will be the flagship in the emerging market as well.Investment Theme:The major investment theme of going long for Autodesk is that we regard Autodesk as the leading CAD software company and as its business model changed from licensing to subscription, it will face a short term drawback, which is the situation right now, but will gain more sustainable growth in the future.Advantages of Subscription Model:Autodesk's current stock price drop mainly results from its change of business model. As its major CAD software switch from one time licensing to subscription, Autodesk is facing the issue of lack of subscribers and the short term defer of its revenue.Lack of subscribers is the current issue that Autodesk is facing.From the graph one can observe that Autodesk's revenue peaks at mid 2015 and dramatically decreased after mid 2016. We interpret the trend as a result of its switching to subscription model. Autodesk receives nearly constant revenue before 2014 because if its stable sales performance. However, after it first announced the plan for subscription during mid 2014, more perspective users crowded to buy one time licence which result in its growth from mid 2014 to 2015. After the mania of licence starts to discharge, the future users who Autodesk foresees going to buy its subscriptions already has life long license. As a result, Autodesk receives less initial subscribers and did not get stable revenue after switching.The short term deferral of its revenue is because of the nature of subscription which is the payment of the licence will be spread out and result in less one time revenue within a quarter. Traditionally, when a user is buying the software one time, he or she will have to pay more than thousand dollars at one time to gain the licence. These one time payments offers huge revenue and cash flow for the Autodesk. When it comes to subscription, users only pays half hundred a month, as a result, with the price of the software spread out, the short term revenue is diluted.Our counter argument for lack of subscribers is that Autodesk is gaining a subscription growth. Autodesk reports that there are 24% subscription growth during Q4 of 2016 compared with other quarters. And the subscription growth is getting stronger in the first quarter of 2017. Even though Autodesk projects the revenue loss contributed by subscription is not expecting to recover due to the promotional discount of the subscription, it is highly expectable for future strong revenue growth after gaining a huge amount of subscribers.The deferred revenue due to the nature of subscription will also be compensated in the long run. Furthermore, The advantage of subscription brings more steady monthly income and less possibility for pirating.A comparable example is Adobe. Both Adobe and Autodesk are software companies which dominate its field. As Adobe switched its model from one time licensing to subscription during mid 2013, one can see similar trend of short term revenue losses in the graph. However, After Adobe's subscribers increases, its gains huge improvement of revenue afterwards. And we project Autodesk will have similar success as Adobe.Evaluation and Projected GrowthThe way we model Autodesk's projected growth is by comparing its predecessor Adobe.The graph shows the stock price of the two companies in the five year period. The two triangles mark the time two companies switch to their subscription model as they are today.As claimed in the previous part, Adobe is comparable with Autodesk in its company profile side because both of these companies are industrial standard professional software developer. They all have market dominating products (Adobe's Creative Cloud Product line VS Autodesk's Engineering and Manufacturing product line). Further, Both of those companies switched their business model from lifetime licensing to subscription.From the graph, in the technical side, both of those companies' stock price experienced drop during the switch period and then recovered.As Adobe projected about 4 times growth after switching to subscription in 3-year-period, we offer a relatively similar projection of Autodesk's growth of about 3.5 times achieving projected price of $140 per share counting for dividends in 3 years.As Autodesk's current price stays around $86 per share, we can still expect 63% growth in three years.Investment Summary HighlightsWe recommend to take a long position of Autodesk for a 3 year period for about 63% growth. The major theme of the investment is that Autodesk is the leading software developer in CAD and media entertainment area with its industrial standard software. As Autodesk have just changed its operation business model to subscription licensing from lifetime licensing of its major products. This new model will offer Autodesk more consistent long term revenue and will secure its growth in the emerging market."

The results are due to faster adoption of the new cloud based business model. Investors should stay bullish on AutoDesk as the fundamentals, a streamlined cloud offering, and expansion into emerging markets support the shares appreciation.AutoDesk reported a loss of $0.16 per share on top line revenue of $486 million beating analyst estimates on both the top and bottom line. Analysts forecasted a loss of $0.24 per share on sales of $470.4 million.Revenue was negatively affected due to accounting being measured ratable over the next year versus upfront due r transition into a subscription model.Management broke out a more detailed view of revenue across three categories; subscription revenue, maintenance revenue and licenses and other. Most of the growth came from subscription and maintenance revenue. Subscription annualized revenue grew an astounding 103% to $692 million year over year. Maintenance plan, which is AutoDesk's service offering updates to active users, decreased 7% year over year to $1.05 billion. Management has ended its sale of the old perpetual licensing.The first quarter saw an addition of 233,000 subscription plans, formerly known as the New Model, for a total of 1.32 million plan subscribers. Total subscriptions grew by 186,000 from the subsequent quarter to a total of 3.29 million subscribers.During AutoDesk's conference call management explained that recurring revenue now accounts for 90% of total revenue and ~33% of subscribers were first time customers to AutoDesk. New customer growth was driven by AutoDesk's marketing campaigns and how the cloud offers ease of access in emerging markets. Revenue in the regions of EMEA and APAC were reported as $190 million and $86 million down 6% and 3% respectively. The relatively small decrease can be partially offset by the ratable accounting and issues related to currency conversionBarron's had upgraded AutoDesk prior to the earnings to a price target of $120.00 citing the accelerating adoption by customers into the newer subscription model. To put this quarter into some context Barron's forecasted it's price target based on estimates of subscriber additions of 120,000-140,000. AutoDesk reported 46,000 more subscribers than the top end of this forecast and is trading at above $105.00 after hours. Further reasons for the upgrade came from AutoDesk's management ability to repatriate $1.7 billion in foreign cash as it plans to use the bulk of this to repurchase shares.AutoDesk guided second quarter FY2018 revenue to $488 - $500 million and expects a loss of ($0.16) per share. AutoDesk also announced a few price increases of its products including a 5% increase in maintenance service. AutoDesk delivered strong quarterly results and is positioned to deliver continued growth in the second half of 2017."
4030850,21968,2016-12-15T17:29:05-05:00,"ADSK is pitching a story of a smooth shift to a subscription model.However, its underlying cash flow reveals that the path is bumpy.The stock is worth far less than its current price.","BackgroundAutodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is a software company offering products that primarily manage design and construction. These products help in drafting, detailing and documenting workflows. Its customers are in the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing and media industries.The company's share price fell after its recent poor earnings report, but has quickly rebounded and then some. The company is the largest (or one of the largest) holding for a number of hedge funds, and the conspiracy theorists would posit that these funds are driving up the price into year-end to goose up their returns.Transition from Software Licenses to SubscriptionsQuite a few companies have successfully transitioned their software business from a sale of licenses to an ongoing subscription model. Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) stand out, and one can throw Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) into the mix as well. During this period, revenue and profits decline as a sale is recognized ratably rather than at once. However, cash flow remains largely stable. Thus, one can discern the true performance of the company by looking at what the operating and free cash flows are. In the case of INTU and ADBE, the cash flows were relatively stable as they made the transition, and the stocks have gone up in the last few years as they have morphed into recurring revenue businesses. ADSK is currently making this transition, and it is notable that its cash flow has shrunk markedly as expenses have ballooned. It appears as if the company is discounting its products, while getting a pass from investors attributing its poor financial performance to the transition.Financial overviewSimilar to my article on Ascent Capital (ASCMA) a few months ago, I will focus on providing an overview of the financial picture at the company and avoid the qualitative elements that do not have a bearing on the thesis.The company has a market cap of $17.5 billion, with $2.4 billion of cash and $1.5 billion of debt, resulting in an enterprise value of $16.6 billion.The company has had revenue of approximately $2.5 billion in the last few years, with a slow shift from license to subscription, about equal in magnitude in the fiscal year ending January 2016. The company continued to ramp up expenses, resulting in the operating margin going from 12.5% to 0% in three years. During this period, the company used its free cash flow to buy back stock, but given the copious amount of stock-based compensation (~$200 million per year), the share count remained steady. The company took on $750 million of debt to fund acquisitions.This year, the company hastened its shift towards subscriptions by halting the sale of licenses for many products. As a result, license revenues have plummeted, down 35%, with no corresponding increase in subscription revenue (the increase in software subscription revenue has been offset by a decrease in maintenance revenue on prior license sales). As a result, overall revenue is expected to be down close to 20% this year. The company has kept expenses steady, and operating income has gone deep into the red, to the tune of ~$100 million per quarter. On the face of it, this would not be a big cause for concern if the company was receiving cash for its services, but just not recognizing the revenue. However, this has decidedly not been the case. The company's cash flow from operations is down substantially YoY. Over the last 12 months, free cash flow is close to zero. There has been a minimal increase in deferred revenue, with a decrease in accounts receivable being a major source of cash. The company has continued to buy back stock, drawing down its cash balance.I do not find it useful to track EBITDA or use it as a valuation measure, but this metric has turned negative as well.Analyst estimates call for the company to grow revenue 7% next year, with a decreased loss. I should point out that analyst profit estimates ignore the substantial amount of stock-based compensation amounting to $0.75 per share, assuming a 20% tax rate. I would regard stock-based compensation as a genuine cost and would not ignore it when valuing a business.It appears that the company has been mismanaged, with uneconomical acquisitions, ballooning operating costs and declining revenue. It has found a convenient excuse in pointing to the transition in its business model. Not one to waste a crisis on an opportunity, the company has also ramped up the restructuring charges it is taking, amounting to $70 million year to date. Optimists' hopes that profitability will eventually exceed peak historical levels seem to be misplaced. In the absence of near-term profits, investors are free to use their imagination to dream about the riches that will follow in the future, and that is what they seem to be doing.Valuation: Fair value of $55 for the stockThe company has earned a maximum of $1 per share on a GAAP basis in the last few years. At its peak free cash flow year, the company generated $2 per share, aided by a healthy amount from accounts payable and accrued liabilities. (Please note that I deduct stock-based compensation when I calculate free cash flow in order to derive a number comparable to GAAP EPS.) I will give the company the benefit of the doubt and assume that at some point, it can generate $2 per share. This would equate to the company's revenue rising to $2.5 billion from the current $2 billion, a 25% operating margin, and a 20% tax rate. (The company's operating margin has not exceeded 15% in the past).Put a 25x multiple on $2 of EPS and you get $50 per share. Add $5 for the value of the net cash (or half the cash) on the balance sheet, and you get $55 per share. That's 30% downside from the current price of $79, which actually isn't very dramatic when you consider the stock was below $50 earlier this year. This valuation would also correspond to a healthy 4 to 5x multiple on revenue. I believe this valuation is quite generous and there could be more downside if margins do not recover rapidly.Risks are manageableThe biggest risk to a short thesis is an acquisition of the company. At an $18 billion market cap, it is within the range of a possible acquisition by one of the larger tech players like Microsoft or Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).The short interest is low (4% of float), so the chances of a short squeeze are not very high. However, one cannot rule this out. There is a risk of the stock going up due to the company obfuscating its results by providing a number of non-GAAP metrics that get investors excited. An overvalued stock can always get more overvalued.Increased infrastructure spending could give a temporary bump to subscriptions. It is hard to gauge the impact of this, because it could also be offset by lower demand from the commercial construction side due to higher interest rates.Finally, there is a risk that the company succeeds in dramatically increasing its revenue, margins and earnings. I would view the chances of this happening to be slim.Revenue analysisFor those looking for more information on the company's revenue:Revenue split by geography: 42% Americas, 40% EMEA, 18% Asia Pacific.Revenue split by product family: 44% architecture, engineering and construction; 31% manufacturing; 15% AutoCAD; 7% media and entertainment; 3% otherRe-sellers are responsible for 74% of revenue, with Tech Data (NASDAQ:TECD) accounting for 30%."
4018708,22742,2016-11-03T05:15:46-04:00,Strategy overview and why I hedge.A candidate to consider that is highly overvalued right now.A brief discussion of the risks inherent to this strategy.,"I hope that my articles provide the above to some investors who feel they need it!Back toAugust UpdateStrategy OverviewIf you are new to this series you will likely find it useful to refer back to the original articles, all of which are listed with links in thisinstablog. It may be more difficult to follow the logic without reading Parts I, II, IV and X. In Part I of this series I provided an overview of a strategy to protect an equity portfolio from heavy losses in a market crash. In Part II, I provided more explanation of how the strategy works and gave the first two candidate companies to choose from as part of a diversified basket using put option contracts. I also provided an example of how it can help grow both capital and income over the long term. Part III provided a basic tutorial on options. Part IV explained my process for selecting options and Part V explained why I do not use ETFs for hedging. Parts VI through IX primarily provide additional candidates for use in the strategy. Part X explains my rules that guide my exit strategy. All of the above articles include varying views that I consider to be worthy of contemplation regarding possible triggers that could lead to another sizeable market correction.I have stressed in previous articles of this series that I generally do not predict recessions or bear markets. Recessions and market corrections are just part of the investing experience. They occur when we least expect them. This is why I hedge. I began in 2014 by using about 1 Â½ percent of the value of my portfolio to hedge against a potential portfolio loss of 30 percent or more. Then, as I was able to capture some sizable gains from a few positions, my cost for that first year was reduced to less than one percent of my portfolio. It amounts to an inexpensive form of insurance and provides me with peace of mind. Last year my gains were much more significant and I was able to offset all of my hedging cost for 2015, the remaining costs from 2014 and have plenty left over to extend my hedge well into 2016. So, now I am basically working with house money, so to speak, and my portfolio remains fully hedged against loss. For a full accounting of the results from last year and a summary of 2014 and 2015 please refer to this article.If the market moves to new highs and I miss the next ten percent move higher I will not be distressed. As long as I miss the majority of the next big leg down, be it 30 percent or 50 percent or more, I rest well at night knowing that I kept my portfolio intact. I prefer to buy stocks at prices that I consider to be bargains relative to the value of the company. There is very little that meets my criteria in that regard in the markets today. Thus, I remain cautious and fully hedged.A Little ReviewAs I looked over the list of the Fortune Global 500 (from the August 1, 2016 magazine issue), I noticed something that gave me pause: a majority of companies' revenues declined from 2014. So I did a little analysis (nothing you can't verify as long as you can count, add and divide). Here is what I found: revenue declined year over year for 364 of the 500 (72.8 percent); of the 134 on the list from the U.S., 68 had declining revenue (50.7 percent); China, the country with the 2nd most number of companies on the list, had 48 of 103 with declining revenue (46.6 percent); Europe, home of the almighty EU, had 138 out of 144 companies on the list experiencing a decline in revenue (95.8 percent); and in Japan 44 of 49 companies had declining revenue (89.8 percent).Declining revenue by this many companies seems to indicate that the demand side of the supply/demand economic scale may be falling. It could not happen at a worse time. The supply side of the equation is out of balance, too, with many industries having expanded beyond the world's current appetite to consume. The obvious areas are in mining and energy, but steel production (thank you China) as well as rail and trucking (at least in the U.S.) have excess capacity, too. The problem has existed since at least late 2014 but awareness is just catching up to reality.There will be pundits who will undoubtedly try to tell us that global demand will grow enough to take up the slack and all will be well. Their logic is based solely on the expectation of continued low interest rates for many years to come. If we continue down that path much longer we become Japan, relying on financial and monetary stimulus for all eternity. It has not worked for the Japanese and it will not work for the rest of the world. Japan could improve its lot with dramatic government reforms. The same could probably be said for Europe, and lord knows the U.S. could use some common sense in Washington, D.C. That is not a political statement, by the way. I do not like either candidate. If you want a little more of my opinion about the state of the global economy and what is driving the slow down please refer to my earlier article here.One thing I do know is that Wall Street does not like Donald Trump. As Election Day draws nearer and the polls show the race tightening, investors and (especially) Wall Street are getting very nervous. What will happen if Trump actually wins? No one knows! That is the problem. Uncertainty scares Wall Street and the markets. That is why I am looking to add new positions over the next few days to potentially take advantage of the possible melee that could emerge suddenly next Wednesday. One more reason as to why I hedge.A new position to consider: Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK)Autodesk is overvalued by every measure I use and yet the stock continues to hold up very well. The company will probably beat expectations this quarter but that will be a meaningless gauge of how well it is performing. Last year in the same quarter, ADSK posted EPS (earnings per share) of $0.14 per share. The consensus estimate for this quarter EPS is for the company to lose $0.24 per share. Results in fiscal 2016 (ended January 31, 2016) were terrible and things keep getting worse.Long-term debt almost doubled in 2016 from $743 million to $1.487 billion. Operating expenses rose while revenues fell slightly causing the bottom line to show a loss of $330.5 million compared to a profit of $81.8 million in 2015. And things have gone from bad to worse. The loss has increased in the TTM (trailing twelve month) period and if consensus is close it will continue its decline, even if it beats expectations. Take a look at my Friedrich data file below to follow the trends. Green is good and red is bad. Notice how much more red is showing up in the last two years. The trend began in 2013 and has just kept getting worse ever since. Notice the line labeled Revenue Growth Ratio; from 10 percent in 2015 to flat in 2016 and now a negative 8 percent over the TTM period. Also notice how the free cash flow line (labeled Friedrich Cash Machine) also goes from positive to negative. This is before the company buys back shares to prop up the share price. When a company cannot produce any FCF the value, according to Friedrich, drops to zero. I focus on FCF because it cannot be manipulated like EPS. Cash is cash. If a company has to borrow to meet its operating cash needs, as is the case with ADSK presently, I do not want to own the stock.Source: Ask FriedrichNow I want to get into some other valuation models from other sources I use to confirm my Friedrich assessment. When I look up ADSK on oldschoolvalue.com I find three valuations using the models the site uses. The first is the DCF (Discounted Cash Flows) model which produces a value of $-46.34. This is probably the most appropriate of the three models, in my opinion. The second uses Graham's Formula to come up with a value of $-24.83 per share. Since this is not a high growth company it to be less suitable. The third model (EBIT Multiples) looks at the income statement and applies historical multiples to determine a value of $18.85. Pick your poison. The current share price is $68.68 as of the market close on Wednesday, November 2). Whichever model you like the current price is out of whack relative to recent results.So, what do I want to do? I want to buy put options, of course, to use as a hedge against my equity portfolio holdings. These are going to be more expensive than the ones I have listed in previous articles because I want to go all the way out to January 2018 expiration. That could give me the time I need to capture most, if not all, of the gain I anticipate. My target price is $18 now, in line with the EBIT model valuation. I will need two contracts that expire January 19, 2018 with a strike price of $47.50. I want to pay no more than $2.65 per share for each contract. My total cost (plus commissions) will amount to $530 with the total potential gain (if ADSK stock price hits my target price of $18 before expiration) is $5,370, or 1,013 percent return on the original investment. The reason for the two contracts is to get as close as possible to a gain of $3,750 for the position. Since option contracts trade only in round lots of 100 shares per contract I chose to round up, so to speak.This position is designed to protect 1/8 of a $100,000 equity portfolio. If I have a portfolio of $500,000 I would want to buy seven contracts ($500,000 x .3 = $150,000 / 8 = $18,750 / (5370/2) = 6.98) to protect 1/8 of my portfolio against a market downturn of 30 percent or more over the next year. I have used just over one half of one percent of my portfolio for this one position. If I were to add seven more positions I would need to use over four percent of my portfolio to protect against a loss of $30,000 or more should our economy were to fall into a recession. This is more than I would generally like to use so I will be looking for some more economical positions over the next few days.Discussion of RiskI want to discuss risk for a moment now. Obviously, if the market were to rally higher beyond January 2016 these option contracts could expire worthless. I have never found insurance offered for free. We could lose all of our initial premiums paid plus commissions, except for those gains we have already collected. But it is one of the potential outcomes and readers should be aware of it. The longer it is before the next recession the more expensive the insurance may become. But I will not be worrying about the next crash. Peace of mind has a cost. I just like to keep it as low as possible.Because of the uncertainty in terms of whether the market will turn into a full blown bear or regain the high ground and the risk versus reward potential of hedging versus not hedging, it is my preference to risk a small percentage of my principal to insure against losing a much larger portion of my capital (30 to 50 percent). But this is a decision that each investor needs to make for themselves. I generally do not commit more than three percent of my portfolio value to an initial hedge strategy position and have never committed more than ten percent to such a strategy in total before a major market downturn has occurred. When the bull continues for longer than is supported by the fundamentals (which is where we are today in my opinion), the bear that follows is usually deeper than it otherwise would have been. In other words, at this point I would expect the next bear market to be more like the last two, since the market has, in my opinion, defied gravity until now. Anything is possible but if I am right, protecting a portfolio becomes ever more important.When the next crash does happen I will be relying on a tool called Friedrich the best bargains. I use it to highlight valuations in some of my other articles as I find it comes very close, in most cases, to my own valuation model results and takes me a lot less time. It is also going global, so I am excited about being able to scour most of the globe in search of value. When the USD finally does peak in value relative to other currencies I will want to invest more of my portfolio carefully in foreign based stocks to take advantage of the positive currency movements in the future. Value is value no matter where we find it.As always, I welcome comments and will try to address any concerns or questions either in the comments section or in a future article as soon as I can.

4027455,98236,2016-12-01T00:43:04-05:00,"Autodesk reported the results of its fiscal Q3 yesterday afternoon.The results were a beat for the reported quarter and guidance that was felt by some to be negative.The shares fell about 3%, although most of the headlines about weak guidance were far from the mark.The company is tracking well towards its new model financial goals, and sub adds showed a nicely positive trend.That being said, I no longer believe there is much short-term positive alpha, and think investors can take profits in the name at this point.","Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) - Featuring the model of a modern-day transition forecastAutodesk reported the results of its fiscal Q3 yesterday. The results significantly exceeded the expectation of the consensus with revenues of $490 million and EPS of -$.18. Prior expectations had been for revenues of $477 million and an EPS loss of -$.24. That sounds good. It really isn't all that significant.Simply put, the purchase case for Autodesk shares has been, and remains, that the company's transition program, in which it moves its entire revenue stream from on-prem to subscriptions and to the cloud, is going to create what many believe to be incredible financial results. Note that the meaning of the word incredible is that it is not believable. Management has forecast that revenues will achieve a 24% CAGR over the next 3 years, and that free cash flow will increase by more than 4X. There is nothing in the quarterly earnings release that could be construed as impacting that argument; some observers, including myself, might feel that the results in terms of net new model subscriber adds are a positive signpost toward the company's goal. This goal has been articulated many times by management, and it remains their mantra.I think it's worth repeating. Headlines aside, the shares are not down because of the guide the company gave for the current quarter. The specifics of the guide have no relevance to the transition. The one figure that is of significance - net sub adds - saw an increased forecast. It will be several years before headline numbers in terms of either revenues or earnings have relevance in determining the progress of this company.The shares have sold off a bit and are down a couple of per cent as I write this. But Autodesk shares have recently achieved all-time highs in the wake of the Trump rally and the expectation that a boom in infrastructure spending will lead to stronger demand for its AutoCAD product line. I think the expectations with regards to AutoCAD seem reasonable. The shares have appreciated by 50% since post-Brexit lows and by about 20% since the company last reported results. There isn't all that much that the company might be able to do to keep up that pace - that is the basic reason behind what has been reported as a pullback.I have written in some detail about ADSK twice now, and the shares have done well, and perhaps better than I might have anticipated in a short time frame. They are up 27% since my first article was published in April, and that compares to an 11% gain for the IGV software tech/index over the same time span. In the short term, and in the wake of its new high, I do not suppose there is much positive alpha remaining in the next few months unless more investors decide to put money on Trump-influenced names.The shares seem unlikely to appreciate another 20% over the next quarter - unless the company gets consolidated, a low odds bet, in my opinion. I will take my position off the table for now and look for some kind of a pullback to re-establish my position. Long-term investors really don't need to do anything. Life is decent at Autodesk, and exogenous factors, including both the Trump play and the assault on pirates, seem real enough. (Management believes more than half of the population of AutoCAD seats have come from illegal sources.)Autodesk - A company with many, many numbersADSK, in the midst of its transition, is a company that reports lots of numbers, and is said by some, therefore, to have many moving parts. It really has but 3 major revenue streams to consider, and is not particularly a complicated company to analyze in that regard. Given that ADSK has gone cold turkey with regard to how it offers its product, many of the numbers the company has just reported and will report in the near future do not serve to illuminate the success of its business. There is no feasible way of adding any value to the understanding of readers and investors without referring to some of the metrics that the company reports and that are the source of headline commentary in analyst reports. But for those looking for an avenue to avoid the tedium of the torrent of numbers, suffice it to say that a couple of the metrics were displeasing to some analysts and require more explanation. But with all the numbers that are produced, it is possible for a roomful of analysts to produce a ""buildingful"" of opinions supported by one metric or the other. As was once said of Mark Twain, reports of the company's disappointing outlook are greatly exaggerated.Most headlines in the wake of the earnings release are talking about what is described as a ""light"" forecast. And the headlines look that way. But one doesn't have to go very far beyond the headlines to see that what seems bad is good - I won't quite say what seems good is bad.In a transition from a model based on the sales of licenses and maintenance to a model based on subscription transactions, the more quickly revenues decline, the faster the transition is going. If you own, or are thinking of owning, ADSK shares, you are simply unconcerned with the amount of revenue the company is generating from legacy sources.Yes, the forecast for traditional headline metrics looks light, but it is in fact what might be hoped for from a modern-day transition forecast. (That lead-in to this section is taken from a song, ""I am the model of a modern Major General"" that is part of the Pirates of Penzance, a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta of the late 1870s. For those interested in the origin of the title, which has to do with the abolition in Britain of the Purchase of Commissions in its armed services, I am happy to supply it on request - but beware, one ought to be familiar with the political situation in the UK and the rivalry between Disraeli and Gladstone of that era.)Analysts appeared to be concerned about a relatively arcane statistic called growth in annual recurring revenues (ARR), which came to $43 million this quarter as compared to $63 million last quarter. Was that a problem? Without presenting all of the details that go to making up that particular number, the end of license sales this past quarter meant that a former expense has now been classified as a contra-revenue. Beware contra-revenues. In addition, mix swings and the specific timing of larger enterprise purchases also lead to what appears to be a ""light"" quarter when it comes to ARR growth. Autodesk offers many different subscription plans with different contract durations and different prices. That also had a role in how ARR is reported, but not in what longer-term revenue expectations ought to be.In addition to ARR, usually investors are interested in the growth in the number of subscriptions. New model subscriptions, the most important number in this group, grew by 168,000, which was quite a bit above prior forecasts and expectations. The net increase in total subscriptions for the quarter, excluding those acquired when the company bought Solid Angle, was 121,000.In the prior quarter, the growth in subscriptions was 109,000 and the growth in new model subscriptions was 125,000. The company raised the low point of the range it has used to forecast subscriptions substantially; surprisingly, no one on the call chose to focus on that metric, which many think to be the most important metric at which to look in forecasting the current business outlook for a transition company.Subscription growth ought to be tightly correlated with ARR; well, if it isn't, then there must be an issue with annual revenue per unit (ARPU) and pricing. Again, not so fast. Mix and timing have lots to do with numbers as the transition gets underway. Not all subscriptions cover the same things for the same period. And so, the ARPU metric is subject to swings that signify little, although they engender many electrons and lots of paragraphs in analyst updates on this name. I do not believe pricing has been a particular issue for this company over the past 3 months. While overall sub growth was but a modest beat, new model sub growth was quite strong and would not likely have been a cause for the company to embark on aggressive pricing strategies.Deferred revenue increased 26% year on year - a significantly stronger showing than was seen in the Q2 results. New model ARR was $414 million, which was up 90%+ on a constant currency basis, although the comparison has obviously lost much of its meaning with the end of subscription sales. As noted earlier, new model ARR increased by $43 million sequentially, or 12%.Non-GAAP spending fell by 2% year on year. It grew by $8 million, or 1.5% sequentially. General and administrative and research and development costs fell year on year and were flat sequentially. Sales and marketing costs rose year on year because of the transition from what had been an expense to a contra-revenue presentation. Absent that, sales and marketing costs were more or less flat year on year. Expense management is one of those metrics with fewer ambiguities than other data released by ADSK. Expense management is perceived by most to be moving in the right direction.Overall, if one sifts through the plethora of numbers to be considered, most analysts are actually increasing their long-term expectations for this company - and were the shares not already discounting some of that, it is a good thing.Behind the numbersIn some ways, despite all of the moving parts, the Autodesk story when it comes down to the numbers is a pretty simple one. The company is forecasting that the results of its transition will bring it to $3.5 billion of revenue by fiscal year 2020 - essentially, calendar 2019. At that point, management is forecasting it will be generating free cash flow of $6/share. On the latest earnings call, the company forecast that it will reach $11/share of free cash flow by fiscal 2022, based on a 20% CAGR in subscriptions over the relevant time frame along with a 24% growth in ARR over that period. Just by comparison, revenues this year are forecast to be just above $2 billion and free cash flow is probably going to wind up around $150-200 million.In a report I recently wrote about Teradata (NYSE:TDC) and its goals, I commented, ""L'audace, l'audace, toujours l'audace."" Some readers liked the phrase, others not so much. Still, the goals that Autodesk has are nothing if not aggressive, and from time to time, that can lead to naysayers pointing out all that has to go right for the numbers to bear out.ADSK will reach those aggressive goals, management asserts, by expanding its TAM and because of the impact of its subscription-based revenue model, which, it is hoped, will dramatically reduce the piracy that plagues the company's AutoCAD offering. If you believe management's scenario, owning the shares is a simple decision. If you do not - well, there is little other reason to own the shares, I believe.I do not propose to do a deep dive into all the product offerings that make up the Autodesk fleet of solutions. Many readers will know AutoCAD, which is the leading solution used by architects and space designers. AutoCAD is by far the company's most important product.The company is also a leading competitor in the PLM space, where its solutions are sold against those offered by PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC), Dassault (OTCPK:DASTY) and Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY). Overall, a well-regarded market research source suggests that Autodesk has a combined share of 19% in the CAD space, but it is the dominant player in architecture and a much less dominant player in the PLM space.I have written in the past about the huge bet this company has taken in developing an all-cloud PLM offering. Right now, the business model transition is what is animating the financial discussion and has the most influence on the share price. But from a business standpoint, Fusion 360 is one of the more important solutions this company has developed in a decade, I believe.The ADSK Fusion 360 offering has been growing share quite rapidly, according to the accessible statistics, and is one of the more successful product launches that the company has had recently. I think it is relevant to comment that there is a significant difference between a subscription model - the direction that has been taken by PTC thus far - and Fusion 360. Different managements, different development strategies. I think the cloud will ultimately be the repository for the data that remains on-prem in most PLM use cases. A web publication called SolidSmack has written about Fusion360 in the terms usually reserved for trendy performers. If readers have an interest in the subject, follow the link above so that you can make your own judgments on the subject. If ADSK were to be a target for consolidation, it would be the web solutions on which it has devoted its development focus that would drive a potential acquirer.One of the more frustrating issues with regard to modern investor communication is that conference calls can come and go without analysts asking any questions regarding the state of the business. There was some of that on the Autodesk call. About the only question that was raised with regard to the company's product strategy related to its bet on the cloud. Here is the specific commentary of the CEO, Carl Bass, regarding what is going on when it comes to technology and the positioning of this company. (Note that the company is hosting an Analyst Day on December 6th, during which it will obviously spend lots of time addressing technology, TAM and competition.)I have said that in the very short term, ADSK shares have probably achieved a significant percentage of positive alpha that may have been available. But over the long term, the key to these shares is a combination of the business model transition coupled with a better mousetrap. I believe the company has built a better mousetrap, mainly because users and industry analysts think that to be the case. And I think the source of this better mousetrap is a defensible, new web-based architecture which is not offered by competitors at this time.Autodesk has a set of differentiated tools in specific markets, and its lead in that regard, as compared to competitors, is likely to persist for years into the future. It is also clearly a Trump infrastructure stock. And the new business model is going to lead to greater consumption on the part of ADSK users, who will trade dollars for flexibility. Lots of things to like, but the valuation subsumes all of that, I believe.ValuationThe one thing about writing this sector is that no one can possibly use current headline financial results to arrive at a valuation. So, I won't try. How much is the worth of a stream of $600 million/year that starts in 2020 and continues to rise for some years at rates greater than 20% actually worth. I have seen analysts who say they believe in the company's transition and yet value the shares at just $71. And therein lies the problem in continuing to recommend this name in terms of its ability to produce significant positive alpha. From here on out, it will be a race between free cash flow growth and valuation. There is very little margin for error.The current average consensus price target for ADSK is less than $70. It is very hard for share values to appreciate when the average share price target is less than the current value of the shares. Some of that is almost certainly a function of those analysts who do not believe the forecast numbers going out to fiscal 2020. And some of that is a function of analysts who say they believe the numbers, but then use very high levels of discount rates to put their thumb on the scale. But even analysts using normal estimates come out with a DPV target of just a little greater than the current value. How much is a stream of $600 million of free cash flow worth? I would have to think that if it were to grow at 24% in the terminal year, the flow would have to be worth $15 billion, or possibly more. The shares currently have a market cap of $16 billion and an enterprise value of $15 billion. My best guess is that ADSK shares will be in share price purgatory for the next few quarters. They remain suitable for long-term investors. I believe the shorter-term positive alpha potential has been achieved, and the risks and rewards are basically balanced at current share price levels."
4038710,52852,2017-01-23T13:28:23-05:00,"Declining revenue, EPS and cash flow are not necessarily bad things.Model transitions are messy but are done for a good reason.No, the market is not dumb and manipulative, at least not for ADSK.","The purpose of this article is to counter the misleading public information on Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), specially the views of uninformed bears. I am not a bull who is trying to defend the stock price, but I am an investor who has some experience with subscription business model transitions and would like to provide the public with the correct framework in analyzing ADSK's results.BackgroundAutodesk is company that is undergoing a business model shift from selling perpetual licenses to subscription. Anytime this happens - and we have seen this happen multiple times before - GAAP financials become distorted in the short run. Analysts who don't understand how financial dynamics work in a subscription transition, tend to jump to the conclusion that declining revenues, lowered profitability, and lowered free cash flow must be a sign of fundamental distress. The problem with this view is that it points out the obvious and implies that the market is so inefficient that it cannot even process basic financial information such as declining GAAP numbers. More often then not, the problem is with the analyst's lack of understanding rather than the market's lack of understanding.As for ADSK, numerous authors (on Seeking Alpha and other publications) concluded that Q3's results are ""poor"", which lead to a sell off in the stock before recovering all the loses and more. The author suggested ADKS's hedge fund holders drove up the price into year-end ""to goose up their returns"". Furthermore, the author asserts that declining revenues and profitability are signs of fundamental troubles, and that the stock should be valued based on past EPS rather its future EPS.These assertions are problematic on multiple levels. First, it assumes that Q3's results are poor and that the market is wrong when in fact Q3's results are decent and supports the market rally. Second, it assumes that ADSK's stock is being manipulated and that it makes sense for shareholders to manipulate the stock, when there is no evidence to support this assertion. Third, it over-emphasizes certain financial metrics such as revenue, EPS and cash flow, while completely ignoring the metrics that the rest of the market is correctly paying attention to. Fourth, valuation should be forward looking rather than backwards looking.First, Q3 result's are not poor.Before I go further, I want to make sure that everyone understands that in the stock market, ""good"" or ""bad"" is always relative to expectations. This is the case because stocks are largely valued by expectations of the underlying company's economic returns. Although public consensus numbers consists of sell-side expectations, they are often a ""good enough"" approximation of buy-side expectations, especially for a large, well-followed company like ADSK. In other words, just because financial metrics declined y/y does not mean the results are ""poor."" If it is above expectations, the stock is more likely to rally than not. Conversely, we have seen many growth stocks sell of after reporting high double digit growths - often the reason is because investors are expecting even more.With that said, ADSK beat estimates on the key metrics. In Q3, ADSK added 121k net subscribers (excluding 13K from Solid Angle), which was ahead of consensus expectations of 113K. This is a key metric because it demonstrates the company's ability to land more new customers under the new model to offset the declines associated with its legacy model. And, for the full year, management bumped their forecast by 20K, to adding 520K net new subs at the mid point of their guidance. This demonstrates confidence in the company's fundamentals.Q3's revenue and EPS also came in above consensus. Revenue came in at $490M, $13M above consensus, driven by strong subscription numbers. EPS came in at $0.18 versus the $0.24 consensus. This is important because strength in subscription revenues is an indicator that the model transition is going well. Since perpetual revenues are booked up front, while the contract value of subscriptions are recognized ratably, more subscription bookings often means lower license revenue and lower profitability. But ADSK surprised to the upside on subscription revenue, total revenue, and EPS - not bad!Furthermore, management reiterated their 2020 and 2023 free-cash-flow per share target of $6 per share and $11 per share. There are many more metrics we can discuss, but the most important thing for ADSK is the market's determination of how well the transition is going. Since Q3 results are in-line (or slightly above expectations), and since management reiterated their long-term target, Q3 has done more to contribute to the bull case rather than the bear case - hence the rally.Second, there is no evidence and little logical support behind the assertion that ADKS's stock is being manipulated.First, I want to flag how crazy it is to think that there is a conspiracy theory to drive up a stock's price just because the market is moving in the opposite direction of what you think. It is more productive to examine where you might be wrong, and if you are convinced that you are not, you add to your bet. Professional investors know that manipulations can only temporarily distort prices and, if they find distorted prices, it is like finding free money waiting to be picked up (i.e. in the case of ADSK, you short the stock if you truly believe hedge funds are manipulating the price). Year-end 2016 came and went, and ADSK's stock price is still holding up. Did market participants forget to short the year-end manipulation-drive rally? I don't think so!I count four concentrated shareholders: Eminence Capital with 15.3% of their portfolio being ADSK, Sachem Head Capital with 49%, Soroban Capital with 9.7%, and Blue Ridge Capital with 8%. Together they own about 20% of the company's outstanding shares. These are all fundamental shops with an activism streak. The idea that those hedge funds got together to bid up ADSK's share price despite a bad Q3, in order to manipulate the market is far-fetched, to put it politely. First, if the fundamentals are falling off a cliff, these funds will have a difficult time in selling their shares given their large exposure to ADSK and ownership of total outstanding shares. Second, with only 4-5% of short interest, no experienced short seller will ever flag a short squeeze as material risk. You might as well worry about ADSK defaulting on their debts (they are net cash).Also, the stock weakened towards the end of the year and strengthened in the beginning of 2017. Did the manipulators run forget to squeeze up the shares when it mattered, only to panic and started buying the stock again in Q1 of 2017? I think not.Third, the important metrics for ADSK on a quarterly basis are not revenue, EPS, and free cash flow.These metrics will obviously decline as you transition away from perpetual licenses and towards subscription, but the declines will ultimately trough and reverse back to growth. Generally speaking, the goal of such model transitions is to increase the life-time value of customers and ultimately profitability.Actually modeling all the moving pieces of a model transition is hard work, and is well beyond the ability of most investors. If you are an investor, you must determine if you are able to do the modeling work, and if not, you must determine if you can trust management. Don't, however, jump to conclusion just because revenue and profitability are going down during the transition.Below, I will walk you through a simple example of how subscription model transitions works so you understand why revenues and profitability must fall during the transition.Take, for example, company A that is currently 100% perpetual license and maintenance, and is planning to transition to a subscription model. When A sells a perpetual license, it books all the revenue and most of the cost associated with the license in the quarter it sold the license. With every $100 license sold, A also sells a 2-year maintenance service and books $20 of maintenance revenue every year. So in year one, A books $120 in revenue for every license sold at the beginning of the year, and $20 in revenue in the next year. In other words, in the first quarter that A sells the license, A books $105 in revenue. In terms of cash flow, since A bills its customers up front for its annual maintenance service, A will show $120 in operating cash flow in the first quarter the license is sold (assuming customers pay within the quarter).In a subscription model, A's customers pay $50 a year as long as they remain a subscriber, and A recognizes $12.5 of revenue per quarter. Since A bills its customers annually, A will recognize $50 in operating cash flow in Q1. At $50 per year, in year 4, A will have booked $200 revenue under the subscription model vs. $180 for the license model. Obviously, the net present value of the subscription will take longer to turn positive after we applying a discount to future cash flows, but the logic stays the same: if you have sticky customers like ADSK does, you will ultimately earn more from selling subscriptions.Although clearly A is recognizing less revenue upfront with subscription sales, A's cost structure remains the same. If A has $100 in annual costs per customer, then it will book a $20 accounting profit if it sells a license, or it will book a $50 loss if it sells a subscription, even if the net present value of the subscription sale is greater than the license. This is why investors pay attention to other metrics such as net customer adds, total books, subscription revenue mix as a percentage of recurring revenue (i.e. maintenance revenue will go down over time), billed and unbilled deferred revenue, average contract size and duration, and other metrics to help investors determine whether the model transition is profitable. Fourth, the correct way to value ADSK is based on its future earnings, not its past earnings, especially when it is distorted by the model transition.As stated earlier, ADSK's public target is to reach $6 per share in free-cash-flow by 2020 and $11 per share by 2023. The real question to ask is if management's targets are credible, and if they are, what is the correct multiple? Different analysts will give you different answers, but a bull might put a 20x multiple on the 2023 target and discount it back by 10% a year, or that by 2023, the stock will reach $220 per share. A rational bear might say that management is too aggressive and that they will only be able to do $3 per share by 2020, and apply a 15x multiple, implying that the stock is worth $45 per share by 2020. Either way, the focus should be on the future, not the past, especially when the company is shifting from license to subscription.I hope this article will help those who are unsure about owning ADSK. If you have any questions or comments, please post them below, and don't forget to follow me for future updates and articles."
4002265,52852,2016-08-25T22:47:59-04:00,"Autodesk reported strong Q2 print after the close on August 25.However, the revenue beat was driven by a one-time demand surge.Other positives include impressive cost-cutting and stable macro environment.","On August 25, after the close, Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) reported a solid Q2 print, which should satisfy bulls and help sustain the stock's performance. However, I expect the reaction to be modest given the stock's recent strength, relatively high multiple, and a questionable driver of revenue this quarter.Before delving into the details, it is important to understand the key debate points entering the quarter.First, there is the shareholder activism angle. Two activist funds, Sachem Head Capital and Eminence Capital, accumulated a combined stake of 11.5% of total outstanding shares. Since the activists' involvement, management already made a number of changes including restructuring to eliminate 10% of employees and cutting down excessive expenses. Thus, cost cutting effectiveness and commentary on restructuring will be important.Second, ADSK is in the midst of a model transition, going from a perpetual license model to a subscription model, which is expected to last through FY20. In fact, Q2 is the final quarter which perpetual product suites were available.Third, investors are concerned with the macro environment given a possible Brexit induced disruption and lower than expected US GDP growth for the quarter.The PrintAutodesk reported a decent Q2 print with revenues of $550.7M, ahead of the upper end of its guidance of $500-520M and consensus of $512.3M. It is worthy to note that the magnitude of this beat (7.5%) is one of the biggest since at least July 2011. The beat was driven by License and other of $228.7M vs. consensus of $165.0M, offset by a miss in Subscription of $322.0M vs consensus of $349.7M - this is a negative considering their model transition, and suggests that many customers still prefer the perpetual model.EPS of +$0.05 beat -$0.15 consensus estimates, driven by top line growth and impressive cost control.Other metrics are more mixed. Deferred revenue missed a bit at $1.52B vs. consensus of $1.59B, while billings of $550.7M missed consensus of $577.1M. However, net subscriber adds for Q2 of 109K beat consensus forecast of 103K. New model subscribers added 125K, offset by a 16K decline in maintenance due to the end of their perpetual EoL. Annualized recurring revenue grew 10%.Guidance raise was subdued, however. As a result of the quarter, management raised FY guidance by a tiny amount while leaving target net subscriber adds the same (475-575K).The CallIn the call, management said they achieved the strong sub adds without any big promotions like they had in Q1. With the end of their perpetual EoL, they are now largely a subscription only company.The end of perpetual licenses drove a larger-than-expected surge of last opportunity buying - this is a negative given its one-time nature and given that this surge in demand was not modeled by Wall Street, so the beat was of low quality. This will also create a tough y/y comp for next year's Q2.The weaker than expected subscription growth was driven by FX (4 point headwind), accounting treatment of product subscription and EBA revenue. The accounting explanation is a bit opaque, and FX headwinds are well known, so the weakness in subscription revenue (combined with weaker than expected billing) should be an lingering concern.On macro concerns, management said their outlook remains unchanged over the past several quarters. Global conditions have remained uneven with most of the mature markets performing relatively well, while emerging markets remain challenged. There is no meaningful change in the demand environment, and management did not see any immediate fallout from the Brexit vote. This is a positive.ConclusionThe print was great with much better than expected revenues and EPS, driven by impressive cost cutting. This should give investors confidence that management is serious in creating long-term value - even if its under the duress of activist shareholders. However, the revenue beat was driven by a one-time demand pull as customers rushed to buy perpetual licenses before they are no longer offered. This is bad for two reasons: 1) the revenue beat is of low quality and 2) the demand surge suggests many customers are still interested in perpetual licenses. On the macro front, investors should be relieved that there is no Brexit impact and that the macro outlook has remained unchanged despite concerns. Overall, Q2 is a ""good enough"" quarter."

But, I have been studying both 3D Printing and Internet-of-Things technologies and I am impressed by the real value these technologies offer. When large companies start investing money and see that these technologies produce measurable value, that's real value.Exhibit 1: Worldwide 3D Printing Forecast (In Billions) Source: Wohlers Associates, August 2014Exhibit 2: Reasons for Pursuing 3D Printing, Gartner, 2014This report by Gartner is a bit dated. We are already seeing signs that 3D printing is being used for more mainstream product manufacturing in mission-critical, ""zero failure"" scenarios. For example, GE is producing jet engine fuel nozzles at the Auburn, Alabama, plant using additive manufacturing techniques.Exhibit 3: GE LEAP Jet Engine Fuel Nozzle Manufactured using Additive Manufacturing Techniques. Source: GEReports.comExhibit 4: GE Aviation Additive Manufacturing Facility in Alabama. (Source: MadeinAlabama.com)For this nozzle, GE sees the following benefits from 3D printing:But, 3D printing has many challenges too. Some of these challenges are:Currently, 3D Printing (interchangeably referred to as additive manufacturing) offers most value in creating quick prototypes. 3D printed prototypes provide a great way to get feedback from all the stakeholders and quickly iterate through design changes by having a tangible product in hand.Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) sees 3D printing as complementary to its design software. But, its ambitions extend beyond 3D printing and into optimizing and adding value to every aspect of the manufacturing process.Conceptual View 3D Printing ProcessExhibit 5: High-level, Conceptual View of 3D Printing ProcessHere's a conceptual view of the 3D printing process. Almost any design software can design a product and output the STL file that would be used by the software in the 3D printer. STL or Stereo lithography files describe the surface geometry of the design without describing the color or texture. The ability to output a STL file does not offer any competitive advantage to a design software.AcquisitionsAutodesk is trying to add value across the entire end-to-end process of 3D printing - from design to final product. Autodesk has made some acquisitions to achieve this goal. So, let's briefly review them.NetfabbAutodesk paid about $42.5 million in cash to acquire Netfabb in September 2015. Netfabb software minimizes waste and costs and streamlines 3D printing workflow from design to finished product. For example, in a case study of ClearCorrect (a manufacturer of dental aligners), the CEO of ClearCorrect says this about Netfabb:""Netfabb Cloud had the fastest packing algorithm of any product we looked at, and the LUA scripting was perfect for integration with our in-house ERP tools.â¦Netfabb not only wrote the LUA script, but made changes to Netfabb core that helped improve our manufacturing efficiency by over 20% over one of Netfabb's leading competitor at a fraction of the cost.""Jarrett Pumphrey, CEO of ClearCorrect, LLCSince 3D printers create objects layer-by-layer from the bottom up, packing algorithms are critical to this process. These algorithms can help the machine pack the most elements into the smallest possible space and thus reduce waste. Lua is a lightweight programming language primarily used in embedded systems. Lua is written in ANSI C and has a C API.WithinWithin design software helps create lightweight designs that are optimized for 3D printing. Within is primarily targeted towards mechanical engineers and medical implant designers. For example, rather than using a solid block of metal to produce a load bearing engine block, a block designed using Within software can help save material without forgoing any of the functionality or strength.Exhibit 6: An Engine Block Manufactured using traditional manufacturing process - drilling. (Source: Autodesk)Exhibit 7: An Optimized Engine Block - Design created using Within Software (Source: Autodesk)DelcamAutodesk acquired Delcam for $284.6 million in February 2014. In FY 2012, Delcam was previously listed in the London Stock Exchange and had Â£47.1 million in revenues which was 12% higher than the previous year. Delcam helps Autodesk go deeper into the manufacturing domain. It provides end-to-end software solutions for the manufacturing industry (automotive, aerospace, footwear and healthcare) from preparation of designs for production to the manufacture of molds, tools, dies with complex geometries. Delcam extends Autodesk's capability beyond design and into the manufacturing shop floor. Even though this acquisition is not directly related to 3D printing, it is complementary to its strategy.Cloud of ActivismActivist investors have taken large stakes in the company and have acquired seats on the board.Exhibit 8: 13-D Filing Source: SEC.GOVBut their end-game is not clear. The activists could ask for more cost-cutting, but there's a limit to that and if one is not careful talent could desert the company. These investors care about near-term gains. In FY 2015, the company repurchased millions of shares. As of quarter ending July 31, 2016, 1.5 million shares were available for repurchase under the current approval by the board of directors.Exhibit 9: Autodesk Common Stock Repurchase Program - Last Six Quarters Source: SEC.govCompared to paying dividends, share buybacks can be a very tricky business. It could help boost the share price in the short term, but the business eventually has to show growth. In this case, any more stock repurchases may not add much value, given the run-up in share price and lack of growth.The Media and Entertainment (M&E) operating segment could be sold and the proceeds could be issued as dividends or invested in more share buybacks. This segment may be seen as not being central to its expertise in engineering design. This operating segment had about $160 million in revenue in fiscal year 2015 and that was a decrease of 4% from the previous year. This segment is small compared to Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC), manufacturing and Platform Solutions and Emerging Business (PSEB). These three segments had $949 million, $724 million and $670 million in revenue in FY 2015, respectively. M&E segment was just 6.3% of the total revenues. So, the upside of selling this business is very limited.Finally, the company itself could be sold. But, given the near-term uncertainty in the business and the current valuation of over $15 billion, this is a low probability event.ConclusionA move into 3D printing fits well with Autodesk's vision "" to help people imagine, design, and create a better world."" It is an iconic company with great brand recognition (among engineers). If you bought the stock around its 52-week low of around $41, it may be prudent to take some profits. Buy the stock at much lower prices, once the cloud of activism clears, assuming Autodesk is still standing as an independent company.If you liked this report, you may also like my report on PTC."
3966000,98236,2016-04-18T14:41:15-04:00,"Autodesk is in the midst of a multi-year transition from a on-prem model to a SaaS model.During the course of the transition, headline metrics will be ugly, but things like sub adds, increase in deferred revenue balance and churn can guide investors.Autodesk derives more than two-thirds of its revenue from cyclical businesses.The company's forecast for fiscal-year 2020 - essentially 2019 - implies valuations substantially above today's level with free cash flow generation reaching $6/share by that time and with further significant upside potential.","Is there a chance for ADSK to become more like ADBE?Sometimes in life, great divergences turn on a thread. Once upon a time, Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) were actually considered in the same breath. After all, they both sold software to creative people, both hobbyists and professionals. At some level, their software was quite similar - although I don't want to take that one too far. And then, Adobe developed its Creative Cloud subscription model, and from being a middle-aged boring software vendor, it has become one of the icons of the cloud world with growth of 30% or so and the ability to consistently beat forecasts.Autodesk has gone down a different path. It obviously was badly hurt by its focus on selling products to design professionals as opposed to hobbyists. While construction and product design capabilities have come back from the depths of the Great Recession, the hobbyist market has proven to be far larger with new applications for Creative Cloud developed almost daily. Users can buy Creative Cloud for $50/month, and if a potential user is just getting started, he/she can buy Photoshop for $10/month. At this point, Creative Cloud has more than seven million users who spend close to $4 billion/year on lease payments.There are probably not seven million architects, construction management personnel and product designers in the US. That doesn't mean ADSK doesn't have some significant business opportunities. It competes in the simulation market, which it believes has a TAM of $3.2 billion. Autodesk's most popular product AutoCAD sells for $30/month for the LT versions, which obviously puts it into the mass market category. Even its Product Design Suite costs $280/month. With that kind of price level, the company has to build a base of several million users in order to grow. Anytime a business software vendor needs several million seats to grow, it is going to be a significant struggle.ADSK is a company within the PLM space where it has to compete with a range of competitors including PTC (NASDAQ:PTC) and Dassault (OTCPK:DASTY). The company suggests that there is a $4 billion opportunity in PLM with 10 million potential subscribers although that seems a stretch to me based on the seat data provided by DASTY and by PTC. It is one of the hundreds of companies vying for a place in the nascent IoT (Internet of Things) market space. IoT is supposed to be a gigantic market over time - at the moment ADSK competes in a relatively narrow sector of the space in which it supplies preventive maintenance for connected machines.If I had to summarize the differences that have now emerged between ADSK and ADBE, it is that ADSK essentially provides solutions to help its customers to make things whole. Things represent a pretty broad category, and it includes buildings and other structures, parts and designs for almost everything manufactured and even solutions that help manufacturing plants run better. But things, nonetheless.Adobe has solutions that allow its customers to create consumer experiences. The TAM for ADSK is said to be $25 billion in total. The TAM for Adobe is probably several times larger and it has a much higher market share in its market space than ADSK will ever have in the spaces in which it competes.In this country anyway, our economy is far less about making things and far more with providing consumers with experiences. That doesn't necessarily mean that ADSK is a bad investment. It does mean that it is much easier these days being Adobe than it is being Autodesk.You know, transition investments can be pains in the neck. Sure there are success stories like Aspen (NASDAQ:AZPN) and Adobe, but there are more than a few other companies starting with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) that are having a dickens of a time in their transition to the cloud. What inning are we with this name?The reason that analysts and investors take the trouble to deal with software companies in the transition to cloud is because of the hugely profitable business model that comes out on the other side. Over the past five years-plus, ADSK's shares have dramatically underperformed the performance of most software shares. The shares were $46 in May of 2011 and they are $58 now. The last time someone upgraded this name was back in May 2014. I wanted to think of some significant pop culture event that happened back in 2011 - but I remembered I know absolutely nothing about pop culture.No, the real reason to take interest in these shares is the company's FY 2020 business model forecast which calls for $3.5 billion in revenues, up from $2.5 billion reported in FY 2016. Further, free cash flow, which was $345 million in FY 2016, is supposed to reach $1.3 billion or $6/share by FY 2020 and rise further to $11/share by fiscal 2023. In addition, non-GAAP margins, which were less than 10% in fiscal 2016, are supposed to reach the mid-20% range on the way to 30%-plus. If it all works out then, EPS would be close to $3.00/share in 2020 and something like $6-7/share in 2023. That's what happens with a SaaS model that features high renewal rates. Management's forecast is that company would be achieving sustained low-double-digit growth in a predictable fashion by that time going forward. As the saying goes, ""nice work if you can get it.""Lots of managements are asked by lots of investors in quarterly conference calls about what inning they are in terms of the transition to cloud. It really isn't a very easy question to answer. Even a company like Adobe still has millions of customers using Creative Suite, its non-cloud offering that hasn't been available to new purchasers for years. But for what it is worth, ADSK's management has proclaimed that this year, fiscal 2017, will be the year of its inflection - by which I suppose it means it will be the first year its business is going to be without the revenue support from the sale of perpetual licenses (The end of sales of perpetual suite licenses comes in Q2 of the current fiscal year, which will further muddy the waters in terms of reported numbers).One indication that Autodesk is still in the early innings of its conversion is that its fiscal Q4 of 2016 that ended on January 31 was finally the last quarter in which perpetual licenses were available for individual products. Q3 will be the cut-over point at which the company stops all sales of any license agreements. So it has taken the company until now to almost cut the cord, so to speak, and to wean itself off the narcotic revenue of perpetual licenses. Cutting the cord is going to produce some pretty ugly financial results this year. Revenue as reported is expected to decline by 20% and non-GAAP EPS is supposed to be a loss of $.85 to a loss of $.60. SA Columnist Eric Jhonsa described Q1 guidance as ""soft"" and indeed it was, but that is the inevitable result of ending sales of desktop perpetual licenses now and ending sales of suite professional licenses at the end of Q2.There are a variety of metrics that different companies have used to talk about their progress. In the case of Autodesk, it is clear that the company's transition to cloud is in the very early innings. The company has at least 2.8 million engaged users who are not subscribers. The company obviously has millions of seats that are unconverted but for which users are still paying maintenance. In one ADSK presentation, the company showed an example of what would happen if 20% of its non-subscriber AutoCAD customers switched to the cloud. That alone would increase Annual Recurring Revenues (ARR) by 45% alone and increase subscription revenues by 21% for AutoCAD.As I wrote a few days ago with regard to Oracle, converting the non-cloud maintenance base to subscription is one of the most difficult challenges legacy vendors face. In the case of Oracle, of course, the problem is of enormous magnitude since 52% of its current revenues and more than all of its operating profits are coming from the maintenance line. But ADSK probably gets nearly 40% of its total revenues maintenance from on-prem installed customersADSK has made a start in the conversion process, but at the moment, it estimates that less than 20% of its enterprise customers have moved from standard on-prem maintenance to a cloud-based pricing model. That model is called Token-Flex, and as the name implies, the model is based on tokens that users purchase when they consume a fixed amount of connect time to the software. I confess that I sometimes wonder why companies choose the figures they do to put in their presentations - but for what it is worth, the company enjoyed a 90% increase in enterprise ARR during FY 2016. How the uptake of Token-Flex pricing relates to traditional maintenance I do not know other than to assume Token-Flex is driving more revenues. For smaller users, Autodesk offers Multi-User subscriptions to replace network maintenance. In a typical 50-seat account, revenues from the transition have increased between 25% and 50%. For the smallest accounts, the transition is increasing revenues by between 50% and 100% as they transition to Single-User subscriptions.Overall, the company is projecting a 24% growth in ARR, a 3% growth in annualized revenue per subscription and a 20% growth in subscriptions over the next four years. Currently, what this company calls its maintenance model ARR is $1.12 billion out of total revenues of $2.5 billion and of total recurring revenues of $1.38 billion. Over time, much of those revenues are going away. Self-evidently, revenue growth and more importantly earnings should be strongly positively influenced by the transition of the Maintenance Model ARR to what the company calls the new ARR, but that transition will not take place overnight or without some hiccups that are currently unknowable.To answer the question posed above, if Adobe and Aspen are in the eighth inning of their transitions, this company has not gone beyond the second inning of its transition. There are two ways to look at that. As a stock, ADSK obviously will offer far more percentage upside as its transition proceeds. As a business, the company's reported growth in earnings, revenues and most everything else will remain hobbled until the crossover point ensues in a couple of years. One pays a huge price for successfully completed transitions as might be expected and the trick is in finding in-process transitions that are still modestly valued but have the opportunity to come out with a good result on the other side.Look seven-year projections and four-year projections are nice - but I am not buying this name to wait several years to see if they are meeting their targets. I can't even figure out what I'm going to be doing four days from now, and ADSK, after all of its ups and downs is forecasting four years and seven years. What are the short-term metrics that will allow us to judge this company and how do you rate its chances of achieving those metrics?I think that the simplest metric to look at is going to be net subscription adds for the next couple of years. The company is going to report that metric; it is going to tell investors if it made or missed its target for net subscriber adds and it is focusing its sales force on that metric as well. Oh, there are other metrics and certainly I would look at ARR, ARPU and of course cash flow. Do not look at traditional headline metrics such as revenue and reported EPS. They are not going to help anyone in understanding how this company is doing relative to expectations. It would be far better to see a revenue ""miss"" with strong net sub adds and bookings than to see a decent revenue quarter that missed on net sub adds and calculated bookings. The most important sub-headline metric is going to be calculated bookings which involve looking at the net change in deferred revenue coupled with reported revenue.The real issue of course is going to be whether the entire investment community chooses to look at what is important now and doesn't fixate on extraneous factors. As most investors know, ADSK has some activist investors who have filed on the company. Activists include Sachem Head and Eminence. At the moment, there is a peace deal in place with the activists who own a bit more than 11% of the shares, but the standstill agreement expires the end of this coming September. The activists now have three board members in place out of an 11-member board.One thing is true for sure and that is that this transition will be nowhere near complete by the end of September and reporting one or two quarters of either good or bad net sub adds is really not going to be enough to prove the company's strategy.It is, I think, pretty unknowable about what the activists might do in September and what is going to influence their decision. But it is either an overhang that can't be totally disregarded (the activists decide to sell shares) or a factor that might set-up a transaction in which this company is sold.At the moment, most analysts are dubious regarding the transition or feel that investors will not focus on signs that the transition is succeeding. The company has a mean analyst rating of 2.5 on a scale of 1 to 5, indicating that the consensus rating is hold. The mean price target is $62, or just 7% above current quotations. On the latest conference call, a prominent analyst essentially asked the question of how anyone is going to believe four- and seven-year projections from a company with a rather mixed record, to say the least. It is probably best to quote the CEO's answer in part. Carl Bass said:What I like about the set up is that the share price, to an extent, is saying that investors either don't believe management about 2020 results or think that until the company starts printing attractive headline numbers, investors won't care. Obviously, investors in this name are investing on a speculative basis that can't be proven. On the other hand, the prospective rewards are substantial enough to take the risk if the investor believes the management. Again using ADBE as a bit of an analog, investors certainly didn't have to wait until the completion of its transition before they were well rewarded and became comfortable with the management projections.Looking at the current environment, and looking at how users increasingly want to buy software, my guess is that the transition will succeed. I think the company is going to achieve the level of sub adds that it's forecasting of 475k-525k. I assume that management will constrain the growth of opex as it has forecast.What is a bit harder to forecast is the global business environment both for this current fiscal year and the future. This is a company tied to a lesser or greater extent to global macro trends. Its revenues from architecture and construction are 34% of the total. Its revenues from manufacturing are 25% of the total. The company's business in China, a not insignificant part of the total, has been relatively strong. On the other hand, its results for fiscal 2016 reflected an implosion in the company's business in Brazil and Russia. I think that the principal risk to the company achieving its current FY 2017 forecast is more macro related than related to its business transition.OK-Wrap it up. Is the valuation at a level that makes sense for a risk tolerant investor?It should be noted that none of the traditional valuation metrics are going to make a whole lot of sense during the course of the transition. For what it is worth, the company has an enterprise value of $12 billion, and sales this fiscal year are forecast to be $2 billion. Also, 95% of the shares are held by institutions. The company is forecasting a loss this year so any kind of P/E analysis is meaningless. The company doesn't forecast cash flow or free cash flow. Deferred revenues ought to grow significantly beyond the $360 million increase achieved in FY 2016. The company's net GAAP loss will be smaller this year than last because last year included a substantial one-time tax provision although that was partially offset by a significant increase in deferred taxes. A/R showed a substantial increase last year rising by $195 million or more than 40%. Some of that increase will be reversed in the current year as a product of lower sales and lower DSO. Considering all of those factors, cash flow should increase significantly from last year's $414 million level to a level of between $600 million and $700 million. Assuming the company makes no acquisitions in the current fiscal year, free cash flow ought to be between $500 million and $600 million, clearly not at a level that would support a $12 billion-plus enterprise value. It will be two to three years at least before it is possible to do any kind of normal valuation analysis for this company.Some Closing CommentsAutodesk is in an interesting position as an investment. On the one hand, reported headline metrics are going to look ugly for this year and at least into the middle of the following year. The company is attempting the feat of moving from all perpetual license business to all SaaS in something like a five-year span. During the course of the transition, most traditional valuation metrics are not going to be particularly helpful in establishing a reasonable share value for this company. The company's goals, however, if they are achieved, include a 50% increase in revenues over the four-year span, EPS of about $3/share and free cash flow of $6/share. I think that if there is a reasonable expectation that operating results will approach such levels by FY 2020, the shares are worth substantially more than current quotations. This company has two activist investors whose standstill agreements expire the end of September. At that point, one assumes they will either sell their shares or find a way to secure a bid for this company.I think the model transition is most likely to work as it is congruent with the way users prefer to acquire software these days. The cloud does change almost everything and certainly will change user preferences with regards to on-prem vs. cloud within the markets that Autodesk competes.I'm concerned, to some degree, regarding the fallout from the macro environment as this company derives more than two-thirds of its revenues from highly cyclical industry segments. But the current penchant for substantial monetary easing is likely to boost spending, at least in the architectural and construction product classes. I think that the shares make sense for risk tolerant investors in that any signs that the transition is working as planned are going to be catalysts to drive the share price long before headline metrics improve."

Today, the web giant announced:Google also announced an expansion of its Cloud Vision API, which uses AI/machine learning to classify images, extract text, and detect objects/faces - the underlying technology enables Google Photos' image-analysis features.Source: GoogleAnd the company took its content delivery network, known as Cloud CDN, into beta. CDN giant Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) is among the companies whose offerings Cloud CDN, which should benefit from Google's large fiber network, will be competing with. As is Amazon, which offers AWS clients its CloudFront CDN service. Akamai's massive global network of CDN servers still acts as differentiator for apps in which low latency is a priority (for example, e-commerce transactions), but Google could deliver a cheap and effective solution for cloud clients looking to outsource media content delivery.Interestingly, Autodesk CEO Carl Bass suggests the huge bandwidth needs of the Maya cloud service were a reason Autodesk went with Google instead of Amazon. ""The best thing about Amazon is the ability to spin up servers quickly. When you get into production, where you have hundreds of thousands of servers running, I think the requirements change pretty dramatically."" The head of a cloud management software firm recently argued Google's huge fiber infrastructure delivers bandwidth cost savings relative to rival platforms.A major cloud expansion effortThe NAB announcements follow news Spotify (Private:MUSIC) is migrating its infrastructure to the Google Cloud Platform, and a report Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has used a mixture of AWS, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, and its own data center infrastructure to deliver cloud services, is now using Google and has ""significantly reduced its reliance"" on AWS. Other Google clients include Snapchat (CHAT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), and Sony (NYSE:SNE).Meanwhile, Google has plans to open 12 data centers over the next 12-18 months, is significantly upping its cloud-related sales and marketing spend, and is reportedly eying cloud software/services firms such as Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), Xactly (NYSE:XTLY), and Callidus (NASDAQ:CALD), with plans to move their apps to Google's infrastructure. New cloud chief Diane Greene, whose time at VMware (NYSE:VMW) gave her plenty of experience selling to enterprises, has apparently been given a large budget to take on Amazon/Microsoft and cement Google as a top-tier cloud infrastructure (""IaaS"") and app platform (""PaaS"") provider.Google vs. the competitionAmazon still has a much larger customer base, a service offering list that runs into the hundreds, and a large marketplace of supported third-party software. MSFT, meanwhile, has differentiated Azure by providing tight integration with on-premise Microsoft server software and more broadly pushing a hybrid cloud strategy to enterprises that want to keep some cloud workloads on their own infrastructures.But (with the help of its historical infrastructure strengths), Google has won high marks for its cloud performance and pricing, which are often considered best-in-class. And - as SA contributor BayesianLearner recently pointed out while highlighting Google's TensorFlow machine learning software library - GOOG has also been able to stand out by creating a slew of advanced tools and services that appeal to developers. With today's announcements, the company is set to do the same for content creators.There are still many billions of dollars worth of on-premise IT workloads due to move to the cloud over the next several years, as well as a large opportunity to support major cloud service providers (such as Spotify) for whom performance and scalability are big deals. In spite of a relatively slow start, Google is now looking well positioned to take advantage of the opportunity."
3963782,24276,2016-04-07T10:12:14-04:00,"3D printing stocks are getting a bid again.Industry leader DDD is leading the way.If Autodesk starts showing a profit, the comeback is real.","The 3D printing business, left for dead just months ago, is showing signs of life.The boom was started by The Wohlers Report, which said ""additive manufacturing"" was a $5.1 billion business last year, growing 26%, and that the sales of desktop units actually climbed almost 70%, with companies and schools replacing hobbyists in the market.This, in turn, has drawn a bid for industry leader 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) of Rock Hill, South Carolina, which has gone from $6.20 to over $15 since mid-January and finally brought in a new CEO, Vyomesh Joshi, from Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ).General Electric (NYSE:GE) has opened a new $40 million additive manufacturing facility near Pittsburgh. Privately-held Aprecia Pharmaceuticals has launched a 3D printed drug that is supposed to be injected more easily. Australian researchers have developed something called a Biopen that can draw new cartilage on a knee. MIT is 3D printing robots that can walk out of the printer. A Dutch bank used 3D printing to recreate a Rembrandt. Industry bulls are even spreading rumors of an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) entry into the space.And that's before HP launches its MultiJet Fusion printer later this year.All the 3D printing shares are now on the march, although none so much as DDD. But voxeljet (NASDAQ:VJET) and ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) are both up 28% so far this year, and even Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS), which was burned so badly by the problems at MakerBot, is up 16%.Stratasys says its new J750 can ""print anything,"" with material extruded from what looks like a hypodermic needle rather than melted off a wire.Aerospace and medicine seem to be the industries most interested in 3D printing right now, areas where accuracy trumps speed. But a start-up called Uniz Technology has unveiled a stereolithography unit called the Slash 3D that it says is 50 times faster than older technologies.The question for investors is always finding a vehicle. That is a problem in solar energy, it's a big problem in pharmaceuticals and the problem exists in 3D printing as well. The hype is causing money to pile mostly into DDD, but with names like GE and HP entering the frame it's hard to call the move anything but a speculation.The canary in the coal mine here may be Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), the Computer Aided Design software house, which recently announced it lost $330 million, $1.46/share on revenues of $2.5 billion for all of fiscal 2016, which ended in January. Its shares jumped in March on an interoperability deal with Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) and a truce with activist investors. Autodesk is buying the open source netfabb and investing in its German parent, FIT Technology Group, as it pushes further into the 3D space.When you see Autodesk start to deliver bottom line results, I think that's the all-clear signal for the industry."
4002922,98236,2016-08-29T20:35:10-04:00,"Autodesk reported the results of its fiscal Q2 and achieved significant upside compared to prior consensus expectations.Much of the upside was driven by end of life purchases of perpetual licenses on the part of the user base.Nonetheless, new model subscription growth also exceeded targeted levels as the company moves its revenue stream both to the cloud and to ratable revenue sources.Because of the transition, most of the traditional valuation metrics are not really applicable in analyzing this company's performance and outlook.The metrics that matter including the growth in annual recurring revenue, the increase in deferred revenues and the decrease in operating expenditures all achieved favorable results this past quarter.","Autodesk: One of the rosier quarters in some timeThe days of Wine and Roses is actually both the name of a film and a song. The film was bittersweet to say the least and it is hard to call the ending happy. The title refers to the love story of two alcoholics in the early 1960s. But the lyrics allow one to forget what the movie was all about. The director of the film was the well-known director Blake Edwards and the theme of the film was really an examination of the perils of alcoholism on two middle class lovers and their child. And it has nothing whatsoever that I can see with the outlook for Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) except that the lyrics taken by themselves describe where I think this company is going.The company reported the results for its fiscal Q2 after the market closed last Thursday and the shares appreciated 8% on Friday. In fact, ADSK shares have been a strong performer so far this year as investors have become more convinced that the company's business model transition is working well and the company will address the issue of bloated costs as well and will achieve the objectives of increasing growth and profitability over the longer term. This was obviously not a universal conclusion, and in the midst of writing this article, one brokerage, Mitsubishi, chose to downgrade the shares from Neutral to Underweight because of doubts by the analyst that the subscription model will be a demand driver. I'm not too sure the extent to which the analyst has been paying careful attention either to the results that Adobe has enjoyed with demand since it went to a cloud model or to the objectives of this transformation. All I can say at this point in the wake of the earnings release is that it had more positive proof points about the potential for new model subscriptions and no obvious failures in that regards, facts being inconvenient things in that regard. I do not think that anyone really expects that demand for the Autodesk solutions will accelerate markedly because of the new business model, although that might happen. (The end of this article discusses, at least at one level, such a possibility.) On the other hand, subscription models, by their nature, will yield higher margins and more cash flow for companies - one can look at something as mundane as Aspen Tech (NASDAQ:AZPN) which simply switched from perpetual to subscription without any cloud to a rather amazing change in the company's business model.At the moment, traditional valuation models are unlikely to produce analytically accurate conclusions for a company like this in the midst of its transition. One must either take management's financial goals at their face or really ignore the name although the size of the company impels many analysts to cover the name without having the time to assess the business model change, the move to offering cloud-based alternatives and the concomitant assault on bloated costs.Autodesk is often considered to be an analog company to both Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and PTC (NASDAQ:PTC), but it is a bit difficult to characterize as one thing or the other. It is a closer analog to PTC and to Dassault (OTCPK:DASTY), although it has an offering that competes, to a greater or lesser extent, with the Adobe Creative Cloud, by far the 600 lb. gorilla in that space. It is easiest to think of the company as a supplier of design software, whether for architects, for designers of industrial products or even for users who make films (animation) with the product.Writing about CAD, which will be seen by many as the historical core of this company, is not perhaps the most entertaining of subjects although some of the things that can be done with the technology, particularly in 3D printing, are fascinating. I tried to do a deep dive with regard to many of the solutions this company has developed and what are its growth drivers in the article I wrote for Seeking Alpha back in April. I don't think that there have been enough changes in the company's business that it would be necessary to reprise the commentary I made at that time although where it is necessary I will update the outlook for the company's products and their positioning.The shares have enjoyed a modest appreciation of 15% since the time my report was initially published here on Seeking Alpha, as opposed to the iShares North American Tech-Software (BATS:IGV) which has appreciated 12% over the same span. Given that ADSK has a greater beta than the IGV, it has really achieved no significant alpha over the period.The issue for most investors is what next? The company's shares are at an all-time high and valuation is not, at least notionally, any kind of a bargain. EV/S based on the consensus estimates of 18 analysts for the current fiscal year is more than 7X for the current year and 6.6X for the company's FY '18 which starts on 2/1/17. The company is forecast to make a loss both this year and next year which makes the computation of a P/E meaningless. The company does not forecast cash flow, but for the first six months of the year, it generated positive cash flow of $146 million. Positive cash flow was mainly driven by a massive $347 million reduction in accounts receivable as a result of the switch in the business model to a ratable basis where contracts are billed and collected on a monthly basis. While I think using free cash flow is the appropriate bedrock in valuing companies, it is important to exclude one-time events such as a massive drop in A/Rs that almost by definition cannot be repeated. I do not think, at this juncture, that using traditional valuation methods has anything whatsoever on which to base a purchase recommendation for this company's shares.But the fact is that looked at objectively, both the quarter recently reported and the quarter reported in May were successful milestones in terms of the company's transition and should be viewed in that context. The company has and continues to forecast that it will achieve a 20% CAGR in subscription revenues through its fiscal 2020 (basically 2019 calendar year), a 24% CAGR in annual recurring revenues and free cash flow by that period of $6/share. Using a relatively modest free cash flow yield at that period of 4%, which likely reflects a lower growth rate than will be the case at that point, yields a price target of $150/share three years from now or something like an IRR of 25%-30%. Investors buy the shares based on that forecast and look at interim quarterly reports mainly as signposts as to whether the company is achieving the interim objectives along the way to such a consummation. Most observers, this writer included, felt that the results of Q2, excluding the one-time benefit to revenues and EPS, of the surge in demand for sunsetting products, represented a reasonable milepost attainment in terms of the company's ultimate objective.Overall, most investors, including some activists, are well aware that the company's current business model is really not a thing of beauty and needs to be drastically adjusted. As discussed below in a bit more detail, the company is spending an extraordinary 35% of revenues on research and development. It needs to start seeing more of a return on that investment or it needs to make less of an investment or it needs to do some of both.And the company spends 45% of its revenues on sales and marketing. That might be acceptable if the company were addressing hyper-growth, under-penetrated markets. That is not the case. I think it is reasonable to imagine that the demand for the three major markets in which ADSK operates is somewhere in the low-double digits, and it is not prudent or necessary to spend 80% of revenues on a combination of sales and marketing and research and development to address that kind of opportunity.A significant component of the company's path to achieving operating cash flow of $6/share three years from now will be through the adjustment of expense ratios to levels that are consistent with the company's growth opportunities. The targets are there and they are large and the goal has been articulated. This past quarter saw non-GAAP operating expense drop a bit and was an improvement compared to company forecasts. It will be key to see continuation of that trend. It is now time to see progress on that front as well as the sales model transition.Given the more important metrics at which to look, and despite the 15% share price appreciation, in reality, the shares represent more of a bargain than was the case four months past. I do believe, based on the last two quarterly reports, that the company is approaching its days of wine and roses, as most of us understand the terms and not in the context of the eponymous film.Some specific results for a company in the midst of a transitionI think it is important to take a careful look at what the company is selling and see how it is achieving its objectives in that context. Most readers and investors are going to focus on what are called new model subscriptions which increased 125,000 in the last quarter to 692,000. Other points of importance are the increase in new model annual recurring revenue which jumped to $371 million year on year, up by 86% year on year in constant currency, and total ARR which increased to $1.47 billion at the end of the quarter, up 10% compared to the prior year. Deferred revenue, which should become more significant going forward with the new business model, increased by 23% to $1.52 billion. And non-GAAP spending decreased by 4%. The company actually managed to generate a bit of non-GAAP earnings, but that had to do more with some last gasp of purchases of perpetual licenses before their availability was entirely phased out than a long-term trend. The company is likely to lose the amount it is forecasting as there is no one-time opportunity to generate revenues from on-prem license going forward. Maintenance revenues, heretofore, the major support of profitability, have started to decline, which is inevitable as there are no new maintenance contracts and users gradually drop out of the pool. CEO Carl Bass said that maintenance customers will gradually be incentivized to move toward product subscriptions which is appropriate in order to convert the model to completely ratable. But overall, recurring revenues increased to 67% of the total from 55% in the prior year.It needs to be noted that while the company today only offers products on a subscription basis, not all of those subscriptions are in the cloud and really cloud revenues, although not specifically disclosed are still nascent. For some arcane financial reporting convention, even though product subscriptions and what the company calls EBAs (Enterprise Business Arrangements) are entered into on a subscription basis, about 80% of product subscriptions are recognized as license and 55% of the EBA revenue is also recorded in the license revenue bucket. Management is aware that tracking subscription revenues on a consistent basis is significant in terms of gauging the company's real progress toward its fiscal 2020 goals. The fact that subscription revenues were flat last quarter is a function of this classification. Management said that in reality, subscription revenues, classifying all subscription arrangements as subscription revenue, would have yielded a 14% growth in terms of constant currency, although it would have reduced the license line by a comparable amount. The revenues reported are the revenues that have been recognized.The company classifies its revenues in four major buckets in terms of verticals. The company's Architecture, Engineering and Construction business is the company's largest and had the best overall results with revenues increasing 8%. The company's segment that it refers to as Manufacturing (really product design across a wide variety of business segments) rose by 3%. The company suffered a 47% decline in its platform business and its Media business was down 16%. Some of the 47% decline in the platform revenue bucket was a function of a change in classification. Again for reasons that seem arcane at best, when AutoCAD products are sold as part of a suite, they are recorded as revenue in the AEC segment. As suites were far more popular on a relative basis last quarter when compared to sales of individual products, some revenue flowed to the AEC segment that heretofore would have been booked into platform revenue.I really have no particular explanation for the noticeable revenue decline in Media and Entertainment. Perhaps, the swing to cloud and subscription was faster in this segment than in others. It seems unlikely that the overall demand for content creation in this digital intensive world has deteriorated and it doesn't seem as though ADSK has lost its competitive positioning. The Adobe Creative Cloud is a dominant factor in the space and has been so for many years. And Maya and its stablemate 3DS have also had a long history. It is rated highly in surveys where it is generally described as the most functional and the most complicated tool. I think the best I can say is that there was no end of life demand surge as this product has been subscription only for a couple of quarters now where the other two product buckets benefited from the end of life availability on a perpetual basis.The company has re-packaged its products into offerings that it calls Collections. These collections include one for AEC, one for Manufacturing and another one for Media and Entertainment. It may seem strange to some, but offering a rational set of offerings such as this will almost inevitably lead to greater revenues for ADSK - users will be buying a packaged unit of solutions rather than trying to game the system. Sadly, users often spend a fair amount of time and energy trying to avoid paying for the software they have acquired and this is a strategy to defeat that business practice. In addition, streamlining the product offerings into collections is going to have a visible impact on the cost of support over time, although just how much it isn't quite possible to say. Collections have just been on sale since the start of August, but CEO Bass reported that volumes for the first few weeks had accelerated above expectations although there are more than two months to go in this quarter, and typically half of the business in a given quarter is done in the last month.The company does lots of forecasting that is communicated to investors, but much of it is not totally relevant in terms of analyzing the transition. The company is forecasting that net subscription additions will be 475-525,000 for the full year and that non-GAAP expenses will decline by 2%. The decline in the short term for expense is almost all likely to occur on the general and administrative line which is obviously what investors ought to want to see. Over time, the company's adoption of a set of more streamlined solutions is going to allow it to support fewer iterations of the same product and that will drop development costs significantly - but again, it is difficult to forecast in advance. At one point, and to what expense, the company starts to address the level of sales and marketing expense was not addressed on the call, although self evidently, at least in terms of dollars, it is largest target of opportunity.As a closing thought, one of the things that happens in this kind of a transition is that there are numerous statistics that can be collected to document the rate of success in this kind of transition. As a victim, beneficiary of listening to a company like Aspen spend literally hours talking about those statistics, my personal opinion is that 90% of the statistics simply are reflections of the same underlying trends. It is the opinion of this writer that sticking to a few basic statistics like net sub adds, the growth in ARR and the growth in deferred revenues and the growth in the different revenue segments in the company's different vertical buckets will best serve investors. The other statistics basically do nothing much more than clutter up the cells in a spreadsheet.So, given the complexities, what is the real outlook for what this company is selling?One thing that is evident in looking at the transcript for this company's latest conference call, and so far, as that goes, the call for Splunk which is in the midst of a similar transition, is just how many cycles can be used in quantifying the transition and in avoiding discussions as to what is going on in the actual business environment. Most of us who are stakeholders or shareholders or SA contributors have to rely on something beyond intuition to guess how companies are actually faring. So, while I will do the best I can, the fact is that there are clearly holes in what we know about ADSK performance in the quarter just reported other than comments by the CEO and the CFO that the results were terrific. Terrific is not a quantifiable term, and I have yet to hear management describe a quarter as horrible - challenged maybe, horrible, never. But again, the numbers were what they were and the company had the net new subscriptions it reported.The other point to make is that while ADSK participates in a variety of interesting markets with very large TAMs, those markets have a degree of maturity. AutoCAD for example, has been around since 1982 - I had to look it up because I didn't remember when it wasn't available. This company is not an analog to the hyper-growth stories such as Workday (NYSE:WDAY) or Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) or Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). Expecting an endpoint for this company that is comparable to those companies is not reasonable and should not be considered. This company, to a greater or lesser degree, has the growth potentials beyond the business model of PTC or Dassault. I doubt that the company CEO, Carl Bass, would really dispute that point very emphatically. I was surprised to see an analyst imagine that anyone really was thinking differently on that point - and why that misapprehension might develop. It is why I do not think the argument for the downgrade holds much water.The outlook for the markets for most of these company's products is reasonable. Certainly not ebullient, but reasonable. The CEO said, ""the global condition have remained uneven with most mature markets performing relatively well, while most of the emerging markets have been challenged. As we evaluated our strong Q2 results, we didn't see any meaningful change in the demand environmentâ¦we don't see any near term risk.""Needless to say, I would have liked to see more of a discussion regarding the specific outlook and competitive position in the three major verticals the company serves, but that is what was provided and the company, unlike some, doesn't provide a slide deck with which to track some sub-headline details.I think it is fair to say that the market position of AutoCAD isn't likely to change any time in the near future. Most students learn to design structures using the product and continue to use it throughout their professional lives. Some of the company's other products such as Sketchbook, for example, do not have the same kind of dominant market position. And then there are newer areas such as 3D printing and particularly the Internet of Things that have significant potential, but are not yet major revenue contributors. But CAD will never be a red-hot growth market nor will PLM. They have been around for far too many years.The company spends lots of money on R&D and presumably does so with the same efficiency and market insight as compared to its competitors. Its GAAP R&D spend is 35% of revenues, truly an extraordinary amount for a company at this scale and with this maturity. Adobe, whose revenues are 2.5X those of ADSK, spends just 20% more on R&D. PTC, a company about half the size of ADSK, spends 25% as much in aggregate research and development dollars and DASTY, which has revenues one-third larger than ADSK, spends about 5% less in dollars on research and development.It might be reasonable to believe that the spend on research and development will ultimately produce some significant products that represent competitive breakthroughs or that the ratio of research and development spending will be significantly reduced or some combination of those two outcomes. It is inevitable that the research and development spend ratio will come down based on the new, less complex product bundles (collections) that the company is now selling. The company hasn't provided a forecast for that kind of spending decline. All that can be known is that it is just starting to happen and it is happening a bit earlier than the company had previously forecast.Whether solutions like Project Dreamcatcher, the company's current iteration of CAD have enough differentiation to gain market share is not something on which I'm really qualified to comment. I have identified an article that may help some interested readers in evaluating such a prospect - the net appears to be that ""Autodesk Fusion team is on the right track, and if I were the completion, I'd be getting worried. The San Francisco company is articulating their vision for a single design ecosystem so well that they're distinguishing themselves from the rest of the pack. That's great news for designers, just maybe not for the rest of the competition."" As the article was written at the end of May, I have to imagine it encapsulates some of the latest thought on the subject by what appears to be an impartial and distinguished source.The specific functionality has been evolving over the past several years although there was a formal release at the end of 2014 which has since been refined and augmented. It would have been interesting to hear about its progress - that just didn't happen during the call this past quarter. Sadly, none of the major market research consultancies, who ought to have the expertise to make an impartial judgment, have chosen to comment about this solution or some of the other significant new products that ADSK has and will release. Overall, I think that one has to accept the company's conference call comments regarding the market and the financial metrics that it will attain the balance of this fiscal year, it has a reasonable forecast track record and what it is doing with the transition is a win/win for both its customers and shareholders.The current case for investing in AutodeskI will reiterate that the process of changing the business model is not going to happen a quarter or two and that it is not going to end up with a company that can grow consistently at greater than 20%. That is highly unlikely to happen nor does it need to happen for the transition to work and to engender much greater share valuations as free cash flow rises significantly. Yes, the shares have increased since the first article and certainly in the wake of this quarter's numbers but they still present investors with reasonable risk/rewards in my opinion."
3484306,22775,2015-09-02T07:42:46-04:00,"Margin expectations keep going down for FY16-17, suggesting Autodesk will find it hard to reach its 30% margin target for FY18.We have decided to review the company's valuation using more conservative long-term assumptions to figure out if the stock is still a buy.The risk/reward appears attractive on a long-term view. But we believe that other tech stocks can offer more upside in a shorter time frame.","We have long been positive on Autodesk's (NASDAQ:ADSK) business model transition (from licenses to cloud and subscriptions), pointing out that revenue streams will become more recurring and predictable, that new paying users will join thanks to lower upfront costs and that piracy will be reduced through the use of cloud-based authentication. In other words, a subscription-based model is likely to deliver higher revenues, margins and cash flows in the long run.That said, we have also long been highlighting the adverse impact of Autodesk's model shift on its short-term financials, as subscriptions bring in less money upfront than licenses. The Q2 earnings update perfectly illustrated this once again, as the company lowered its FY16 guidance (revenue/EPS of $2.465-2.505bn/$0.60-$0.72 versus a consensus of $2.59bn/$1.04) following a mixed Q2 ($0.02 EPS beat, but slight revenue miss).Margin forecasts have been going down for a while, as the new model has been adding subscribers ahead of expectations (admittedly, net adds were a bit light for once in Q2, 61K versus a consensus of 90K). And with Autodesk accelerating the transition to subscriptions (perpetual licenses on standalone products will be discontinued at the end of the current fiscal year, and licenses on suites probably soon after), margin expectations are unlikely to recover soon.Against this backdrop, it becomes increasingly likely that Autodesk's 30% margin target for FY18 will be pushed out or lowered, as consensus margin expectations now stand well below 10% in FY16 and FY17, and as management hinted during the conference call at a ""financial model update"" on September 29 (Investor Day).With the stock down 30% from its recent high, we believe the risk of FY18 guidance cut is now largely priced in. That said, we have decided to review Autodesk's valuation using more conservative long-term assumptions to figure out if the stock is still a Buy.In the table below, we assume that Autodesk will reach its full profitability by FY20 (instead of FY18), and that the company will deliver a 25% margin in a bear case (similar to its pre-transition profitability levels) and 30% in a bull case. Then, we apply to the company's estimated EPS a 20-25x earnings multiple (which is fair for a leading software vendor) and discount the valuation at an 8.5% rate.The table shows an attractive risk/reward: No downside in a bear case and 23% upside in a bull case. Hence, we reiterate our positive stance on the stock, even if we believe that other tech stocks can offer more upside in a shorter time frame."

Both Eminence Capital and Sachem Head have formed a partnership to elicit change in the company. Currently, Sachem Head has a 5.7 percent stake in the company, paired with Eminence Capital's 5.8% percent - for a combined stake of 11.5 percent. Both firms have stated that they feel Autodesk's shares are undervalued.The two firms have outlined their partnership and intend to appoint their own members to the board, replacing the previous directors at the company's annual shareholders meeting.The head of Sachem Head is the protÃ©gÃ© of Bill Ackman, having been a partner at Ackman's Pershing Square Capital before founding Sachem Head. He spent eight years at Pershing before starting Sachem Head in 2012. The activist hedge fund had $1 billion in assets as of 20; their current value is at $3 billion - thrice the amount they started with only two years ago. They might be relatively, but have managed to proven themselves.Some of Ferguson's biggest investments since founding the fund includes Zoetis (NYSE:ZTS), a company where Pershing Square got two board seats, and a feat that Sachem helped contribute to.Eminence Capital is led by Ricky Sandler, originally a manager at Fusion Capital Management. Eminence isn't new to the activist game and should prove to be an effective partner for Sachem Head.Time to StrikeRecently, Autodesk shares have risen and this looks like an odd time for an activist to strike and start pushing for reform. Sachem Head wishes to discuss with the board ""operations, assets, capitalization, financial condition, strategic plans, governance, and board composition.""On the other hand you have CEO Carl Bass who is highly critical of activist investors and their motives. He feels like they are just trying to jump in for short-term profits and not benefit the company in the long term.He is, of course, not opposed to speaking with shareholders about concerns and ideas to make the company more profitable in the long term. Bass appears confident that his long-term strategy of shifting to cloud based subscriptions will be something that adds value to the company. Autodesk is arguing that this is a disruptive technology and as a leading technology company they need to be on the forefront of leading that movement.Specific ActionsPerhaps Bass doesn't need to worry about the new coalition of activist investors now targeting the company. They have yet to say anything regarding his long term strategy in regards to cloud computing and there's a possibility they would back up this strategy. With their recent acquisitions of SeeControl, a cloud based platform and Netfabb, it's an additive design and manufacturing tool for Autodesk; they're poised to become more profitable in the long term. This is something that activist investors would get on board with and support. The question is what does Sachem Head and Eminence Capital want to do with Autodesk?Here is what their plans for the company could include. The most important thing to do would be to maximize and boost margins. After that it would be ideal to boost shareholder returns. Buybacks would get cash into the hands of shareholders and allow the company to keep advancing. Autodesk, with a market capitalization of $14 billion expects sales between $2.4 to 2.5 billion next year, as well as $580 million to $600 million in Q3 revenues of 2015.Bass should hear the two activist firms out and think about granting them the board seats if their ideas align with the future plans for the company. Instead, he's been overly defensive. They both appear to be interested in the long-term profitability of the company."
3474526,65443,2015-08-28T10:32:55-04:00,"Autodesk reported mixed earnings, and lowered guidance again.However, this is because the company is in the midst of a transition to a subscription based model of selling software that will be beneficial in the long-term.The reason that guidance was lowered is actually a bullish factor, due to this business transition.Additionally, valuation looks attractive.","Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) reported earnings on Thursday. For some context, back in May, Autodesk lowered their guidance for both the next quarter and the full year. Despite this, they missed on revenue yesterday and lowered their full year guidance once again.On the surface, this sounds truly awful. However, the company is in the midst of a transition from selling software on a perpetual license to sell them on a subscription basis. Management indicated on the conference call that this was the reason that they were bringing guidance down again - they were anticipating more subscription sales vs. upfront perpetual license sales.This obviously hurts in the short-term - perpetual licenses are a one-time payment and thus are larger than subscription payments. However subscription payments are more reliable and more valuable over the long-term, as the customer ends up paying more for the software while the cost to Autodesk still remains the same. So yes, management may have guided down once again, but the reasoning for doing so makes this fact a positive, because it means Autodesk will make more money in the long-term, even if they make less in the current year. Further reinforcing this point is the fact that management did not bring down guidance for billing growth and subscription adds.Autodesk wants to get away from the perpetual license model - the subscription model is the way of the future. On the conference call, management stated that ""We're quickly approaching the end of this fiscal year when we stop selling new perpetual licenses for stand-alone products."" This is a strategic imperative, and investors should be glad that the company is reaching its goals faster than it thought it would. It's also important to note that the company is seeing strength in China - essentially the most important growth market, given its size. It's also impressive that they were able to do so, in spite of all the fear that the Chinese economy is doing worse than expected.The new business model adversely affects the company's net income, but this is temporary. It does result in the P/E looking absurdly high though, even when the company is actually minting money - it's cash flow is nearly ten times higher than their official net income. Therefore I recommend that investors use P/FCF, rather than P/E to judge this stock. This gives it a P/FCF of around 20, which isn't bad at all. Its P/S is also 4.36. Both of these metrics compare favorably to Autodesk's competitor - Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), which trades at a P/S of 8.85 and P/FCF of 30. This is despite the fact that both companies are growing at similar rates, which means that Autodesk compares very favorably with Adobe, suggesting that it is undervalued.I expect that the stock will decline tomorrow, and reach new 52-week lows, due to the reduced guidance and mixed results. I believe that the long-term story is still intact, and even strengthened by the latest earnings release. Therefore investors may want to see tomorrow as a buying opportunity."

However, the stock was +17% since strong FY '16 earnings results and an upward revision of long-term management forecast.Thesis:ADSK is the first mover to subscription & cloud, and it will succeed because it has a good product and the new business model is a superior value proposition for customers. This will translate to a larger TAM and market share.ADSK is solving specific pain points identified with its customers by offering lower pricing, flexible usage, elastic computing, and data sharing.

3683716,65443,2015-11-13T12:31:23-05:00,"Autodesk has risen 30% since I first recommended it.This move upwards has been largely driven by a change in sentiment, with no clear catalyst.The stock is also starting to look a little overvalued, based on its P/S and P/FCF.","I first wrote about Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) in August, after the company reported mixed earnings. Back then the stock as trading at roughly $47 a share, with massive negative sentiment hanging over it. I recommended that investors buy it, as the stock was looking quite undervalued, when taking into account the fact that the stock was undergoing a transition. Since then, the stock has soared nearly 30%, to $61.75 a share as of Thursday's close. This is a very rapid spike, in such a short time frame. Additionally, the stock only really started rising in early October, so it's an even shorter time frame than it would originally appear. Most worryingly, this move upward has been largely driven by a change in sentiment, rather than any actual change in fundamentals.The only fundamental event that occurred was Autodesk's analyst day, where all they did was reiterate previous guidance, and also talked about 2020 goals. The latter is important, but it should be viewed with extreme caution, given how far out this goal is. Moreover, the initial market reaction was negative.Analyst reaction was positive, but this didn't seem to affect the price either. Not only has the price target always been significantly higher than its current price, but, there hasn't been a single upgrade or downgrade since June. Then something seemed to change. The company hosted another meeting at JP Morgan's conference, and this resulted in a 9% move upwards. This was despite the fact that no new fundamental information was really released.Since then, the stock could not be stopped, roaring higher and higher. Adding to the bullishness was the fact that an activist investor has taken a position in Autodesk. However, this cannot really explain the extent of the company's rise, given that it was already over 20% higher by the time this position was disclosed. Therefore, the sudden change in sentiment is a true head-scratcher and I expect to see a pullback in the stock based on this alone. Given that there is no real reason for the stock to have suddenly reversed courses, there is no reason that it can't do the opposite, and is in fact quite likely to do so.Moreover, the company is also starting to look overvalued. In my original article, I argued that the company should be judged by P/S and P/FCF, rather than P/E, due to the fact that it was in the midst of a transition. Both of these multiples have expanded rapidly. Given their FY20 revenue goals of ""at least"" 3.5 billion, and the fact that their current FY16 revenue is $2.5 billion means that their annualized revenue growth is about 8.8%. A P/S of 5.5 looks expensive for such lackluster revenue growth.The free cash flow goal is 1 billion, while their current free cash flow is 570 million, which means the annualized growth would be 15.5%. The free cash flow growth looks a lot more appealing but a P/FCF of 26 seems to also largely price this in. I would not be comfortable paying so much for a company, especially given that the FY20 free cash flow is fairly hard to predict now. Therefore, I think investors should wait before picking up more shares of Autodesk, or even sell part of their position."
3198936,22775,2015-05-20T10:22:57-04:00,"The model shift will be more back-end loaded than initially expected as Autodesk sees FY17 as the trough year.In our view, this is just a phasing issue that should not raise concerns about the long-term trajectory of billings and margins.Autodesk could deliver at least a $3.50-4 EPS by FY18/19, hinting at a stock valuation of $70-100 using a 20-25x earnings multiple.","Until now, Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) had perfectly managed its business model transition (to cloud and subscriptions from licenses), delivering ahead of expectations on billings and subscriber additions in almost every quarter over the last years. But while Q1 was once again a solid beat ($0.30 EPS vs. $0.28 expected) with 95k net adds (vs. a consensus of 80-85k), billings growth was disappointing at +8% at constant FX vs. +20% in the previous quarter.In addition, Autodesk's Q2 guidance was light ($600-620m revenue, $0.14-0.19 EPS, below a consensus of $650m and $0.32), suggesting that FY16 will be back-end loaded. And management's comment that FY17 will be the trough year was a major surprise as most analysts and investors expected margins and earnings (which have been under pressure due to the model shift) to start recovering next year.While Autodesk blames some softness in several geographies (Japan and Russia), it also looks like the company has been affected by lower upfront billings for some of its subscribers. In our view, this is just a phasing issue that should not raise concerns about the long-term trajectory of billings (note the long-term 12% billings growth guide was reiterated).But this clearly suggests that the model shift will be more back-end loaded than initially expected as Autodesk's operating margin could decline to 10-12% in FY17 from 12-14% in FY16 before recovering in FY18 (the 30% margin target is unchanged but can now appear a bit aggressive).We have long been highlighting that Autodesk's financials are being distorted by the model shift and the Q2 earnings release and guidance update perfectly illustrate this. That said, we remain confident in the company's long-term profitability outlook and earnings power, even assuming the 30% margin target is slightly delayed.Indeed, the new model's revenue streams will become more recurring and predictable, new paying users will join thanks to lower upfront costs and piracy will be reduced through the use of cloud-based authentication. In addition, subscription revenues come with a higher ARPU as management recently commented the annual value of AutoCAD LT subscriptions was 30% higher than perpetual licenses.In all, Autodesk could deliver at least a $3.50-4 EPS by FY18/19, hinting at a stock valuation of $70-100 using a 20-25x earnings multiple (which is fair for a leading software vendor)."
3721446,58641,2015-11-30T15:10:06-05:00,"Autodesk changes its strategy in competing against Adobeâs industry-standard software products.After buying Indeeo last month, Autodesk now has a professional vector illustration software like Adobe Illustrator CC.Autodesk will sell Graphic for a $29.99 one-time fee. This could hurt the $19.99/month subscription-only Illustrator CC.The Autodesk Graphic $7.99 iOS version also is the best vector illustration/design app for the iPad Pro.","Activist investors might go easy on the management. Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is slowly upgrading its business model to compete better with its rivals. Autodesk's new $30 vector design/illustration software, Graphic, is a sign of this maturity (to not overprice its products).Autodesk bought Indeeo last month. It now sells a $30 professional-level vector illustration program that could eventually hurt the $19.99/month Adobe Illustrator CC. Maybe this time, Autodesk will succeed in eroding the dominance of Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) graphic design product.Autodesk is not competing well with Adobe's video editing and composing software products, Premiere Pro CC and After Effects CC. This is because video artists have to pay Autodesk $185/month to use Smoke.Autodesk Smoke offers the same advanced video editing, composing and special effects functionalities of Premiere and After Effects in one package. However, Adobe only charges $29.99/month for After Effects and $19.99/month for Premiere Pro. The huge disparity in monthly fees ($50 vs. $185) is why Autodesk Smoke remains a laggard product that is not being monetized properly.Autodesk will likely realize that stealing customers away from Adobe is easier done through competitive pricing. Smoke can only attract more subscribers once the monthly fee gets discounted to below $100.The long-term growth of Autodesk is better when it can cater to both stingy and generous software customers. The current 3D/CAD-centric business of Autodesk also is unlikely to post substantial future growth. This is due to the proliferation of free/cheaper alternatives.Autodesk obviously do not have the experience/money to challenge Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Office/Office 365. The next best thing therefore is for Autodesk to challenge Adobe's products to find growth opportunities.Selling more affordable (not more expensive) alternatives is the best way Autodesk can compete against Adobe's software products.Competitive Pricing Is KeyIndeeo created iDraw, a Mac OS/iOS vector design and illustration software. It was considered the best alternative to Adobe Illustrator in 2013. Now renamed as Autodesk Graphic, it still remains a lightweight, faster, more affordable option for professional and amateur graphic designers/user interface artists.(Source: Autodesk)Unlike its Smoke product's pricey subscription-only fee structure, Autodesk is selling Graphic for a one-time fee of $29.99. Autodesk's alternative to Illustrator CC is also cheaper than the $50 Affinity Designer from Serif. Autodesk is now ruthless enough to even underprice products from much-smaller rivals like Serif.The broader client list of Autodesk (compared to Serif) makes Graphic the more potent threat to Illustrator. Adobe's Illustrator CC business could decline once Autodesk starts persuading its existing clients to drop their Illustrator CC subscriptions in favor of Graphic. Most often than not, the artists/studios who create 3D/CAD assets for games/advertisements/broadcast TV also arw heavy users of Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop.Autodesk Graphic offers almost all the advanced tools and features found inside Illustrator CC. Graphic designers and UI/UX artists who are dissatisfied with Adobe's $19.99 monthly fee can save a lot of money if they switch to Graphic. Autodesk's buy-out of Indeeo also was an acqui-hire move to get new talent.The developers will continue to improve Autodesk Graphic. Going forward, I opine that Autodesk Graphic will grow beyond the Mac platform. Since other Autodesk CAD/3D/Animaton products are being used more in Windows-based computers, I expect Indeeo to eventually issue the Windows 10 version of Graphic.Aside from CorelDRAW, there is no other competent alternative to Illustrator CC on the Windows platform. Autodesk's management will be greatly remiss if they do not release a Windows version of Graphic.Competing with Adobe means Autodesk should battle it across on all platforms, not just on the Mac.Benefiting From The Popularity of The iPadThe long-term contribution of the Indeeo acquisition is not limited to the PC versions of Graphic. Like the older iDraw iOS version, Indeeo created a desktop-quality iOS port of Autodesk Graphic. The $7.99 iPad version and $1.99 iPhone version of Graphic have the tools and features of the Mac version.(Source: Autodesk)Autodesk Graphic iOS also are compatible with the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pencil and the iPad Pro. Artists/designers who are fed up with the lack of touchscreen-equipped Macs will likely buy the iOS version of Graphic to speed up their workflow. The sad truth is that Adobe is still reluctant to create feature-rich iOS versions of its PC software products.The iPad Air 2 and iPad Pro have very powerful processors and yet Adobe again released a watered-down iOS port of Illustrator CC. Illustrator Draw's User Interface below should convince investors that Autodesk Graphic is the real professional implementation of tablet-based vector illustration.(Source: Adobe)My TakeawayAutodesk's next growth opportunity is to challenge Adobe's design/web-focused products. I opine that the future of vector design/illustration software is to make it cross-platform. Long-term investors should therefore consider adding ADSK to their portfolio. Autodesk Graphic is a perfect example of a true cross-platform software that works almost exactly on PC and tablets.Tablets and 2-in-1 touch-enabled notebooks are the future of the computer industry. Autodesk now has a product that I believe is the best vector drawing/design iOS app. Adobe's future revenue stream from Illustrator CC could be affected once thousands/millions of iPad owners starts buying the $7.99 iOS Graphic app from Autodesk.Autodesk's enthusiasm to sell a $30 professional-level software also is a notable change to its old system of selling/renting only pricey products. Adobe's success is due to its affordable software products. I will go long on ADSK if management tries lowering the subscription fees of its other products to match Adobe's pricing.Competitive pricing is and will always be the decisive factor to determine the success of any product."

(NASDAQ:ADSK) may attract some potential investors due to the company's stable earnings in recent years. Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether a company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here's a look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another.

The Defensive Investor is concerned with the low current ratio, the lack of dividends, insufficient earnings growth over the last ten years and the high PEmg and PB ratios. The Enterprising Investor is only concerned by the lack of dividends. As a result, all value investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, the company has seen its EPSmg (normalized earnings) rise from $0.80 in 2011 to only $0.82 for 2015. This is a weak level of earnings growth, and does not support the market's implied estimate for 30.78% annual growth over the next 7-10 years. The ModernGraham valuation model returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling below the current price, indicating that the company is overvalued at the present time."
2958906,22775,2015-02-27T11:43:18-05:00,"Autodesk reports solid Q4 figures.Autodesk is likely to exceed its FY16 sub adds, billings and margin target by a wide margin.We remain convinced by the companyâs revenue and earnings potential.","In our most recent article on Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), we said that billings and subscriber numbers, which are currently viewed as the company's key operating metrics amid earnings pressure caused by the business model shift, offered obvious upside in FY15 Q4. In line with our thesis, the design software vendor reported net sub adds of 100k vs. a consensus of 83k and billings of $815m (up 20% at constant FX) vs. a consensus of $780m.More importantly, the FY16 guide (billings growth of 3-5% or 9-11% at constant FX and sub adds of 375-425k) appears conservative, even if it comes slightly above Street's expectations. This guidance surprisingly hints at a lack of traction after a strong FY15 (sub adds roughly in line with the 385k reported in FY15, sharp slowdown of billings growth compared to the +20% in FY15), while Autodesk is in the process of phasing out perpetual licenses over the next 12-24 months and to have most of its users migrating to a subscription plan. Hence, an acceleration in sub adds seems highly likely in FY16.This, combined with marketing initiatives (product bundles available only for subscribers) and the introduction of new distribution partners (Amazon and Dellâ¦), should enable Autodesk to approach 100% recurring revenues pretty soon (vs. the 70% target) and to grow revenue and billings at a faster pace than the current guidance.True, operating margins and earnings were the weak spot in Autodesk's quarterly release as Q4 EPS were only slightly above consensus while the FY16 margin guide (13-15%, down 120bps year-on-year at mid-point) came below expectations and could raise concerns about the company's ability to reach a 30% margin by FY18.Once again, we believe Autodesk has been extremely conservative when setting this operating margin target and that the risk is on the upside. Even assuming investments in the business model transition, we would be surprised to see a margin decline this year given the expected revenue growth. Remember that Autodesk is a software business with a strong operating leverage. In addition, we feel comfortable with the profitability ramp by FY18 as subscription revenues come with a higher ARPU (management recently commented the annual value of AutoCAD LT subscriptions was 30% higher than perpetual licenses).In conclusion, we remain Buyers of the stock and also reiterate our pair trade idea Long Autodesk / Short 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). The January 2016 P/E is expensive at first sight (52x) but this is due to Autodesk's financials being distorted by the current business model transition. The FY18 P/E (around 21x), which assumes a 30% operating margin (end of the transition), is more useful in our view and does not appear excessive for a software company with a leading position and the opportunity to play a key role in the 3D printing revolution."

No one talks about Commodore anymore, do they? For younger readers, Commodore International was the leader in the PC industry in the early 1980s with the top-selling Commodore 64.Today, the new exciting technology is 3D printing or additive manufacturing. And the current leadership is under quite a bit of pressure.3D Printing Stocks Under PressureTwo of the leaders - 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) - have seen their stocks tumble over the past 15 months. They are down 71% and 61% respectively, since the start of 2014.Bottom line here is that reality failed to keep with the hype.3D Systems saw revenues climb only in the 7%-12% range, below company projections of 30%. Stratasys meanwhile is investing heavily, keeping its operating margins in the 10%-14% range, instead of the 18%-23% the company had forecast.Other current players in the field, such as ExOne (NASDAQ:XONE) and Voxeljet AG (NASDAQ:VJET), have also suffered.The other reality staring shareholders of these companies in the face is the fact that the big printer players, such as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), will be entering the space very soon.Pete Basiliere of the consultancy Gartner told the Financial Times, ""By the end of 2016, we'll see at least three of the big printer makers in the market with their own branded 3D printer.""Terminator 2 TechnologyBut that isn't the real threat ...The real danger comes from futuristic technology inspired by the film, Terminator 2.The details were revealed in a study published in the journal, Science.The technology is called ""continuous liquid interface production"" or Clip, developed by a firm called Carbon3D. This company was founded by researchers at the University of North Carolina and is backed by Sequoia Capital and Silver Lake Kraftwerk.The company also recently received a $10 million investment from Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK). This is Autodesk's first investment from its Spark Investment Fund, which launched last October with the aim of investing in 3D start-ups. Over 600 companies applied to Autodesk and Carbon3D landed the investment, which tells you what Autodesk thinks of the technology's commercial potential.The technique developed by Carbon 3D works 100 times faster than current methods and produces objects that are considerably stronger than objects produced via current methods. See the video.The Carbon 3D method features a moving platform that gently lifts printed objects out of a pool of liquid resin, ala the robot in Terminator 2 that rose from a pool of molten metal. And unlike current technology, this machine works continuously (not constructing objects layer by layer)The technique combines pulses of light, which solidifies the resin, with oxygen, which prevents it from becoming solid, to create very intricate 3D objects.At the base of the liquid resin reservoir, there is an oxygen permeable window. This forms a ""dead zone"" at the bottom of the tank. Solidification happens just above this ""dead zone"".Carbon3D plans to launch its first 3D printer and range of materials in the next year.Outlook for 3D Printing SolidThat would seem to be ideal timing for the company.The worldwide products and services market for 3D printing climbed 35.2% from 2013 to 2014, to $4.1 billion, according to consultancy Wohlers Associates.Another consultancy, Canalys, forecasts that the 3D printer and services market will continue to grow in 2015, to $5.2 billion.The market would be growing even faster, but adoption of additive manufacturing has been slowed by factors including the length of time needed to manufacture objects and the lack of quality of some objects produced.This new technology from Carbon3D looks to be a real game changer, making objects in mere minutes instead of hours with current 3D printing technology. In effect, what Carbon3D has done is to turn a mechanical process into a photochemical one.From a time and quality standpoint, this makes additive manufacturing competitive with current manufacturing processes for making real-life objects, perhaps leading to a new Industrial Revolution.Investment ImplicationsAt the least, it may at least turn some of its competitors into this generation's Commodore.What do I mean?That means the current aforementioned leaders in the sector - using what now looks to be outdated technology - may not survive. The chemical photography guys did not survive well the advent of digital photography.To survive, they will have to adopt the latest technology - perhaps licensing it or investing into it as Autodesk has done. At the moment, they seem to be ignoring the technology.One very interesting aspect of this Clip technology from Carbon 3D will be what the reaction of the giants like HP will be. Perhaps they can find an alternative. But likely they adopt it in some form.Bottom line: it looks like Autodesk's first investment in its Spark Investment Fund will be a big winner."

3198506,40351,2015-05-20T08:06:02-04:00,"Autodesk has recently released its quarterly results that were better than marketâs estimates.The second quarter and full year growth guidance, however, was disappointing.Currency headwind remains a major theme in this earnings season as well.Autodeskâs shares have fallen following weaker than expected guidance.This could be a buying opportunity.","Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), the maker of AutoCAD and other construction and engineering software, has recently released its first quarter results for FY2016 in which it managed to beat the revenues and earnings estimates following a strong performance in the fourth quarter. But the San Rafael, California-based company has given a disappointing guidance.Earnings recapDuring the quarter, Autodesk's revenues increased by 9.1% from last year to $646.5 million, largely on the back of 15.7% increase in subscription revenues. The revenue growth was driven by a strong performance in the architecture, engineering, & construction (AEC) and manufacturing segments where revenues climbed by 21% and 25% on a year-over-year basis respectively. The company's earnings, adjusted for one-off items, fell from $0.32 per share last year to $0.30 per share. The earnings drop was led by an increase in costs associated with the company's effort to switch from a license-based to a cloud-based subscription model. Analysts, on the other hand, were expecting a profit of $0.28 per share from revenues of $637 million, as per data compiled by FactSet and Thomson Reuters.Despite the better than expected performance, billings growth dropped from 13% in the fourth quarter to just 3%. On a constant currency basis, billings growth fell from 20% in the prior quarter to 8%. Subscriptions increased by 95,000, half of which were related to the company's new offerings which includes term-based desktop, enterprise flexible license and cloud-based service offerings.Currency headwindsDuring the quarter, Autodesk struggled due to the strong dollar. Despite the hedging, the rise of the greenback hit the company's billings by $31 million and revenues by $22 million. Autodesk generates two-third of its revenues from international markets which is why it is significantly exposed to currency fluctuations, but it isn't the only company that is facing this problem. Rather, the impact of the strong dollar on revenues and earnings has been one of the major themes in the last as well as the ongoing earnings season. Companies such as Dover (NYSE:DOV), DuPont (NYSE:DD), Harley Davidson (NYSE:HOG), Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW), Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB), United Technologies (NYSE:UTX) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) have all been hit by dollar's rally.What I find particularly interesting is how a majority of the analysts who cover these companies have failed to predict the impact of stronger dollar on top and bottom-line. This is probably because while analysts are experts regarding the companies they cover and the underlying industry, they are not currency strategists. When it comes to analyzing currency movements, their knowledge is usually about as good as an average individual investor. This was also evident in the consensus estimate regarding Autodesk's guidance.For the second quarter, Autodesk forecast revenues of between $600 million and $620 million and expects to report a net loss of $0.10 to $0.05 per share. In adjusted terms, this will translate into a profit of between $0.14 and $0.19 per share. This was significantly lower than analysts' expectations of a profit of $0.32 per share from revenues of $650 million. Moreover, for the full year, Autodesk has lowered its revenue growth guidance from a mid-point of 4% to 3%. Analysts, on the other hand, were expecting revenue growth of 4.5%. The cut in guidance, which most of the analysts' failed to predict, is due in large part to the currency headwinds.Bullish thesisThis weaker than expected guidance, which was partly due to the analysts' inability to predict currency movements, led to ~2% drop in Autodesk's shares yesterday. And this could be a buying opportunity for long-term investors. That's because the bullish thesis, which is underpinned by Autodesk's transition, is still intact.The company will stop selling its perpetual offerings for standalone products by the end of January and will also discontinue the sale of perpetual licenses for suites in the next fiscal year. This will lead to a substantial drop in license revenues, but a subscription-focused model will allow the company to open predictable and recurring revenue streams. Moreover, with migration to subscription offering, the revenue per user metric is going to climb. The rental license offerings, on the other hand, have the potential to significantly lift the user base. Autodesk will also monetize the cloud-based offerings. In short, while the company might struggle with growth over the current and next fiscal year, with complete transition to subscription-based model, Autodesk will likely rebound in 2018. In addition to this, in the coming years, Autodesk will also likely follow in SAP's footsteps by lifting its maintenance pricing to match the subscription prices which will give a boost to its revenues."
2684205,20411,2014-11-14T19:05:24-05:00,ADSK has higher revenue.But lower EPS growth.Something needs to give.,"Our observations of Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) suggest that earnings growth is declining while revenue is increasing. This diverging relationship has been quite clear since the third quarter of 2013, and although the company still has time to prove that it can bring those added revenues to the bottom line, it has not done that yet.Instead, as earnings growth turned negative the stock accelerated and the PE multiple increased from near 18 times earnings, where it was when this divergence began in the third quarter of 2013, to over 40 times earnings, where it stands today. The multiple expansion associated with Autodesk took place as earnings growth declined, and that raises concerns for investors looking to identify fair valuation.Let's make this more tangible by saying this. A company that is trading at 40x Earnings while EPS growth is negative makes traditional investors that respect fair value cringe. What happens if ADSK does not get EPS results up and up fast? The answer is simple - the multiple falls back to where it was, and takes the stock down with it.Technical take:According to our real time trading report for Autodesk the stock is in the process of increasing toward longer term resistance and reasonably longer-term resistance is within striking distance. It is much closer than longer term support, suggesting that the downside risk in the stock outweighs the upside potential at this time. Because the stock is in the upper tier of its trading channel we would not suggest buying the stock at this level, but instead recommend protecting gains given the proximity to longer term resistance.Summary:The diverging relationship between revenue and earnings growth at Autodesk makes it extremely overvalued based on fundamental observations that are based on earnings growth as that relates to PE multiples, and any doubt about that basic fundamental observation can only be made if the diverging relationship between revenue and earnings growth is not related to margin pressure. In addition, it is absolutely clear that Autodesk will need to bring revenues to the bottom line and produce substantial EPS growth in the year ahead to satisfy investors. Otherwise, in our opinion, the massive multiple expansion that took place recently will reverse. This suggests that investors who are holding onto Autodesk protect those gains and given the aggressive increase that has happened recently and the proximity of the stock to longer term resistance our technical analysis supports the same."

It will not help reduce the rampant use of pirated copies of AutoCAD products.,"It is my strong opinion that Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is a bad investment candidate right now. The high valuation of this software sales-dependent company is dangerous considering that AutoCAD products are no longer as dominant as they used to be.

It is a big surprise because in my younger years (1998 to 2010), AutoCAD was the de facto standard among Filipino architects, engineers, drafting professionals, and product designers.The architect's explanation is that DraftSight Professional was a lot cheaper to own than AutoCAD products. He also made it clear that DraftSight works and feels like AutoCAD LT versions. The architect paid $299 (first year of license, renewable for $99 for succeeding years) to get the professional version. He also explained that even the free version of DraftSight is already as good as AutoCAD 2015 LT when it comes to 2D architecture-related drafting.My architect only paid for the professional version to get extra premium features that helps him accelerate his workflow. I did some research and I found out that DraftSight is indeed a free 2D CAD program from Dassault Systemes (OTCPK:DASTY). I downloaded a copy and below is a screenshot of DraftSight 2015 running on my Windows 7 desktop.(click to enlarge)Source: Alcaraz ResearchI do not have a copy of AutoCAD LT 2015 but here is a screenshot of the program's user interface from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).(click to enlarge)Source: Amazon.comAutoCAD LT 2015 (which is also 2D-drafting only) costs $1,200 to buy outright, and $30 per month on a monthly subscription basis from Autodesk's online store.The free version of DraftSight's user interface is not as pretty looking as AutoCAD LT 2015.

Investors should also take into account that DraftSight is just one of the many free alternatives to Autodesk's AutoCAD software.Here is a list of some of the best no-cost CAD software available.PhythonCADQCADDoubleCAD XTFreeCADPTC Creo ElementsBRL-CADArchimedesnanoCADLibreCADOpenSCADThere are other free or cheap alternatives to AutoCAD that can easily be found via Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) search. I now have DraftSight and DoubleCAD XT installed. A comprehensive feature-for-feature comparison between the free DoubleCAD XT versus the expensive AutoCAD LT software is available. DoubleCAD seems to offer more features that helps architects speed up their workflow.ConclusionI opine that the proliferation of free/cheap CAD/CAM software severely limits the growth prospect of Autodesk. This is still true in spite of Autodesk's decision to emulate the example of Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) subscription-based model.It is very difficult to attract people to pay $30 every month for AutoCAD LT 2015 when there are dozens of free professional-quality CAD programs available (like DraftSight). Free softwares that are compatible with AutoCAD files will eventually erode the leadership position of Autodesk.DraftSight and DoubleCAD XT can open and edit AutoCAD-made DWG files. Here is my DoubleCAD XT opening a DWG file created by another architect using AutoCAD.(click to enlarge)Source: Alcaraz ResearchMy point is that AutoCAD 2015 (2D/3D capable) still retails at a stratospheric price of $4,195. Sure professionals dependent on AutoCAD will keep buying upgrades or new versions from Autodesk. However, there is slim chance that the current user base of AutoCAD will significantly grow in the future.TurboCAD Pro, DesignCAD, and progeCAD are much cheaper 2D/3D CAD programs that are capable of replacing AutoCAD. There is also ZWCAD, which Autodesk sued for patent infringement but lost the case in the Netherlands.The availability of IntelliCAD technology makes it easy for other companies to create cheap AutoCAD clones and Autodesk cannot stop them. Autodesk is likely headed for trouble if it remains adamant in its old-world strategy of pricing AutoCAD products so expensively.The monthly subscription for AutoCAD 2015 is $210 - a price still too high for most small firms. In spite of the more stringent anti-piracy laws in the Philippines, many architecture/engineering design shops still buy just one AutoCAD software for one PC as a showcase unit just in case the Optical Media Board makes inspection. The other workstations have hidden pirated copies of AutoCAD installed.As long as Autodesk keeps pricing its products far higher than what most users will willing pay for, pirated copies of AutoCAD products will remain popular among office workers and home-based designers. The argument that Autodesk gives free copies of its products to students and educators is invalid. Free educational versions of AutoCAD cannot be used for commercial purposes.Architecture/engineering design firms who have limited budgets (or facing stiff competition) will likely use pirated copies of AutoCAD or use free alternatives like DraftSight so they can reduce their overhead costs. A lower overhead cost allows design professionals to offer their services at a cheaper rate.The architect who used DraftSight to layout the house for my brothers only charged me 5,000 pesos ($113.64) for both architectural and structural drawings. My 3-storey house's design, which was created in AutoCAD 2011 by another architect, cost me 12,000 pesos ($272.73).I strongly agree with Alpha Omega Mathematica's Sell rating for ADSK.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2715955,22775,2014-11-27T13:23:57-05:00,Autodesk delivered again ahead of expectations in Q3.The upside remains significant in Q4 as the high-end of the billings guide implies only 10% growth vs. 25% in Q3.The group's open-source strategy in 3D printing makes sense.,"Business model shift a boon for revenue/billings growth and operating marginsSince the beginning of the year, we have been highlighting Autodesk's (NASDAQ:ADSK) ability to surprise on the upside in relation to an increasingly supportive environment for its two main verticals (Construction and Manufacturing) and the early success of its business model shift to subscriptions. After two strong quarters, Autodesk delivered again ahead of Q3 expectations ($618 million in revenue, $0.25 EPS versus consensus of $602 million and $0.22).Importantly, billings and subscribers, which are now the most useful operating metrics, beat consensus by a wide margin (net sub adds of 121,000 versus a consensus of 57,000, billings up 25% versus consensus around +8%), leading Autodesk to raise FY guidance (billings growth of 15-17% versus 10-12% previously and sub adds of 325,000-375,000 versus a prior of 200,000-250,000).In our view, upside remains significant in Q4 as the high-end of the billings guide implies only 10% growth in the quarter (vs. 25% in Q3). Momentum should remain supportive next year. Indeed, Autodesk announced in recent weeks plans to phase out perpetual licenses over the next 12-24 months, starting with AutoCAD LT. Of the company's 2.9 million customers not on a subscription plan, half are AutoCAD LT users and will have to migrate soon. This, combined with marketing initiatives (product bundles available only for subscribers) and the introduction of new distribution partners, should enable Autodesk to approach 100% recurring revenues soon (versus 70% guidance).Considering that subscription revenues come with higher ARPU (management recently commented the annual value of AutoCAD LT subscriptions was 30% higher than perpetual licenses), Autodesk's business model shift should be a boon for revenue/billings growth and operating margins. We believe Autodesk is on track to reach or even exceed its long-term margin target, potentially sooner than expected.The 3D printing opportunity is just around the cornerThe January 2016 P/E is expensive at first sight (40x), but this is due to distorted financials caused by the current model transition. Assuming a normative operating margin of 30%, the stock's P/E would stand slightly above 20x, which is not overly demanding for a software company with a leading position and the opportunity to play a key role in the 3D printing revolution.The group's open-source strategy in 3D printing makes sense. While Autodesk's long track record in the design software business is likely to make its Spark platform more reliable and more user-friendly than proprietary solutions, the open-source nature of Spark (as in, free) could attract a large number of printer makers that do not have sufficient in-house software development skills. That said, 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) are expected to develop their own solutions and to stay away from Spark.Notably, 3D Systems announced a few days ago (see our article) that it will acquire small design software vendor Cimatron (NASDAQ:CIMT). This resistance to Spark from the 3D leaders is understandable as much of the value of 3D printing in the future will probably lie in the software. Will users accept 3D printing hardware coming with proprietary software (like they do with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices for instance)? The question is openâ¦For now, we continue to bet on the success of the Autodesk platform. Should Spark enjoy wide adoption and become the 3D printing software standard, it could give a significant boost to sales of Autodesk's core design and PLM (Product LifeCycle Management) solutions.We reiterate that Autodesk is a different and safer way to play the 3D printing revolution, with valuation levels and earnings expectations much more modest than 3D printing stocks such as DDD.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

2678855,23471,2014-11-13T13:16:13-05:00,"ADSK is suitable for Enterprising Investors following the ModernGraham approach.
        According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is overvalued at the present time.
        The market is implying 23.25% earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, a rate unsupported by the company's recent earnings performance.","Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) has seen a run-up in price over the last couple years, and for many investors that alone presents a reason to turn away. However, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that looking at the price cannot be the sole factor in investment decisions as the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here is a look at how Allergan Inc. fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.ADSK data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 3/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 4/5Key Data:Balance Sheet - July 2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryAutodesk does not pay a dividend.At the initial phase of an analysis, Autodesk appears suitable for the Enterprising Investor but not the Defensive Investor due to the lack of earnings growth over the last ten years, the lack of dividend payments, and the high PEmg and PB ratios. The Enterprising Investor's only initial concern is the lack of dividend payments. Defensive Investors should look to other opportunities while Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.The company has shown some growth in raising its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $0.80 in 2011 to an estimated $1.07 for 2015. However, the market is implying an earnings growth rate of 23.25% for the next 7-10 years. In contrast, the average growth rate the company has achieved over the last few years is only 6.77%. There would have to be a significant change in the company's prospects in order to meet the market's implied forecast, especially for such a long period of time. As a result, the model returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling below the current price, indicating the company is overvalued at the present time.Be sure to check out previous ModernGraham valuations of Autodesk Inc. for more perspective!"

So far peer Q4 results have been strong.Expect flat Q4-15 Gross margin of 90%, but operating margin likely to be sharply lower.Global macro trends a key driver for revenue growth, continental PMIs in focus.Valuation methodologies all suggest ADSK is overvalued.","AutoDesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is well positioned in both its industrial sector exposure and geographically, thus it benefits from secular software growth. In addition, the company also has a cyclical, macro-economic delta which differentiates it from most of its peers. Sharp operating expense increases during FY'15 and beyond however are likely to reduce operating margins significantly. My DCF methodology illustrates a fair market value of only $50 per share, well below today's market price.Autodesk, unusually, a good proxy for global economic growthAs a quick reminder, AutoDesk is a leading provider of design and engineering software, commonly known as computer-aided design ""CAD"" software for architecture, civil engineering and manufacturing businesses. The software is fundamental to the design, construction and management of new buildings and civil infrastructure projects, such as roads, power plants, bridges and water systems. Further, its software is used in consumer facing devices such as video games, TV sets and audio equipment. Given its wide industrial application base and global licensing and subscription revenue streams - split roughly one third, Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific - ADSK is geared into general global economic growth trends more than most of its other computer software peers. The chart below highlights the positive correlation between the ADSK share price and global economic activity. The recent downturn in the global activity index has not yet been reflected in ADSK's share price, but is a negative factor to keep an eye on.Gross profit margins very high, at around 90%, with Q4 likely to be the strongest quarterMarket expectations for full year revenues (to end Jan'15) are around $2.5 billion, up 10% y/y, split roughly 52% for license revenue (7% growth y/y) and 48% for subscription revenue (13% growth y/y) generating gross profits of around $2.24 billion, i.e almost 90% gross profit margin. Clearly, with such a high gross margin on revenues (with Q4 probably its highest margin quarter going forward), slight changes in the revenue growth outlook have a high delta on earnings. Further one must ask the question, how much higher can gross margins grow? Probably not much. Focusing on Q4-15 revenue expectations, I look for revenues of around US$650m and gross profit of US$585m.Operating margin decline due to sharply higher operating expenses, driving down EPS by 30% y/yDespite a strong gross margin outlook for Q4-15, operating margin outlook is that of a sharp decline mainly due to higher sales and marketing costs and higher research and development costs, which has been a characteristic during the full year. The operating margin for Q4 is likely to be around 12.5%, down around 700 bps y/y, with the full-year operating margin down by a similar amount, leading to a 30% decline in EPS for the year. Operating margin guidance for FY'16 will be key to share price performance from here.All valuation techniques suggest this stock is overvaluedUtilizing my DCF methodology, as demonstrated below, I arrive at value of approximately $52 per share. Further, looking at a comparative peer group valuation, ADSK is trading on double-digit premiums to its peers on EBITDA multiples. I do not see earnings bouncing back sharply anytime soon and recommend value investors stay clear of ADSK at current prices."

Revenue growth accelerated to 13% vs. 4% in Q1 as strength was relatively broad-based, with both Construction (32% of revenues) and Manufacturing (25% of revenues) performing well (+23% and +17% respectively) and with most geographies contributing to the beat. Asia was solid at +8% despite the temporary economic slowdown in Japan due to the recent implementation of the sales tax hike. Importantly, the business model transition from licenses to Cloud & subscriptions continued to perform ahead of expectations, leading Autodesk to raise its FY15 net adds target to 200-250K from 150-200K. Billings growth, now widely viewed as a key metric as it takes into account the business model transition, accelerated to 27% in Q2 from 12% in Q1, boding well for future revenue growth.We have been saying since our January article ""Autodesk: A Different And Safer Way To Play The 3-D Printing Revolution"" that Autodesk was likely to keep surprising on the upside, as the company's two main verticals (Construction and Manufacturing) benefited from an increasingly supportive environment: a strong commercial construction market (which typically lags residential construction recoveries by 6-12 months) and an improving macro for Autodesk's Manufacturing customers, notably in the important Japan and Europe geographies. We believe that these drivers remain intact and that the revenue & earnings revision cycle (FY15 revenue growth guidance raised to 7-9% from 4%-6%) will remain positive in coming quarters. We also explained in our previous articles that the model shift from licenses to Cloud was a clear positive as revenue streams would become more recurring and predictable (based on subscriptions) and as new paying users would join (upfront costs are more attractive vs. licenses).In conclusion, we reiterate that Autodesk is a different and safer way to play the 3-D printing revolution, with valuation levels and earnings expectations much more decent than 3-D printing stocks such as 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). Note that the January 2015 P/E is expensive at first sight (46x) but that this is due to Autodesk's financials being distorted by the current model transition. Assuming a normative operating margin of 30%, the stock's P/E would stand slightly above 20x, which is not overly demanding for a software company with a leading position and the opportunity to play a key role in the 3-D printing revolution.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

This article will review the underlying fundamentals of Autodesk, and the basis for its selection within this strategy.Our fundamental research is based on earnings. Our objective is to identify earnings from operations, so we exclude onetime events from our review. That means special tax considerations are excluded, and other events not pertinent to operations are excluded from our earnings analysis too.In doing so, we are able to review the underlying growth rate of Autodesk much more clearly; however, we cannot be nearsighted in our observation either. Every data point is a trailing 12-month review of earnings, so the data we include in our observations also comprises a full year, and that means no seasonal anomalies exist. For Autodesk, this time, the yearly growth rate is what is most important.In our yearly growth rate chart for Autodesk below, we can see that the yearly growth rate has been deteriorating and is currently -18%. This is trailing 12-month data, and we're comparing this quarter to the same quarter of last year, the trailing 12-month data from last year, to determine how earnings have changed between now and then. We do this for every quarter, and that is how our yearly growth rate chart is devised. It shows us that Autodesk realized a peak in earnings growth in 2012, and since then, the earnings growth has been declining and is well in negative territory now.The concern here is absolutely the trajectory of earnings growth, but also very important to this observation is the corresponding PE multiple. At almost the exact same time earnings growth began to deteriorate, the PE multiple for Autodesk began to increase. That means that the stock increased based on multiple expansion, and not on earnings growth.Market participants can argue the rationale for multiple expansion all they want, but the truth is that when stocks increase based on multiple expansion without corresponding earnings growth, it is due at least in large part to an excessive amount of liquidity chasing stocks (Stimulus?). With earnings actually deteriorating, the rational approach is not to buy it, but instead to take money off of the table; but that is not what happened here.Notwithstanding our longer-term macroeconomic observations, the selection of Autodesk as the Stock of the Week this week had everything to do with our correlated market observations. Our market observations on Sunday suggested that the markets were beginning to break down, and if they continued to break, Autodesk would likely break with them. The Stock of the Week selection can be long or short, the strategy began in December, 2007, so it has been proven in up and down markets, but by definition, as the title suggests, the trading plan we have outlined for Autodesk is actionable for this week and this week only.Stock of the Week (SOW) Strategy:"

In all, a subscription-based model is likely to deliver higher revenues, margins and cash flows in the long run.The new business model was in focus during Autodesk's Investor Day last week and sparked many sell-side upgrades as Autodesk provided strong metrics giving increased confidence in the transition and in the group's ability to achieve and potentially exceed its long-term guidance. As a reminder, Autodesk expects 12% billings CAGR through FY18 and a 30% operating margin in FY18 (from 15-16% in FY15).Autodesk speeds up the transition: 100% recurring revenues in sightAs commented in our previous articles, the model transition has been performing ahead of expectations in Q1 and Q2, leading Autodesk to raise its FY15 net adds target to 200-250K from 150-200K when reporting its Q2 figures. Interestingly, the company said that 30-35% of subscribers were net new customers, confirming that the ""lower cost"" (see the impact on ARPU below) model was attracting new users.It looks like the transition will now go even faster as Autodesk announced plans to phase out perpetual licenses over the next 12-24 months, starting with AutoCAD LT. Of the company's 2.9m customers that are not on a subscription plan, half of them are AutoCAD LT users and will have to migrate soon.This, combined with marketing initiatives (product bundles available only for subscribers) and the introduction of new distribution partners (Amazon and Dellâ¦), should enable Autodesk to approach 100% recurring revenues pretty soon (vs. 70% guidance).Strong ARPU lift gives confidence in margin outlookManagement's comment that the annual value of AutoCAD LT subscriptions (i.e. ARPU) was currently 30% higher than perpetual licenses was probably the most encouraging data point of the Investor Day as it hints at a strong revenue growth and margin leverage over the years. While the +30% ARPU rise can appear surprisingly high, it can be explained by customers' willingness not to pay large upfront costs and to have a permanently updated version of the software.This ARPU strength, combined with likely lower sales & marketing costs (renewal rates will probably stand above 90% vs. ~80% currently) and the traditional revenue leverage in the industry, suggests that Autodesk is on track to reach or even exceed its long-term margin target and potentially to reach it sooner than expected.ConclusionThe January 2015 P/E is expensive at first sight (48x) but this is due to Autodesk's financials being distorted by the current model transition. Assuming a normative operating margin of 30%, the stock's P/E would stand slightly above 20x, which is not overly demanding for a software company with a leading position and the opportunity to play a key role in the 3-D printing revolution.

2226893,25120,2014-05-20T00:30:00-04:00,"Autodesk reported solid billing growth while the company is transitioning its business model.Investors should focus on billings growth over revenue growth as it provides a better clue about the real performance.I believe shares are expensive, even when factoring in the Â¨artificialÂ¨ headwinds of the change to a SaaS model.","Investors in Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) were pleased with the company's first quarter results and upbeat outlook for the remainder of the year.As the company is still in transition mode to a SaaS based model, investors are still wondering how the financials will look like on a post-transition basis. I believe shares are still quite expensive even when factoring in the impact of the transition, and therefore remain on the sidelines.First Quarter HeadlinesAutodesk reported first quarter revenues which came in at $592.5 million which is 3.9% higher compared to the year before. In constant currencies growth would have come in a percent higher.Reported GAAP earnings fell by half to $28.3 million with GAAP earnings coming in at $0.12 per share.Non-GAAP earnings came in at $0.32 per share, down from the reported $0.42 per share last year.Looking At The OperationsAutodesk is in the middle of essentially changing its business model, a reason why GAAP financial metrics are not the most useful at the moment. Like many of its competitors, Autodesk is in transition to a Software-as-a-Service model. The company aims to generate 70% of its revenues as a recurring mode in a transition which takes years.Eventually the company will receive monthly payments for its services instead of long term multi-year contracts. The transition is similar to what competing firms like Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) are making as well.Billings rose by 10% compared to the year before as total subscriptions rose by 89,000 on a sequential basis, far above consensus estimates. The company has well-diversified operations in terms of geography, while it shown growth in all three major geographic segments.US sales rose by 2%, EMEA sales were up by 4% while APAC growth came in at 6%. Important to notice, in constant currencies, APAC growth was reported at 15%.Looking Into The Fiscal YearFor the current second quarter, Autodesk sees revenues coming in between $595 and $610 million. This represents 1.7% growth on the midpoint of the guidance at a sequential basis, and 7.3% growth on an annual basis.GAAP earnings are seen between $0.05 and $0.10 per share, while non-GAAP earnings are see twenty cents higher.Full year billings growth is seen at 7-9% which should translate into 4-6% revenue growth. GAAP margins are seen at 3-5% while net subscriber additions are foreseen at 150,000-200,000.ValuationAutodesk ended the quarter with $2.12 billion in cash, equivalents and marketable securities. The company has nearly $747 million in outstanding debt, for a comfortable net cash position of nearly $1.4 billion.At $52 per share, equity in the business is valued at around $11.8 billion which values operating assets at $10.4 billion. This values the company at 4.3 times anticipated revenues of $2.4 billion and a non-meaningful GAAP earnings metric.Autodesk does not pay a dividend at the moment.Takeaway For InvestorsInvestors have troubles figuring out the real performance of Autodesk throughout the transition. Yet investors are comforted after the company behind the famous AutoCAD design software hiked its outlook for billing as well as revenue growth for the year.In the end, the new business model results in more predictable revenue streams and it makes it easier for consumers to sign up as they don't face large upfront costs.During the transition phase, billings are a better indicator of the performance versus revenue growth which is trailing during this transition phase. As a result, deferred revenues rose by 13% to $964 million, approaching the billion mark.To get a clue about the potential profits of the firm, during the latter part of the 2000-2010 decade, Autodesk reported net earnings around 10-15% of revenues. Based on today's reported revenues earnings of $250-$375 million should be attainable given that the transition has been completed.Even then, a roughly $10 billion price tag is a bit on the expensive side. This implies paying a 30-40 times earnings multiple for a company with solid growth and a strong product offering, which is too expensive according to my standards.I remain on the sidelines with a slightly bearish stance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

And indeed, Autodesk delivered once again strong quarterly figures, with both revenues ($593m vs. consensus of $569m) and EPS ($0.32 vs. consensus of $0.21) coming in ahead of expectations.Strength in the quarter was relatively broad-based, with both Construction (32% of revenues) and Manufacturing (25% of revenues) performing well and with most geographies contributing to the beat. This was perfectly in line with our scenario of a strong commercial construction market (which typically lags residential construction recoveries by 6-12 months) and of an improving environment for Autodesk's Manufacturing customers, as macro and PMI have been improving in recent months notably in the important Japan and Europe geographies. We believe that these drivers remain intact and that the earnings revision cycle (FY15 revenue growth guidance slightly raised to 4%-6% from 3%-5%) will remain positive in coming quarters.Importantly, the business model transition from licenses to Cloud & subscriptions is off to a strong start. It looks like customers are responding well to the shift to Cloud as Autodesk reported 89K net sub adds in the quarter, tracking well ahead of the FY15 target of 150-200K net adds. And billings growth, now widely viewed as a key metric as it takes into account the business model transition, was up +10% in Q1.We explained in our previous articles that this new model was a clear positive as revenue streams would become more recurring and predictable (based on subscriptions), as new paying users would join as upfront costs were more attractive (vs. licenses) and as piracy would be reduced through the use of cloud-based authentication. In all, we expect this model to deliver higher revenues, margins and cash flows in the long run.The 3-D printing opportunity is just around the cornerWe have long been highlighting 3-D printing as a major growth opportunity for Autodesk whose core business is 3-D design. Autodesk's announced launch of an open-source 3-D printing software platform called Spark was thus a pleasant surprise. We believe that the group's open-source strategy makes sense. While Autodesk's long track record in the design software business is likely to make Spark more reliable and more user-friendly than proprietary solutions, the open-source nature of Spark (i.e. free) will probably attract a large number of printer makers that do not have sufficient in-house software development skills.If Spark enjoys wide adoption and becomes the 3-D printing software standard, it could give a significant boost to Autodesk's sales of its core 3-D design and PLM (Product LifeCycle Management) solutions.ConclusionWe reiterate our view that Autodesk is a different and safer way to play the 3-D printing revolution, with valuation levels and earnings expectations much more decent than 3-D printing stocks such as 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD). Note that the 2015 P/E is expensive at first sight (42x) but that this is due to Autodesk's financials being distorted by the current model transition. Assuming a normative operating margin of 30%, the stock's P/E would stand around 20x, which is not expensive for a software company with a leading position.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company is shifting from licenses and upfront software packages and solutions to the Â¨cloudÂ¨ and subscription-based business models.While I understand that current earnings and revenues are depressed by this change, I fail to see the upside even after accounting for the Â¨understatementÂ¨ of the current performance.Barclays Turns BullishAnalysts at Barclays raised their rating on Autodesk from equal-weight to overweight, attaching a $65 price target for the end of 2015.The focus on the subscription model is limiting the company's GAAP growth numbers during this transition phase. Like many other companies including Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) for instance, Autodesk is shifting to subscriptions over upfront software packages.During the transition phase, and in the years following, Autodesk should be able to contribute to cash flows and be able to boost margins. The price target is based on a 12% compounded annual growth rate, operating margins of 30% and nearly $1 billion in free cash flows.Autodesk's Overview And PlansBack in March, Autodesk gave an investor webcast stressing the Building Information Modeling (BIM) solutions which focus on planning, designing, building and management of assets.A continued increase in adoption of the BIM principle is expected to be the driver behind future anticipated revenue growth. Usage of these principles and software reduces risks for the wider construction sector, allowing for the optimization of design, among others. Opportunities are large with the construction sector in general still lagging in the adoption of IT spending.While the BIM solutions are very attractive in the long run, Autodesk already has great diversification in its businesses. The company is operating in platform solutions, architecture, engineering & construction, manufacturing and media & entertainment. In terms of actual products, the company still derives 50% of sales from its flagship product.Important to consider as I discussed the shift to the cloud, Autodesk's subscription revenues are close to making up 50% of total sales at the moment.Valuing AutodeskBack in May, Autodesk released its first quarter results. The company ended the quarter with nearly $2.4 billion in cash, equivalents and marketable securities. The company has nearly $750 million in debt outstanding, resulting in a solid net cash position of around $1.65 billion.Trading around $55 per share, Autodesk is valued at about $12.65 billion which values operating assets around $11 billion. On a trailing basis, Autodesk has posted sales of $2.30 billion on which it net earned $202 million.This values operating assets at 4.8 times trailing sales and roughly 55 times earnings.Despite the solid earnings and strong financial position, Autodesk does not pay a dividend at the moment.Looking At The PastAutodesk is of course switching to subscription based models to appeal to customers, but also generate recurring revenues and highly predictable cash flows. Yet the shift from recognizing all upfront revenues compared to a monthly recognition, has slowed down reported revenue growth recently. This is a result of the GAAP accounting system, and to get a better clue about revenue growth one should consider watching the billings being reported.As such sales have been flat between 2012 and 2014 around the $2.2 billion mark. At the same time deferred revenues have increased and are approaching a billion, as a result of the shift in the business model as discussed above. As such growth is still likely, with even understated and reported revenues having nearly doubled over the past decade.Earnings have been stagnant at best, coming in at $202 million on a trailing basis, still far below reported earnings of around $350 million in 2008. Just like revenues, earnings are understated as well due the transition and reported numbers should be adjusted to account for this.With exception of lows around $10-$15 during the financial crisis, shares have traded in a $25-$50 trading range over the past decade. Following returns of 60% over the past year, shares have advanced to current levels at $55 per share.Final TakeawayThe operating margin target of 30% as issued by Barclays seems rather ambitious in my eyes, resulting in net earnings margins of 20% per annum assuming statutory tax rates. This would translate into revenues of about $500 million per annum based on anticipated growth in sales. Even then shares trade at 22 times operating assets based on these highly optimistic assumptions.Back in May of this year I last had a look at Autodesk's prospects following the release of the first quarter results. I concluded that to get a true clue about the valuation of the business, one should look at the estimated performance of the business after the transition into the cloud has been completed. This is of course as the transition phase depresses current revenues.While the transition to the cloud could result in higher operating margins as argued by many, I believe competition is heating up as well. Therefore I apply historical net profit margins of 10-15%. The cloud business model reduces distribution costs, but I anticipate that most of these gains will be made undone by competition. Even when applying net margins of 15% on a revenue base of $2.5 billion, earnings are seen around $375 million, or close to 30 times earnings.The lack of dividends and lack of share repurchases in recent times is disappointing as well given the solid financial position. It is noteworthy that between 1989 and 2005, the company paid a quarterly dividend of $0.015 per quarter, yet it has halted those dividends. For this reason, the already high valuation and optimistic analysts, I remain cautious and stay on the sidelines.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2491235,71765,2014-09-12T13:02:51-04:00,"The company has expectations of revenues of $590 million-$605 million in FQ3, though analysts expect that revenues could go up to $588.2 million.Autodesk's billings and revenues for FY 2015 are expected to go up to 10%-12% and 7%-9%, up from 7%-9% and 4%-6%, respectively.According to Autodesk CEO Carl Bass, strong global demand and adoption needs of suite solutions resulted in billings and record revenue results.Revenues for Autodesk in America alone grew by 11% to $223 million compared to revenues in the second quarter last year.","Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) has gone up sharply, and its volumes are already over 5x the daily average. The company has expectations of revenues of $590 million-$605 million in FQ3, though analysts think that revenues could go up to $588.2 million. At the same time, EPS for Autodesk is expected to range between $0.17 and $0.23, vs. a consensus of $0.28 EPS. Other companies, like Nuance (NASDAQ:NUAN) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), might have their near-term EPS pressured by a shift from licenses to subscriptions. We believe that the strong earnings revision cycle for Autodesk is likely to last, due to its positive performance in FQ2 and FY15 guidance.Autodesk's billings and revenues for the FY15 are expected to go up to 10%-12% and 7%-9% from 7%-9% and 4%-6%, respectively. The expected number of future subscribers has increased by 50,000 and now ranges between 200,000 and 250,000.The announcement of its FQ2 results were above expectations and the company showed a 27% year-on-year increase in its billings. As compared to FQ1's 10% increase, the results of FQ2 are much more promising for the company. In absolute terms, revenues amounted to $637 million, which is a 13% increase compared to the second quarter of FY14 that exceeded the consensus of $604 million. Subscriptions grew by 74,000 to reach a high 2.01 million.Deferred revenue balances, which were $981 million, grew quarter on quarter by 2%, while the year-on-year growth was 22%. This is basically an indication that Autodesk is reeling in customers through its cloud offerings. At the same time, due to the new customer contracts, the total contract value of the company is expected to go up by 20% -- especially when existing customers migrate to the cloud.Based on these facts and figures, it seems as if this positive earnings cycle for Autodesk is bound to last, and the software corporation is the right direction to go in to live through the 3-D printing revolution.Citi and RBC: Their Take on Autodesk's PerformanceOn the other hand, ADSK achieved a record revenue growth solely due to the upgrading of current licenses' rather than the issuance of new ones. The license upgrades have picked up the pace mainly because of a promotion scheme that is led by ADSK, which is likely to end in FY15. Citi does not look impressed with Autodesk's addition of about 200,000-250,000 subscribers for FY15, and this is mainly due to the fact that Citi managed to add about 250,000 subscribers to its own list in FY13. That, too, is with the help of fewer promotions.RBC, as opposed to Citi, thinks that Autodesk's numbers are pretty impressive and is of the view that the improvement in macroeconomic conditions has led to this impressive growth. RBC, however, is uncertain about the growth that is to be expected in FY16, though it does think that the cloud growth, license sales, and maintenance could help the company to grow its sales.According to Autodesk CEO Carl Bass, strong global demand and adoption needs of suite solutions resulted in billings and record revenue results. He added that the company has also progressed in the transition to a more recurring and subscription-based business, which added approximately 74,000 maintenance, desktop (rental), and cloud subscriptions.Revenues for Autodesk in America alone grew by 11% to $223 million compared to the revenues of the second quarter last year. EMEA revenue registered a growth of 21% to settle at $244 million. The revenue in APAC was approximately $170 million, which was an 8% increase compared to the second quarter of the last year.ConclusionBased on the turnaround that Autodesk has made from its licensing system to a subscription-based one, and outperforming the consensus of analysts, it is expected that the company's stock will be more bullish. This is mostly because of the diversity of the products that Autodesk provides. Autodesk has some of the most common software used in different processes -- including construction, where its AEC business segment seems to be doing immensely well compared to the company's other segments.Looking at the subscription approach from a small business viewpoint, the less cash-rich businesses can benefit from this as they will be able to use the software without incurring higher purchase costs. In other words, now that the company has shifted from licensing to subscriptions, it could increase revenues by registering an increase in demand for its products based on the fact that they may be more affordable vs. earlier ones.Keeping in view how the company has changed its approach to retain and attract more customers and has improved revenue growth every fiscal year, shares of Autodesk are a likely buy-and-hold investment due to the strong potential growth."
2068303,22775,2014-03-05T07:34:55-05:00,,"We said in our January article that Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) was likely to keep surprising on the upside, as the company's two main verticals benefited from an increasingly supportive environment. Indeed, Autodesk delivered strong Q4 figures, with both revenues ($587m vs. consensus of $573m) and EPS ($0.40 vs. consensus of $0.34) coming in ahead of expectations, despite the continued transition to a rental model (~$30m impact on revenues). Importantly, the group also provided a sound FY15 3%-5% revenue growth guidance (vs. flat growth expected by consensus) that, in our view, is likely to remove investor concerns about the model shift, as the negative impact appears well under control at the top-line level.Unsurprisingly, Autodesk was constructive on its two main verticals. Construction (32% of revenues) grew 8% in the quarter, confirming our positive stance. Leading indicators such as the Architecture Billings Index continue to point to an improvement, confirming the usual pattern (commercial/industrial construction typically lags residential construction recoveries by 6-12 months).Manufacturing (25% of revenues) is also likely to remain supportive, as macro and PMI across the world have been improving in recent months, notably in two key geographies (Japan and Europe).If short-term revenue growth is expected to pick up, the mid-term outlook is also attractive, as Autodesk is expected to be a key beneficiary in the advent of 3D printing. 3D printing will sharply increase the number of design software users globally and spark rising interest for PLM solutions. 3D printing is also expected to open a huge market for Autodesk, the consumer market, that could be worth several billions in a few years (see our assumptions in our previous article).New model perfectly suited to the consumer marketWhile still early in its business model transition, Autodesk now has roughly 45% of recurring revenues and 1.9m subscribers. The group is thus well on track to reach its mid-term 70% recurring revenues target.Despite the slight short-term pressure on revenues and margins (FY15 non-GAAP operating margin guided to 14%-16% vs. consensus at 20%), the transition from a traditional license model to a rental and usage-based model remains a clear positive, in our view. Revenue streams become more predictable as they are based on subscriptions, new paying users are likely to join as upfront costs are attractive (vs. licenses) and piracy is likely to be reduced through the use of cloud-based authentication.In all, this model is perfectly suited to the consumer market and could enable Autodesk to fully benefit from the expected take-off of 3D printing for the mass market, for which the product pricing is key.ConclusionHigher revenues will come with lower commercial costs in the mid and long-term, suggesting that the new model is likely to deliver higher margins and cash flows in the long run.We reiterate our view that Autodesk is a different and safer way to play the 3D printing revolution, with valuation levels and earnings expectations much more decent than 3D printing stocks such as 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), leaving room for upside.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1939931,25289,2014-01-11T09:19:00-05:00,,"In this article, I will feature one tech stock that has seen intensive insider selling during the last 30 days. Intensive insider selling can be defined by the following three criteria:Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) operates as a design software and services company worldwide. Its Platform Solutions and Emerging Business segment offers AutoCAD software.Insider selling during the last 30 daysHere is a table of Autodesk's insider-trading activity during the last 30 days by insider.There have been 984,984 shares sold by insiders during the last 30 days. Carl Bass, Steven Blum, Mark Hawkins, and Crawford Beveridge sold shares pursuant to the Rule 10b5-1 plan.SEC Rule 10b5-1 is a regulation enacted by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2000. The SEC states that Rule 10b5-1 was enacted in order to resolve an unsettled issue over the definition of insider trading, which is prohibited by SEC Rule 10b-5. After Rule 10b5-1 was enacted, the SEC staff publicly took the position that canceling a planned trade made under the safe harbor does not constitute insider trading, even if the person was aware of the inside information when canceling the trade. This staff interpretation raises the possibility that executives can exploit this safe harbor by entering into 10b5-1 trading plans before they have inside information while retaining the option to later cancel those plans based on inside information.For example, a CEO of a company could call a broker on January 1 and enter into a plan to sell a particular quantity of shares of his company's stock on March 1, find out terrible news about his company on February 1 that will not become public until April 1, and then go forward with the March 1 sale anyway, saving himself from losing money when the bad news becomes public. Under the terms of Rule 10b5-1(b) this is insider trading because the CEO ""was aware"" of the inside information when he made the trade. But he can assert an affirmative defense under Rule 10b5-1(c), because he planned the trade before he learned the inside information.In general, it is a safer way for an insider to sell shares pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan than without it.Insider selling by calendar monthHere is a table of Autodesk's insider-trading activity by calendar month.There have been 2,259,107 shares sold, and there have been zero shares purchased by insiders since January 2013.

1757242,54532,2013-10-21T10:36:31-04:00,,"One of the leading providers of computer-aided design software, Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) announced October 8, 2013, that it would acquire some of the technology assets of Graitec including its Advance Steel and Advance Concrete product lines. The acquisition, when completed in 2014, would help Autodesk to develop model-based workflow for structural engineers, detailers, fabricators and contractors. It is expected that with the help of this acquisition, Autodesk will be a frontrunner in the industry and will migrate toward high-tech building information modeling (BIM). It is not only the acquisition that has made a strong case for Autodesk since the company has already put into motion efforts to improve its overall efficiency. Let us perform an in-depth analysis of the company's financial strategies.Improved Business ModelAutodesk has grown its revenues since the recession by convincing customers to switch to a subscription-based model of its Auto Cad software. Through this software, customers can have access to automatic updates and the installation of new features in exchange for a recurring fee, which takes effect after one month of usage. If customers stop paying the monthly subscription they lose access to the program.The monthly subscriptions represent 22% of Autodesk's customers and they also account for almost 50 percent of its revenues. Recently, certain steps have been taken to attract more customers to the subscription-based model. For example, Autodesk has included rental and usage based pricing options. The company is altering its business strategy to address customer needs and to compete with other software providers. The importance of the rental-based customers for Autodesk has been noted by its C.E.O who said ""A customer that comes and joins as a renter is much more valuable over a number of years.""The move will also allow Autodesk to attract customers who are less willing to pay a lump sum amount for access to the software. It will also be a cost-effective solution for architects, designers and engineers to use Autodesk software with no up-front costs.ExpectationsAutodesk is determined to increase billings by 12 percent per annum up to 2018, as the company expects to sell more software subscriptions. In addition to the increase in billings, Autodesk also expects that the number of subscribers will grow. The company currently has 1.9 million subscribers, and that number is expected to increase by 50 percent by 2018. Autodesk will increase service charges while also anticipating an increase in the number of subscribers.Historical Pricing and Recent ResultsThe company has treated long-term investors to profitable returns but the most recent returns have not been very impressive. The share prices have rallied from $10 in 2003, to as high as $50 in 2007. However, in 2009 the price dropped down to $12 mainly due to financial crises. In the post-financial crises period prices have recovered and the current price is $40 per share.Autodesk released the recent quarter results on August 22, 2013. It reported an E.P.S of $0.45 for the quarter, which exceeded the analyst estimate of $0.42 by $0.03. The company declared revenues to be $562 million whereas the consensus estimate of analysts was $560.07 million. The difference of $2 million was mainly due to an improvised business model through which Autodesk managed to bring in new customers.Despite the company besting analyst estimates Autodesk witnessed weakened sales in European, Middle East and African countries. In 2012 the company's international revenues accounted for 72% of its revenues but in 2013 international revenues represented almost 71% of total revenues. The decline was primarily offset by the growth in the revenues of company from the American region as that increased by 2 percent. As the company's business has expanded globally, it has increasingly become subject to risk arising from fluctuations in currency and also to the adverse changes in political and economic conditions.The company operates in four primary segments: platform solutions, architecture, engineering and construction, manufacturing, and media and entertainment. The operating segments for architecture accounted for 37% of the share in net revenues, engineering and construction accounted for 30%, manufacturing accounted for 25% and media and entertainment accounted for 8%. Out of the four segments, architecture has been the most successful. The segment contributes 37% in the net revenues and has grown by 9% from last year.Dividend Based ValuationIn the free cash flow model presented above, I have assumed that the company will grow its operating cash flow at an average growth rate of 21.18 percent per annum. The growth rate assumption is primarily due to an additional increase in revenues backed by the positive impact of the improvised business model. Another factor I considered while estimating the growth is the expected increase in the number of new subscribers.For the Capex growth rate, I used the company's historical average growth rate of 21.30 percent. I believe that in the long run the Capex will not likely resume the current growth rate as there is no mention of such by the company. However, the historical averages have been used to maintain accuracy.As can be seen in the above table, the price of $45.15 per share seems to be an appropriate intrinsic value of Autodesk stock. The upside potential of more than 11 percent signifies that the company is a potential investment.The table above shows the core assumptions and important inputs used to calculate the weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC) of 17.45%. I have assigned 88 percent weight to equity primarily because the company is operating with minimal debt. Moreover, out of the total debt of $1216 million; $746million was taken by the company during fiscal year 2013.The average return of S&P for five years is taken as Rm. While the risk free rate of 2.63% is the 10-year Treasury note's rate. An adjusted beta of 1.73 is calculated with the belief that in the long run the company's beta of 2.09 will revert back to the market beta.The sensitivity analysis expresses the price in relation to the long-term growth rate and WACC. In the best-case scenario, assuming a growth rate of 3.5% and cost of capital of 15.45%, the stock price would be trading near $54.29. In the worst-case scenario the share price would be around $35.01. The scenarios give us a price range of $35-$54 with a downward potential of -13.28% and an upward potential of 34.47%.Multiple based ValuationIn order to compute the fair value I have chosen multiple based valuation. It can be seen in the figure above that I have given 35 percent weight to both P/E and P/Cash Flow. The weights can be amended according to their relevance but this is a matter of one's discretion and judgment.The multiple based approach calculates the fair price with an upside potential of 10.44 percent from the current market price and makes the target around $47. Comparable valuation also gives us a fair value, which is in line with the fair value estimates given by the dividend discount model.ConclusionAutodesk transformed its business model into selling monthly licenses instead of only offering contracts with upfront payments. This strategy will allow Autodesk to report higher revenue in the quarters to come.Although the acquisition of Graitic was good for company it will take considerable time for the company to start seeing financial gain from these expectations. I believe that Autodesk will be able to perform well in the near future.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2224563,57182,2014-05-19T04:10:32-04:00,CEO sells massive amounts of stock.Insider selling at market highs. Earnings growth is negative.Net income falls 50%.,"With the market at all -time highs, it becomes increasingly dangerous to own certain high priced stocks.In my opinion Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) is one of those companies. Autodesk, Inc. operates as a design software and services company worldwide. Its Platform Solutions and Emerging Business segment offers AutoCAD software, a computer-aided design application for professional design, drafting, detailing, and visualization; and AutoCAD LT, a professional drafting and detailing software. The company's Architecture, Engineering and Construction segment offers Autodesk Building Design Suites that give customers the ability to manage various phases of design and construction.With a P/E ratio of 51, you would think that the company has 50% revenue growth and exploding profits. Not the case here. The buzz on the Conference call was 89,000 new subscriptions but where is the profits? Net profit dropped almost 50% from the year ago period and no one bothered to mention it. Not one analyst asked about insider selling.Look at this clip from Yahoo Finance.Here is what I find interesting: you have no purchases and 11 sale transactions for 533,409 shares, representing 50.2% of the total shares held by insiders. Institutions are dumping this stock with 23,367,300 shares being sold prior to latest quarter a 12.88% reduction. The question is this: who is going to be left holding the bag?Here is a list of sales which add up to much more than 11, I find it all a little confusing. I will try to clear it up. As an investor it is of paramount importance to have your eyes open, trust yourself and your intuition first. In my humble opinion, something doesn't seem right. Things are not always as they appear. After reading the quarterly report I understand why insiders and institutions are selling.That looks like a lot more than 11 transactions to me. I for one have some questions; why is Carl Bass unloading such a large sum of shares in the quarter. It appears he is cashing out. Does he know something we don't know?Another question: Why did the company buy back 2 million shares at an average price over $51 a share? It seems to me they are buying their stock back at multi- year highs, all the while selling their own personal stock and lavish stock options. Even with the buyback the company was unable to generate any significant revenue growth; the company was down on most metrics that count to me, like earnings and revenue growth.Autodesk Inc. reported tepid earnings last week. The company reported net income of $.12 cents a share, down from $.24 a year ago. The stock gapped up and rallied 8% or $3.90 to $51.67 a share.I listened to the conference call and heard a whole lot of smoke and mirrors. The CEO did quite a job of spinning the earnings call, totally avoiding the dismal comparisons and making projections out to 2016 and 2017. I for one am not buying it, I saw very little to be excited about. Bottom line, net earnings were dismal.Although I imagine for him it was wonderful, selling around $60,000,000 in stock. Yes, $60 million in the quarter. Over half of the stock buyback went right into his pocket, what a deal.I am slightly perplexed at the analysts from all of the big named banks. For the most part, they sound like young college graduates afraid to ask any tough questions. Not one analyst asked why the company's net profit declined nearly 50%. No mention of all the institutional selling or massive insider trades.This is not a fast growth company. I don't see the growth to justify a multiple 51 times earnings. I am downgrading this stock to a sell with a $28 price target. In my opinion the stock is in bubble territory, with insiders selling so many shares in the last 4 months I see trouble on the horizon. The company would have to execute flawlessly for the next 3 years to trade at the price where they trade today.Let's look at some valuation metrics compared to its peers.As you can see Autodesk is expensive by any measurement, at 32x cash flow, and 43.8 x FYF, the company's stock price is in the stratosphere. With -29.92% forecasted negative EPS growth it could be a very dangerous stock to hold.Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA) may be turning their business around, and then again, maybe not. Checkpoint software technology Ltd (NYSE:CKP) a high flyer with continuing growth prospects is trading at a 17.5 FYF multiple. The market is full of uncertainty, and anomalies, my job is to find companies that are mispriced with insider activity. In my opinion, investors would be wise to sell or avoid this company.Here is a 5 year chart comparing with the NASDAQ and Checkpoint Software Ltd.As you can see above, the last 5 years have been epic. Currently Autodesk is about 24% above the NASDAQ, in part due to the gap up last Friday. Autodesk has outperformed Checkpoint Software Ltd by over 124% in the last 5 years. It looks like Autodesk and NASDAQ like to trade in close proximity to each other, crossing back in forth over the years. I'm calling a long term double top in this range.Short squeezeAccording to shortsqueeze.com there are 3.39 million shares short, or 1.6% of the float. At normal volume it would take 1.5 days to cover. In my opinion, that makes the stock more vulnerable to profit taking.ConclusionThe market is near all-time highs; I believe many tech stocks are in bubble territory. Institutional and Insider selling along with a decline in net profit lead me to believe that Autodesk is a sell. Last Friday's 8% pop was an anomaly that had to do more about option expiration than anything else. I expect profit taking and believe we will see violent moves up and down in the market over the summer. I see a $28 handle on this stock in the next correction. Be wary of upgrades on high multiple stocks at market peaks. As always, do your own research, follow your own advice and always have an exit strategy in place before making any investment decisions.Disclosure: I am short ADSK.

1971631,22775,2014-01-28T03:59:12-05:00,,"In the 80s and 90s, software makers were the real winners of the computer revolution, with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) grabbing most of the dollars generated by the PC industry at the expense of hardware makers. We believe that History could repeat itself in the current 3D printing revolution.Design software is likely to drive 3D printing adoption thanks to easy-to-use functionalities, notably in the consumer segment, and to become key in printer makers' offerings. CAD (computer-aided design) software vendors Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) and Dassault Systems (OTCPK:DASTY) are thus set to become major beneficiaries of the 3D printing take-off. As the installed base of 3D printers grows significantly over the years, the scalability of the software model will offer huge EPS growth going forward.While 3D printing stocks such as 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) are priced for perfection and have to manage extremely high consensus earnings expectations (see our recent SA article here), we believe that Autodesk offers more decent valuation levels (31x 2014 earnings) and earnings growth expectations, leaving room for upside. We are buyers of Autodesk, and sellers of 3D Systems.Collaborative creation: when (almost) everybody takes part in the creation processAutodesk's software products enable customers to design and visualize their concepts and to simulate and analyze real-world performance by creating digital prototypes.Source: AutodeskSource: AutodeskThis means that 3D printers and design software are part of the same creation process, and that design software vendors will obviously benefit from a rising 3D printers installed base (+21% CAGR in $ terms over 2012-17, probably +30-40% in unit shipments assuming declining ASPs).Historically, Autodesk has been mainly active in large manufacturing verticals, such as auto and aerospace (25% of revenues), and in the commercial construction segment (32%). These customers are expected to make extensive use of 3D printers in coming years and to involve an increasing number of people in the creation of a new product as 3D printers become less and less expensive. R&D engineers, but also marketing and manufacturing staff, suppliers andâ¦ end consumers will have the opportunity to see and touch a concept thanks to 3D printing and to propose changes. This growing product creation ecosystem is an obvious positive for Autodesk, as the number of design software users (initially limited to R&D engineers) will grow significantly. The pricing is likely to be lower for these new ecosystem members as they do not necessarily need the full 3D software features; anyway, the number of design seats (Autodesk's key metric) is likely to go up by x2 or x3!The increasing complexity of the creation process (design, sourcing and manufacturing on multiple sites across the world, involving several partners and suppliers) is another positive for Autodesk as this will drive increased adoption of its Product Lifecycle Management solutions (part of the group's Platform solutions which account for roughly 35% of revenues).The consumer segment is a huge market opportunityThe advent of 3D printing at home is expected to open a new market for Autodesk: the consumer market. Even if profitability levels in the consumer segment are likely to be lower than in the corporate segment, the market opportunity is impressive: assuming the 3D printers installed base reaches tens of millions units in the mid-term and software ASP (average selling price) around $50, this market could be worth close to $5bn. This would represent the combined revenues of Autodesk and Dassault in 2013!New business model perfectly suited to the consumer marketWe believe that Autodesk's low price-high volume strategy (compared to Dassault) and new business model (rental vs. licenses) are perfectly suited to the consumer segment. Even if the transition from a traditional license model to a rental and usage-based model could lead to earnings hiccups in next quarters, this is a smart move in our view:- new paying users are likely to join Autodesk' user base as upfront costs are attractive (vs. licenses)- piracy is likely to be reduced thanks to cloud-based authentication- revenue streams become more predictable as they are based on subscriptionsNear-term trading: upside to come from US non-residential construction and EuropeDespite the accelerated transition to the rental model in Q3 (short-term negative impact on revenue growth), Autodesk delivered strong figures with both revenues and EPS ahead of expectations. We are confident that the group will continue to surprise on the upside as Autodesk's two main verticals benefit from an increasingly supportive environment.Construction grew 13% Q3, and leading indicators such as the Architecture Billings Index continue to point to an improvement, confirming the usual pattern (commercial/industrial construction typically lags residential construction recoveries by 6-12 months) and suggesting that a non-residential real estate cycle is potentially looming.Manufacturing delivered a sound 8% growth in the quarter, a clear acceleration vs. the +2% reported in Q2. We believe the momentum is likely to remain supportive as PMI across the world have been improving in recent months, giving confidence in end-demand from industrial customers. The Euro Zone PMI notably reached a 31-month high in December, and could give a boost to Autodesk's revenues in the region which accounts for 37% of total group revenues.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in ADSK, over the next 72 hours.

1501612,42111,2013-06-14T02:31:05-04:00,,"Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), the multinational software company that makes drafting, manufacturing, civil engineering, 3D, and animation design software, has experienced a recent pullback. Part of that is due to the general market correction, but the other part is due to its recent quarterly results. It has pulled back roughly 13% from its high of $41.42 in May. Can it be bought now? Or is there more downside in the stock?The stock decline began after Q1 earnings fell 30%. Autodesk reported a profit of 24 cents per share, down from 34 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue decreased 3.1% to $570.4 million. Operating margins also fell to 14.3% from 16% YoY. The company cited currency fluctuations as one reason for the disappointment. Over the course of their conference call, management mentioned several factors but I don't know if anyone has pinpointed a clear factor.Chief Executive Carl Bass said the following:The company is facing headwinds in the broader economy. This can be seen in declining sales in many areas of their business. Regionally, the U.S was flat; Northern Europe was up; Southern Europe was down; and emerging markets were down. Autodesk also lowered quarterly and yearly revenue expectations. This lowering of guidance by Autodesk also matches the same guidance changes made by competitors Parametric Technology (PMTC) and ANSYS (NASDAQ:ANSS), so it is not necessarily losing out to its rivals in this case.The CFO noted two important things in their conference call. First, he noted that a portion of earnings ($24M) were reported in Q4 last year, which subtracted that amount from this Q1. That accentuated the miss. Second, he noted that last year's Q1 was great, making the comparison very hard. Taken together, this quarter may not have been as bad as it seemed.So there could be a variety of reasons for the quarterly miss, but I believe that it was mainly due to: 1) a global economic slowdown taking place, 2) Autodesk customers spending less on IT, and 3) Year-over-Year comps, and 4) the financial engineering that took some income into Q4.MetricsThe company has really solid free cash flows, evidenced by its price to free cash flow ratio of 13.70. It also has a low debt-to-equity ratio of .36. The company has a forward P/E ratio of 15.3, which seems reasonable given the uncertainty in much of the world economy.And despite its trouble this past quarter, Autodesk has gross margins of 89% and operating margins of 13%. The operating margins are what they will continue to focus on improving. The CEO stated that they continue to reach for 30% operating margins. This will be the real test for management in my opinion. Revenue growth is more related to the economy at this point, but the margins are more in management's control.Future RevenueIf the decline in sales is due to a larger economic slowdown, especially abroad, then that isn't necessarily a fundamental flaw with the company. An economic slowdown is something that has to be fought through, cutting costs where available, and squeezing out profits via efficiency.Global recessions aside, Autodesk has made acquisitions over the past few years to beef up its product line. That should help with providing additional revenue streams. Autodesk bought Vela Systems last year for $76 million in an effort to add to its mobile device applications business. The purchase was a wise move because, as is noted in this article, a portion of design and drafting software is now being used on mobile devices. In addition to the Vela purchase, Autodesk made 16 other acquisitions over the past two years. This is a potential reason for the margins trouble, after all it can prove challenging to integrate that many companies together.The company is also positioned well in the Cloud applications segment with its Autodesk 360. Additionally, the company seems to be effectively growing its subscription business (which is already very large). Both of those factors will play critical roles in the company's future revenue and earnings.ChartThe chart for Autodesk is basically a classic Head and Shoulders pattern. A Head and Shoulders pattern is a bearish reversal chart pattern. In the chart below, I noted the head and each shoulder, and then the broken neckline. I also added Quadrant Lines. Quadrant lines basically divide the price from high to low, into four sections, and add lines denoting the Low/25%/50%/75%/High prices. [I don't usually use Quadrant Lines, but it seems to work well showing that the distance from neck to top of the head is also the same as from the neck to the previous lows.]Price Target & StrategyStrategically speaking, the paragraphs above may provide a mixed message. Earnings going down and margins down; solid free cash flow and low debt; a macroeconomic slowdown; and strong sales to automotive makers.I believe that in the long run, the stock is a solid winner and will continue to grow earnings. In the short and mid term, I am not as certain. I believe that it is worth waiting to see if the global economy gets worse, before jumping into Autodesk at these levels. Additionally, I would prefer to see margins heading back up, indicating that the acquisitions from the past two years are being integrated well.I like to use technical analysis to help choose entry and exit positions. To obtain the downside target on the break of a Head and Shoulders ""neckline,"" you measure from the neckline to the top of the head. That is the amount of decline you can reasonably project the price to fall to below the neckline. Again, this just happens to match up with previous lows -- which would act as a level of support on its own. You can expect that a number of technicians will buy that level, which is why that's my target for this slide. And that is how I come up with the target and projection of 14% further downside.Therefore, I would not look to buy this until the stock shows strength, presumably near the $31-30 level.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1712352,20411,2013-09-25T08:59:01-04:00,,"By Neal RauAutodesk, Inc. (ADSK) last released earnings data on August 22 when it reported $0.45 EPS for the quarter, beating estimates of $0.42 by $0.03. The company had revenue of $562.00 million for the quarter, compared to the consensus estimate of $560.73 million. The stock is up about 15% YTD, less than of half the return of its competitor Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE), and near a 52-week high. The question is, with the stock trading near the high, does ADSK still have room to run?This summer graphic designers and printers received a shock when Adobe forced all users to move to its cloud system and a monthly subscription charge. No longer will users be able to buy a boxed version and avoid upgrade costs. If customers stop paying the monthly fee, they lose access to the programs. The software industry is moving toward subscription payments for online and desktop software, as consumers and businesses seek access to a steady stream of new features instead of just one version of a software package. Autodesk has already been offering a subscription model for its AutoCAD software, which has been a more profitable model for the company. Only about 22% of AutoCAD customers are using the subscription model, but that group accounts for 50% of the company's revenues. The company's revenue for the quarter, which was reported last on August 22, was down 1.2% on a year-over-year basis. Stock Traders Daily currently has a neutral rating on shares of ADSK, but the stock has just recently broken above long-term resistance so that can change.The move to subscriptions is also a way to keep customers, who are less willing to pay for big up-front licenses with more expensive programs. Customers will now be able to pay as they go for all of the company's latest Design and Creation Suites, Autodesk 3ds Max, Autodesk Maya, and the new Autodesk Maya LT. This will be a more cost effective solution for designers, engineers and visual effects artists to get started with Autodesk software with virtually no up-front capital costs, and give them the ability to quickly ramp up projects using industry-leading Autodesk software. Customers who choose to purchase monthly, quarterly or annual plans will receive similar benefits to Autodesk Subscription customers including staying current with the latest product updates, access to select Autodesk 360 cloud services and basic support. It is the latest in a series of moves by Autodesk to encourage customers to adopt regular maintenance programs, giving them the ability to upgrade to new versions over time, as the shift to 3-D printing looks to be a major growth driver in the future.Companies like 3D Systems Corporation (DDD) and Stratasys, Ltd. (SSYS) are making headlines with innovations in 3-D printing. Autodesk has aggressively expanded into 3D printing software. Earlier this year, Autodesk released a new app for the Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) iPad called 123D Catch, which enables users to capture 3D images of things using their tablet's camera. Users take photos with their iPad and submit them for processing on the Autodesk Cloud, which converts them into a realistic 3D model that you can view, share, and download.As Autodesk continues to develop 3-D software for architecture, engineering, construction and entertainment markets worldwide, there will be big opportunities for growth. Based on the Stock Traders Daily real-time trading report, the stock has broken above long-term resistance, which is now converted support. So far, converted support is holding, and as long as that remains true, the rules that govern our strategies tell us to expect higher levels, but converted support also acts as our risk control. We are buyers at that converted support level, but caution buyers not to chase the stock. Although it seems to be able to push higher if converted support (former resistance) stays in place, that will change if the stock falls back into its longer term channel, so keep this one tight to the vest.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: By Neal Rau for Stock Traders Daily and neither receive compensation from the publicly traded companies listed herein for writing this article."
1674142,20568,2013-09-04T18:29:32-04:00,,"Did you know that designers for the last 17 Academy Award winners for Best Visual Effects used Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) software? Since its introduction of AutoCAD in 1982, Autodesk continues to develop the broadest portfolio of state-of-the-art 3D software for the architecture/engineering/construction (AEC), manufacturing, and media and entertainment markets worldwide. These customers use Autodesk software to design, visualize, and simulate their ideas before they're ever built or created.But the shifting sands of technology -- both the company's and customers' access to it -- have been creating some headwinds for this pioneer. Two weeks ago, Autodesk reported fiscal second-quarter 2014 non-GAAP earnings that beat the consensus. But the reaction among investors and analysts since has been mixed and the stock recently fell to a Zacks No. 5 Rank Strong Sell due to steeply falling EPS estimates, as the following chart displays:A Change to the Business ModelWhile Autodesk's competitors sell advanced software for upward of $10,000, AutoCAD sells for only about $4,000, maintaining its foothold as the de facto standard with 85% market share. The software's price means AutoCAD is the only option for smaller firms -- a market the company's competitors have only recently begun to target, as we will see in a moment.Autodesk has grown revenues since the recession by convincing customers to switch to a subscription model for AutoCAD software. In this model, customers get automatic updates and new features in exchange for a recurring fee. The model is much more profitable for Autodesk -- only 22% of Autodesk's customers buy software in this way, but they account for nearly half of the revenues. However, this transition was recently modified to include a move to offer more rental and usage-based pricing options. And this gave the company a lack of financial visibility, causing them to withdraw revenue and profit guidance for the next several quarters -- which, of course, left analysts no choice but to take their estimates down.The news isn't all bad. It's really about how the company is altering strategy and responding to the shifting sands of technology, customer needs, and the competition. According to WikiInvest, ""Autodesk is trying to increase the adoption of 'next-generation' 3D software products as compared to the 2D market. It recognizes that the 3-D segment would be a key driver for growth for the company in the future. This would definitely provide Autodesk with the opportunity to up-sell its massive 2-D installed base into higher average sales price (ASP) 3-D software and to boost growth.""3-D Competition DriversThe ""3-D printing"" and design industry has become front-page news thanks to innovative companies like 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS). You could say these guys have put the CAM back in CAD/CAM with ""additive manufacturing"" techniques that use constructive polymers to ""assemble"" new products, almost a molecule at a time.And Autodesk not only must answer these innovation calls, they could see challenges to their own turf. 3D Systems recently acquired the cloud-based collaboration software Relevant Products/Services portal, TeamPlatform. This acquisition will help DDD in attracting AEC customers engaged in computer-aided design (CAD) and other 3D projects.ADSK also faces competition in its conventional markets from UGS (Siemens) who is offering its 2-D software very competitively online. Again from WikiInvest: ""UGS has indicated that there have been over 33,000 downloads of the Solid Edge 2-D drafting tool in the four months since its introduction. While the number of downloads does not pose any major threat, UGS's decision reflects a belief by some that basic 2-D tools will become commoditized and could be given away for free in an effort to help drive 3-D adoption.""Still RelevantRecent optimistic comments by analysts at Wedbush Securities confirm that Autodesk is still a force to be reckoned with in its home markets, even as it reinvents itself. They view the acceleration of ADSK's model change as a net positive, and even though they had to lower estimates into next year, they maintain their Outperform rating and 12-month price target of $43.But until the earnings estimates stabilize and begin to rise, it might be best to stay on the sidelines because the stock will probably only get cheaper. Until then, investors interested in the future of Autodesk might want to check out the upcoming Inside 3D Printing Conference & Expo in San Jose, Calif., on Sept. 17-18. Joining Avi Reichental, president and CEO of 3D Systems, and S. Scott Crump, founder of Stratasys, will be Carl Bass, president and CEO of Autodesk, to deliver one of the conference's three keynote addresses.

1439321,44731,2013-05-16T03:39:25-04:00,,"The stock of design and drafting software company Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) is currently trading at a price of $39.43 per share ahead of the scheduled release of its first quarter fiscal 2014 financial results after the closing bell on May 16. The consensus estimate for Q1 fiscal 2014 by the 20 research analysts providing coverage of ADSK stock calls for the company to deliver non-GAAP diluted earnings of 45 cents per share on revenues of $584 million, with current guidance for the second quarter averaging 51 cents per share.Last year, Autodesk Inc. reported non-GAAP diluted earnings of 47 cents per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 on revenues of $589 million, which was in-line with the analyst consensus. Although the year-over-year performance of Autodesk's financial results do not adequately display it at first glance, when investors drill down beneath the surface they will discover the company is growing at a much greater rate than the figures immediately suggest. Notably, Autodesk has been on a prolific acquisition spree in the technology sector for the past several years as part of a strategy to grow its core business of enterprise drafting software and computer generated three-dimensional image design by integrating innovative smaller private startup companies into the company's portfolio.As the benefits of this buyout growth strategy begin to manifest in the ADSK stock price and contribute to its financial results, investors looking to take advantage of the tremendous potential in this cutting edge technology company will be given a timely opportunity with Autodesk's first quarter fiscal 2014 earnings report and conference call to gain greater insight into management's vision of its future. Ahead of the announcement of financial results, taking a closer look at the company's acquisition strategy, new investment fund sponsors, analyst sentiment, and the recent performance of ADSK shares will provide potential investors with a clearer view of Autodesk's prospects.Over the past two years, Autodesk has embarked on a growth strategy through buying out technology startups with a plan of forming a diverse complement to its central business model of enterprise design software. Thus far, the acquisitions have mostly been confined to three burgeoning sectors of high-tech: social networking, cloud computing, and mobile device technology. Autodesk CEO Carl Bass began implementing the acquisition growth strategy in 2011 after devoting most of his attention in his first five years as head of the company to trimming costs and reducing overhead.Since the acquisition strategy began in 2011, Autodesk has spent over a half billion dollars on identifying and purchasing smaller technology companies. In 2011, ADSK bought 23 different companies for a total investment of $234.4 million for the year. Autodesk surpassed that amount in its 2012 acquisitions by investing $273.3 million to purchase 13 companies, which is reflective of the larger size of its buyout targets and the significant year-over-year increases in private startup valuations in the technology sector.Notably, only five of the acquisitions were of companies based in the Silicon Valley area and the rest were distributed globally and throughout the rest of the United States. During the summer of 2011, the company purchased Instructables, which is a San Francisco-based online community dedicated to design collaborations and do-it-yourself projects. Around the same time in the summer of 2011, Autodesk also acquired Pixlr, which is a Swedish-based photo editing and sharing cloud computing service that will help expand ADSK's reach into the online imaging market. In the summer of 2012, Autodesk invested a reported $60 million to purchase the social video sharing application SocialCam that boasts over 50 million users on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). This was a move that essentially amounted to paying around $1.20 per user to acquire the popular platform. The integration of the video sharing application will potentially enable users of Autodesk's computer aided drafting software AutoCAD, as well as its many other enterprise design products, to collaborate and share projects. In October 2012, Autodesk announced the acquisition of Qontext, which is a social media networking platform based out of India that enables enterprise users to collaborate on projects through the use of an integrated activity stream feature. All of the buyouts share a common thread in their potential synergies to enhance Autodesk's core enterprise drafting software business and eventually increase its market share through the fusion of the social networking aspects and the collaborative nature of the design projects undertaken on these platforms.While these acquisitions may not deliver immediate monetization or be accretive to near-term quarterly earnings results, they do illustrate the commitment by CEO Carl Bass and his management team to expand Autodesk's market share and promote the growth of its core software offerings in the future through the explosive marketing potential of social networking, collaborative project storage capabilities of cloud computing, and increasingly omnipresent nature of mobile device applications. Investors can feel confident that management has a vision of its rapidly changing industry that transcends its central business of design software and is making the strategic moves to enhance this market.Several prominent hedge funds are taking note of Autodesk's growth through acquisition strategy and making significant investments in ADSK stock. In particular, Autodesk Inc. found a true believer in Dinakar Singh, whose hedge fund TPG-Axon Management purchased a new position of over 3.1 million shares by investing $112 million in ADSK in late 2012. The enormous new stake by the $1.9 billion hedge fund makes ADSK the seventh largest holding of TPG-Axon, accounting for 5.78% of its portfolio as of the end of 2012. That position also makes TPG-Axon the largest stake in Autodesk among hedge funds, which is closely followed by a nearly 2.7 million share holding established by Citadel Advisors in late 2012. The significant investments by these hedge funds in late 2012 show the confidence of professional money mangers in Autodesk's growth strategy and financial prospects.The weekly chart of ADSK shares shows that the stock successfully bounced off a test of its 50-day exponential moving average during the week of April 26 and is rallying toward a breakout to new highs for 2013. Autodesk shares are up 12% year-to-date and have gained 30% since they rallied off a double-bottom formation in the middle of November 2012. Analysts currently have ADSK rated as a hold with a consensus price target of $41.16, which means an encouraging Q1 fiscal 2014 earnings report and positive guidance could result in boosted price targets during the second quarter. For potential investors looking to increase or initiate a position in ADSK, the May 16 earnings announcement and conference call will provide a great opportunity to gain further insight into implementation of the company's growth through acquisition strategy and its prospects for the second quarter.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

This write-up will analyze Autodesk's platform shift from perpetual license to SaaS.What is SaaS?Common concerns on SaaSSoftware renting vs. buyingAccording to ""Software as a service: A look at the customer benefits"" by B Waters, hardware and upfront software investments in a perpetual license increase the IT budget 80% on average. Low initial cost in software renting increases positive network effect. Increasing number of buyers increases the buzz around the product and decreases customers' search costs. Increased consumption also benefits product development, as software developers learn from feedback. Renting would fail if a customer's needs are unique and applications are complex and fragmented. In that case, customers would be difficult to be aggregated onto a uniform IT infrastructure.What is Autodesk doing with cloud?In Sept 2011, Autodesk introduced its first cloud offerings in Autodesk Cloud 360, which is a series of add-ons for perpetual license subscribers. Subscribers gained access to rendering and 25GB storage performed in the cloud. In June 2012, Autodesk introduced BIM 360 for cloud-based building information modeling. BIM technology supports data-driven, model-based design and construction of buildings and infrastructure. In September 2012, Autodesk rolled out the first stand-alone cloud solution in Simulation 360, accessible via the internet.New seat license, upgrade and subscriptionCurrently, Autodesk sells perpetual licenses and users have the option to add annual subscription to the purchase to get the benefits of uninterrupted software upgrades and cloud. License revenue carries a gross margin of 85% and subscription revenue carries a 95% gross margin. Licenses' upgrades are priced at 50% of full license price and subscription is priced at 11% of full license price. Upgrade discount is only eligible for three years and users have to pay full license price if they decide to upgrade beyond three years. Present value of total cost of ownership over 10 years with a 10% discount rate on AutoCAD shows it is more economical for users to sign on subscription when they purchase a new seat license.Autodesk implemented the current 50% upgrade ratio in April 2010 or beginning of FY2011. The economics clearly favors subscription over discrete upgrade after that change.A stand-alone cloud solutionThe low initial cost of SaaS would help bring in new users to Autodesk. However, current economics of SaaS vs. (perpetual license plus subscription) would not give many existing users incentives to switch. The pricing of the recently introduced Autodesk Simulation 360 is used to understand the economics of a stand-alone cloud offering vs. Autodesk Inventor perpetual license:Prices for Autodesk Simulation 360:The basic one-year subscription price, the cloud capacity pack, for Simulation 360 is about $1,000. Perpetual license users already invested in the hardware and IT infrastructure when they first bought the perpetual license. Subscriptions already gave them the benefits of cloud. The decreasing cost of computing power and the similar pricing between one-year subscription and the stand-alone cloud offering do not give existing users much incentive to switch.The low initial cost of cloud will attract new users. In the case of customer life of 3 years, 5 years and 10 years, lifetime value of perpetual/ subscription user is 3.3x, 2.6x and 2x of the lifetime value of a stand-alone cloud user.Assume there would be some discount to the stand-alone cloud solution vs. the subscription price to encourage users to switch and a five-year customer life, Autodesk would need 3-4x cloud users for every perpetual/ subscription AutoCAD Architecture user.P&L analysis on the cloud restructuringDuring the last quarter, Autodesk announced a restructuring to accelerate the progress to cloud and mobile. The restructuring involves cutting 520 jobs (7% of staff) and investing in cloud product and development. The restructuring will reduce operating expense from 6% Year/Year growth in the first half to plus/minus 2% Y/Y in the second half. Operating expense is roughly 67% of revenue. The dollar saving in 2H FY13 would be around $45 -$60 million ($770 million operating expense in 2H FY12 * 6% or 8%). The pre-tax charge in 2H FY13 would be $50 - $60 million. The restructuring charge and spending save effectively offset each other. According to the Q2 press release, ""While Autodesk is reducing its overall staffing levels in the near term, the company will continue to invest in key development areas."" As a result, R&D or marketing spend would likely normalize in FY14 (closer to +6% Y/Y run-rate) while consensus expects an accelerated margin expansion.Consensus:Bottom LineEconomics of stand-alone cloud product and perpetual license with subscription show that existing users have little incentive to switch. The SaaS initiative would be more about bringing in new customers. In cutting 7% of its workforce and shifting the platform focus to cloud, Autodesk risks alienating existing users and needs to compensate every loss of perpetual user with 2-4 SaaS users. It would be difficult for Autodesk to transition to a standalone cloud only software vendor. In addition, CAD data is too heavy for internet-based communications just yet. The current economics of suite and subscription are very attractive. Similar to the sales force re-org, Autodesk would most likely emerge with a hybrid model of perpetual license/ subscription and SaaS. In the meantime, there would be volatility in execution and financial results would be under downside pressure.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

838781,24491,2012-08-30T14:44:09-04:00,,"With the recent fall in Autodesk's (NASDAQ:ADSK) price, let's see if the firm is set to deliver alpha from here.Investors know that to generate alpha, one must constantly seek out new opportunities and new ways of looking at the same things. Alpha can be created by capitalizing on public information that other investors can't easily process (think footnotes of an 8-k), building a better mousetrap (think a better valuation model), achieving a better understanding of how the market works (an in-depth understanding of the company and its drivers), or exploiting structural impediments of the market (think cross-methodological work and post-earnings drift).(click images to enlarge)Autodesk's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsAutodesk earns a ValueCreationâ¢ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. We expect the firm's return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) to expand to 144.8% from 87.7% during the next two years.We want to capture alpha, and the higher the rating on our Valuentum Buying Index (our stock selection methodology), the higher probability a company will deliver alpha in our Best Ideas portfolio. Autodesk looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. If the firm's share price fell below $28 (see our valuation assumptions below), we'd take a closer look at the company. Autodesk currently registers a 6 on our Valuentum Buying Index, which is respectable, but not as good as other firms that register a 9 or a 10 on our index.We think earnings and free cash flow drive the valuations of stocks. Autodesk has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 21.5% in coming years, and the firm had no debt as of last quarter.Autodesk's share price performance has trailed that of the market during the past quarter. However, it is trading within our fair value estimate range, so we don't view such activity as alarming.Economic Profit AnalysisWe think the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Autodesk's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 76.4%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreationâ¢ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Autodesk's free cash flow margin has averaged about 20.5% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. It differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Autodesk, cash flow from operations increased about 132% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 62% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Autodesk's shares are worth between $28.00 - $46.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRiskâ¢ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $37 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 30.3 times last year's earnings, and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 15.4 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 8.2% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of -1.5%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 25.8%, which is above Autodesk's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year five, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.7% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Autodesk, we use a 10.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate Autodesk's fair value at about $37 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRiskâ¢ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Autodesk. We think the firm is attractive below $28 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $46 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Autodesk's fair value at this point in time to be about $37 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Autodesk's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year Three represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $50 per share in Year Three represents our existing fair value per share of $37 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1656932,25120,2013-08-26T11:00:04-04:00,,"Shares of Autodesk (ADSK) are marching higher as investors act relieved following the release of a strong second quarter earnings report.I remain cautious as I don't understand why the market attaches a premium valuation to this software company given the lack of revenue growth. This is despite the great popularity of Autodesk's products.Second Quarter ResultsAutodesk generated second quarter revenues of $562 million, down 1% on the year. The decline was mostly caused by adverse currency movements, as in constant currencies revenues would have increased by 2 percent.Revenues were roughly in line with analysts predictions of $561 million.GAAP diluted earnings per share fell by a penny to $0.27 per share, while non-GAAP earnings fell by three cents to $0.45 per share. Adjusted earnings beat consensus estimates of $0.42 per share.Looking Into The ResultsAutodesk saw some weakness in its European, Middle East and African business which reported a 4% decline in revenues to $202 million, but was flat in constant currencies. As revenues in the Americas were up by 2%, they matched those in EMEA.Asia-Pacific revenues fell by 1% to $158 million, but were actually up 4% in constant currencies. Disappointing was the 2% drop in emerging economies revenues, coming in at $86 million.Platform Solutions revenues fell 9% to $197 million, while revenues from the architecture, engineering and construction business rose by 9% to $177 million. The manufacturing unit reported a 2% increase in revenues to $144 million, while revenues from media and entertainment fell by 11% to $43 million.All in all, net income fell slightly to $61.7 million on the back of the modest decline in revenues.Looking AheadFor the current third quarter, Autodesk sees revenues coming in between $540 and $555 million. GAAP earnings per share are seen between $0.19 and $0.23, while non-GAAP earnings are seen between $0.36 and $0.40 per share.Consensus estimates for non-GAAP earnings stood at $0.50 per share, while analysts looked for guided revenues of $580 million.The guidance implies that while revenues are falling 3% compared to the second quarter at the midpoint of the guidance, they are flat compared to last year. To put the earnings guidance into perspective, last year's earnings came in at $0.13 per share.ValuationAutodesk ended its second quarter with $2.00 billion in cash, equivalents and marketable securities. The company operates with $746 million in debt, for a solid net cash position of around $1.25 billion.Revenues for the first six months of the year came in at $1.13 billion, down 2.1% on the year before. Net earnings fell by 18.3% to $117.3 million. At this pace annual revenues could come in around $2.25 billion, while net earnings are seen between $225 and $250 million.Trading around $39 per share, the market values Autodesk at $8.65 billion, or its operating assets at $7.4 billion. This values operating assets of the firm at 3.3 times annual revenues and 30 times annual earnings.Autodesk does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveWhile long-term investors have seen really good returns, the more recent returns have been less impressive. Since 2003 shares have rallied from $10 to highs around $50 in 2007.Shares have fallen all the way back to $12 in 2009 amidst the financial crisis but have recovered to current levels around $40 per share.Between the calendar year of 2009 and 2012, Autodesk has increased its annual revenues by almost 35% to $2.31 billion. Net income rose from $58 million to $247 million in the meantime.Investment ThesisJust like major competitor Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Autodesk is trying to transform its business model by selling monthly license streams instead of large lump-sum and contracts with upfront payments. Autodesk will give shareholders and analysts a detailed look about its future subscription revenue model in an investor meeting to be held in October.Adobe's 50 million active user base is furthermore accessing their beloved software more, and more from the cloud. Besides offering flexibility in software accessibility, Autodesk aims to boost flexibility in payment models as well.Autodesk, known from its computer-aided design software (CAD), saw a modest performance over the past quarter. Its software is used in the architecture and construction sector, and these sectors have seen some recent tailwinds given the recent strength in the US housing sector. Other sectors have seen continued struggles.Back in August of 2012 I last took a look at Autodesk's prospects. I concluded that despite the growth opportunities, the profitability of the business was dismal, especially given the valuation of the business.Today I reiterate my stance. I remain on the sidelines on the back of a premium valuation accompanied with a lack of revenue and earnings growth.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

940461,35231,2012-10-23T04:29:06-04:00,,"Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) has a stronghold in construction and infrastructure design, especially with government projects adopting the use of BIM standard. There is a long growth runway for Autodesk due to (1) BIM is only 50% penetrated globally according to management and (2) adoption of the BIM standard is accelerating. Overall, Autodesk will benefit from U.S. housing recovery and increasing infrastructure spending in emerging markets. The business of Autodesk is robust because (1) the switching cost for customers is high, (2) the company has 40% revenue recurring in maintenance that will grow with the installed base of licenses, and (3) an increasing unit revenue (+20% on average) from the installed base from suite penetration.Despite solid fundamentals, the recent sales reorganization would probably need further fine-tuning using past examples as reference. As a result, there would still be volatility in strategy execution and financial results would be under pressure for the next quarter or two.Company DescriptionAutodesk is a vendor of computer-aided design (CAD) software. Customers range from corporations to individuals. The firm was founded in 1982 and is based in San Rafael, California. Autodesk is the de facto 3D design standard within Architecture, Engineering & Construction (AEC) and Infrastructure (combined to be 66% of revenue) from a 30-year head start. The rest are in the manufacturing/ PLM space, where the firm competes with Parametrics and Dassault, and media & entertainment.Autodesk is dominant in construction and infrastructure design because most government construction projects are mandated to follow Building Information Modeling (BIM), a 3D modeling/ simulation/ visualization requirement. And this standard, a shift away from 2D technology, is being increasingly adopted by governments worldwide. According to the Q4 2012 earnings call, ""We've really hit the tipping point with BIM or Building Information Modeling. We've hit the point where there is a huge amount of demand from owners. It's being mandated by government agencies.""Revenue Mix60% of overall revenue comes from new seat licenses and upgrades. Commercial new seat revenue is 67% of license revenue. Maintenance, which is 40% of revenue, includes new releases, enhancements, downloadable training courses and online support during the term of the software contract. Deferred revenue, at about $600m as of the latest Q, reconciles net billings with maintenance revenue. Most of the net billings are single-year contracts since the product cycle runs on one year, meaning deferred revenue will get recognized as revenue within 12 months. Maintenance growth rate is a function of the license sales during prior four quarters, the attach rate and the renewal rates.Driving top-line growth through suite penetrationAutodesk introduced suite in Q2 FY12 to replace product bundle. As of Q2 FY13, suites are 27% of license revenue and management would like to grow that to 70%. Suites would lift average spend per customer by 20%. Since 85% of sales come through channel partners vs. 15% company direct sales, Autodesk has encouraged sales teams and channel partners to represent the entire product portfolio targeted at industries rather than geographies through additional trainings and certifications to drive deeper suite penetration. This initiative has motivated management to reorganize the sales force by industry verticals vs. geographies.P&L waterfall and free cash flowAutodesk has 90% gross margin and spent 40% of revenue in marketing, 25% in R&D and 10% in G&A. Excluding stock-based compensation and amortization of acquisition-related purchased intangibles, adjusted operating margin improved 480bps in FY11 and 360bps in FY12 to about 25%. The company targets 30% margin by FY15.CapEx is 2-3% of revenue. With zero debt, cash is 20% of market cap at $1.4 billion (>80% off-shore). Autodesk generated about $500 million free cash flow in 2010 and 2011 on about $2 billion revenue. The company spent $200 million in tuck-in acquisitions in FY12 and the rest went to shares repurchase. The company has a $1.4 billion buyback program outstanding.Sales reorganization gone badTo drive suite penetration, management implemented a reorganization on the sales force, changing from a geo-organized sales force to one that focuses on industry verticals. The reorganization blew up last quarter, when management had to cut revenue guidance (from at least 10% growth to 4%-6%) and adjusted operating margin guidance (200bps expansion to 150bps expansion) for FY13.The management confirmed its guidance of at least 10% top line growth during its Analyst Day in July. The surprised cut in August is summed up by an analyst's question during the earnings call:The reorganization was a significant organizational change, with many employees taking on new roles, new customers, new managers and teams. Management admitted that ""it's clear that our reorganization and having people in different positions slowed us down in the quarter."" Most people still had the same job, but the chain of command had changed, because the sales force is organized in industry vs. geography and ""some of these incentives got out of whack with some of our channel partners."" Therefore, ""it probably impacted our ability to get quotas and targets out to our sales force and our ability to measure the results as they came in.""A historical examination of reorganizationAccording to an analyst at the Q2 earnings call, ""typically in software, when you make major changes to go to market and sales, it takes three quarters for things to settle out."" Exide (XIDE), Ford (NYSE:F) and P&G (NYSE:PG) went through a similar business reorganization in the past - shifting from geography focused to product focused. Their examples are used to analyze the current reorganization at Autodesk.1. Exide TechnologiesIn 2000, Robert Lutz, Chairman and CEO of Exide, spent $8 million to form business units around the company's various product lines, replacing geography. Half of Exide's top European managers resigned after feeling demoted. The reorganization didn't last long. When Exide bought GNB Tech in May 2000, Mr. Lutz tilted the organization structure back toward a geographic model by letting Mr. Bregman, the president of GNB's industrial-battery division, keep control of the North American industrial-battery business. After two more quarters of reshuffling, Exide emerged using a blend of geography and product-line org structure.2. Ford MotorUnder ""Ford 2000,"" Ford abandoned functional departments and geographical divisions and pursued a product-based model. The reorganization, begun in 1995, saved the company $5 billion. However, Ford's European market share in 2000 dropped to 8.8% from 13% five years ago. Between 1996 and 1999, its European division went through four different executives. By early 2000, Ford restored some of its regional executives' lost authority. Ford emerged as a blend of product and geo-focused org structure.3. P&GUntil 1998, P&G was organized along geography. Under ""Organization 2005,"" P&G shifted from four geo-based business units to five product-based business units - Baby, Feminine & Family care, Beauty Care, Fabric & Home Care, Food & Beverages and Healthcare. However, P&G did not anticipate the disruption when shifting thousands of employees into new jobs. The company's goal of cutting 13% of workforce certainly did not help morale. Managers started complaining to the board, and CEO Jager was forced out after 17 months. His replacement CEO, Alan Lafley, reinstated some of P&G's geographic focus.Takeaway from past reorganizationsA Bain study of 57 major reorganizations found that less than one-third has added shareholder value. Successful reorganizations enable people in the organization make better decisions and align executions with incentives. According to HBR, reorganizations disrupt relationships that get things done and hinders productivity until connections can be rebuilt within the new structure.What does that mean for Autodesk?Autodesk is currently going through two initiatives: (1) pushing customers towards suites and away from point products and (2) restructuring to accelerate the shift towards cloud and mobile computing. The first initiative would depend on the reorganized sales force (85% of revenue comes from indirect sales channels) and the second initiative would depend on how quickly customers adopt a new billing model (from perpetual license/ upgrades to annuity/ term offerings). Looking at history, it is likely that the sales force will emerge as a hybrid (geo/ industry focused) model to align chain of command and incentives. Therefore, there will still be volatility in executions and thus pressure on financial results in the next quarter or two.Bottom Line - Consensus still too high, staying on the sideline for nowAfter the Q2 report, FY13 sales growth was revised from +15% to +7.5% and consensus now expects 150bps adjusted operating margin expansion. The company is cutting spending (COGS + Operating expenses) from the 6% run rate to -2% and +2%. That should help margin. However, FY13 sales growth is 150bps above the upper range of management guidance (4%-6%) and EPS has barely bulged since the Q2 miss. With the still high consensus expectation and the lingering reorganization, there would be opportunity in the next quarter or two to buy in this solid business.Source: FactSetDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1415421,35521,2013-05-08T15:36:00-04:00,,"Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), with a market cap of $8.85 billion, is a design software and services company, providing customers productive business solutions mainly in the architecture, engineering, construction, manufacturing, digital media and entertainment industries.Create 3D Models by Autodesk and iPadAutodesk is on the right spot for 3D printing as the company is trying to help users create a 3D model via the iPad and a free app called 123D Catch. By taking 50-70 shots around the subject twice at different angles, 2D photos can be processed into a 3D model by using Autodesk's software. The 3D model can then be uploaded to Autodesk's 123D site or printed directly with a 3D printer, such as MakerBot.Imagination and Limitation of 3D PrintingAlthough there are still limitations for 3D printing, the development for 3D printing technology had been phenomenal in the last few years. Autodesk's CEO, Carl Bass, stated, ""It's taken it 20 plus years for it to really develop, but the acceleration of the technology in the last few years has been incredible."" 3D printing continues to have scaling problems and be limited by the materials. Still, 3D printer companies, such as 3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD) and Stratasys, Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS) continues to enjoy rapid expansion by selling what analysts call a disruptive technology.Autodesk had tripled its workforce in San Francisco in the past 5 years and had aggressively expanded into 3D printing software. As said by Autodesk's chief marketing officer, Chris Bradshaw, ""Not unlike LaserJet printers, 3D printers are going to end up in everyone's house."" The impact may be further beyond and apply to the manufacturing and supply chains. The future of 3D printing is only limited by imagination.Hype?The future is bright for 3D printing, however, are 3D printing related companies overpriced? A quick comparison will be reviewed for Autodesk, 3D Systems and Stratasys including the revenues, return on equity, and P/E ratios.Source: YCharts.comThe revenues for all 3 companies continue to increase since mid-2009. The growth has accelerated for both 3D Systems and Stratasys since 2011.Source: YCharts.comThe ROE for Autodesk had peaked in mid-2011 while 3D System and Stratasys had started to decline in early 2012.Source: YCharts.comDespite the rapid growth, Stratasys' P/E of 190.90 is much higher than 3D System's P/E of 58.58 and Autodesk's P/E of 36.94. Although there may be some hype surrounding the 3D printing industry, the valuation for 3D Systems and Autodesk are justified and supported with its solid revenue growth. 3D Systems had just announced another solid quarter with record revenue and gross profit on higher printer units for Q1, 2013, where revenue grew 31% from 2012 to $102.1 million on a 61% increase in printers and other products. Despite a high P/E, Stratasys is expected to ride the long-term uptrend for 3D printing as the integration continues for the company after the merger, supported with a healthy balance sheet.Autodesk remains a solid, safe bet for 3D printing with its current business model. Autodesk enjoys a wide economic moat and a strong market leadership with its computer-aided design software. The company continues to aggressively expand into mobile, social, and could market by leveraging its advanced technology. Autodesk is well positioned to capture the 3D printing trend with its solid fundamentals and well established positions in the 2D market.How to InvestAutodesk's P/E of 37.0 remains below the industry average of 57.5. The Forward P/E of 18.2 is justified with its estimated revenue growth of 5.90% and 8.40% for 2013 and 2014. Analysts have a mean target price of $41.47 for Autodesk. Technically, Autodesk's share price should be supported at $36, the long-term uptrend support. Autodesk remains a solid long-term buy.Disclaimer: Investors and traders are recommended to do their own due diligence and research before making any trading/investing decisions.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in ADSK over the next 72 hours.

We expect the firm's return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) to expand to 144.8% from 87.7% during the next two years.The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. If the firm's share price fell below $28, we'd take a closer look at adding it to the market-beating portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter. In the spirit of transparency, we show the performance of our Best Ideas Newsletter below: (Click to enlarge)Autodesk has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 21.5% in coming years, and the firm had no debt as of last quarter.Although we think there may be a better time to dabble in the firm's shares based on our DCF process, the firm's stock has outperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter, indicating increased investor interest in the company.The firm experienced a net income CAGR of about 15.8% during the past 3 years. We expect its net income growth to be better than its peer median during the next five years. (Click to enlarge)Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Autodesk's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 76.4%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.8%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreationâ¢ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate. (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge)Cash Flow Analysis (Click to enlarge)Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Autodesk's free cash flow margin has averaged about 20.5% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Autodesk, cash flow from operations increased about 132% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 62% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Autodesk's shares are worth between $28.00 - $46.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRiskâ¢ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $37 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 30.3 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 15.4 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 8.2% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of -1.5%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 25.8%, which is above Autodesk's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.7% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Autodesk, we use a 10.8% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows. (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge)Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $37 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRiskâ¢ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Autodesk. We think the firm is attractive below $28 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $46 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion. (Click to enlarge) (Click to enlarge)Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Autodesk's fair value at this point in time to be about $37 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Autodesk's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $50 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $37 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.

828031,25120,2012-08-25T08:47:12-04:00,,"Shares of Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) fell over 15% in Friday's trading session. The design and software company reported disappointing second quarter results on Thursday after the close.Second Quarter ResultsAutodesk reported second quarter revenues of $568.7 million, up 4% on the year. Revenues fell 3% compared to its first quarter revenues. License and other revenues rose 2% to $341 million, while maintenance revenues rose 8% to $228 million. Revenues came in much lower than analysts estimates of $594.0 million, after Autodesk guided for revenues of $580-$600 million.GAAP operating margins compressed fell by 1% to 16%. The margin compression resulted in a decline in GAAP earnings per share from $0.30 per share towards $0.28. Non-GAAP earnings rose from $0.44 to $0.48 per share. On average, analysts expected Autodesk to earn $0.49 per share.Autodesk repurchased roughly 3.4 million shares, at an average price of $32.23 per share, for a total consideration of $111 million.The company is restructuring some parts of its business. Autodesk sees design and engineering software moving towards the cloud and mobile solutions. The company will take a pre-tax charge of $50-$60 million in the third and fourth quarter, related to the restructuring.CEO Carl Bass commented on the results:Segmental InformationEurope, Middle-East and African revenues rose 1% on the year to $210 million, but fell 1% on the quarter. Revenues in the Americas rose 4% on the year to $199 million, but fell compared to the first quarter. Asia-Pacific revenues rose 12% per year to $161 million, up 3% on the quarter.Revenues at platform solutions came in at $218 million. Architecture, engineering and construction revenues fell to $161 million. The manufacturing and media & entertainment division reported a decline in revenues as well.OutlookFor the third quarter of its fiscal 2013, Autodesk anticipates revenues between $550-$570 million. Earnings per share on a GAAP basis are expected to come in between $0.02 and $0.07. Non-GAAP earnings are anticipated to come in between $0.40-$0.45 per share. The guidance, came in below analysts consensus of non-GAAP earnings of $0.50 per share.For the full year of its fiscal 2013, the company anticipates revenue growth to come in between 4-6%. GAAP operating margins are expected to fall 210 basis points.Despite the challenging environment, Autodesk continues to see opportunities and strong long term prospects. The company remains committed to achieve the long-term growth targets by the end of 2015.ValuationAutodesk ended its second quarter with $1.7 billion in cash and equivalents. The company operates without the assumption of debt.For the first six months of its fiscal 2013, the company reported revenues of $1.16 billion. The company net earned $144 million on a GAAP basis, or $0.62 per share. The company is on track to report annual revenues of $2.3 billion for the year, on which it could earn $200-$250 million, or around $1 per share.At the moment, shares are valued at $6.8 billion. Excluding the $1.7 billion in cash, operating assets are valued around $5.0 billion. This values the company at roughly 2.2 times annual revenues and 30 times earnings. The valuation compares to a revenue multiple of 3.9 times for Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE), which trades at 20 times annual earnings.At the moment, Autodesk does not pay a dividend.Investment ThesisYear to date, shares of Autodesk trade flat after the disastrous trading session on Friday. Shares hit highs around $42 per share in March, but fell towards $30 by May as the company warned of a tough second quarter.Over the past five years, shares of Autodesk have lost roughly a third of their value. Revenues stabilized at around $2.3 billion, during this period of time. Earnings rose slightly from $185 million in 2008 to an expected $200-$250 million for this year. This includes the $50-$60 million in restructuring charges.Despite the growth opportunities in the industry, profitability of the business remains dismal. Given the company's track record in recent years, I think the current valuation is on the high side. I remain on the sidelines.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

825591,27011,2012-08-23T23:59:12-04:00,,"After the market closed on Thursday, August 23, 2012, Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) released earnings and guidance,which fell far short of expectations. The company reported earnings of 28 cents per share for the second quarter, which was down from 30 cents in the same period last year. Analysts had been expecting earnings to come in at 49 cents per share, on revenues of $593 million. But the company missed on revenues as well, which were just about $568.7 million. If that wasn't enough, Autodesk said it would start a restructuring program, which includes job cuts. Additionally, it gave third quarter guidance, which also seems to fall short of current expectations. It now expects earnings to fall between 40 to 45 cents on revenues of $550 to $570 million, while analysts were expecting about $600 million in revenues and earnings of 50 cents per share.Faced with this new dose of reality, Autodesk shares plunged over 20% to about $27.50 per share in after hours trading. Even at this lower level, the stock does not look cheap. While many investors might be tempted to go ""bargain hunting,"" the stock is likely to underperform for awhile. The next couple of days are likely to bring a number of analyst downgrades and price target reductions.Autodesk is a great company, and it has a solid balance sheet. This company is a leader in design and 3D software, but it comes down to valuation. Even at about $27.50 per share, the stock still trades for about 17 times earnings, while one of the world's largest software companies, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), trades for just about 10 times earnings. Furthermore, Microsoft shares offer a solid dividend yield of about 3%, while Autodesk offers no dividend. Microsoft is expected to earn significantly more than Autodesk on a per share basis, and yet the two stocks trade at for close to $30 per share. That means Autodesk shares could still be too expensive to consider for bargain-hunters. At these levels, Microsoft may be a better value.Autodesk's recent results and forward guidance shows that sales are slowing, and if you want to see what the market can do to tech stocks that fail to show solid growth, just take a look at Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) shares, which now trade for just over 4 times earnings. With this recent miss, and a higher than average valuation, the shares could be poised to test the 52-week lows at around $24.63 in the coming weeks and months.Key Data Points For Autodesk From Yahoo Finance:Current Share Price (as of this writing): $35.71 (or about $27.50 in after hours trading)52-Week Range: $24.63 to $42.69Dividend: none2013 (Fiscal Year) Earnings Estimate: $2.02 per share2014 (Fiscal Year) Earnings Estimate: $2.36 per shareP/E Ratio: about 17 times earningsKey Data Points For Microsoft From Yahoo Finance:Current Share Price (as of this writing): $30.2552-Week Range: $24.26 to $32.95Dividend: 80 cents per share, which yields 2.6%2012 Earnings Estimate: $3.02 per share2013 Earnings Estimate: $3.32 per shareP/E Ratio: about 10 times earningsData is sourced from Yahoo Finance.

Socialcam is a Facebook app, which seems to have little in common with the Computer Aided Design or CAD software the company is noted for.Autodesk management says it bought Socialcam for its platform, which it believes can become a channel for its professional video tools.The price is sofa cushion money for a company that has more than $1 billion in cash. What's far more important is Autodesk's credibility, defending a PE of 25 in a world where many leaders are now selling for half that.Socialcam competes in the social video app space with Viddy, a product that a slicker interface that limits videos to 15 seconds. It was founded by Michael Seibel, who told PandoDaily he was happy to sell out for three times what his investors had put in, saying there will be ""Instagram for video"" and that the winner in this area will be the company that can draw deeper engagement from a limited number of users.Seibel is best known as the founder of Justin.Tv, and originally created Socialcam as a spin-off to that product. He seems unlikely to be staying at the company, but he would be a great ""get"" for Autodesk, whose top management is aging. CEO Carl Bass is 54 and an Autodesk lifer while Seibel, who is not yet 30, seems more hip to what's new.Building a network of smaller, trusted entrepreneurs like Seibel seems to be Autodesk's best bet for continuing growth. Joseph Flaherty of Wired notes there are many other small companies Autodesk could go after next, many of them closer to its original niche.The question is whether Bass and his team can make the right choices and spend judiciously to grow what they buy. Until they bring someone like Seibel on-board that will remain a question.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

384171,20568,2012-02-22T15:28:21-05:00,,"Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK)  is scheduled to release its fiscal fourth quarter 2012 results after  the closing bell on Thursday, Feb 23, 2012. In the run-up to the  earnings release we notice only one analyst revising estimates in the  last 30 days.A Sneak Peek into the Previous QuarterAutodesk reported a strong third quarter driven by continued growth in  revenues across geographies and business segments. The company reported  robust top-line growth on the back of higher license and other revenues,  which not only surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimates, but were also  at the higher end of managementâs guided range.Autodeskâs bottom line also improved on a year-over-year basis and moved past the Zacks Consensus Estimates.Moreover, buoyed by the robust growth in revenues and cost-controlling  measures, the companyâs operating performance also improved. (For  further details, please read: Autodesk Reports Strong 3Q)Fourth Quarter and FY12 ExpectationsFor the fourth quarter of 2012, Autodesk expects revenues in the range  of $575.0 million to $590.0 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is  pegged at $584.0 million.GAAP EPS is expected in the range of 26 cents to 29 cents. Non-GAAP EPS  is expected in the 42 cents to 45 cents range. The Zacks Consensus  Estimate is currently pegged at 38 cents per share, which is evidently  below the guided range.For fiscal 2012, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of $2.20  billion to $2.21 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  $2.21 billion. GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $1.17 to $1.20 and  non-GAAP EPS is expected in the range of $1.70 to $1.73. The Zacks  Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.39. Autodesk expects non-GAAP  operating margin to improve by between 210 and 240 basis points in  fiscal 2012.Additionally, the company provided a sneak peak into their fiscal 2013  when the company reported its third quarter. For fiscal 2013, Autodesk  expects revenues to increase 10.0% on a year-over-year basis, with about  150 basis points increase in the GAAP operating margin and roughly 200  basis points increase in non-GAAP operating margin, over the fiscal 2012  figures.Estimation Revision TrendOut of the six analysts covering the stock, one upward revision was  noticed in the last 30 days, while none of the analysts revised their  estimates downward. Thus, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 38 cents moved  up a cent over the last 30 days.For fiscal year 2012, out of the 8 analysts covering the stock, one  positive revision was witnessed in the last 30 days, although the EPS  estimate for fiscal 2012 remained at $1.39.Most of the analysts covering the stock are optimistic about the  companyâs market share gains and presence in emerging markets, which  will likely drive the top-line going forward. Moreover, the acquisitions  in the field of CAD and gaming middleware sections will provide the  company with long-term opportunities, particularly in the web-based  communities that will likely boost the companyâs cloud offerings going  forward.However, some analysts are cautious about the high exposure of the  company in Europe (40% of revenues are derived from Europe), citing the  lingering financial turmoil and gloomy macro-economic environment in the  region.ConclusionAutodesk posted a positive average earnings surprise of 4.02% in the  trailing four quarters, implying that on average, the company exceeded  the Zacks Consensus Estimate by that magnitude in the stated period.  Given the upward trend in positive surprises, the improving product line  and growth prospects, we expect the company to post another positive  surprise in the upcoming quarter.In our view, Autodeskâs expanding product portfolio, and broadening  industry application and geographic reach will help it sustain  longer-term growth through the development of high-volume, lower-cost  CAD software. We believe that this will likely drive earnings going  forward.However, foreign exchange fluctuations, increasing exposure to Europe, and competition from Adobe Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Parametric Technology Corp. (PMTC) are the headwinds. Additionally, challenges in the form of customer concentration keep us in the sidelines for the time being.We have a Neutral recommendation on Autodeskâs shares in the long term.  Currently, Autodesk has a Zacks #4 Rank, which translates into a  short-term (1-3 months) Sell rating.ADOBE SYSTEMS: Free Stock Analysis ReportAUTODESK INC: Free Stock Analysis ReportPARAMETRIC TECH: Free Stock Analysis Report"

Note that revenue is forecast to come in at $583.09 mln next quarter (4Q 2012), a 10.5% year/year increase and 6.5% sequential gain in a more challenging economic backdrop.The macro picture, particularly in Europe (EMEA accounts for ~40% of Autodesk revenue) is among the chief concerns facing Autodesk, while expectations are already toward the high end of the previously-stated forecast. With the shares up more than 30% above the October lows, positive results may well be priced in, with the shares now trading at 31.4x trailing earnings, a premium to the 5-year average. Meanwhile, gross margins near 90% are also at the higher end of the range over the past 10 years.Chart Review(Click charts to expand) Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Disclaimer: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

We do not see any major variation in  analystsâ estimates in the run-up to the earnings release.Prior-Quarter RecapAutodesk reported strong results, spurred strong by year-over-year  growth in revenues, which was driven by higher license and other  revenues. Moreover, maintenance revenues were also up on a year over  year basis.Autodesk witnessed significant upside across all of its geographical  regions. Revenues in America jumped 13.0% year over year to $191.0  million. Revenues from emerging economies remained strong.For the third quarter of 2012, Autodesk expects revenues in the range  of $535.0 million to $550.0 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is  pegged at $544.0 million.The GAAP EPS is expected in the range of 25 cents to 29 cents. Non-GAAP  EPS is expected in the 38 cents to 42 cents range. The Zacks Consensus  Estimate is currently pegged at 34 cents per share, which is below the  guided range.For fiscal 2012, Autodesk expects revenues to increase 13.0% year over  year. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to increase 200 bps on a  year-over-year basis. The company did not provide any EPS guidance for  fiscal 2012. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.38 per  share for fiscal 2012.Estimate Revision TrendNone of the six analysts covering the stock revised their estimates in  the last 30 days. Hence, the EPS estimate for the third quarter of 2012  remained at 34 cents.For fiscal year 2012, two negative revisions were witnessed in the last  30 days, although the EPS estimate for fiscal 2012 remained at $1.38.Most of the analysts covering the stock are optimistic about the  companyâs market share gains and presence in emerging markets, which  will likely drive the top-line going forward.During the reported quarter, revenues from emerging economies  represented 16.0% of the total revenue and compared favorably on a  year-over-year basis. The analysts also expect significant earnings  growth for 2012 on the back of accelerating license revenue, maintenance  and renewal rates.However, some analysts are cautious about the high exposure of the  company in Europe, citing the recent gloomy macro-economic environment  in the region. ConclusionAutodesk posted a positive average earnings surprise of 3.09% in the  trailing four quarters, implying that on average, the company exceeded  the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the period. Given the upward trend in  positive surprises, the improving product line and growth prospects, we  expect the company to post another positive surprise in the upcoming  quarter.In our view, the companyâs improvements and innovations in 3D-design  technology and product portfolio provide a competitive edge. Moreover,  Autodeskâs expanding product portfolio and broadening industry and  geographic reach will help it sustain its longer-term growth strategy of  providing high-volume, lower-cost CAD software. We believe this will  likely drive earnings going forward. Moreover, the acquisitions that are  being made in the field of CAD and gaming middleware sections will  provide the company with long term opportunities, particularly in the  web-based communities that will likely boost the companyâs cloud  offerings going forward.However, foreign exchange fluctuations and competition from Adobe Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Parametric Technology Corp. (PMTC) remain headwinds.We have a Neutral recommendation on Autodeskâs shares in the long term.Currently, Autodesk has a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term (1-3 months) Hold rating.ADOBE SYSTEMS: Free Stock Analysis ReportAUTODESK INC: Free Stock Analysis ReportPARAMETRIC TECH: Free Stock Analysis ReportZacks Investment Research"

We do not see any major variation in  analystsâ estimates in the run-up to the earnings release.Prior-Quarter Recap Autodesk witnessed strong revenue growth across all its segments and  markets in the first quarter of 2012. Revenues not only beat the Zacks  Consensus Estimate but also surpassed managementâs guidance range.  However, earnings per share (EPS) were in line with the Zacks Consensus  Estimate.EPS, including stock-based compensation but excluding one-time charges  were up 47.6% year over year, driven by strong revenue growth.Positive results in the quarter were backed by year-over-year growth  across all the served geographies. Autodeskâs international businesses  also contributed to the strong revenue growth in the quarter.Second Quarter 2012 & Fiscal 2012 EstimatesFor the forthcoming quarter, Autodesk expects revenues in the range of  $530.0 million to $545.0 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged  at $539.0 million (high end of the guided range).The GAAP EPS is expected in the range of 25 cents to 29 cents. Non-GAAP  EPS is projected at between 37 cents and 41 cents for the quarter,  which excludes 8 cents related to stock-based compensation expense and 4  cents for the amortization of acquisition related intangibles, net of  tax. The current Zacks Consensus estimate for the quarter (including  stock-based compensation) is 34 cents.Net revenue for fiscal 2012 is expected to increase by approximately  12.0% from the year-ago level. Autodesk anticipates fiscal 2012 GAAP and  non-GAAP operating margins to increase by at least 200 basis points  (bps) compared with fiscal 2011. The non-GAAP operating margin excludes  approximately 60 bps of restructuring charges, 20 bps of intangibles  amortization charges and a negative 50 bps of stock-based compensation  expense.Autodesk expects effective tax rate of approximately 23.0% for GAAP results and approximately 25.0% for non-GAAP results.Estimate Revision TrendNone of the six analysts covering the stock revised their estimates in  the last 30 days. Hence, the EPS estimate for the second quarter of 2012  remained at 34 cents.However, for fiscal year 2012, one positive revision was witnessed in  the last 30 days. But the EPS estimate for fiscal 2012 remained at  $1.40.Most of the analysts covering the stock are optimistic about the  companyâs market share gains and presence in emerging markets, which  will likely drive top-line going forward. Revenue from emerging  economies represented 15.0% of the total revenue in the previous quarter  and compared favorably on a year-over-year basis.The analysts also expect significant earnings growth for 2012 on the  back of accelerating license revenue, maintenance and renewal rates.ConclusionAutodesk posted a positive average earnings surprise of 26.6% in the  trailing four quarters, implying that the company either beat or was in  line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the same period. The company  is also expected to post another positive surprise in the upcoming  quarter.In our view, the companyâs improvements and innovations in 3D design  technology and product portfolio provides a competitive edge.

297186,24351,2011-10-03T10:14:06-04:00,,"With all the talk about a second potential global slowdown it may be no surprise that the market has punished shares of design software provider Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) lately. ADSK is down 28 percent compared to the S&P 500's (INX) drop of 10 percent this year.Analysts know, after all, that the 2008 recession took a cleaver to Autodesk's sales as building and infrastructure projects were among the first capital outlays to be put off or canceled completely. Competitors in design automation software like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) were not spared either. Engineering design software is clearly not a recession proof industry.But fears of a repeat are overblown mainly because Autodesk is less vulnerable to a slowdown this time and in a stronger position to weather another drop in sales, should it happen.Deja Vu all Over Again?At one particularly painful point in the 2008-2009 downturn Autodesk's quarterly revenue plunged by 30 percent. The company was unable to cut costs nearly as quickly and so operating margins were swamped and ADSK had to book a loss. Are investors risking a repeat if another recession should take hold? In a word, no. As far as Autodesk is concerned, this time really is different.This Time Around1) Happier Customers - Several months before the bottom fell out of the market customers were telegraphing their weaker balance sheets. Autodesk's subscription renewal rates dipped, multi-year renewals disappeared, and business in the U.S. market slowed down. Customers apparently did everything but scream ""recession!"" at Autodesk's sales staff.Given that history, management has been busy looking out for similar signs of an impending collapse in demand and has found nothing.There may be a lot riding on the word ""yet"" in that quote from the company's last conference call. But not only are sales failing to register any portentous weakness, Autodesk's renewal rates are actually at a record high, with multi-year renewals and attachment rates rising too. If customers are supposedly feeling another pinch, someone should tell them about it. 2) A Stronger Cost Posture - Autodesk went through several rounds of restructuring in response to the previous dip in demand and is now operating from a leaner cost position. About 50 leased facilities and 1,300 salaries were removed from Autodesk's books in FY's 2010 and 2009, significantly reducing expenses as a percentage of revenues. So if another demand dip does hit, Autodesk will have more flexibility in its costs and should find it easier to maintain margins.3) A More Stable Revenue Base - The company has made progress at improving the quality of its revenue base in the years since the recession. By developing and selling suite packages over one-off solutions and by expanding its sales footprint to compete for large enterprise clients, Autodesk has strengthened the diversity and stability of its customer base. So, any new demand shock shouldn't impact revenues nearly as negatively as before.Of course, if another global slowdown comes, Autodesk would not be immune from the fallout. But with greater operating efficiency, record customer engagement, and a stronger revenue base, the company is well positioned to protect margins and market share. And what if a recession doesn't come? I can think of three reasons Autodesk's future could see expanding margins and greater market share (see above).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

As per the Zacks Consensus,  Autodesk is estimated to earn revenues of $522.0 million.GAAP EPS is expected in the range of 21 cents to 24 cents. Non-GAAP EPS  is expected in the 34 cents to 37 cents range for the quarter. The  Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at 31 cents per share for  the first quarter of 2012, below the guided range.For fiscal 2012, Autodesk expects revenue to increase 10.0% year over  year. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to increase 200 basis points  on a year-over-year basis. However, the company did not provide any EPS  guidance for the full year. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is  pegged at $1.40 per share for fiscal 2012.The outlook provided by the company includes the impact of two  acquisitions (Scaleform Corp and Blue Ridge Numerics), which were closed  during the first quarter of 2012. However, the Blue Ridge Numerics  acquisition is not expected to impact first quarter results, so the  guidance remains unchanged following the announcement.Estimate Revision TrendFor the current quarter, out of the seven analysts covering the stock,  only one analyst raised estimates while none moved in the opposite  direction over the last thirty days.For fiscal 2012, three analysts raised their estimates in the last  thirty days, one of which was made in the last seven days. Hence, the  EPS estimate inched up from $1.39 to $1.40.The analysts believe that the company is well positioned to benefit  from an improving macro environment and fundamental improvements in the  business, which is evident from a recovery in new license sales that  would occur in conjunction with global recovery.The analysts also believe Autodesk is gaining market share and its  presence in the emerging markets will drive top-line and bottom-line  growth going forward.ConclusionAutodesk posted a positive average earnings surprise of 43.75% in the  trailing four quarters, implying that the company either beat or was in  line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate over the same period. The company  is also expected to post another positive surprise in the next quarter.In our view, the companyâs improvements and innovations in 3D design  technology and product portfolio provides Autodesk a competitive edge.  These innovations enable Autodesk to stay ahead of competitors like Adobe Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Parametric Technology Corp. (PMTC) and Avid Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:AVID).Over the long term, we remain optimistic on the stock and have an  Outperform recommendation, given positives such as Autodeskâs operating  margin leverage and strong revenues, stability in its end markets, the  increased demand for 3D products, expanding market share, a diversified  product pipeline, cost control and strategic acquisitions. However,  foreign exchange fluctuations remain a headwind.Currently, Autodesk has a Zacks #2 Rank, which translates into a short-term (1-3 months) Buy rating."

(ADSK) will release its third quarter fiscal 2011 results on November 18, 2010.Second Quarter Highlights On August 12, Autodeskâs second quarter 2011 earnings per share (NYSEARCA:EPS)  of 30 cents jumped 100.0% year over year from 15 cents and were well  ahead of the company's guidance of 19 cents to 22 cents per share. EPS  also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 20 cents, posting a surprise  of 50.0%.Earnings exclude one-time charges but include stock-based compensation  expense. Earnings were driven by higher revenues, growth in  international markets and impressive cost controls.Total revenue of $472.8 million was up 14.0% year over year from $414.9  million, attributable mainly to a strong global end market demand. This  was well ahead of both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $457.0 million  and the company's guidance of $445.0 million to $460.0 million. The  year-over-year growth was primarily driven by a continued improvement in  the demand environment, favorable foreign exchange and strong  international revenue growth.Guidance During the second quarter conference call, management provided third  quarter guidance. For the third quarter, management expects revenues  between $450.0 million and $475.0 million, in line with the Street  expectation of $463.8 million.Excluding 4 cents per share for the amortization of acquisition-related  intangibles but including 6 cents per share related to stock-based  compensation expense, EPS is expected to be in the range of 22 cents to  27 cents. The effective tax rate is expected to be 27%.For full year 2011, management did not provide any specific guidance  but expects the fourth quarter 2011 to be the strongest. Given the  strong first half fiscal 2011 results, management expects increased  revenues and higher operating margins in full year 2011. The non-GAAP  operating margin for 2011 is expected to increase by approximately 400  to 450 basis points (bps) in 2011, compared with the previous  expectation for an increase of 300 bps.Estimate RevisionFor the third quarter of 2011, the earnings revision trend remains  considerably positive. Of the 9 analysts providing estimates, 2 analysts  revised their estimates upward for the third quarter of 2011 over the  last 30 days. For fiscal year 2011, 2 analysts raised their EPS  projections in the same period. There were no downward revisions.In accordance with the overall trend of estimate revisions for  Autodesk, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter 2011  remained unchanged at 25 cents per share in the last 30 days. However,  it is a 66.7% improvement over last year's EPS of 15 cents. The Zacks  Consensus Estimate for the full year advanced 1 cent to $1.03 per share  in the last 30 days.Our TakeThe company will benefit from an increased demand for 3D products,  expanding market share, a diversified product pipeline, cost-cutting  initiatives, margin expansion and liquidity. Moreover, Autodesk  continues to benefit from growth in new accounts and subscription and  increasing penetration in emerging markets.We remain positive on the stock, given its strong revenues and  operating performance, improving European business and growing key  metrics.However, foreign exchange headwinds and intense competition from Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Avid Technology Inc. (AVID) remain a concern.Autodesk has posted an average positive surprise of 42.5% in the last  four quarters, implying that the company beat the Zacks Consensus  Estimate by an average of 42.5%.  With improving numbers and the absence  of any downward revision in analystsâ estimates, the current Zacks #2  Rank indicates a short-term Buy rating.We expect the company to post upbeat third quarter 2011 results and  therefore maintain our Neutral recommendation on Autodesk over the long  term."

For me, these shares are now at over-bought conditions, and perhaps now is not the time to get greedy. I agree that it is hard to argue with a share price that seems like it can only keep going up, but I believe that these shares should be sold while investors hold cash for some time.Autodesk is set to release earnings next week. The consensus estimate is about 27 cents per share for the quarter. Remember, ADSK often beats these estimates. It is noteworthy that annual estimates appear to be slowing. Perhaps it is time to take profits and take another look later.Valuation Analytics Table I suggest that if there is any miss or poor (inaccurate) guidance going forward, or a market correction, ADSK shares could experience a substantial loss from current levels. ADSK executives and large shareholders are actually buying shares at this time.Overall, ADSK has very good management and is a quality company, but the above valuation table is offering a notable warning (click to enlarge image): For a current (up to the minute) chart of ADSK, click here and scroll down.In summary, ADSK is a fine company. However, the current risk / reward ratio is quite unfavorableThe general market is currently over-valued, over-bought and is showing signs of deteriorations, especially in the area of breadth. Interest rates are on the rise and inflation is already a serious problem. This means that you must consider holding cash or perhaps taking bearish positions. I would not recommend taking bearish positions in any securities quite yet. My focus is ""investing wisely,"" e.g. taking advantage of the bull/bear cycles as they occur within the overall marketplace. Integrating modern fundamental analytics within these technical cycles means maintaining a process of the thorough and ongoing analysis of many companies and industry groups.

The company said that the sequential improvement was driven by improving end-market demand and continued competitive displacements.Sequentially, revenue and profitability improved due to increased revenues from commercial new seat licenses. Both domestic and international revenues increased. Further, the company witnessed increased revenue from each of its products and segments, including Manufacturing, AEC, and Platform Solutions and Emerging Business.Considering that results were slightly down year over year on lower licensing revenue, its margin improvement is commendable. Further, the company provided guidance for the first quarter of 2011 of both revenue and earnings in line with the Zacks Consensus.Operating PerformanceThe company reported net income on a non-GAAP basis of $69.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, down marginally by 0.6% from $70.3 million reported last year. Earnings per share (EPS) of 30 cents beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 15 cents, but were down by one cent from 31 cents reported in the year-ago period.However, earnings increased 3 cents from 27 cents a share sequentially. Earnings came in above the companyâs own guidance range of $19 cents to $24 cents a share.This reflects the companyâs strong execution in reducing operating expenses. Operating expenses in the quarter decreased 11% year over year, mainly due to lower marketing and sales expenses (-12.8%) as well as lower R&D costs (-10.7%). As a result, Operating margin came in at 19.5% in quarter, up from 15.9% reported in the year-ago quarter. Margin also improved from 18.4% in the previous quarter due to a lower revenue base.Total non-GAAP pre-tax spending (operating expenses plus cost of goods sold) for the full-year fiscal 2010 decreased by $312 million, or 18%, compared to fiscal 2009. This was above the companyâs initial target of a total pre-tax cost saving of $250 million.Gross margin came in at 92.1% versus 91.8% in the year-ago period and 89.2% in the previous quarter due to lower cost of sales.RevenueRevenues of $456.1 million were down 6.9% year over year, mainly due to a year-over-year decrease of 12.9% in License revenues, partially offset by an increase of 3.5% in Maintenance revenues. However, revenues were up 9.6% sequentially as both License and Maintenance revenues improved. Revenue came in above the companyâs own guidance range of $420 â $440 million.By geography, revenue from the Americas increased 3% sequentially but decreased 2% from the year-ago period. EMEA revenues increased 18% sequentially but decreased 15% year over year on a constant currency basis. Revenue from the Asia-Pacific increased 6% sequentially and 4% year over year on a constant currency basis. Revenues from emerging economies represented 16% of total revenue and increased 18% sequentially and 16% year over year on a constant currency basis.Moreover, revenues from 3D design solutions were down 25% from the year-ago period but were flat sequentially. Revenues from 2D horizontal and vertical products declined 37% year over year and decreased marginally from the last quarter. We are positive on Autodeskâs migration from 2D products to 3D products, which have a higher margin.Revenue from 3D model designs increased 10% sequentially but declined 7% year over year. Revenue from 2D horizontal and 2D vertical products increased 13% sequentially but decreased 8% year over year. Combined revenue from AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT products increased 9% sequentially but decreased 9% from the year-ago period.Although the company has a strong market position in the ""mainstream"" CAD market, it faces competition from Dassault Systemes. Moreover, the company competes against Adobe Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Avid Technology (NASDAQ:AVID), Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI).Balance Sheet and Cash FlowAutodesk has a strong balance sheet with cash, investments and securities totaling $1.1 billion or $4.92 per share at the end of quarter and no long-term debt. Cash flow from operations was $126 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of 169% sequentially and 45% compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009.Guidance For the first quarter, Autodesk expects revenue to be in the range of $420 â $440 million. Earnings on a non-GAAP basis are expected to be in the range of 18 cents to 23 cents a share. The effective tax rate is expected to be 27%, an increase from fiscal 2010, primarily due to the expiration of the R&D tax credit.The company did not provide revenue and EPS guidance for the full fiscal year 2011. However, the company expects the GAAP operating margin to increase significantly from fiscal 2010 level. The company anticipates modest improvement in the non-GAAP operating margin for full year fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010.As the company witnesses stabilization in end-market demand, we expect recovery in fiscal 2011. Moreover, the company should be a major beneficiary of the global economic recovery and the rapidly improving IT spending environment.

172186,21568,2009-11-09T07:45:51-05:00,,"By Michael KanellosHow do you count carbon?Although various governments have already erected carbon accounting and abatement systems, the issue remains unsettled. The easiest plan to administer is a carbon tax tied to the fossil fuels consumed directly by an individual or company. Politically, however, taxes have proven a difficult sell. Cap-and-trade systems, meanwhile, can lead to vague credits with amorphous values.Manufacturers have also complained that they get saddled disproportionately with the burdens in carbon schemes, while activists have complained that carbon accounting, normalized for revenue, can mask increases in emissions. On the other hand, companies have complained that carbon accounting, if not properly created, can penalize growth. But what about in terms of economic importance? On that scale, ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) might be the greenest company on the planet.Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), the design software giant, has decided to step into the breach. It has created its own carbon accounting methodology â the Corporate Finance Approach to Climate-Stabilizing Targets [C-FACT] â that considers carbon emissions (and increases in carbon emissions) adjusted against the ""value"" or change in value produced by the company.What is value? Gross profit, or revenue generated minus costs, according to Emma Stewart, senior program lead of the Autodesk Sustainability Initiative.The initial reaction is to see this as a scheme that favors software companies, which tend to have high gross profits and low carbon emissions. But where you begin is not the important part, she stated. The issue is how a company can improve its emissions from a baseline while accommodating growth and increases in profit.The system also accommodates short-term deviations, forecasting and cost-saving measures.C-FACT grew out of a company-wide effort to reduce carbon emissions. Autodesk itself does not generate much in the way of carbon emissions directly. Still, the company's output of greenhouse emissions increased from fiscal 2008 to 2009. The increase, though, also coincided with a growth surge.How did it fare in 2009? The company generated 83,073 tons of greenhouse gases and reported $2.1 billion in gross profit in fiscal 2009, leaving it with 0.04 kilograms per dollar.Autodesk is now in the process of discussing C-FACT with various organizations and standards bodies.As part of its overall effort, Autodesk has imposed fairly high carbon emissions standards on itself. The company wants to reduce emissions by 85 percent and the accounting will include ""an unusually high level of indirect emissions,"" Stewart said. Autodesk, for instance, will include carbon emissions generated by customers flying to its conferences, not just the carbon consumed by its own executives to get to the same event.""We want to err on the side of over-accounting,"" she said.The company will also continue to tinker with its tools to reduce emissions. In some ways, most of Autodesk's emissions are twice removed. It emits relatively low amounts of emissions directly and, unlike Samsung or Sony, Autodesk does not sell products that get plugged into walls. They are software applications that sit on other things plugged into walls.""Our biggest impact comes through influence and building functionality into tools,"" Stewart said."

Revenue from the Asia Pacific decreased 7% sequentially and 33% year over year on a constant currency basis.Revenues from emerging economies represented 15% of total revenue and decreased 3% sequentially and 45% year over year on a constant currency basis.  Moreover, revenues from 3D design solutions were down 25% from the year-ago period but were flat sequentially. Revenues from 2D horizontal and vertical products declined 37% year over year and decreased marginally from the last quarter. We are positive on Autodeskâs migration from 2D products to 3D products, which have a higher margin.  Combined revenue from AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT declined 39% year over year. Although the company has a strong market position in the ""mainstream"" CAD market, it faces competition from Dassault Systemes (DSY.PA). Moreover, the company competes against Adobe Systems Inc. (ADBE - Analyst Report), Apple Inc. (AAPL - Analyst Report), A-id Technology â¨(AVID - Snapshot Report), Sony (SNE - Analyst Report) and Thomson Reuters (TRI - Analyst Report).  Autodesk has a strong balance sheet with cash, investments and securities totaling $1.05 billion at the end of quarter and no long-term debt. Mixed Guidance The forecast for the fourth quarter of 2010 were mixed, with earnings below Consensus expectations and revenues in-line. The company provided guidance for fiscal 2010 of both revenue and earnings in line with the Consensus. For the fourth quarter, Autodesk expects revenue to be in the range of $420 â $440 million. Earnings on a non-GAAP basis is expected to be in the range of 19 cents to 24 cents a share, excluding 6 cents related to stock-based compensation expense and 6 cents for amortization of acquisition related intangibles.  Net revenue for fiscal 2010 is expected to be in the range of $1.68 â $1.7 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) are expected to be in the range of 88 cents to 93 cents a share. The company anticipates total non-GAAP pre-tax spending (operating expenses plus cost of goods sold) for fiscal 2010 to range between $1.42 and $1.43 billion. The company said that it is on track to deliver more than $300 million in pre-tax cost savings in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. For the first quarter and full fiscal year 2011, the company did not provide revenue and EPS guidance. However, the company expects GAAP operating margin to increase year over-year in the first quarter of fiscal 2011, due to significant impairment charges. Non-GAAP operating margin in the first quarter is anticipated to be flat to slightly down compared to the year-ago period due to seasonality and increased costs.  GAAP operating margin for the full year fiscal 2011 is expected to increase. The company anticipates modest improvement in non-GAAP operating margin for full year fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010."
142156,22829,2009-06-09T07:16:54-04:00,,"by Thomas RasmussenComing off a dealmaking binge fueled by cheap credit, private equity (PE) shops have been investing much more soberly since the debt market collapsed late last summer. Highly leveraged multibillion-dollar buyouts have gone the way of  collateralized derivatives. As financing has become much more expensive, PE shops have in turn become more price sensitive. Deals are much smaller and generally done with equity these days. The heyday of the PE buyout boom saw dollars spent on deals balloon from $56bn in 2005 to $98bn in 2006 before peaking at $118bn in 2007. Last year saw a drastic ânormalization,â with disclosed spending by PE firms falling three-quarters to just $26bn. Spending on buyouts has plummeted this year, with just $3bn worth of deals through the first five months of 2009.Even as the aggregate value of LBOs has declined sharply, we would note that the volume remains steady. (The 90 PE deals announced so far this year is roughly in line with the totals for the same period in three of the past four years.) We might suggest that this indicates a return to basics for PE firms. Instead of bidding against each other in multibillion-dollar takeouts of smoothly running public companies, buyout firms are returning to more traditional targets: unloved, overlooked public companies as well as underperforming divisions of companies.In terms of recent take-privates, we would point to Thoma Bravoâs pending $114m acquisition of Entrust, which valued the company at less than 1x sales. And looking at divestitures, we would highlight the recent buyout and subsequent sale of Autodeskâs (NASDAQ:ADSK) struggling location-services business. Hale Capital Partners acquired the assets in February for a very small down payment and what we understand was a $10m backstop in case things went awry. New York City-based Hale Capital put the acquired property through a pretty serious restructuring. (The moves got the division running at what we understand was an EBITDA run-rate of $5m on approximately $20m in trailing sales.) Hale then sold the assets for $25m in cash and stock in mid-May to Telecommunications Systems following a competitive bidding process. Through the terms of the divestiture, Autodesk also had a small windfall in the sale of its former unit, pocketing an estimated $5m.PE Spending Falls of a Cliff"

Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis increased 58.8% year over year to 29 cents. This was well ahead of the conservative Zacks Consensus Estimate of 16 cents and beat the high end of the company's guidance between 18 cents and 23 cents, primarily based on strong year-over-year revenue growth in international markets and recovery in corporate spending.The company experienced strong year-over-year growth in maintenance billings and commercial new licenses in the first quarter, which along with the continued focus on cost control led to significant improvement in operating profits.First quarter operating expense was $359.2 million, up from $349.0 million in the year-ago period. Consequently, the operating income on a non-GAAP basis was $85.1 million, up 21.0% year over year from $70.3 million. Operating margin was 17.9% in the first quarter versus 16.5% in the year-ago period. The increase was primarily driven by higher revenue growth.RevenueFirst-quarter revenue was $474.6 million, up 11.5% year over year from $425.8 million. Favorable foreign exchange contributed $21.0 million in the quarter. This was well ahead of both the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $437.0 million and the high end of the company's guidance ($420.0 - $440.0 million). The year-over-year growth was primarily driven by continued improvement in the demand environment and strong international revenue growth.License and other revenue increased 14.8% year over year to $280.0 million. Revenue from commercial new licenses increased 24.0% from the first quarter last year.Maintenance revenue increased 7.1% year over year to $195.0 million in the first quarter 2011.First quarter revenue includes a one-time benefit of $15.0 million that resulted from a change in the upgrade pricing for subscription customers, which also pulled in other customers onto the subscription platform. Management believes this to be a one-time item and anticipates a sequential decline in upgrade revenue in the second quarter. Total upgrade revenue in the first quarter was $51.0 million, up 18.0% from the year-ago period.Revenue by Geography - The company's international businesses posted strong revenue growth in the quarter. EMEA revenue increased 19.0% year over year and 10.0% on a constant currency basis to $199.0 million. This region generated the majority of upgrade revenue in the quarter.Asia Pacific revenue increased 21.0% year over year and 15.0% on a constant currency basis to $115.0 million.Revenue from emerging economies represented 14.0% of total revenue in the quarter and increased 16.0% year over year and 13.0% on a constant currency basis to $68.0 million.The Americas revenue decreased 1.0% year over year to $161.0 million, reflecting difficult comps compared to the year-ago period.Revenue by Product Type â First quarter model-based design products (29.0% of total revenue) increased 13.0% year over year.Horizontal Design products and Vertical design products increased 20.0% and 8.0% year over year, respectively. Combined revenue from these two segments was $240.0 million, up 17.0% compared to the first quarter of 2010.Revenue by Business Segment â Revenue from Platform Solutions and Emerging Business segment increased 18.0% year over year to $184.0 million. Both AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT reported strong growth driven primarily by upgrades.Architecture, Engineering and Construction revenue increased 7.0% year over year to $137.0 million, driven by strong sales from the Revit family of products and AutoCAD Architecture.Manufacturing revenue increased 15.0% year over year to $108.0 million, primarily attributable to a 21.0% increase in revenue from the Inventor family of products.Media and Entertainment revenue decreased 4.0% year-over-year to $46.0 million, due to a 25.0% decline in revenue from creative finishing, partially offset by a 10.0% increase in revenue from animation products.In the first quarter, the company launched the 2011 portfolio of design software products. These are high end products with powerful new features for 3D design, visualization and simulation for engineers, architects and other creative professionals. The new user interface makes it easier for the customers to navigate between multiple Autodesk products.The company launched the Sketch Book Pro application for the iPad. The company also launched AutoCAD Freestyle and Autodesk Home Styler during the quarter.Balance Sheet and Cash FlowTotal cash and investments at the end of the first quarter increased to $1.24 billion from $966.0 million in the year-ago period. Cash Flow from operating activities of $139.1 million was significantly higher on a year-over-year basis from $27.2 million.GuidanceFor the second quarter, management expects revenue between $435.0 and $460.0 million. Diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis is expected in the range of $0.23-$0.28 and, on a GAAP basis, in the range of $0.12 to $0.17. The effective tax rate is expected to be 27% and excludes any benefit from the R&D tax credit.For full year 2011, management did not provide any particular guidance. However, they expect GAAP operating margin to increase significantly compared to 2010. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to increase by approximately 300 bps in 2011.Management remains somewhat cautious due to de-valuation of the euro and the general instability of the European economy. However, they expect a strong global demand environment going forward.We believe a weak European economy will temper Autodesk's growth over the coming period. With around 40% of first quarter revenue coming from the region, any softness in Europe would have a significant negative impact. Moreover, the company can also face some foreign exchange headwind as it is not fully hedged.Although Autodesk has a strong market position in the ""mainstream"" CAD market, it faces competition from Dassault Systems. Moreover, the company competes against Adobe Systems Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Avid Technology (NASDAQ:AVID), Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Thomson Reuters (NYSE:TRI)."

(NASDAQ:ADSK) has been no exception.  With the severe downturn that impacted Autodesk customers, the revenue decline has been expectedly sharp.[ charts]  Revenue Decline Has Been Steep...  Source: Gridstone Research  Clearly customers are in no mood to spend money on adding additional seats of Autodesk products as their R&D headcounts would have reduced substantially.  Sequential Decline In New Seat (License) Revenue Has Been The Culprit   Source: Gridstone Research  While many Tech sector companies have reported signs of stabilization, Autodesk has also struck a cautiously optimistic tone in its latest earnings call. Note CEO Carl Bass's comments about demand stabilization below:Relative to what we experienced late last year and early this year, our business was less volatile as we exited the second quarter. The environment is still challenging but it feels like global demand for our products is showing signs of stabilizing.But the question remains if license revenue will ever come back to the highs of 2008. Clearly the main driver for increased seat revenue would be more employee additions in the Auto and E&C segments and when that would happen is still unclear. Alternatively, it probably would never reach the headcount figures of 2008 as the Auto industry has seen some rules re-written and looks set for a prolonged period of downsizing and cost-reductions. Keeping this in mind, Autodesk had embarked on a cost-reduction program in the Jan 09 quarter itself.    Source: Gridstone ResearchThough ongoing Opex (excl. one-off expenses/charges) has been curtailed to ~$300-320M per quarter rate, Autodesk wants to achieve total expense reduction to the tune of $300M in FY10(FYE Jan10) compared to FY09.CEO's comments on OpEx Reduction in 2Q10 Earnings call: However this itself looks insufficient compared to the rate at which gross profits are fallingSource: Gridstone ResearchOn a YOY basis, gross profits have either grown at a lesser pace or declined at a higher rate than OpEx (non-Gaap) in all of the last seven quarters. Clearly this trend cannot continue as OpEx spends need to be drastically re-adjusted to the revised revenue outlook for FY10/11. If we assume that quarterly revenues will be in the $400-450 million range over the next few quarters, total cost and expenses(Cost of Revenue+OpEx) would need to be well below that at around $320-330M. We need to remember that other non-cash costs ($50-60M per quarter) - some one-time like restructuring and some continuing charges like D&A would anyway eat into a portion of the remaining profits too and thus ADSK has no scope for having an expense rate above the $320-330M quarterly rateTotal Expenses Need To Be Maintained At Jun09 Quarte Levels Till Demand Picks Up Source: Gridstone ResearchThe revenue outlook that Autodesk has provided for the Oct 09 quarter is bleak and this strengthens the case for strict control of OpEx continuing at Autodesk. The outlook suggests that Autodesk does not expect revenue declines to ease on a YOY basis in the Oct 09 quarter too.Steep Revenue Declines To Continue Source: Gridstone ResearchAutodesk revenues, both new seats and maintenance revenues, are highly co-related to more R&D heads being employed at its customers. Customers have probably let maintenance contracts for many seats lapse as the seats themselves have become redundant. So this double whammy of significantly lesser seat additions and customers purging some 'existing' seats(which means lesser maintenance revenue) has re-set the revenue expectations for Autodesk, a reality the mangement is reconciled too:CEO's comments on Revenue Expectations Being Reset in 2Q10 Earnings call:To sum-up, Autodesk is still not out of the woods by any measure and they would do well to curb costs at planned levels (or even more) so that any incremental revenue from current levels will go straight to the bottom line. However, with no visibility as to when this incremental revenue would start flowing in, the ~33% run-up in Autodesk's stock price YTD (2009) to $25.38 (Aug 13 '09 close price) seems too early and too fast.Disclosure: No Positions"
77721,20521,2008-05-18T05:57:30-04:00,,"Last month, I wrote about how it was a good time to buy Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK). The stock was trading at $33 then and today post the announcement of its Q1 results is trading at $41 levels. A good 25% return in a month.   The company reported revenues of $598.8 million, beating market expectations of $592 million and recording a 18% growth over the previous year Q1. EPS for the quarter stood at $0.50 compared to the marketâs expectations of $0.44 and growing by 13.6% over the year. It continues to do well in the emerging markets. Due to the economic pressures in America, revenue grew by 4% to $191 million. EMEA revenue was $259 million, an increase of 25% and Asia-Pacific revenue was $149 million, an increase of 27%. Segment-wise, License revenue grew by 13% to $432 million, and subscription revenue grew by 33% to $167 million. Division-wise, platform solutions and emerging business grew by 11% to $278 million, manufacturing solutions grew by 26% to $119 million, AEC Solutions grew by 29% to $129 million and the Media and entertainment segment grew by 14% to $67 million. Autodesk continued its acquisition spree by announcing the intent to acquire Moldflow Corporation for $297 million. Moldflow is a leading provider of simulation software used to optimize the design of injection molded plastic parts in molds. The transaction will enable a fully digital development process for plastic injection part and mold design. The company expects the acquisition to add $30 million in revenue for the year 2009. For Q2, the company projected revenue of $600 - $610 million with EPS of $0.52 - $0.54. For the year 2009, Autodesk reaffirmed its outlook of revenue of $2.45-$2.50 billion, representing a growth of 13% to 15%. The company expects non-GAAP EPS of $2.20-$2.30 for the year. The company continued with its good performance on 2D solutions recording a growth of 14%. Revenue from 3D solutions also increased by an impressive 37% to $146 million, contributing 24% of its total revenue. The latter continues to be one of the key drivers of Autodeskâs growth, since the world of 2D design moving to 3D design is a big trend working in Autodeskâs favor. 2D growth is also good, because thatâs the prospect base for the 3D business. With its results, I maintain my recommendation of buy on Autodesk. There will continue to be momentum in the 3D business, as large chunks of older 2D designers retire, and younger designers feel less resistance to working in 3D. Also, one of my key factors for confidence in Autodeskâs execution ability is that it has handled succession planning very well, unlike many other companies I cover. Carl Bass was groomed for the top job over many years by Carol Bartz, now Chairman, and he is doing an excellent job shepherding the company. The Mechanical CAD market also does not face the dynamics of price erosion that plagues its cousin, the EDA industry. In fact, yes, the high-end MCAD market is facing price-erosion due to the increasing capabilities of mid-range tools, but Autodesk, in fact, is the biggest beneficiary of this movement. (I have marketed MCAD, and am intimately familiar with the market dynamics.) So, all in all, I am comfortable saying that I plan to hold on to my Autodesk stock for the long term.

I had recommended Buy on the stock when it announced Q4 results last year, maintained this recommendation after the Q108 announcement, and again reiterate my view following the Q2 results announced at the end of last week (see earnings call transcript). With revenues of $620 million, Autodesk beat the marketâs expectations of $606 million and reported an 18% increase over the year. EPS grew 27% to $0.56, also beating the Streetâs view of $0.52.By segment, License revenue grew 12% to $440 million and Maintenance revenue from subscriptions grew 27%.By division, Platform Solutions and Emerging Business grew 12% to $270 million, Manufacturing Solutions grew 32% to $131 million, AEC Solutions grew 21% to $144 million and Media and Entertainment grew 12% to $69 million.Revenue from 2D vertical products grew 16% over the year. 3D solutions grew an impressive 31% and contributed 27% to overall revenue.Autodeskâs strength continues to remain emerging markets. Four percent growth in the Americas was primarily driven by strong growth in Canada and Latin America, with a relatively stable US market. EMEA revenue of $267 million was a 31% increase over the year, and Asia-Pacific brought in the balance of $115 million, an increase of 18% over the year.The company credited this strong growth in emerging markets to the infrastructure build-out in China and the Middle East, along with the âincreased awareness around digital prototyping.âThey gave a revenue outlook of $625-$635 million for Q3 with EPS of $0.54-$0.56. For Q4, they expect revenues to be $660-$680 million with EPS of $0.64-$0.68. That will take annual revenues to $2.5-$2.53 billion, a 15-16% increase over the year, with EPS of $2.24-$2.30.Last quarter Autodesk announced their intention to acquire Moldflow, a developer of simulation software for the plastics injection molding industry, and they completed that acquisition this quarter. Moldflowâs contribution of over $7 million in revenues for the quarter was higher than the Streetâs expectations.There were four smaller acquisitions during the quarter: REALVIZ, which specializes in image-based content creation software;Â Kynogon,Â whichÂ supplies ofÂ IA technology to the gaming industry; Square One Research, which creates environmental design tools; and Green Building Studio, a web-based energy analysis service for designers and architects.Â  Autodesk expects these companiesâ technologies to help advance their base of âcurrent solutions for visualization, simulation, and analysis, as well as technology used to create energy-efficient buildings.âThe market was happy with the performance and the stock rose 12% to $38.37 after the results announcement."

ADSK also upped revenue guidance as they expect revenue to come in between $625 - $635 million, up from $623.1 expected by analysts.Even though ADSK faces increased risk from their exposure to cyclical spending and competition, ADSKâs size (market cap: $8.593B) and tough market position is helping the company tread through the US economic slowdown. Revenue growth in 3D technology solutions increased revenue by 36% and favorable foreign exchange rates boosted revenue growth by about 7%.Since 2004, net revenue increased at a compounded annual growth rate of about 23%. Operating income increased 21% so far in 2008 as compared to 11% in 2004 (income as a percentage of total revenues). In addition, gross margins increased 6% due to fixed expenses and better management of distribution networks.I believe that the larger customers of ADSK are conservative toward allocating capital to software purchases. In addition, the US slowdown, intense industry competition, and the vigorous pricing battle occurring between these software vendors will hurt ADSK. However, this is offset by ADSKâs rapid expansion into emerging markets such as China and India. This has led to 40% revenue growth for ADSK.For Q3, ADSK expects to earn $0.40 - $0.42 per share and excluding items, they expect to earn $0.54 - $0.56 per share on revenue ranging from $625 - $635 million. Currently, 20 analysts give recommendations on ADSK and currently there are 9 âBuyâ ratings, 10 âHoldâ ratings, and 1âSellâ rating. Even from 6 months until now, only 1 firm has issued a âSellâ rating on ADSK even though ADSK gapped down and traded in the $30-34 range, shot back up trading in the $37-42 range, and fell back down into a $32-$36 range. The stock is almost exactly back to where it was 6 months ago.On Friday, ADSK gapped up nearly 12% and maintained momentum throughout the day, trading nearly 13.4 million shares. The average daily volume is 3.66 million. The MACD and RSI both indicate a bullish trend divergent from price action. ADSK hit an intra-day high at the 200-day MA before giving back some gains.

72082,20521,2008-04-13T09:09:04-04:00,,"I have worked a lot with CAD businesses in their various forms, so I have a fair bit of visceral knowledge of the market. I own Autodesk stock, and have no intention of selling it anytime soon. With that backdrop, letâs look at its most recent financials and business metrics. Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), the leader in 3D Design automation, recently announced its Q4 results. With Q4 revenues of $599 million, it beat market expectations of $581 million, and grew 20% over the previous year Q4 revenue of $497 million. EPS for the quarter at $0.52 was marginally lower than market expectations of $0.54, and increased by 17% over the previous year. Segment-wise, license revenue grew by 18% to $446 million, and maintenance revenue from subscriptions grew by 25% to $153 million. Region-wise, American revenues showed a marginal increase of 2% to reach $206 million, EMEA revenue increased to $262 million recording an impressive 38% increase, and Asia Pacific revenues increased by 24% to $131 million. Emerging markets have been an area of focus for them, and the company's impressive results in the region are proof of its success. Division-wise, design solutions grew by 19% to $263 million, manufacturing solutions grew by 26% to $123 million, AEC Solutions grew by 22% to $137 million, and the Media and entertainment segment grew by 10% to $71 million. For the year, Autodesk crossed $2.2 billion in revenue, recording an impressive 22% increase over the previous year revenues. Autodesk also recorded a substantial double digit increase in the 2D solutions. Management believes that strong growth in 2D creates future opportunity and provides easy migration to 3D products and digital prototyping. It is interesting to see that the 2D market still has growth, but I guess that is at least partially due to uptake in the emerging markets. Autodeskâs 3D penetration in its customer base still remains under 15%, which means the 2D to 3D conversion opportunity is still spectacular. The company continues to focus on its project management platform Revit and making interoperable products. It completed three acquisitions last quarter â two technology companies and a provider of outsourced product development. The technology companies acquired include Robobat and Carmel Software. Both, Robobat, which was acquired for $42.5 million and Carmel Software, were acquired to help build up Autodeskâs suite of software for structural engineering analysis, design, steel and concrete detailing, and expand its portfolio of sustainable design solutions. The acquisition of Hanna Strategies will help the company expand its global engineering and software development initiatives as Hanna has its centers in China, India and Atlanta.  However, the company still has not acquired a web-based âcollaborative designâ partner. Recently the stock crashed to a new 52-week low of $29.58. It has gained ground since, and is currently trading above $33. This might still be a good price to pick up the stock, as I firmly believe in the company and its market. Over time, the gap between high-end and mid-range CAD has closed consistently, and Autodeskâs market opportunity continues to be robust."

On the heels of the Q2 guidance, PacCrest published a cautious note asserting that his channel checks at that time found U.K. resellers seeing Q2 sales flat with a year ago, a change from his prior check which found expectations for 20% growth. The firm also noted that the weakness had spread from the U.S. and U.K. to include Germany, and possibly India and Brazil.

However, longer term, Citigroup said that downside risks remain as the environment is fragile, macro concerns have worsened, and a combo of weaker Europe and a currency reversal could create headwinds for CY09. Baird expects Q2 to be in-line with guidance and said it is possible the stock could trade higher following the results. However, while a short-term relief rally is possible, Baird said the sustainability of any such move will require business trends to stabilize during 2H08 and 2009, something of which they are hopeful, but not assured, will occur. The big focus could be initial FY10/CY09 guidance. Guidance provided in June calls for Q3 EPS of 53c to 55c and revenue of $615M to $630M. Guidance is for FY09 EPS of $2.20 to $2.30 and revenue of $2.48B to $2.53B. Autodesk also remains without a CFO."
44931,20307,2007-08-20T03:28:08-04:00,,"Sentiment on Autodeskâs (NASDAQ:ADSK) fiscal second quarter earnings turned around Friday morning. Thursday night, the stock slipped after the company announced results, despite reporting numbers and guidance that beat the Street. In an interview with Tech Trader Daily, CFO Al Castino said the company was seeing no impact from the housing sectorâs woes, said the company was seeing across the board strength, with strong growth in particular in its 3D design products. Friday morning, the Street commentary was most bullish. Bear Stearns analyst Philip Alling raised his rating on the stock to Outperform from Peer Perform, noting that the company is showing strong results in getting its resellers to focus on selling 3D software. He set a $52 price target on the stock. â3D growth was strong with seat sales up 24 year-over-year and 3D revenue up 34% year-over-year despite concerns about disruption in the companyâs reseller network as a result of changes to the incentive structure,â Alling wrote in a research note. âWe believe that ADSK, after some turbulence, has stabilized the 3D growth trajectory.â Alling notes that the company raised full year guidance for the second quarter in a row; he says that this is âparticularly noteworthy given the tough environment elsewhere in the software design space as well as turmoil in the financial markets.â Meanwhile, skeptics on Autodesk seemed almost offended by the companyâs increased guidance given the uncertain economic outlook. Ross MacMillan, an analyst at Jefferies who has a Hold rating on the stock, wroteFriday that the increased outlook âeither exudes confidence or spells folly.â As of Friday, the Street was going with confidence rather than with folly. Autodesk closed Friday at $44.90. ADSK 1-yr chart"
35976,20171,2007-05-18T08:38:11-04:00,,"Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) reported record quarterly revenues of $509 million, an increase of 17 percent over the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The company, which makes engineering and architectural design software, is like all too many tech companies in that a probe into stock option practices means they donât know how much they actually earned. What is known about the results, however, looks pretty good, as analysts were only expecting $500 million in sales. Autodesk also raised estimates for the next two quarters and the full year to levels above the wall street consensus. Growth indicators look solid: Although I think Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) has more potential, Autodesk also appears reasonably valued. Its $9.7 billion enterprise value is backed by nearly $400 million in free cash flow, an amount that is nearly double the level of two years ago. After they complete their options review, this one could be a stock to watch. ADSK 1-yr chart:"
58126,20521,2007-12-21T06:55:29-05:00,,"In 2005 Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) was expanding 3D presence via acquisitions like Alias, leaving competition like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) in the dust. The story hasnât changed as far as 3D is concerned. The fact remains, a large part of the design world (mechanical, architectural, construction, animation, etc.) still designs in 2D, and Autodesk is one of the prime beneficiaries of the movement from 2D to 3D that has been steadily progressing throughout the world. Autodeskâs Q3 earnings ending September 30, 2007 totaled $538 million in revenue, an 18% YoY and a new record (and higher than analystsâ expectation of $536.1 million). Each of the companyâs continent bases contributed with the Americas producing $218 million (up 12% YoY), EMEA revenues were $203 million (up 27% YoY), and Asia-Pacific totaled $118 million (up 14% YoY). Similar to many tech companies today, emerging markets accounted for $92 million or 17% of the total revenue and increased by 37%. Operating expenses were $381 million GAAP and quarterly net income totaled $85 million (versus $52 million YoY). Unlike the prognostication of critics, Autodesk saw no slowdown due to the housing/credit crunch despite the company's presence in the architectural design and construction software segments. Its Q4 guidance expects revenue of $581.8 million. Adding to the value of its stock, Autodesk has a share buyback program to offset dilutions from employee stock programs, having purchased already 13 million shares and announcing a target of an additional repurchasing of 20 million more. With a current market cap of $11.6 million, Autodeskâs share price is currently just below $51/share and its 52-week high point. As noted earlier, Autodesk is still rounding up the 3D market with a planned purchase of Robobat, a privately held French company for about $42.5 million (originally $33 million in September 2006) in cash. This will allow Autodesk increased specialization in analysis, design, and steel and concrete design software. Adobe did offer a meager competition attempt when it produce Acrobat 3D in 2006, but it was akin to offering gold-plated trinkets on the street outside of Tiffanyâs jewelry store. While Autodesk continues to lead the CAD [computer-aided design] design market, Adobe ended up hoping to be Switzerland with its Acrobat 3D packaged aimed at everyone. I am reminded of Aesopâs Fable with the father and son losing their supply-laden donkey trying to please everyone equally well. In comparison, Autodesk continues to build its market share acquiring facets that improve its product line with a goal to continue controlling its target market of CAD engineers and designers. The current share price may be at premium currently, but the company is best of breed and has proven it improves shareholder value consistently. I noted the need for an online design collaboration strategy, but Autodesk has chosen to continue with its project management platforms Revit and Buzzsaw, without too much focus in this area yet. Nonetheless, the dynamics of the CAD market are quite interesting, and at this point, increasingly moving in Autodeskâs favor. Earlier, Autodesk entered and conquered the 2D and mid-range 3D markets, with limited competition from Solidworks, now part of Dassault (OTCPK:DASTY). Five years ago, when I was working on the think3 turnaround, Autodeskâs mid-range 3D product was quite a bit weaker. It has not only gained ground, but it is also starting to get to the point where it can compete with the very expensive high-end 3D products. In fact, PTCâs ProEngineer and Dassaultâs CATIA are potentially markets that are now within Autodeskâs realm of possibilities as those to conquer. Meanwhile, in the 2D to 3D conversion, Autodesk continues to be one of the two biggest players, along with Solidworks. Also, as is obvious frm the numbers, their emerging market growth has been excellent, and I fully expect this to continue to be so, as India and China design and build lots of products, houses, and films using their software. I like the company, its management (CEO Carl Bass has been around for a long time, and was groomed for the job by Carol Bartz, an industry luminary), the market dynamics, and as a result, am long on the stock."
44580,20454,2007-08-15T09:06:27-04:00,,"Other vendors in the segment experienced slowness this quarter (see PMTC and Dassault's SolidWorks segment) and MSCO believes ADSK may also be seeing pressure based on channel feedback hence our focus on sales inertia.
Last quarter's results indicated momentum in certain areas but full-year guidance left us wondering if it was on the optimistic side against the backdrop of some potentially weakening core metrics. ADSK has been able to leverage subscriptions and 3D to drive overall revenue growth but declining new seat adds, slowing subscription penetration and sluggish deferred revenue growth may point to signs of a storm ahead.
Notablecalls: I think this call is actionable from a trading perspective. Recall that PMTC reported solid Q1 results and provided strong guidance only to disappoint investors couple of months later. While admittedly PMTC's negative pre-announcement was due to weak execution, one can't help to wonder if it was the only reason. Maybe the CAD market is indeed slowing? Like ADSK, PMTC's top line growth had been decelerating over the last year.
Also, recents checks done by other firms show that some large Autodesk resellers have indicated that the loss of volume discounts on AutoCAD has hurt their business. Some mentioned that they tried to put more sales effort behind 3D products, but that the market for 3D is simply going to develop and grow at its own pace. In other words, changing incentive compensation and changed sales force behavior could not alter the pace of 3D adoption beyond its own chosen speed.
I know there's a fair chance ADSK will prove the doubters wrong but given the nervous shoot-first-ask-questions-later type of market we are in, I think ADSK stock will take a hit today."
44831,20307,2007-08-17T04:34:12-04:00,,"Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is not seeing any impact on its results from the slowdown in the residential housing market, CFO Al Castino said in an interview Thursday afternoon with Tech Trader Daily. Autodesk Thursday reported fiscal second quarter results that were slightly ahead of expectations, and provided guidance that was slightly above the Street consensus for the third quarter and full year.  Castino says âthe business is doing really well,â with sales of 3-D design products up 34% year over year, and 2D products up 22%. He says the company saw good growth across all geographies, with particular strength in emerging markets, where sales grew 37%. Castino notes that, while the company does provide software to the commercial construction business, it has âalmost no connection with home construction.â He says its construction segment is seeing healthy business, with âno impactâ from the recent slowdown in home sales and the crisis in the mortgage market. He says Autodeskâs business tends to be affected less by any particular economic metric than it is by product cycles and product transitions. Signs Castino: âItâs amazing how few people understand our business.â Castino made an interesting comment on an apparent conflict between the companyâs strong numbers and analysts who conducted âchannel checksâ which found demand to be weak. Castino thinks the channel checks some of the analysts conduct is flawed; he says they tend to talk to just a handful of the companyâs 2,000-plus resellers, and that âweaker resellers who want to grumble are the ones who talk to the analysts.â He also says that some third-party research firms are apparently paying resellers to provide them with interviews; stronger resellers, he says, are too busy serving customers to participate. Castino says he hadnât heard of resellers being paid for interviews until the current quarter. Castino concedes that Autodesk would suffer were the economy to fall into a deep downturn; no surprise there. But heâs not seeing any hints of that kind of downturn at the moment, and contends most of the troubles now afflicting the market are concentrated in financial companies and residential real estate, where Autodesk has no significant presence.

âResellers indicate strong sales momentum in Autodeskâs current [April] quarter and do not see an overall economy-related slowdown over the next several quarters,â Zorovic wrote in a research note. âWe are increasingly comfortable the company may deliver top-line performance at the high end of guidance for this quarter, with the momentum carrying over into subsequent quarters.â
Zorovic says one driver for the company is the continuing move to 3-D design tools from 2-D, âa theme we find sustainable for a longer period of time.â He notes that the shares have slipped in recent weeks on economic concerns; the stock through Monday night was down 2% year-to-date.
The Goldman analyst sees 12% compounded growth for Autodesk over the next five years at the top line, with expanding margins allow 19% compounded growth in EPS. Concludes Zorovic: âAutodesk, in our opinion, provides investors with a compelling growth story.â

This, for me, raises the question: Where does Design Collaboration sit in the enterprise workflow?
In my recent Extended Enterprise series I have been addressing the challenges of Collaboration across Extranet/Extraprise. 
I also wrote a previous article on the CAD PLM market, indicating that the divorce of IBM and Dassault, the turnaround at PTC, the sale of UGS to Siemens are industry events that will create an opportunity for movement and rearrangement.
Add to this the fact that SAP (NYSE:SAP) has been trying to enter the PLM space, and has tied up with Adobe to provide the web collaboration functionality, and we have yet another contributor to change.
CAD and PLM have been fairly stodgy industries that donât have major shifts. It seems like now is one such rare time in history when shifts might occur. The trend driving this need for movement is the Extended Enterprise, and I am curious to hear how Carl Bass interprets it."
107577,20521,2008-11-24T09:53:29-05:00,,"Leading 2D and 3D design software maker Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) announced its Q3 results last Thursday. The stock might have taken a beating Thursday to close at $16.82 and is now hovering around $13.17, but the companyâs performance makes me remain bullish on it.Autodesk reported quarterly revenue of $607 million, representing growth of 13% over the year, and exceeded the marketâs expectations of $604 million. EPS for the quarter of $0.56 was sequentially flat, but grew by 14% over the year. The Street was looking for EPS of $0.53.Revenue from the Americas revenues declined by 1% over the year, and there was weakness some EMEA areas as well. Yet, revenue from EMEA grew 27% and from Asia Pacific grew by 12%. Emerging markets continued to report strong growth of 25% and represented a 19% contribution to total revenue.By division, platform solutions and emerging business grew by 11% to $269 million, manufacturing solutions grew by 22% to $124 million, AEC solutions grew by 8% to $134 million and the media and entertainment segment grew by 9% to $73 million.The 2D solutions segment declined 6%, primarily due to weak global sales of AutoCAD Architecture. Revenue from 3D solutions grew by 16% to $151 million, contributing 27% of total revenue.Poor economic conditions have negatively affected Autodeskâs business environment. Many of its clients are unable to secure credit financing due to tighter credit restrictions. Budgets for construction and media and entertainment projects of all sizes are either deferred or canceled. While the companyâs larger manufacturing units are suffering from the slowdown of end user demand, the SME units are dealing with financing restrictions and thus cutting back on their investments. Autodesk has responded to these changes in the credit market by offering small rebates on LT (drafting and detailing software) and AutoCAD and setting up a 0% interest, deferred payment financing program for US and Canadian customers.In terms of whether customers were buying fewer products and upgrading less frequently or just buying lower-cost products, CEO Carl Bass said on the results call, âWe certainly havenât seen people choosing different products [...] 3D products, the more sophisticated, complex products actually did quite well. I think what we are seeing is the people [who] are choosing to buy new tools are looking for the best tools to make them most competitive. We are not really seeing a movement within our range towards lower-priced productsâ.For the fourth quarter, the company guided for revenue of $525 to $550 million and GAAP EPS of $0.13 to $0.19. Autodesk plans to continue and expand cost reduction measures taken in the previous quarter, such as a hiring freeze and cuts in discretionary spending.As mentioned above, the stock is trading around $13.17 with a market cap of about $2.83 billion.

26857,20164,2007-02-13T05:21:07-05:00,,"Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) has reported impressive revenue and earnings growth over a multi-year period. However, their financial model is on the cusp of a transition that will augur in a period where revenue growth is less consistent and less certain.  
ADSK has used ingenious operating strategies and business model changes to grow revenue. The most important recent growth driver has been the switch to a subscription (or annual maintenance) model. Looking ahead, migration to subscription will be supplanted by migration to the companyâs 3-D products as the key revenue growth driver and this transition represents increased risk. ADSK has also used pricing levers within its distribution model, varying discounts to resellers and raising prices and managing rebates to customers to drive quarterly results. 
Subscription adoption among ADSK users has had an outsize impact on the companyâs overall growth having boosted reported growth by 49% from fiscal 2002 through fiscal 2007. That will change going forward with increased penetration of the installed base. That puts the focus on the 2-D to 3-D migration to achieve growth goals, which increases risk as predicting new 3-D sales will be more difficult than forecasting subscription adoption among existing customers."

Consider, for instance, Autodeskâs (NASDAQ:ADSK) announcement for revenue for its fiscal third quarter ended October 31. Revenue came in at $457 million, in line with Street expectations. 
The company did not report full financial results due to its ongoing internal stock options review. Carl Bass, the companyâs president and CEO, described the quarter as âvery solid,â and noted that the company is seeing increasing adoption of its 3D software products, as well as strength in emerging economies, which now account for 15% of revenue. The company says it continues to gain market share.
The company said fiscal fourth quarter revenue should be $490 million to $500 million, consistent with the Street estimate of $496 million. For all of fiscal 2007, it puts revenues at $1.832 billion to $1.842 billion, in line with the Streetâs view at $1.84 billion. For 2008, the company sees revenue of $2.075 billion to $2.125 billion, versus the Street at $2.1 billion. The company sees pro forma operating margins increasing 1 to 1.5 percentage points next year.
So really, no surprises. But the underlying story is that there was nervousness on the Street about Autodeskâs quarter. In particular, the thinking was that the company might be vulnerable to a slowing economy in general, and in particular to a slowdown in the construction business, given that the sector is one of the companyâs most significant customers. The slowdown did not materialize, though, and with the solid outlook from the company, the pressure came off the shares, and the stock on Friday took off.
The commentary from the Street Friday morning was pretty consistent; the numbers were good, the worries are eased. A few excerpts:
There are a lot more notes on Autodesk sitting here on the floor of my office, but you get the idea. 
Oh, you know who else made a nice call on Autodeskâ¦uh, me. (I canât link to it, but I wrote a bullish column on the company in the November issue of Smart Money.)
Autodesk shares on Friday jumped $3.55, or 9.6%, to $40.55.

4262223,97936,2019-05-09T17:36:26-04:00,"Over the past week, the benchmark distributed its monthly dividend of $0.3664 which is slightly lower compared to the previous dividend.We continue to see a strong correlation between the high-yield bonds and the stock market.Most of the closed-end funds from the sector are traded at positive Z-score, so you need to be cautious when you select your long positions.In this article, we will focus on Apollo Tactical Income Fund as a fund with one of the lowest Z-scores which can be reviewed as a potential buying opportunity.","The closed-end funds from the high-yield sector significantly increased their prices over the past four months. Currently, most of them are traded at positive Z-scores, which is an indication that they have lost most of their statistical edge. Still, they are traded at high discounts, but we are cautious when we select our positions due to the lack of statistical edge. I still see several interesting buying opportunities in the sector, which I am going to discuss with you in this article.At the end of the article, we will review in more details Apollo Tactical Income Fund, Inc. (AIF) as interesting buying opportunity based on the attractive yield and one of the lowest Z-score in the sector. Currently, the offered yield is 8.18% and you will appreciate the positive earning/coverage ratio and UNII/Share balance. The portfolio of the fund is different from the rest of the high-yield funds due to its big portion of ""Loans"" in its portfolio.The price of the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) moved away from its highest level from the year but mainly because it distributed its monthly dividend. On the 1st of May, the benchmark distributed the amount of $0.3664 which is slightly lower compared to the previous amount which we saw in April. On a weekly basis, the main index fell by $0.40 and finished the week at $86.57 per share.After the loud climbing in the first weeks of the year, now the high-yield closed-end funds seem switched to quiet mode. The environment in the sector indicates for returned appetite from the investors for riskier assets and seeking higher yields.Source: Barchart, iBoxx $ High Yield Corp Bond iSharesSource: Dividend.comHigh-yield bonds are typically evaluated on the difference between their yield and the yield on the US Treasury bond. High-yield spreads are used by investors and market analysts to evaluate the overall credit markets. Higher spreads indicate a higher default risk in junk bonds and can be a reflection of the overall corporate economy and/or a broader weakening of macroeconomic conditions. On a weekly basis, we notice a slight decrease of 0.04 bps.Data by YChartsSource: YCharts, US High Yield Master II Option-Adjusted Spread and US High Yield Master II Effective YieldBelow, you can find a statistical comparison between HYG and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT). As discussed, we observe a low correlation between the two sectors - it is only 0.62 points for the last 200-day period:Source: Author's softwareOn the other hand, we have a statistical comparison between HYG and the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY). There is definitely a stronger relationship between them for the last 80 days. As you see, it is 0.99 points.Source: Author's softwareSource: Yahoo News, High Yield Closed-End Funds NewsOver the past week, several of the funds announced their dividends:Weekly % Changes In The SectorSource: CEFConnect.com1. Lowest Z-Score:Source: CEFConnect.comThe pure statistic is always an important part of my analysis. Therefore, the first criterion that I am going to use is a statistical one. The Z-score indicator shows us how many times the discount/premium deviates from its mean for a specific period. By the value of the Z-score, we can figure out whether the fund is overpriced or undervalued. Theoretically, when the Z-score is negative, the fund may be reviewed as potential ""Long"" candidate. As you see, most of the high-yield CEFs are traded at positive Z-scores. For me, this is a signal to be cautious when I select my long positions and to decide whether I can gain from a capital gain.However, the statistical approach is only one piece of the puzzle and for the investors who seek a higher return for their portfolio, I still see several interesting opportunities in this sector. Ivy High Income Opportunities Fund (IVH) is one of the funds which caught my eye. This fund has one of the lowest Z-scores in the sector and offers a pretty attractive yield of 8.68% which can help you to boost your return. Of course, if you are more conservative investor, then IVH should be only a small percentage of your total portfolio. The dividend of the closed-end fund is very stable and the latest earning report proves that the earnings from the portfolio of IVH are high enough to cover the current dividend. In other words, we do not see a risk of dividend cut based on the earning/coverage ratio.Source: CEFAnalyzer.com2. Highest Z-Score:Source: CEFConnect.comOn the other hand, I have plotted the funds which should be statistically overpriced. The strong performance of the sector led to a situation where most of the closed-end funds are traded positive Z-scores.Last week, we saw Pioneer High Income Trust (PHT) on the second position with Z-score of 2.50 points. Over the past week, the price of the fund remained in a red territory with 1.39% decrease and PHT is going at the bottom of the table.Once again, Neuberger Berman High Yield Strategies Fund (NHS) is the CEF with the highest Z-score. The positive impulse for the price came after the announcement of the dividend increase from $0.0658 to $0.0905 per share. Somehow, I can understand the high Z-score of NHS and BGH because these funds have one of the highest yields in the sector and the market participants are willing to pay for this luxury.For me, Invesco High Income Trust II (VLT) remains the fund which can be reviewed as a potential ""Short"" candidate or potential hedging reaction of our long positions. A current yield of 7.87% which is below the average for the sector and Z-score of 2.10 points are among the factors which make me think this fund is slightly overpriced compared to its peers.The average Z-score of the high-yield CEFs is 1.15 points. On a weekly basis, we find an increase of 0.30 bps of the average value. At the end of December, we had -3.43 points average Z-score, and now, it is above 1.00 point.Source: CEFConnect.com3. Biggest Discount:Source: CEFConnect.comOnly two of the funds reported a decrease in their prices on a weekly basis. Expectedly, we see a narrowing of the discounts in the sector and only eight of the high-yield closed-end funds have a discount of more than 10.00%. Six months ago, most of the participants from this table were traded at a discount of around 15.00% but the stabilization of the stock market and the credit panic led to a significant increase in the prices of the high-yield funds.Based on the Z-score, we do not have many options but based on the spread between the price and the net asset value you can still decide to include some of these funds to your portfolio.The average discount/premium of the high-yield CEFs is -6.56%. Last week, the average spread between prices and net asset values was -7.01%. This is the lowest average discount for the past 40 weeks.Source: CEFConnect.com4. Highest Premium:Source: CEFConnect.comDefinitely, lack of candidates which can be reviewed as potential ""Short"" trades based on their premiums. Although the funds have positive Z-score, it is difficult to label the sector as ""overpriced"" because most of the CEFs are still traded at discounts.Babson Capital Participation Investors (MPV) and Barings Corporate Investors (MCI) lower their premium after the announced increase of their net asset values. If you follow the sector, then you are probably aware that these two funds do not announce their net asset values on a daily basis.Source: CEFConnect.comHere is the full picture of the funds from the sector. Below, we have depicted their discount/premium and their Z-score:Source: CEFConnect.com5. Highest 5-year Annualized Return On NAV:Source: CEFConnect.comThe average return for the past five years is 5.06% for the sector. As you can see, the current yields of most of the funds are much higher than the historical ones.Unfortunately, none of them provide us with an attractive statistical edge to review it. Then, the Z-score value is between -1.00 point and +1.00 point that means 68% of the time the fund was traded at this discount or premium. However, if I have to select one fund which deserves to be reviewed as a potential ""Buy"" candidate for your portfolio, I will choose Wells Fargo Advantage Income Opportunities Fund (EAD). It combines good past results with the opportunity to buy it now at an attractive valuation.Source: CEFdata.com6. Highest Distribution Rate:Source: CEFConnect.comFour funds from the sector have yield more than 9.00%. Keep in mind that NHS offers a current yield of 9.10% and should be in the third position. The information is still not updated in CEFconnect. The average yield on the price for the sector is 8.08%, and the average yield on net asset value is 7.55%. The difference between the two values can be easily explained by the spread between the price and the net asset values of the funds.Source: CEFConnect.com7. Lowest Effective Leverage:Source: CEFConnect.comWe have two funds which are not leveraged and three which use leverage below 10%. The average leverage for the sector is 26.87%. Below, you can see the relationship between the effective leverage of the funds and their yield on net asset value.Source: CEFConnect.comThe potential ""Long"" candidate which I am going to review today is Apollo Tactical Income Fund, Inc. (AIF). We have already seen that this fund has one of the highest discounts in the sector. In addition to the satisfying spread between the price and net asset value, we should highlight its relatively low Z-score. I will delve into more details, but before that will provide you a brief summary of the investment policy of the fund:Source: CEFConnect.comData by YChartsFund basicsCurrent Yield & Earning/Share RatioWe do have a yield on the price of 8.18% and yield on the net asset value of 7.25%. Both of them are close to the average value for the high-yield sector. The current distribution is $0.1020 and it is paid on a monthly basis.Source: CEFAnalyzer.comAnother important fact is the positive earning/coverage ratio of the fund which signals that the management team can fully cover the dividend with the earnings from the investments. In other words, based on this ratio the fund is able to keep the current dividend unchanged.The positive UNII/Share balance is another fact which should be taken into consideration when we are talking about the protection of the dividend. In combination with the earning/coverage ratio, it is an important factor for the distributions.Source: CEFdata.comSource: CEFdata.comPortfolio Quality & CompositionMost of the investments owned by this CEF are with rating ""B."" A brief overview of the investments shows that ""Services Business"" and ""High Tech Industries"" sectors have the biggest weights.Source: Fund Sponsor WebsiteThe fund seeks current income with preservation of capital through investment in different types of credit instruments including senior, structured loans and high yield corporate bonds. Inevitably, you will notice the big portion of ""Loans"" in its portfolio. That is why it will be an appropriate task to compare it not only to high-yield CEFs but to senior loan CEFs, as well.Source: Fund Sponsor WebsiteDuration & LeverageWhen we are talking about fixed-income, it is almost impossible to miss the duration as a factor. The weighted average modified duration of the portfolio of AIF is 4.39 years.The total assets managed by the fund are $366.5 million and $126.5 million of them are coming from the leverage. In other words, the effective leverage of the fund is 34.51%.Source: CEFConnect.comComparison To The BenchmarksBelow is the comparison with the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) and how their prices and net asset values change over the past years. As we discussed, the fund is a little bit different from the rest of the funds in the sector. Therefore I will compare it to the Invesco Senior Loan ETF (BKLN), as well.Data by YChartsData by YChartsThe high-yield sector does not provide us with significant arbitrage opportunities at present. Most of the CEFs are trading at discounts, and it is difficult to find reasonable ""Short"" candidates. On the other hand, there are still interesting funds which provide us with an attractive valuation to review them as potential ""Buy"" candidates.Based on the data that I have reviewed, AIF can be a potential addition to your portfolio.Note: This article was originally published on May 05, 2019, and, as such, some figures and charts might not be entirely up to date."
4075371,101638,2017-05-22T13:37:17-04:00,You should really take a look at this even if you aren't invested in the space because there are some important lessons.The pros are trading this asset class in a completely different way than retail investors.The problem: this asset class is in a bubble and the pros' positions are liquid while retail's positions aren't.,"Twice in the past five days I've tried to make a point about how if you look at credit's relative resilience during last Wednesday's equity market selloff, it seems to suggest that traders weren't shaken out of their core positions (see here and here).And predictably, some readers interpreted both of those articles as bearish reads on the market when in fact the exact opposite was true.Hilariously, I even explained that to readers at the beginning of the second article, citing a comment left on the first post, and readers left what amounted to the very same comments again, proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that very few people are actually reading these posts.But you know, that's how it goes.Well, I wanted to extend that analysis for anyone who is inclined to read what I'm writing because I think it's pretty important, especially if you're in iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:HYG) and/or SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:JNK).Recall this table from Goldman (NYSE:GS):(Goldman)What you want to look at there is the ""SPX"" column. See those high numbers in the red boxes? So those are the percentile rankings for the S&P's (NYSEARCA:SPY) underperformance versus the assets listed on the left. The message there is clear: credit's outperformance versus equities in the period capturing last Wednesday's selloff was anomalous.That, as I noted in the second post linked above, underscores the extent to which the rally in credit markets off the deflationary doldrums of February 2016 has proven bullet-proof. There was a brief stumble in early March when crude sold off hard, causing oil-HY correlations to spike, but other than that, junk has remained resilient.So resilient, in fact, that the last time spreads in both synthetic and cash markets were as tight as they are now, crude was trading at roughly $90/bbl:That in and of itself is a red flag, but if you needed further evidence of the extent to which the artificial suppression of volatility is creating bubbles galore, have a look at this:(Barclays)So that's net protection bought on CDX HY and the deeply negative read there means that what you're looking at is a giant net long position (i.e., when a chart of protection bought is negative, it means investors are net protection sellers).And here's what I mean about artificially suppressed volatility encouraging this behavior:(Barclays)Consider this from Barclays:Again: from the 81st percentile to the 4th percentile in the short space of 5 months. How's that for getting long in a hurry?Now there's some nuance here. Note the discrepancy between protection sold on all series (the shaded light blue) versus protection sold on the OTR. Clearly, the all series figure isn't signaling as extreme a long position. The explanation for that is obvious. Here's Barclays (NYSE:BCS):Ok, duly noted, but I'm not sure how that materially changes this picture. That is, if series 27 shorts didn't roll their bought protection, then that would seem to suggest they either i) got bullish, or at the very least ii) are no longer bearish.Barclays also points to still elevated short interest in HYG and JNK as ""evidence"" that the market hasn't gone completely crazy with the HY bullish bias:I'm not buying that explanation. What seems pretty clear to me is that credit investors are getting long the ""smart"" way by selling protection in a low volatility environment on a highly liquid HY instrument and then they're hedging that long position by shorting the dumbest, most illiquid HY instrument available: your ETFs.If you own those ETFs that should give you pause. Here's what you should be thinking: ""why is it that the pros are hugely long HY via sold protection on CDX HY but their short positions in the ETFs I own are in the 67th and 73rd percentile versus history?""Well, I'll tell you why. Because CDX is liquid. The cash bonds aren't. And because the cash bonds aren't liquid, neither are your ETF shares in a pinch. So were something to go wrong (i.e. HY were to sell off), they can unload their longs easily, and their shorts are in the instruments that are most likely to suffer from a liquidity-mismatched firesale.In the same vein, the other thing you should immediately ask yourself when you see that chart of all the protection being sold on CDX HY is this: ""if they wanted to get long HY, why would they sell protection on CDX as opposed to simply buying the cash bonds?""The answer is the same: because the cash bonds aren't liquid. So whereas CDX used to be used as a hedging instrument, managers are now using it to express core directional views because there's no embedded liquidity mismatch. Of course, the more that ""substitution effect"" (outlined in more detail here) takes hold, the more illiquid the cash market gets because no one is trading it.I'll just be blunt: if you don't understand every single last bit of the above, you have no business buying HY ETFs."
4288016,102308,2019-08-26T16:57:53-04:00,AIF is an aggressive loan CEF with additional pockets of high-yield bond exposure and CLO equity - a balanced-credit investment strategy that we think is compelling.AIF also sports an unusual and dynamic distribution policy which we think mitigates against potentially large future cuts.The recent dovish turn by the Fed suggests that the current credit cycle can extend further and provide an environment for AIF to continue to perform well.,"This article was released to subscribers a few weeks ago so some figures may be somewhat out-of-date.To paraphrase Mark Twain, the reports of the death of this credit cycle have been greatly exaggerated. We have written a few times about the lack of love for the loan sector. Some of the criticism is deserved but far from all of it. In fact, we think the flight from the sector opens up a potential opportunity, particularly for investors who think that the recent dovish Fed turn can further extend the current credit cycle.The Apollo Tactical Income Fund (AIF) is a loan fund that has recently come across our screen for a couple of reasons. First, AIF features on both our top covered yield list as well as the widest discount list - an unusual combination given the tendency of high-yielding funds to trade at tighter discounts.The second reason we have noticed the fund is because of its unusual distribution policy. Effectively, the fund has a kind-of smoothed pay-as-you-go distribution policy with frequent distribution changes. It's not exactly clear why the fund has pursued this unusual policy, particularly given the desire of many income investors for stable distributions. However, this conservative distribution policy does have two benefits. First, it decreases the likelihood of large negative distribution cuts and secondly, it creates an opportunity for special distributions which the market tends to undervalue.Overall, we like the fund for its strong absolute and relative performance within the sector, an appealing distribution policy and attractive valuations.AIF is an Apollo-managed fund running about $370 million gross credit assets at 34% leverage at a current distribution rate of 8.2%.AIF has a sister fund AFT which is focused more on loans. One reason we prefer AIF to AFT (and to other focused-loan funds) is its wider mandate. In addition to loans, AIF allocates about 17% to high-yield bonds and another 10% to CLO equity. We generally prefer funds with wider mandates because wider mandates allow the manager more room to maneuver in pursuit of relative value opportunities.We also like this particular sector mix because each one adds a different exposure, providing diversification. High-yield bonds add a duration element which has worked out quite well in the last few months as long-end yields have fallen. CLO equity provides a kind of call spread option on credit spreads as their widening allow the CLO manager to redeploy repayment proceeds into higher-yield assets. This enhances the excess cash flow to equity tranches given the cost of debt (i.e. senior tranches) is fixed.About 80% of the fund assets are in B/CCC-rated assets which is quite aggressive but not overly unusual for the sector. About a quarter of industry exposure is in Tech, Finance and Real Estate. The largest exposure at 3.2% is Intelsat Jackson Holdings.AIF sources its leverage via a credit facility for which it pays LIBOR + 90, a reduction from LIBOR + 115 for its previous loan prior to April-2018. The recent fall in short-term rates has cheapened the fund's cost of leverage and provided a small boost to its earnings. Ever since the Fed has stopped tightening interest rates, loans have fallen out of favor with investors. However, given the fall in long-end rates, it's not at all clear that loans are less appealing relative to high-yield bonds than they were when the Fed was in hiking mode. This is particularly true given the inverted yield curve with 3M Libor trading 0.60% above the 5-year Treasury yield. The flight from loans means that relative to other income CEF sectors, the asset class looks increasingly attractive. Given its higher place in the capital structure, it is telling that the sector offers a yield that is only half a percent lower to the average of other income sectors.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TiingoGiven the run-up in the short-term rate, the loan sector has also been able to increase distributions while other sectors are flat.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TiingoThe sector discount is also trading at low absolute and relative levels.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TiingoFinally, relative to the benchmark ETF, the sector is still offering a decent pickup of 2.5% - which is more than we can say for most other CEF income sectors.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TiingoAnd while other financial assets are trading fairly richly, single-B rated assets spreads are fairly wide relative to recent history which is another tailwind for the sector and AIF in particular.Source: FREDIn this section, we take a quick look at how AIF has fared relative to other funds in the sector. In price terms, the fund is the best-performing fund in the sector.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TiingoThe fund has also outperformed the sector in NAV terms in all but one year.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TiingoIts volatility-adjusted NAV performance is quite strong as well, suggesting the fund is not just taking the most risk it can but is actually able to deliver alpha. Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TiingoAnother sign of its measured risk-taking is that its NAV volatility has been relatively well contained within the sector.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TiingoAs we mentioned above, the fund has an unusual distribution policy with variable monthly distributions which it has maintained for about the last three years. What makes it more puzzling is the fact that the fund paid a large special at the end of 2018 suggesting that the variable distributions were not designed to exactly match net investment income but instead err on the conservative distribution side. It's possible that the specials are for capital gains but that's pretty unlikely in 2018 when loan prices collapsed.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TiingoIt's worth noting that the recent distribution trend has been lower. That could be for a couple of reasons. First, Libor which is used as the base rate for loans is lower by 0.70% and secondly, probably less likely, that some of the CLOs in the portfolio have hit triggers that cause cashflows to be rerouted to senior tranches.There are two reasons to be hopeful, however. First the latest earnings figure from end-2018 is higher than the current distribution. Secondly, the 2018 special was higher than the one in 2017 and that was due to income, not capital gains. So we think the lower recent distribution trend is not yet a danger signal.Another metric we like to check for distribution stability is the net (ex-distribution) NAV trend. Generally, we don't like to see a negative trend. One reason why this is less of a problem in this particular case is the fact that the downtrend closely matches what we would expect from the loan loss rate over the last few years. This is a general phenomenon worth keeping in mind. The historic loan default rate for single-B rated credit has been about 6% per annum which translates to about a 2% loss rate. So, unless a fund is able to do a good job at picking credits, this is the figure that should be subtracted from the yields of the more aggressive loan funds, before adjusting for leverage.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TiingoUltimately, what looks appealing about AIF is the open-end-fund like combination of its distribution policy and its discount. The fund behaves like an open-ended fund with variable distributions and potentially limited volatility due to a lack of large surprise negative distribution cuts. But, unlike in an open-ended fund, you get this benefit at a discount, given open-end funds trade at their NAV.The AIF discount has tended to trade wider than the sector. This is not explained by the fund's attractive yield or strong historic returns and most likely is due to the lack of a strong brand for Apollo in the CEF space. More recently, the discount has closed the gap against the sector somewhat but still remains wider.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TiingoThe picture on relative yield is similar. The fund has maintained a yield that has been consistently wider than the sector although it has converged somewhat more recently.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TiingoAIF compares favorably against the sector on a number of paired metrics.The fund has an attractive combination of high covered yield and a wide discount.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TiingoSimilarly, the fund's 3-year NAV return is among the highest while its discount is among the widest.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TiingoThe fund also has the highest 5-year annual sector excess return.Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TiingoThe table below is an extract from our sector dashboard. Here we include AIF, its sister fund and the sector average. The following metrics stand out to us:Source: ADS Analytics LLC, TiingoAIF came across our screen because of a combination of its high covered yield at an attractive valuation. We like the fund's broad mandate that allows it to diversify across a number of risk factors and credit asset types. We also like its unusual variable distribution policy which we think potentially mitigates against large future distribution cuts. Although the fund's positions in low-rated loans is relatively aggressive, the recent dovish turnaround by the Fed increases the chance of an extended macro cycle where the fund could continue to perform very well."

Most of these products are designed to provide a steady stream of income, usually on a monthly or quarterly basis, as opposed to the biannual payments provided by individual bonds. And this feature continues to attract market participants even when the overall market looks unstable.In spite of CEFs being mostly of interest to income investors, we have found our path to approach them as active traders and we are constantly monitoring them. As a testament to this, you will be kept up to date with Weekly Reviews such as the one below.On a weekly basis, the price of the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (HYG) reported a slight increase of $0.02 and finished at $85.61 per share. Of course, it is important to notice that on 1st of March, the benchmark distributed its monthly dividend of $0.3818. Ultimately, the strong performance of the high-yield bonds and high-yield closed-end funds continues as the appetite of investors for risky assets is back. The instability around credit confidence seems overcame and the main index is eager to conquer new highs week after week.Source: Barchart, iBoxx $ High Yield Corp Bond iSharesSource: Dividend.comHigh-yield bonds are typically evaluated on the difference between their yield and the yield on the US Treasury bond.

Lowest Z-Score:Source: CEFConnect.comAs usual, our weekly review starts with searching for potential ""Buy"" candidates based on their Z-score. The purpose of this indicator is to show us how many times the discount/premium deviates from its mean for a specific period. The calm week for the sector led to a slight increase in the Z-scores of the funds as only five of the closed-end funds from the sector reported a decrease in their prices on a weekly basis. On top of that, you will notice that only First Trust High Income Long/Short Fund (FSD) had a slight decrease in its net asset value.The sector continues with its strong performance and statistically, it is getting more difficult to find a reason to include some of the high-yield funds to our portfolio as potential ""Long"" candidate. Two months ago, the situation was totally different and most of the CEFs were traded at Z-score of less than -2.00 points.If I have to point out an interesting fund based on the Z-score and its discount, I see Credit Suisse Asset Management Income Fund (CIK) as an opportunity which could be analyzed. The recent earning information showed that the earning coverage ratio is in a good shape and the UNII/Share balance remains positive.Source: CEFdata.com2. Highest Z-Score:Source: CEFConnect.comOn the other side are the closed-end funds with the highest Z-scores. Most of the CEFs are traded at high statistical parameters but when we are talking about an opportunity to review some of them as potential ""Short"" position, I would prefer to review a fund which is traded at high Z-score accompanied by a premium. This week, I do not see so many interesting opportunities where to take a short position, but if I need a hedging reaction of my long positions in the high-yield CEFs, I will use Invesco High Income Trust II with no hesitation.Let us go back to the previous week when we found Barings Corporate Investors (MCI) traded at extremely high Z-score of 5.40 points. Even with so low average daily volume and related liquidity risk, I told you that this trade deserves attention. The positive result is obvious as the price of MCI fell by 4.93% on a weekly basis.Source: CEFConnect.comThe average Z-score of the high-yield CEFs is 1.00 points. On a weekly basis, we find a slight decrease of 0.07 bps of the average value. It is pretty interesting to notice the drastic change.

Biggest Discount:Source: CEFConnect.comThe table above aims to show us the closed-end funds with the biggest spread between their price and net asset value. Compared to the previous week, there is almost no change among the top ten candidates. Nevertheless, we have a new leader of the ranking in the face of Prudential Global Short Duration High Yield Fund, Inc. (GHY). Over the past week, the price of the fund remained flat while its net asset value went up by 0.44%. If you want to include some CEF with relatively low duration to your portfolio, GHY is a good option. It has a 3.2 years duration and currently offers 7.11% current yield.Source: CEFdata.comThe average discount/premium of the high-yield CEFs is -7.62%.

The situation remains the same as we used to see it over the last months. The seeking of ""Sells"" is still a challenging task and the sample above proves it.Here is the full picture of the funds from the sector. Below, we have depicted their discount/premium and their Z-score:Source: CEFConnect.com5. Highest 5-year Annualized Return On NAV:Source: CEFConnect.comThe average return for the past five years is 4.78% for the sector. As you can see, the current yields of most of the funds are much higher than the historical ones. This fact can be easily explained by the sharp declines in their prices over the past year.Wells Fargo Advantage Income Opportunities Fund (EAD) and Credit Suisse High Yield Bond Fund (DHY) could be reviewed as potential ""Buy"" candidates. They not only have one of the best performance for the past five years but also have a current yield much higher than the historical one.6. Highest Distribution Rate:Source: CEFConnect.comAfter a long time, we do not have a closed-end fund with a yield of more than 10.00%. Barings Global Short Duration High Yield Fund continues to be the CEF with the highest current yield in the sector. As I wrote in my previous article, I think this fund deserves our attention based on its yield and its very low duration.The average yield on price for the sector is 8.23% and the average yield on net asset value is 7.61%. The difference between the two values can be easily explained by the spread between the price and the net asset values of the funds.Source: CEFConnect.com7. Lowest Effective Leverage:Source: CEFConnect.comWe have two funds which are not leveraged and three which use leverage below 10%. The average leverage for the sector is 26.26%. Below, you can see the relationship between the effective leverage of the funds and their yield on net asset value.Source: CEFConnect.comThe potential ""Long"" candidate which I am going to review today is Apollo Tactical Income Fund, Inc. (AIF). It is a very interesting CEF which could be categorized as a combination of senior loan closed-end fund and high-yield closed-end fund.Data by YChartsFrom a statistical point of view, I could say that although its Z-score is not negative, AIF still has one of the lowest statistical value in the sector. We should also take into account its discount which is among the highest ones. The current spread between the price and the net asset value is 11.06%.Source: CEFConnect.comInvestment ApproachCurrent YieldWe do have a yield on the price of 8.68% and yield on the net asset value of 7.72%. The current distribution is $0.1070 and it is paid on a monthly basis. At all, AIF has one of the most stable dividend distributions in the sector. For me, it is a good sign to see that the last changes in the dividend were in the right direction. In August 2018, the management team decided to increase the distribution from $0.1040 to $0.1070 per share.Source: CEFAnalyzer.comImproving UNII BalanceAs per the latest report, we find that the earning coverage ratio is 104.02% which may be perceived as protection against dividend cut. In other words, the earnings of the funds are enough high to cover the current distribution.Source: CEFdata.comThe improving UNII/Share balance is another fact which should be taken into consideration when we are talking about the protection of the dividend. In combination with the earning coverage ratio, it is an important factor for the distributions.Source: CEFdata.comPortfolioMost of the investments owned by this CEF are with rating ""B"" followed by 17.30% of the assets labeled as ""B+"" rating. A brief overview of the investments shows that ""Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals"" and ""High Tech Industries"" sectors have the biggest weights.Source: Fund Sponsor WebsiteThe fund seeks current income with preservation of capital through investment in different types of credit instruments including senior, structured loans, and high-yield corporate bonds. Inevitably, you will notice the big portion of ""Loans"" in its portfolio. That is why it will be an appropriate task to compare it not only to high-yield CEFs but to senior loan CEFs, as well.The effective duration of the AIF portfolio is 5.19 years and the effective leverage is 33.49%. Compared to the metrics of the high-yield funds, these two characteristics are slightly above the average values of the high-yield CEFs duration and respectively effective leverage.Source: Fund Sponsor WebsiteThe high-yield sector does not provide us with significant arbitrage opportunities at present. Most of the CEFs are trading at discounts and it is difficult to find reasonable ""Short"" candidates. On the other hand, many of the funds provide us with an attractive valuation to review them as potential ""Buy"" candidates.Based on the data that I have reviewed, AIF can be a potential addition to your portfolio.Note: This article was originally published on March 03, 2019, and as such, some figures and charts might not be entirely up to date."
4205808,97936,2018-09-12T12:55:17-04:00,Review of where high-yield closed-end funds and their benchmark ended the week.Comparison with the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF and spread review.Recap of news related to the sector.Comparison among the funds using several important metrics.Pair trade idea for those interested.,"The opportunities in closed-end funds over the last few months caught the eye of many investors. Most of these products are designed to provide a steady stream of income, usually on a monthly or quarterly basis, as opposed to the biannual payments provided by individual bonds. And this feature continues to attract market participants even when the overall market looks unstable.In spite of CEFs being mostly of interest to income investors, we have found our path to approach them as active traders and we are constantly monitoring them. As a testament to this, you will be kept up to date with Weekly Reviews such as the one below.Source: Barchart, iBoxx $ High Yield Corp Bond iSharesOn a weekly basis, the price of the main index, the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:HYG) fell by $0.66. Of course, we should take into consideration the fact that it paid a dividend of $0.37.On the chart above, I have highlighted the price trading range which was formed after the sharp decline at the beginning of the current year. The main resistance level can be found around $86.55 and just a week ago, we were about to see a test of it. On the other side, the main support level can be found around $84.90. In case there is a range breakout, we expect significant changes in the funds' statistical characteristics.If you still do not have any high-yield CEFs in your portfolio, I would like to spend some time covering several advantages of high-yield bonds and closed-end funds, which invest in this asset class. As the high-yield sector generally has a low correlation to other sectors of the fixed-income market, along with less sensitivity to interest rate risk, an allocation to high-yield bonds may provide portfolio diversification benefits. In addition, high-yield bond investments have historically offered similar returns to equity markets but with lower volatility.High-yield bonds are typically evaluated on the difference between their yield and the yield on the US Treasury bond. High-yield spreads are used by investors and market analysts to evaluate the overall credit markets. Higher spreads indicate a higher default risk in junk bonds, and can be a reflection of the overall corporate economy and/or a broader weakening of macroeconomic conditions.On a weekly basis, we notice an increase of 0.08 bps but the current levels remain one of the lowest for the past decade.Source: YCharts, US High Yield Master II Option-Adjusted Spread and US High Yield Master II Effective Yield Below, you can find a statistical comparison between the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF and the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:TLT).

Based on the Z-score indicator, the table provides us with interesting ""Long"" opportunities. The Z-score indicator shows us how many times the discount/premium deviates from its mean for a specific period. On a weekly basis, we notice a slight decrease in the values of the metric which corresponds to the recent downtick of the benchmark.We have a new leader in the face of Pioneer High Income Trust (NYSE:PHT). Over the past week, its price fell by $0.18 and currently we find it with a Z-score of -1.20 points.

Highest Z-Score:  Source: CEFConnect.comThe Putnam High Income Securities Fund (NYSE:PCF) is taking the first place of the ranking with Z-score of 1.40 points. We still cannot consider it as a ""Sell"" candidate because the CEF's price is trading below its net asset value.

Over the past three days, the price of the fund fell by more than $0.55.Source: Barchart.com3. Biggest Discount:Source: CEFConnect.comMost of the funds from the sector are traded at discount. Over the past two months, they increased their prices and part of the statistical edge has vanished, but at all the period remains favorable for seeking of potential ""Long"" positions. The above sample represents the funds from the high-yield sector with the highest discount. As you see, only a bunch of them have a Z-score less than -1.00 point.The average discount/premium of the high yield CEFs is -8.50%. Last week the average spread between prices and net asset values was -8.19%.Source: CEFConnect.com4. Highest Premium:Source: CEFConnect.comOn the other hand are the closed-end funds which are traded at a premium. Apparently, we have only three participants with a price above their net asset value. I will restrain myself from considering any involvement in them. The first reason is that their premiums do not seem high enough to me and the second is because of their low Z-scores. It does not make sense to use the indicator if its value is between 0 and 1 point. In that scenario, we cannot talk about a statistical edge.Here is the full picture of the funds from the sector.

4041318,20757,2017-02-01T00:29:17-05:00,,"The S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) is on pace for its fourth straight day of losses, which would mark the longest losing streak for the index since the election (leading up to the election, through 11/4, the index was down for nine straight days). While the four-day decline has been relatively modest, whenever equities slump, we like to see how things in the high yield market are playing out in order to see if there are any warning signs in this area of the fixed-income market. Historically speaking, spreads (yield premium over treasuries) on high yield debt have been inversely correlated to the equity market. In other words, when spreads on high yield debt increase, equities usually decline, and vice versa.Taking a look at the chart below, spreads on high yield debt have narrowed significantly over the last year. After hitting a peak of 887 bps back in February of last year, spreads contracted by more than half through their recent lows which occurred last Friday at 393 bps. In yesterday's trading, spreads widened a bit, which is understandable given the increased risk aversion in the market. However, with an increase of just 3 bps, like the equity market, high yield debt markets aren't showing a high degree of concern at this point.Thanks for reading the article.

4066793,101638,2017-04-28T13:47:17-04:00,"Two managers with $789 million in tow are out with what is quite simply the starkest warning on ETFs to date.Their full comments (from an April letter to investors) on the industry are highlighted here.This is their conclusion: ""The WMDs during the Great Financial Crisis were three-letter words: CDS, CDO, etc. The current WMD is also a three-letter word"".","Early last month, I wrote a little something called ""This Just Doesn't Feel Right.""It was about ETFs.As it turns out, that wasn't the first time I've expressed my reservations about the rampant proliferation of passive, low-cost investment vehicles. In fact, maligning ETFs has become something of an obsession for me of late.ETFs are a textbook example of ""too much of a good thing."" Here's what I mean by ""too much"" (I've shown these charts before):(Goldman)There's little question that it was a good thing to offer investors an alternative to overpriced, actively-managed funds. To be sure, buying and holding a benchmark for almost nothing in terms of management fees is a far better way for most people to invest their money than trying to pick individual winners and/or paying someone else to pick individual winners.Simply put: Beating the broad market is almost impossible over a sufficiently long investment horizon. So why try?That goes double for periods during which central banks are essentially propping up assets by injecting trillions upon trillions in liquidity.That said, if you step back and think about ETFs in a kind of common sense way, they actually seem like a really horrible idea. They are, for all intents and purposes, derivatives, which by extension means hordes of retail investors are now derivatives traders. Throw in the rising popularity of ETPs and you've also managed to turn retail investors into futures traders (for instance, no VIX ETP actually tracks the VIX, they track VIX futures).That's bad. And it's made immeasurably worse by the fact that most ETF investors don't realize they're trading derivatives and most ETP investors don't realize they're essentially futures traders.And it gets worse. The creation/destruction mechanism that serves as the scaffolding on which these vehicles are built, is far from the streamlined, miracle of financial engineering that ETF sponsors would have you believe it is.In fact, for some ETFs (think high-yield funds), it's a liquidity mismatched nightmare. Investors are given the illusion of liquidity. For instance, you can trade the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:HYG) all day every day. But that liquidity relies on what Barclays has correctly called ""diversifiable flows.""You're selling and someone else is buying, eliminating the need for trading in the underlying bonds. But the problem comes in when the flows become unidirectional. If everyone is selling, someone, somewhere is going to have to trade the underlying bonds. Well guess what? The market for those bonds is thin. Which means the potential for a fire sale is high.Similarly, we learned during the flash-crashing madness that unfolded on the morning of August 24, 2015 that equity ETFs are not immune when it comes to potentially wide NAV bases.Have a look at the following two charts:(Goldman)(SocGen)Don't worry so much about the specifics. The first visual purports to show how ETF short interest can rise above 100% without causing problems and the second seeks to trace the source of implicit transaction costs. There's a lot to learn from those, but again, just look at them as examples of how the process you've been made to believe is streamlined and simple, is anything but.Up until 2016, a lot of the criticism of ETFs was confined to the conceptual level. Witness Howard Marks' warning in 2015 that no matter what anyone tells you, ""an ETF cannot be more liquid than the underlying assets.""More recently, however, the criticism of ETFs has become more pointed. I outlined the case for why S&P ETFs (NYSEARCA:SPY) perpetuate a gross misallocation of capital here earlier this month (aside: some people didn't like that post - at all - but to be honest, it's another one of those ""who you gonna believe, Heisenberg and Goldman or the critics on this platform?"" moments).And then there was the recent study by researchers at Stanford University and Emory University, which showed that ETFs are making it impossible for investors to ""seek alpha"" (so to speak).The list just goes on, and on, and on.Well, in the most recent and perhaps the most hyperbolic attack on the industry yet, Arik Ahitov and Dennis Bryan, who run the $789 million FPA Capital Fund, are out with a truly stark warning, detailed in a letter to investors dated April 7.Bloomberg and a few other sites published some excerpts from it on Thursday, but I've got the whole letter and I wanted to bring to your attention the excerpts about ETFs. Here are the important bits (I'm going to eschew my usual highlights here because frankly, all of it should be highlighted):Needless to say, that summarizes almost everything I've been saying for almost a year both here and elsewhere.Now as always, I encourage you to draw your own conclusions based on the evidence presented, but I would once again beg you to at least consider that we're talking about some really - really - smart people here. And they've all come to essentially the same conclusion about this industry.Some of it is probably sour grapes from people who have lost AUM. But a lot of it isn't. Believe me, Carl Icahn is doing just fine and doesn't need passive management to die in order to make money and yet he's saying the very same things.So that's something to think really long, and really hard about over the weekend."
4039299,96646,2017-01-25T09:15:29-05:00,,"What does the sea change in the economic and market landscape mean for fixed income investors?The U.S. presidential election was a transformative event. It focused tired markets on the potential for tax reform and reduced regulation, which introduced new optimism about economic growth, corporate earnings and a shift from ultra-low inflation. This has contributed to a surge in equities, and a tightening of spreads on corporate bonds, particularly in high yield, while Treasury yields have seen a sharp increase (and commensurate decline in Treasury prices).This is in stark contrast to the pessimism that reigned for the previous two years, when investors were preoccupied with slow growth and what seemed like the stuttering end to a very long business cycle. Flat corporate earnings, the drop of oil prices and the related six-quarter correction in high yield energy assets contributed to the malaise. As recently as the first quarter of 2016, meager U.S. economic growth and uncertain prospects in China were ongoing worries.The nadir of sentiment came in July 2016, at a time when central banks were flirting with the “dark side” of negative policy rates and seeing the limits of extraordinary monetary intervention. From there, yields began to inch up and risk assets gained momentum. The election then accelerated those trends. Interestingly, if you look at where rates are today versus the start of 2016, the trend is less dramatic.It’s possible that investors have exaggerated the potential economic upside from the change in political regimes, but there are certainly significant shifts in the works. Of primary importance is the rewriting of the tax code. House Republicans introduced a framework for corporate and personal income tax reductions back in June. At the time, it was given little chance of success, but given Trump’s campaign promises and Republican control of the executive and legislative branches, reform seems likely, with possible passage in the second or third quarter and implementation in January 2018.Its impact, by many accounts, would be significant. Corporate tax cuts alone have been estimated to increase corporate profitability by 10%, while a portion of personal tax savings is likely to enter the consumer economy. Depending on its size, an infrastructure package could help stimulate growth in the mid- to long term, while reduced regulation could encourage business expansion down the road.Source: Bloomberg, as of November 30, 2016.All told, we anticipate GDP growth moving from around 2% in 2016 to roughly 2.5% in 2017, with possibly higher growth in 2018 depending on the success of tax reform and other initiatives I’ve mentioned.As for interest rates, the Federal Reserve has hesitated to tighten for some time, but optimism about growth and inflation seem to now provide “air cover” to hike rates in a more sustained way. After its December increase, the central bank anticipates raising the fed funds target three times in 2017, to 1.25% - 1.50% by year-end, and could become more hawkish after that if inflation inches above its 2% target, as some expect. Still, its approach remains gradual and data-driven, as the risks of overtightening at this point outweigh those of further accommodation.Source: FRED, Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Recession Years: December 2007 to June 2009. Data through December 31, 2016.What does this do to fixed income prospects for the year? It clearly makes things more challenging, particularly for rate-sensitive Treasuries. We believe that the 10-year Treasury yield will rise to about 3.0% this year from its recent 2.4%. The story is more positive for corporate bonds and other credits. Economic firming and better yields are likely to extend expectations for the length of the credit cycle, which should help to further tighten yield spreads over Treasuries. All else equal, the after-tax yields of municipal bond prices would be reduced by tax cuts, but the sector is already cheap relative to other quality bond segments. Overall, we believe it will be important for investors to be flexible in their approach to bonds, to better capitalize on the opportunities beyond the broad indices (See “Fixed Income’s Role” below). That said, the low global rate picture may limit the extent to which U.S. nominal rates rise this year, as foreign investor flows could rush in to capitalize on differences with home country yields.It may seem strange to hear from a fixed income manager, but I believe that this move to higher rates is actually very positive in the long term. The fact is that the major economies in developed markets have, in my view, reached the limits of nonconventional monetary policy. There’s only so much they can do to fight deflation and stimulate growth. Help has to come from other branches of the government through fiscal stimulus, whether tax cuts, reduced regulation or spending, or a combination of all three.Until now, the Fed has missed opportunities to raise rates and normalize the yield curve because of ongoing concerns about growth. Whether you like the new administration or not, its pro-growth bias lays the groundwork for expansion that doesn’t rely on ultra-low rates and a flat yield curve that have penalized savers and encouraged speculative, non-economic business activity. There are clearly risks: If the tough anti-globalization rhetoric of the campaign translates into trade war, that could offset any benefits from tax reform or deregulation. However, I believe that the Trump administration will probably take a more pragmatic approach, akin to the Reagan administration’s assertive negotiations with Germany and Japan 30 years ago. Another less dramatic risk is that the consumer may decide to “take a couple quarters off” due to uncertainty over health care coverage and other worries; that’s not our base case, but it could slow the expansion and cause the Fed to be more cautious.Net-net, I believe recent events have likely broken the logjam on rates. That’s not only good for the long-term health of the economy, but it also will likely recharge the Fed in the future when it once again needs to confront economic weakness or even crisis. Investors have experienced tightening cycles before, but this one is “new” given the low yield levels we will be emerging from. Although the process will likely create some near-term pain for fixed income investors, I believe it also sets the groundwork for a more normal environment and healthier prospects for savers over the course of time."
4062520,101638,2017-04-14T19:40:12-04:00,"One day, someone is going to look back at the proliferation of ETFs and wonder how everyone could have been so naive.Outside of some geopolitical catastrophe, ETFs almost unquestionably represent the biggest risk to markets - and this risk is at the structural level.Think about this: if you own ETFs, you are a derivatives trader. Have you considered that?","So, this is kind of strange.By far, the most read post over at the Heisenberg Report, in a week dominated by geopolitical headlines, was a piece about ETFs.Personally, I think that's great. Because it suggests people are at least cognizant of the fact that no matter what you think about the proliferation of passive, low-cost investment vehicles, their rise to prominence (actually ""dominance"" is better) is important and something that needs careful consideration.To be sure, the ETF discussion is a rabbit hole. And one thing I've learned writing on this platform over the past year is that readers here don't like to be led down rabbit holes, especially deep ones, because if comment totals are any indication, readers tend to get about halfway down those deep rabbit holes before they simply turn around and climb back out (i.e. they click out of the article and don't bother commenting).So, in the interest of respecting readers' apparent disdain for lengthy, in-depth diatribes, I'm going to try and keep this concise, simple, and visually pleasing.As the Heisenberg crowd is well aware, I'm worried about ETFs. That goes for popular equity vehicles (NYSEARCA:SPY) all the way down to high-yield (NYSEARCA:HYG) products. Here's how I put it earlier this week:That last bit is a problem. And no one wants to admit it. But the simple fact of the matter is that ETFs have turned retail investors into derivatives traders. You can call them whatever you want in order to make yourself feel better, but if you've got a portfolio full of ETFs, what you have is a portfolio full of derivatives.But it's certainly not just retail. Consider this out earlier this week from Deutsche Bank:Now again, you can read that as is and take comfort in it (which is pretty clearly what Deutsche intended), or you can translate it and strip it down to what it actually says, which is this:Right. So, that's obviously bad. But it gets worse. Here's another passage from the same Deutsche Bank note:In the interest of keeping my promise re: conciseness, I'm not going to expound on all of the things that could go wrong there. Rather, I'll ask you again to think about that last bolded passage from a common sense perspective. That is, just read it again and tell me if that sounds like a good idea.Here's what you should think after reading it:See this always - always - comes back to the same inescapable problem, which is this: I don't care what kind of ETF it is, it cannot be more liquid than the assets it represents.It can seem to be more liquid, but that's what we might call ""phantom liquidity."" And it will dry up when things get messy which, you'll recall, is exactly what happened on the morning of August 24, 2015.As I've noted before, there are a whole lot of people out there who are hell-bent on pointing to heavy volume as ""evidence"" of liquidity. Witness Goldman out on Wednesday (this is in reference to high-yield ETFs):Read that last bolded bit again.That is completely and totally absurd. The argument there is that more trading in the ETF (velocity) is leading to a less volatile NAV basis (the difference between the ETF price and the value of the underlying bonds), and, therefore, we have more liquidity.But that's not true. We just have more trading in the ETF shares. That says absolutely nothing about liquidity for the underlying assets. Indeed, it makes things worse! Because the more you trade the ETF rather than the underlying bonds, the more illiquid those underlying bonds invariably become.I am 100% sure that the vast majority of market participants (big and small) have no idea how dangerous this is. Which is really, really strange considering what transpired on August 24 two years ago.If ever there were a ""systemic"" risk, surely this is it.Yours truly on a beach weather Friday,"

Then I decided against it.But I still wanted to take the law school admission test, so that later no one could accuse me of backing out because I couldn't pass the test. So basically, I took the LSAT for fun.I did ok.""Ok"" wasn't enough to satisfy my ego, so I took it again to try and beat my first score. I paid for the second test with profits I made from long calls on a Brazilian water utility ADR that I sold to close from the first iPhone (the 2.5G version that no one remembers) in the middle of a graduate political science class (it's not like the test was expensive, but every penny counts when you're a college student).That's a true story.When I still had designs on actually becoming a lawyer, I wanted to be a criminal defense attorney. Either that or a corporate lawyer.Either way, the job was going to entail defending people that were, in some cases, objectively guilty. So, I would have to be pretty adept at arguing for things I knew to be wrong. I'm pretty sure I would have been up to the task, had I pursued it.So I think it's fair to say, given the fact that ""professional liar"" was once on my list of possible career choices, that if I can't figure out how to lie about something, there's probably a good chance there's no case to be made for it.And I can't figure out for the life of me how to argue a bull case for credit - that goes for investment grade (NYSEARCA:LQD) and high yield (NYSEARCA:HYG).It's not for lack of trying. You'll note that I attempted to document what I think is a pretty weak inflation-based argument earlier this month. Basically, it boils down to this: usually, when inflation expectations rise, spreads tighten. Well, if the case for or against something starts with ""usually"", you don't even have to know what the subject is, let alone hear the rest of the argument to formulate a counterargument.So ubiquitous are the arguments against credit that I've ceased recounting them when I broach the subject anew. Rather than put regular readers through the same set of charts, I've just developed a handy set of bullet points with links that should suffice for anyone who needs a review. Here they are:For those who need visual evidence to be convinced, you'll find no shortage of it in the posts linked above.Here I wanted to highlight a kind of pseudo-argument for being bullish on credit advanced in a note out from Wells Fargo on Friday. To be clear, it's not that I like the argument (it's basically just that spreads could continue to grind tighter). Rather, I like the point the bank makes about the relationship between rates and credit, and I think it's worth pointing out. Here are some excerpts (my highlights):If you want a better visual representation of the dynamic Wells is describing (i.e., a better one than it provides), here's a graph from Goldman Sachs with my highlights to point out the discrepancy between rates volatility and credit/equity volatility:(Chart: Goldman Sachs)Now, here's where it gets interesting (if you're inclined to think these types of things are interesting). Consider the following, again from Wells Fargo (my highlights):If you're like me and expect that at some point this year, a breach of 3% on 10s is inevitable, then you also need to be concerned about what happens to credit as Treasury yields reprice.In other words, the last bolded passage above is yet another reason to be cautious on credit as an asset class.I want to leave you with one last chart. Remember, I've talked about the fact that the percentage of corporate credit concentrated in the hands of those who were heavy sellers during the crisis has increased dramatically, thereby making it likely that the next sell-off will be commensurately more violent? Well, here's a chart from Citi that underscores that very point:(Chart: Citi)"
4038705,101638,2017-01-23T13:26:17-05:00,"I'm not always bearish.In fact, I've laid out the bull case for stocks and rates in previous posts.Herein, I do the same for credit.","I like to present all sides of an argument.There's this perception that I'm bearish on everything, all the time (well, except for maybe the dollar).To a certain extent, that's correct. I'm bearish on rates (NASDAQ:TLT), I'm bearish on stocks (NYSEARCA:SPY), and I'm bearish on credit. All with good reason - I think.I have, however, presented the bullish case for rates and the bullish case for stocks on any number of occasions (see here on rates for example and here on stocks).What I haven't done is presented a bull case for credit.That's because there isn't one.Just kidding. There are always arguments on both sides of the trade. With credit, I do contend (and I'm hardly alone here) that the spread compression we've seen over the past 12 or so months is, for lack of a better word, absurd. High yield (NYSEARCA:HYG) spreads are now near levels last seen when oil was at $80. So enthusiastic is the market, that earlier this month, Citi decided to do a survey to see how many of their clients thought HY energy would soon trade inside HY as a whole.You won't be able to vote (unfortunately), but I did get a screengrab for you:(Citi)Note the reference to historical spreads. The assumption that the chart above will mean revert is based entirely on the idea that oil prices will continue to rise. Given positioning, you can hardly blame Citi for running this survey:(Charts: Deutsche Bank)As for IG (NYSEARCA:LQD), we've seen spreads tighten dramatically there as well and while there's certainly been no shortage of demand (or supply) when it comes to new issuance, I just can't bring myself to believe that this is realistic:(Chart: Goldman)For those interested in reading a truly devastating indictment of both IG and HY, see here. But as tipped at the outset, I'm going to present the bullish thesis for credit below.Ok, so we're all acutely aware by now that inflation is supposed to move higher going forward (in the US that is - ask Mario Draghi about how that's going in the eurozone).Consumer prices rose by the fastest y/y pace since June of 2014 in December and we've got some easy comps coming up on the energy front (think about how much higher oil prices are now than this time last year). And then there's the whole reflation narrative fueled by hopes of fiscal stimulus.Of course we have to be careful when we pile fiscal stimulus atop an economy that's already running too hot. Here's what I said early Sunday:With that caveat out of the way, it's worth noting that historically, rising inflation has led to tighter credit spreads. Let's look at some charts.First are two graphs that show IG credit tightens when inflation expectations rise (left pane) which isn't entirely surprising given the link between inflation expectations and growth (right pane):(Charts: Citi)Again, we have to bear in mind that too much of a ""good"" thing when it comes to inflation can create problems, but Citi's point is duly noted.Next up is a look at how spread differentials compress between quality buckets (you've got US in the left pane and euro in the right):(Charts: Citi)Obviously that isn't surprising. You'd expect the premium investors demand to hold lower quality paper to fall in an environment where spreads are compressing more generally.Which is precisely why what we see in this last set of charts isn't surprising either:(Charts: Citi)That's just a similar dynamic as that shown in the second set of charts. The spread difference between HY and IG (both in the US and Europe) compresses as inflation expectations rise.So that's the bull case for credit. Citi sums it up in about as simple a manner as possible: ""High inflation expectations are credit positive.""As noted above, you have to incorporate that into an analysis that includes considerations about leverage, fundamentals, and the credit cycle (as delineated quite poignantly by Morgan Stanley in a recent presentation).Considering all of the variables at once isn't easy, but your reaction function has to be as robust as possible if you want to make an intelligent decision.What the charts do show (well, besides the fact that when they're really trying, Citi has some of the best charts on the Street) is that ""there's always a bull case somewhere.""Oh no, I just paraphrased Jim Cramer. That means it's time to take a break.Until next time."
4037527,101638,2017-01-18T05:57:02-05:00,It's difficult to find the right words to describe just how rich corporate debt has become.We already know that the cushion these bonds once enjoyed has completely evaporated.Now let's look at the fundamentals.,"That exchange is from the film ""Margin Call"". In it, Jeremy Irons plays John Tuld, the CEO of a major investment bank and Kevin Spacey plays Sam Rogers, a 34-year veteran of the fictional firm who oversees MBS trading.It's a go-to movie for me on the rare occasions when I leave the desk and as I was watching it for the umpteenth time on Sunday evening, I was reminded of credit markets.Although I could say the same thing about a lot of asset classes (stocks, for example), the numbers in investment grade (NYSEARCA:LQD) and high yield (NYSEARCA:HYG) truly don't ""add up anymore.""And I don't just mean in the narrow sense that ""one plus one no longer equals two"" (another quote from the film). I mean there is a shocking discrepancy between where we are in the cycle, the fundamentals, and spreads.It's not just that high yield has overshot a bit on excessive optimism around promised OPEC production cuts. That may be an example of one plus one not coming out to two. Rather, the whole complex is grossly mispriced. The 12-month spread compression has been so dramatic that one struggles to describe how truly irrational the market seems to have become.Earlier this year, Bloomberg's Lisa Abramowicz said ""buyers of risky corporate bonds are starting 2017 in a precarious position."" Lisa is pretty smart, so we can assume that the only thing keeping her from using much more colorful language to describe the situation was Bloomberg's dedication to a certain level of professional decorum.Indeed, the image at the top of the article - a silhouette of someone walking a tightrope - suggests she's fully aware that calling investors' position ""precarious"" surely qualifies as a candidate for understatement of the year and we're not even three quarters of the way through January. Here are some excerpts from the piece:In technical terms, spreads have compressed to the point that the cushion investors receive from taking on the risk associated with HY has disappeared with remarkable rapidity. The same is true of IG. Have a look for yourself:(Charts: Goldman, my additions)Here's a more straightforward way to visualize it (i.e. by showing explicitly how the cushion has eroded from one Fed hike to the next):(Chart: Morgan Stanley)To be sure, I've been over this rather remarkable spread compression on any number of occasions (most recently here and here). If you want to read Jeff Gundlach's opinion and/or see some incredible charts, I encourage you to take a few minutes and scan those pieces. But for our purposes here, I want to highlight a disconnect between collapsing spreads and fundamentals.""Many analysts think the market is in the later stages of the credit cycle, meaning that credit quality is expected to deteriorate in the near future,"" Bloomberg's Abramowicz goes on to note, in the same piece cited above. That's an important point and one I've made repeatedly. Here's what Morgan Stanley said earlier this month on the subject (my highlights):If we do get the growth the new President has promised, that may end up forcing the Fed's hand and that, as they say, would be all she wrote for the already long in the tooth credit cycle.So now let's look at leverage as a proxy for credit quality (and this is where the insanity really becomes apparent). First, here's a look at gross and net leverage in IG and HY, respectively:(Charts: Morgan Stanley)You can read the titles of the charts for yourself, but basically, there's no recent historical precedent for where we're at leverage wise.Rather than show you each chart in turn, allow me to just save us all some time and present four visuals at once:(Charts: Morgan Stanley)I mean, it's impossible to overstate how absurd this has become. Look at the growth of the HY tail (i.e. the most leveraged names) since 2011 (upper left hand corner). And how about the fact that a quarter of IG firms are leveraged 4 times or more versus just 15% six years ago (bottom left hand corner).And finally, have a look at how tight (compressed) spreads are versus fair value:(Charts: Morgan Stanley)See what I mean when I say this is off the charts (no pun intended) crazy? The disconnect between spreads and fundamentals has reached lunatic proportions.I certainly hope that the investment implications of the above are abundantly clear, but in case they're not, let me quote Lisa Abramowicz one last time:Indeed. And as far as ""pushing the leverage"" goes, I'll leave you with one last graph to chew on:(Chart: SocGen)"
4039818,21992,2017-01-26T14:34:32-05:00,Bonds have struggled in recent months and have cooled lately following a bounce in recent weeks.Is it finally time to ditch long-term bond holdings?Is a new bear market in bonds now underway?,"The bond market has taken another turn lower following a strong start to the year. And with stocks showing some fresh vigor in recent days, it is reasonable to question whether it may be time to lighten up on high-quality bond allocations. While continued short-term fluctuations should be expected not only from bonds but across the asset class spectrum, now is not the time to change course with existing bond allocations.Everlasting BondsIndeed, it has been a difficult stretch for the bond market over the past several months. After peaking last summer with bond yields touching all-time lows, bonds entered into sharp correction mode through the remainder of 2016.Bonds started to show renewed life starting in mid-December, however. And over the subsequent month through mid-January, bonds as measured by long-term U.S. Treasuries (NYSEARCA:TLT) posted a solid +5.5% rally that outpaced a stock market as measured by the S&P 500 Index (NYSEARCA:SPY) that had entered a consolidation phase following its own sharp rally in the weeks following the election.But over the past two weeks, this bounce in bonds has proven fleeting with prices falling back to earth. This coupled with the jump in stocks over the past few days have put the two major categories back in line with one another from a return perspective since mid-December with one heading in the right direction and the other not.So is it time for investors to quit their high quality bond allocations? While the near-term road may indeed be bumpy in the weeks and months ahead, the answer is no for the following reasons.""Amicitiae nostrae memoriam spero sempiternam fore""(I hope that the memory of our friendship will be everlasting)--Marcus Tullius CiceroInvestors are constantly given to amnesia when it comes to managing their investment portfolios over time. Remember when the financial crisis nearly collapsed less than a decade ago? Remember the returns generated by stocks after reaching historical highs at the turn of the millennium? Apparently many do not - it is important to constantly reflect on the history of the market to understand where it is likely to travel going forward.And while so many in the stock pumping crowd have been quick to declare the end has arrived for the bond market following what has been a less than 75 basis point jump in the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield (NYSEARCA:IEF) since the election, it may prove unwise to jump so quickly to such conclusions.After all, this is not a bond bull market that has been going on for a few years. In fact, it's not something that has been limited to the post financial crisis period. Instead, today's bond bull market, which remains very much ongoing today by the way, is now entering its 36th year of existence. For more than two secular stock market phases (or three depending on who you might ask, but I'm in the two camp) dating all the way back to 1981, bonds have been in rally mode. Not a bad run to be certain. And just as the current bull market in stocks, which is the second longest in history dating back to March 2009, has proven relentless and seemingly impossible to take down, so too has it been true for the bond market. The only difference is that bonds have been in the practice of repeatedly defying its doubters including the esteemed Oracle of Omaha for more than four times longer than today's stock bull market.Thus, investors would be naïve to think that today's bond bull market will simply go quietly and without one heck of a fight along the way. What will a ""fight"" most likely look like? Extreme interest rate volatility much like the stock market top in 2000 with wild swings in either direction. After all, it will likely require a transformational change in financial market conditions to usher in a new bond bear market.The bond bull market has survived strong economies and recessions as well as both rising and falling interest rate cycles from central banks over the past nearly four decades. And with global economic growth still sluggish and completely imbibed on central bank liquidity coupled with the fact that various risk markets are distorted beyond all recognition across many parts of the world, such is not the environment where investors are likely to throw a 36-year bond bull market overboard. Could high inflationary pro-growth fiscal policies eventually turn the tide in the coming years? Perhaps, but this is a tale told so many times in the past over the past four decades under much better geopolitical and global economic circumstances, yet the bond bull kept charging right through it to the upside.But why would an investor, for example, possibly want to lend money to the U.S. government in the form of U.S. Treasuries for the next 30years and earn a paltry 3%? Sure, I agree that a 3% annualized return over 30 years would likely be a lousy investment. But who said that when I buy a bond that I have to hold it to maturity? Do investors plan on holding the stocks they buy to perpetuity? No. And the same holds true for bonds. After all, one has to look no further than the chart above to see that these same U.S. Treasury bonds that won't mature for another 20 to 30 years generated a positive rate of return approaching 6% in about a month.Nice ClothesThus, the question instead is whether bonds (NYSEARCA:BND) including Treasuries represent an attractive investment not only for the long term as demonstrated by their ongoing bull market but also over the short term and intermediate term. And at present, a number of indicators are providing reassurance for bond investors after what has been a recently difficult stretch.""Vestis virum reddit""(The clothes make the man)--QuintilianusFirst, U.S. Treasuries as represented by the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield appear to be finding their footing as of late. Yields are currently moving toward the middle of a thick terrain of support and resistance levels that have been in place for the past five years.Once again, the bull market in bonds is not over, as yields have only recently jumped to levels last seen in June 2015 (sarcastic gasp!) and are still below what would have been considered historically low yields in the first three years AFTER the financial crisis from 2008 to 2010. And while it is possible that they may continue to rise toward the 3% level in the coming months, this would be very much within the realm of normal yield movements in the ongoing bond bull market.Second, the primary driver of recently spiking yields (and thus lower Treasury and bond prices) has been the widespread liquidation of Treasuries by China, which has needed to raise cash to support its banking system in the midst of heavy capital outflow activity in recent months. Evidence of this source of downside pressure can be found not only in the Treasury TIC data but also in the recent correlation between the falling Chinese Renminbi currency exchange rate relative to the U.S. dollar and the price of the TLT.Over the past month, evidence has emerged that this pressure from China on U.S. Treasury prices appears to be abating. This is reflected in the renewed strength of the Renminbi since the start of the New Year, suggesting the tide in capital outflows may be heading back out for now.""Sometimes the clothes do not make the man""--George Michael, Freedom '90Of course, U.S. Treasuries have still rolled back over despite this apparent alleviation of downside pressure on prices due to the sale of foreign governments. So what then explains the recent price retreat over the past two weeks? Although the data hadn't really supported the narrative to this point, maybe investors have finally bought into the notion of pro-growth fiscal policies and are finally now rotating out of stocks and into bonds.Once again, the data does not support this narrative. In fact, the exact opposite is true. For according to the Investment Company Institute, the past week saw net inflows into taxable bonds totaling $3.5 billion versus net outflows from domestic equities totaling -$3.7 billion. Perhaps we will see a stark reversal once the next round of weekly data comes in to better explain what we have seen in recent days, but apparently investors have been rotating out of stocks and into bonds as of late.""Semper idem""(Always the same thing)--CiceroOK, but what about expectations for rising interest rates from the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2017? Perhaps some of the pro-growth fiscal policies we have seen started to move in recent days is raising expectations about interest rate hikes and weighing on the bond market. Perhaps, but if so the market itself does not agree.At the start of the year, the following were the probabilities based on CME Fed Fund futures for at least one 25 basis point increase in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve coming out of their four press conference FOMC meetings this year:March 2017: 29.5%June 2017: 71.2%September 2017: 85.7%December 2017: 95.2%And here are the same numbers a few weeks later as of Thursday:March 2017: 25.4%June 2017: 74.5%September 2017: 85.8%December 2017: 94.2%In short, expectations for rate hikes are effectively unchanged from where they were at the start of the year when the bond market was rallying. In fact, they are incrementally lower if anything, as expectations for the first hike is more definitively backed up to June while the notion of more rate hikes by the end of the year is marginally lower.So maybe then the recent pullback in U.S. bonds (NYSEARCA:AGG) is due to the recent compression in the relative yield advantage over competing high-quality government debt from around the world. Maybe, but these spreads remain near historical highs implying that U.S. Treasuries remain an attractive bargain relative to other key safe haven destinations from around the world.U.S. Treasuries continue to enjoy some of the most attractive yield margin over equivalently dated German Bunds in history. For bonds that once were at parity in yield terms only a few years ago, investors are now getting paid more than 2% for owning U.S. Treasuries over their German counterparts.A similar story holds for U.S. Treasuries relative to Japanese government bonds as investors are getting paid nearly a 2.5% premium by owning Treasuries over comparably dated Japanese bonds, which is the highest spread since 2010.The Bottom LineBonds have fallen off a bit in recent days. And they have had a difficult stretch since last summer. But it is important to remember the following. Not only is the nearly four decade long bond bull market still intact with yields finding their footing at current technical support with capital flows recently moving out of stocks and into bonds and interest rate expectations remaining largely in check, but U.S. bonds including Treasuries represent a relative bargain versus the high quality debt available around the world. And as an additional point, if capital markets were to ever take a turn for the worse going forward, the U.S. Treasury market has been and will remain the safe haven of choice for the global investment community.For all of these reasons and more, stay long bonds including U.S. Treasuries as part of a diversified asset allocation that includes stocks and other uncorrelated securities. Further short-term volatility should be expected, but the underlying fundamental thesis supporting such an allocation remains as sound as ever.Only Two Days Left: The DIY Investor Summit 2017 is underway and soon will be drawing to a close.

4040632,101638,2017-01-30T09:48:59-05:00,"Here's a fresh look at one of my least favorite asset classes.Follow along as I build the case against one of 2016's best performers.And if you're in these ETFs, don't forget to ask yourself: ""How much more do you want out of this?""","Okay, so high yield is high yield for a reason, right?I mean, it probably doesn't make much sense to be surprised when the fundamentals look bad. That's a lot like buying yourself some paper backed by subprime auto loans and then acting like you had no idea that two-thirds of the borrowers behind the assets in the collateral pool had FICOs under 550.Still, I can't help but wonder whether a combination of unusually high leverage, unusually tight spreads, and the presence of two problem sectors isn't a recipe for HY disaster. I talked a bit about this in a previous post.Generally speaking, what you get from me is a stream of consciousness with enough structure to satisfy editors. I don't do dry reports about where I think this or that is going to trade in six months. People who write those kinds of things seem to be unaware of the fact that making such predictions has historically been an exercise in futility (if you want proof of that contention, feel free to shoot me a message and I'll send you some academic studies). I have said that US 10s will likely trade above 3% at some point this year, but that's more a reflection of my penchant for black swans than it is some calculation about the intrinsic value of US debt.The point is, if you read Heisenberg, you're basically following along in real time as I develop theories about trends and themes driving broad asset classes. If you want to know where Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) is going to trade three months from now, I would suggest the best way to find out is to wait until May and check the stock price.So, here you are reading the latest in a series of posts documenting the evolution of my take on HY.As you know, energy is a big concern of mine when it comes to the space. My quarrel with the sector is well documented and multifaceted. But the main problem is that the rally off last February's spread blow out is based entirely (well maybe not ""entirely"") on the idea that the rally in crude prices is sustainable.Let's look at the energy story from an IG perspective. I think that's useful because the same dynamics are at play in higher grade credit, and to a certain extent, the best argument against HY energy (and thus HY in general) may be the fact that higher grade energy credits are equally risky. Consider the following from Wells Fargo:So that's investment grade energy. What do you think that says about high yield?But I've talked about energy enough. I wanted to say a few more things about HY's new problem child: retail (NYSEARCA:XRT).In a previous post, I touched briefly on the space, noting that it's clearly in jeopardy from the proposed border adjustment tax which, if implemented, would make all sorts of things vastly more expensive to obtain from overseas suppliers (I won't discuss it here, but ask yourself what that means for consumer spending and, in turn, for the economy).In addition to the border tax issue, HY retail stands to be the biggest loser from still another proposed tax change: the elimination of the deductibility of interest expense.As Deutsche Bank has shown, HY retail is the most exposed sector. While retail isn't the most exposed in terms of the percentage of issuers with interest expense that exceeds 50% of EBITDA (utilities gets that dubious title), it is the sector that's the most exposed when you take into account the benefit from accelerated capex depreciation. That is, the upfront depreciation offset is virtually immaterial to retail. Here's a chart that depicts this dynamic:(Chart: Deutsche Bank)But I've shown that before. Let's look at some new commentary and visuals from Wells Fargo.First, we look at HY energy versus HY retail. Via Wells:Right. So what's the outlook? Well, that depends, but the problem (as you might have surmised) lies in the composition of the HY retail space. Here's Wells again (my highlights):So basically, HY retail is completely devoid of issuers that operate in segments growing market share. And the mix is only going to get worse as the downgrades roll in.See this is what I'm talking about when I say you should watch trends and themes.Now as Detusche Bank reminds us, retail represents less than 5% of the USD HY index. Compare that to energy's 15% share in 2014. But here's the caveat, via Deutsche again:That's always how it starts - with commentary like that.You hear a lot of ""however""s and a lot of ""still""s. Eventually, those turn into a lot of ""as we warned""s and a lot of ""we cautioned""s.I think the important thing to understand here - or at least for someone like myself - is the context. This comes as HY continues to compress:(Charts: Goldman)The question you have to ask yourself if you're in something like the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:HYG) or the SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:JNK) is this: ""How much more do you actually expect to get out of this rally?""Or, perhaps more poignantly: ""How greedy are you?"""
4035120,24206,2017-01-09T03:13:36-05:00,,"This week, the Federal Reserve issued their latest meeting minutes. They viewed the labor market positively: unemployment and initial claims for unemployment were low while wages were increasing at slightly higher rates. PCEs were growing moderately and future indicators of consumer spending were bullish. Industrial production was recently unchanged, but mostly due to a drop in utility output. Business investment was still weak, but recent indicators showed a slight increase. The Fed is projecting slightly higher growth due to a perceived increase in fiscal spending and an increase in price pressures due to recent increases in energy prices.Credit markets are in strong good shape. Although rising inflation expectations (as measured by the spread between treasuries and TIPS) have led to a selloff in the treasury market, rates are still historically low:Corporate yields have also increased since the election:AAA (in blue) are near 5-year highs. But BBB credit (in red) is still low by recent standards. The recent increase in yields explains higher corporate issuance since the first of the year (subscription required):Consumer credit is also plentiful (from the Minutes):Consumers are in much stronger financial shape. The financial obligations and debt service payments ratio are near multi-decade lows as are credit card charge-offs (subscription required):There is nothing in the credit markets that indicates a problem is coming down the pike in the next 12-18 months.The Fed has not only increased their growth forecast, but also their inflation expectations. The former is higher due to the incoming administration's promise for lower taxes and higher federal spending, while the increase in the CMT-TIPS spreads has caused the latter. Increased federal spending is not guaranteed. While the Republicans control the House and have of late generally been more accepting of Trump's positions, a large conservative core may not want to increase deficit spending. Tax reform is a far more achievable goal. While most commentators have not offered this explanation, the OPEC supply restriction deal is just as likely an explanation for increased inflation expectations as the potential for an increase in federal spending and tax reform.Hale Stewart, XE.com"

To be sure, it's an important topic. Especially if you're somewhere you don't want to be and want to get out but that somewhere is now on a list of countries from which America will accept no new refugees.But you know, as sensitive as I am to that, it's not exactly like it came out of the clear blue. So much of what the new administration is doing was telegraphed last year that I'm not entirely sure why everyone is surprised. Remember, you can be horrified without acting surprised.We certainly can't equate damage to corporate ""citizens"" with damage to people. That said, I think the public (and especially the investing public to the extent the main wires care about that segment of the population) would benefit from some stories that take an impartial look at policies that may produce surprising (and sometimes counterintuitive) economic outcomes rather than continually harping on perceived affronts to humanity that we already knew were coming.One example, as I delineated earlier, is the fact that fiscal stimulus is unlikely to have the pronounced effect on growth that the market seems to be pricing in. It's not Trump's fault, it's just too late in the cycle for that kind of thing to be effective - especially when the Fed stands ready to cool off an overheating economy with potentially aggressive tightening measures.(Chart: Goldman)Here I want to expand on a post that I feel didn't get as much attention as it probably deserved given the implications for investors.Although the details are still foggy (to say the least), there's a possibility that the loss of the deductibility of interest expense (which supposedly will mitigate the government revenue lost to lower statutory tax rates) will cripple the earnings of highly leveraged companies.Specifically, Citi's Matt King has shown that high yield corporations with interest coverage ratios of 4X or less will be worse off under a system that lowers corporate taxes but eliminates interest expense deductibility. Here's the visual:(Tables: Citi)That, I've argued, is one more strike against high yield (NYSEARCA:HYG). Here are some others:In a note out last Monday, Deutsche Bank took a look at the same problem. That is, the bank looked at the implications of the loss of interest expense deductibility for HY issuers. The results were not encouraging. Consider the following (my highlights):Now you might be wondering what the difference is between the light blue bars and the dark blue bars. Essentially, the dark blue bars represent each respective sector's exposure after taking into account the offsetting benefit associated with upfront capex depreciation (another proposed change in the system).In other words, the sectors with the longest dark blue bars are those most exposed after everything is taken into account. As you can see, the retail (NYSEARCA:XRT) space is especially vulnerable due, as Deutsche Bank notes, to the fact that ""there was no meaningful capex in this credit cycle.""As the bank goes on to conclude, media, metals, and healthcare are also at risk in this model.But irrespective of the specific sector risk, the broader point is that this is bad news for high yield as a whole.Indeed, as mentioned above, it would be the equivalent of a recession for a large number of issuers. Why, you might ask, would you knowingly throw such a large percentage of HY to the fire?On that note, I'll give the last word to Deutsche Bank:"
4044901,101638,2017-02-10T12:34:04-05:00,"If you're in corporate bond ETFs, I implore you to think very seriously about what you may be up against.Owning something pegged to a market you don't fully understand can work out ok in a benign environment.But this environment is anything but.","I have some bad news.The outlook for credit, both investment grade and high yield, no longer admits of any ambiguity.Whether you know it or not as a holder of retail corporate bond products like the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:LQD) or the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:HYG), no one who trades these markets professionally is mincing words anymore.This trade is over. Done with. Kaput. You're going to be a bag holder. The only question is how much pain is in the cards.And bear in mind, I'm just giving you the real story here. I have no positions (cash or synthetic) in these markets and there is literally zero chance of me putting on any such trades in the foreseeable future.Earlier this week, I quoted Citi which, in no uncertain terms, described how it views anyone still long credit in the current environment. ""It would, in our view, be a huge leap of faith to assume that this can happen with no impact on asset prices,"" the bank wrote, referencing the plausibility of a thesis that suggests credit can remain buoyant while central banks pull back from markets.Remember, credit has rallied and rallied hard since this time last year. You can see the scope of that rally in the following chart:(Chart: Heisenberg, Morgan Stanley)And indeed, the retail money continues to chase it. Here's Goldman describing how swimmingly things went in January (my highlights):And have a look at IG issuance:(Chart: Goldman)HY issuance was more subdued last month, but, in an irony of ironies, that only added fuel to the rally (for a full rundown of HY's January performance see here). Here's Goldman again (my highlights):If ever there was an example of picking up pennies in front of a steamroller, this is it. Mark my words: this is it.Regular readers are well aware that I've created my own set of bullet points that serve as a kind of Cliffs Notes version of the longer argument for why the outlook for credit is so dour. Rather than repost those bullets for the umpteenth time, I'll give you Morgan Stanley's version from a note out this week. To wit (my highlights):Note the reference to an ""asymmetric asset class."" This is precisely what I argued on Wednesday in ""A Huge Leap Of Faith.""I want to note something else important here. It looks to me like retail interest in corporate credit is offsetting the shift from cash markets to derivatives, driving down the liquidity premium for holding cash bonds.Recall that due to concerns about cash market liquidity (i.e. the ability to transact in size and/or sell cash bonds at all), there's been a migration to markets where professionals think conditions are better. This is what UBS told clients earlier this month (my highlights):Note the bolded passage there and then look at this:(Chart: Morgan Stanley)See what's going on there? The basis blew out in early 2016 as investors effectively voted with their feet in terms of expressing their concerns about liquidity in the cash market. As credit rallied, the basis tightened, eroding the liquidity premium you're getting for owning the less liquid cash bonds.In other words, you're not getting paid very much to take the risk that the bonds underpinning your ETFs can't be sold in a pinch.""The cash-CDS basis is now at multi-year tights following a year of cash sharply outperforming synthetic instruments on the back of strong global demand for US corporate bonds,"" Morgan Stanley notes, before illustrating the point as follows:(Charts: Morgan Stanley)And it's the same story with the CDX-CDS basis (surprise, surprise). Look at the skew:(Chart: Morgan Stanley)Note that this is just an extension of the cash-CDS dynamic. That is, just as the liquidity premium for owning the cash bonds over CDS has evaporated with the rally, so too has the liquidity premium for owning individual name CDS versus the CDS index. Remember my post that cited the recent NY Fed study? It's that dynamic in reverse.Here's how Morgan Stanley sums it up (my highlights):If money managers were already inclined to express their views on credit through derivatives, they're only going to be more inclined now that there's virtually no compensation for taking liquidity risk in cash versus CDS and in CDS versus CDX. Or, as Morgan puts it, ""at the margin, we think this argues for liquid instruments, especially with such a compressed liquidity premium in credit today.""But here's the thing: there's literally nowhere to go here. Recall this from Citi:Right. So even if you're a fund manager with the money and the know-how to get exposure through relatively (and I strongly emphasize the word ""relatively"") attractive CDX, you're still getting into an absurdly rich market relative to fundamentals. Here, have a look:(Charts: Morgan Stanley)Here's how Morgan Stanley sums up that rather disgusting risk/reward tradeoff (my highlights):There's literally no value anywhere. The whole market is rich. Cash, CDS, and CDX. All of it.If you're holding corporate bond ETFs, just realize that the cash markets are the last place you want to be in this environment.Really, the only trade here looks to be something around volatility and something tells me the vast majority of readers won't be in the market to try and monetize this discrepancy:(Chart: Goldman)I realize this is a lot to digest, but I would strongly encourage retail investors in corporate credit (and based on January flows, there are more of these folks out there all the time) to consider that you are up against quite a few headwinds that you may not fully comprehend.And while that might be ok in an environment where the valuations, the cycle, and the fundamentals aren't stacked against you, that is most assuredly not the case here."
4036121,98996,2017-01-11T15:32:40-05:00,,"Celery and raspberry? Marathon miles of Sudoku and crossword puzzles? Extra reps at the gym? Binge away.'Tis the season after the season, that other most wonderful time of the year when it's a challenge to get a machine at the gym and resolutions are resolute, at least until February or a more intriguing deal comes along. What better way to make amends for that huge holiday hangover that crescendos with so many a New Year's Eve bash?Some of us chose to ring in 2017 in a substantially more subdued manner that nevertheless entailed binging of a decidedly different derivation. Enter Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Yours truly must confess that closet claustrophobia was the culprit in keeping this one indoors coveting the control, confining the choices to richly royal romps. It all started innocently enough, with a recommendation to catch The Crown, which has just won a Golden Globe. The devolution that followed began in Italy, with Medici, stopped over in France, with Versailles, and round tripped back to England, with the epic saga that kicked off the modern day, small screen genre, The Tudors. At some point, hallucinations began to give the impression that all the series' stars had British accents. Wait, they actually did.Thankfully, at some point, bowl games snapped the spell and reality rudely reared its redemptive head before anyone else's head rolled (those royals were a bloodthirsty lot!). Sleep and sanity followed.Sadly, the same cannot be said of borrowers of almost every stripe these days. For those tapping the fixed income markets, the borrowing bingefest is conspicuous in its constancy. Not only did global bond issuance top $6.6 trillion last year, a fresh record, sales are off to a galloping start thus far in January.In the lead are corporate bond sales, which accounted for $3.6 trillion of last year's super sales. To not be outdone, investors ran a full out sprint in the new year's first trading week, ""shattering,"" not breaking records, in the words of New Albion Partners' Brian Reynolds. In the first three trading days of the year alone, investors bought $56 billion of new corporate bonds. Some context in the context of what's been one record-breaking year after another in issuance:For those of you who have ever had the pleasure of a good, long visit with Reynolds, he is anything but prone to using exclamation points. (!)In any event, waves of heavy issuance often coincide with big deals carrying 'concessions,' or enticements in the form of higher yields than what the issuer's existing bonds offer. Despite 2017's already extraordinary deal flow, a good number of issues stood precedence on its head, coming out of the gate with negative concessions. ""It's as if corporate bond buyers are rabid, as if there are not enough corporate bonds to go around, even though there is a record amount of corporate bonds!"" added Reynolds.The kicker - there always is one when fever sets in - is that issuers are earmarking proceeds as generically as they can, for ""general corporate purposes."" In other words, they can use the sales proceeds for whatever they desire, including share buybacks.But wait! (Can exclamation points be contagious?) Haven't we just learned that buybacks took a nosedive in the latest Standard & Poor's data release? That quarter-over-quarter share repurchases had fallen by 12 percent and tanked by a stunning 25.5 percent over 2015's third quarter? What superb sleuthing you've done, Watkins!And right you are, except this one little thing. The pre-election world is so passé.What are the odds share repurchases reaccelerate under the new administration? In one word 'growing,' fed by two springs. The first is mathematically driven. CalPERS, the country's largest pension, recently announced it would be ""gradually"" lowering its rate of return target to 7.0 percent from 7.5 percent. In the nothing-is-free department, estimates suggest taxpayers will have to cough up an additional $2 billion per year to make up for what the pension no longer anticipates in the form of pension returns.(Suspend reality as the pension returned 0.61 percent in its most recent fiscal year ended June 30. We could ride off on a tangent but link to this if you'd like to hear more on pensions' prospects.)The funny thing is California governor Jerry Brown just announced he anticipates the state will run a $1.6 billion deficit by next summer as the tax base continues to atrophy driven by - wait for it - rising taxes. And where are a lot of those tax dollars going? You guessed right again - backfilling that yawning pension gap. Will the exodus out of the Golden State continue, leaving only the uber-wealthy and economically immobile behind? You tell me.Promise there's a point here. CalPERS will lead the way to other pensions also lowering their rate of return targets, which will in short order triggers more in the way of rising taxes and, it follows, more actual monies pensions allocate to fresh investments to thereby generate those fairy tale returns. To stay deeply deluded and convince oneself (still) high returns are achievable, the de rigueur investment is private equity credit funds in their many high voltage varieties. At Reynolds' last count, pensions have voted a record dollar amount into credit every single month since the stock market panic of 2015.And the momentum just keeps building. December 2015's record pension credit fund inflows of $7.3 billion were blown to bits by this past December's $10.6 billion - and that's before any leverage is put to work. As we have hopefully learned, the credit machine feeds the buyback machine, and away we go. Tack on the prospects of a Republican Congress facilitating the repatriation of all that offshore cash and you've got the makings of a true buyback renaissance. Oh, and by the way, a seriously overvalued bond market.Jesse Felder, president of Felder Investment Research, recently put pen to paper to quantify the value investors get today. What sets Felder apart from the crowd, in a good way, is that he factors in the backdrop of record bond issuance feeding what had, until very recently, been a record pace of share buybacks.""When you look at corporate valuations more comprehensively, including both debt and equity, we have now matched that prior period,"" Felder wrote in a recent report, referring back to peak dotcom bubble valuations. To arrive at this conclusion, he compares the value of non-financial corporate debt and equity relative to gross value added, an effective gauge of enterprise value-to-sales.How does Felder calculate such a clever metric? With the help of some Federal Reserve data, no less, he incorporates the buyback bout to create a holistic valuation methodology to capture comprehensive corporate valuations. Because one frenzy, bond sales, has fed the other, the stock market's historic run by way of share count reduction, it's simply disingenuous to not marry the two. You can want to try, but it's futile to examine bond or stock valuations in a vacuum.The point, though, is not that the current rally will necessarily buckle under the weight of bloated valuations. To the contrary, pensions' sheer buying power, their trillions upon trillions of dollars of monies to be allocated, can indeed make it appear that we are now in 1999, or better yet, 1996. But don't be fooled - you're still paying a dear price to play with fire.So stop yourself the next time you hear some talking head reassuring you that the price-to-earnings ratio on a trailing 12-month basis is dirt cheap. Fight the temptation to validate your sense of security by proclaiming, ""Wow, that erudite expert has some set of lobes!"" Don't just move on to the next episode, hitting BUY on that equity ETF. Stop and ask yourself just how profoundly this deep thinker has probed into the true drivers of valuations in recent years. More to the point, ask yourself whether the source is clean or compromised.If you need inspiration, look to some of the greatest lines ever penned in Politics and the English Language by George Orwell:And yes, Orwell was English. You can safely read his words aloud, with a British accent."
4034603,101638,2017-01-05T14:41:52-05:00,"It's that time again.Time to revisit the ongoing fallout from the global USD shortage.This go around, let's have a look at the prospects for US corporate credit.","It's funny how some topics sit well and others just don't.There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to what grates an audience's nerves, although I suppose if I knew everyone's particular circumstances, I could surmise why some subjects are taboo and others aren't.Of course, it's always the contentious topics that create the best discussions and that's precisely because, whether a reader realizes it or not, the only way to become more confident in your convictions is to subject them to scrutiny. And if scrutiny is what you need, I've got a surplus of it stored away in my head.In any event, one subject that everyone seems to find agreeable is the global dollar shortage. I cannot, for the life of me, figure out why everyone is so enthusiastic about a topic that necessitates a discussion of LIBOR and things like cross-currency basis swaps (maybe it's a sense of nostalgia for the Heisenberg gimlet threshold, FRYBOR, and the Albanian girls), but I certainly like writing about it and if you like reading about it then we've got ourselves a win-win.When last I broached the subject, I talked a bit about why foreign investors might be more inclined to run higher FX exposures. More specifically, I highlighted a Morgan Stanley note that quantified the yield pickup a Japanese investor could expect from running an unhedged position in US credit. Basically, you just subtract the cross currency basis from the yield on the instrument you're buying. Here's a visual aid using US 10s:(Chart: Morgan Stanley)So let's think about what that means for IG (NYSEARCA:LQD) credit. Needless to say, corporate credit has benefited from rock bottom rates on DM government debt. Indeed, ZIRP and NIRP have forced investors to reach for yield and that means climbing down the quality ladder, taking more duration risk, or both. As discussed previously, that leads to more IG and HY supply, which in turn means more EPS-inflating buybacks.The fact that rates are even lower in Europe and Japan than they are in the US means foreign money has contributed to the demand for US corporate paper.But now, with the policy divergence between the US and Europe/Japan fueling wider cross-currency bases and thus higher hedging costs, it's entirely possible that foreign demand for US IG paper will begin to dry up, removing one of the market's embedded cushions against a bond sell-off.Here are some bullet points and graphs from Deutsche Bank that illustrate how much lower the (hedged) yield pickup is now in US IG than it was at the start of 2016 (my highlights):Deutsche Bank goes on to note that rising UST yields have helped to mitigate the hunt for yield, but the stronger USD and commensurate rise in hedging costs makes it a zero-sum game.Here's where it gets disturbing. Consider the list of measures foreign investors are taking to increase the yield on their investments (emphasis in original):In other words, foreign money is taking on more and more risk in order to tack on a few extra basis points wherever possible. Needless to say, that money will be glad to adopt a more conservative investment strategy once rates on risk-free DM government debt finally rise.Deutsche Bank also provides a very interesting real-world example of how important the foreign bid is when it comes to mitigating a quick move higher in domestic rates (just like what many observers think we're about to see in the US). To wit (my highlights):In other words, the foreign bid is very useful in a pinch, but the high cost of hedging could discourage inflows.So the moral of the story: The global USD shortage in conjunction with a growing policy divergence between the Fed and other DM central banks threatens to wipe out the foreign bid for US corporate credit in a market that's already nearing the end of the cycle. US credit investors (both IG and HY) should be aware of this dynamic.As for the equity (NYSEARCA:SPY) investors out there, I'll leave you with one chart:(Chart: Morgan Stanley)"
4037223,29681,2017-01-17T07:28:02-05:00,"After the recent Federal Reserve rate rise, interest rates are set to rise.After Donald Trump's election, tax cuts and deregulation should spur economic growth and inflation.Both of these factors make risky investments increasingly attractive, and safe haven assets should be sold off.","Equities and fixed-income securities have traditionally been negatively correlated. This historical trend has been somewhat turned on its head in recent years as an increasingly dovish Federal Reserve kept in place a very loose monetary policy, leading bonds and equities to rise, and in tandem. We are seeing the traditional rotation between equities and bonds reassert itself as the Fed tightens monetary policy.The Federal Reserve Has ActedOn December 14th, 2016 the Federal Reserve ""decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent"" (Federal Reserve Press Release). Although expected, this was a marked departure from the dovish status quo Chairwoman Yellen has maintained, and is just the second rate hike in the last decade. Somewhat surprisingly, the Federal Reserve also forecast three rate rises in 2017. However, the Fed predicted no fewer than four rate rises in 2016, so whether they will follow though is anyone's guess. Nevertheless, economic growth is expected to be strong in the year ahead, and we should expect at least one more hike to offset expected inflation. So, from an investment position, a rising federal funds rate will lead to higher overall interest rates and a further rotation into equities from bonds.A Move Away From US Treasuries and Investment Grade PaperUS 10-Yr. Yield, Source: CNBC MoneyThe rotation into equities has already begun. After the US presidential election, the Dow (NYSEARCA:DIA) and the S&P (NYSEARCA:SPY) rallied, while US Treasuries sold off. As investors pour into riskier assets off a bullish outlook and a climate of rising rates, many safe bonds, including US Treasuries and investment grade paper, do not offer high enough yields. Yields have grown as US Treasuries have become less attractive. The 10-year Treasury yield rose from 1.8% before the election to just over 2.4% heading into the New Year.The Trump FactorRisk is where the answer lies. A growing economy and a fiscally bullish administration are both good signs for risky assets, including high yield fixed income and equities. The customary fixed-income investments don't offer a high enough risk-reward trade-off and barely outstrip inflation, if even that. We are in a climate where risky investments are more desirable. The movement towards equities from safe haven assets is indicative of the prevailing risk-on climate. The real catalyst for this movement was the election of Donald Trump.President-elect Trump will come into office on January 20th and will immediately embark on sweeping tax reform and deregulation. Much of his tax reform and regulatory changes will happen with little complaint, although he might run into difficulty with his spending plans. At least in the short-to-medium term, this bullish fiscal approach will benefit risky assets. There are more long-term risks to consider with Trump, particularly over trade and immigration. Also, the deregulation the Republicans seem intent on pursuing could result in the kind of ""boom and bust"" economy we saw in the 2000s. Nevertheless, in the next couple of years, the Trump administration's policies will be a strong net benefit to more risky assets.A Movement Towards High Yield BondsSafe fixed-income securities have attracted attention for some time as the safe haven assets of choice, while high yield bonds have missed most of the bullish run. According to Bill Eigan of JPMorgan, ""high-yield flows just turned positive toward the end of 2016,"" and this run will only be ""overdone when we see heavy retail flows, and that hasn't happened yet."" Given the current climate, we should expect to see institutional players selling off US government bonds and moving to higher-yield bonds.Potential High Yield OptionsThere are many high yield bonds that present attractive investments. High yield energy bonds are a particularly interesting option, as ""the rebound in the oil price from its low in January has... made high-yield energy bonds a top pick for next year.""Two of my favorite options are the BlackRock Corporate High Yield Fund (NYSE:HYT) and the SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:JNK).Take Care…We should look to late 2017 for any potential headwind to the risk-on environment which is so attractive to high yield bonds. While the Fed is forecasting rate to rise, any tapering off of growth expectations might hamper future raises. It will be important to understand when in Trump's presidency we might start to see more bearish economic data and the impact that data will have, considering the current very bullish expectations for the future."

The BlackVault Investments bond portfolio has done well this year investing in junk bonds, primarily in the Oil & Energy sector, netting the portfolio a very pleasing 22.5%+ return on the year. The core portfolio consists of bonds with a weighted average of 2.75 years to maturity, limiting duration risk in a rising rates environment and uncertain credit market. These core positions have been held through the majority of 2016 with minor adjustments.A smaller portion of the portfolio is utilized in trades or small positions.Compared to the 10% year-end return of iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:HYG), I am very pleased with our portfolio's performance. It's been a tumultuous year all around so I've added the S&P 500 here for context. Junk bonds have now outperformed the S&P 500, excluding the past two recessions, by the most since 1993.Since the New Year, the Dynagas (NYSE:DLNG) 6.25% '19 position was sold at a gain of 13.10%. A position was expanded in Ocean Rig 6.50% '17 bonds.High-Yield Outlook 2017As of Dec. 22nd, U.S. economic growth was measured at 3.5%, a little hot, encouraging high corporate debt levels and spurred on by cheap money. Following the wave of Brexit puns post-June 23rd, I even heard cries of a ""Crexit"", driven by the swell in corporate debt.Our forecast for 2017 points towards a more modest 2.5% GDP growth rate, which may cool the default cycle and bring debt back to more manageable levels. That being said, I am hesitant to declare myself wholly bullish on high-yield, as too many things remain to be seen.One of the main points of 2016 was the level of corporate defaults. Defaults in 2016 were primarily driven by the energy and mining sectors. In a review, J.P. Morgan recently indicated that 84% of corporate defaults in 2016 were by commodity tied companies. Unfortunately, we're not quite yet over the hump. Early 2017 still sees another large chunk of bond issues maturing, a number of them I have myself seen in the distressed energy market.As a ballpark figure, Morgan Stanley research indicates defaults could hit 23% by 2019, take it with a grain of salt. That being said, I'm in favor of a near-term peak in high yield defaults in 2017, before tapering back down over the course of the year, cooling off namely due to a more controlled GDP growth rate trajectory.This is in fact a fair possibility. Last year, I mentioned to my colleagues around the office and wrote on Seeking Alpha about the steady rise in corporate defaults, and was not alone. The wave of defaults has culled many of those already at severe risk, namely in Oil & Energy as I see it. A stabilized oil outlook is a huge positive here. More on our outlook for oil here and here. Moreover, Moody's LSI (liquidity-stress index) has been receding over the last six months from a peak in March, painting an optimistic portrait for 2017 defaults. The index falls as corporate liquidity improves.Default rates peaked above 11% following each past recession of the last 25 years, but throughout the default cycle last year neither the default rate nor running projections rose this high. The running average default rate is 4%. The red bar, F 2017, is our forecast.Source: J.P. Morgan, BloombergCorporate default rates will also likely be suppressed by a large scale down in the number of borrowers classified with distressed debt:From another view, we have had our fourth consecutive annual declining of high-yield issuance:Fairly illiquid underlying securities of bond ETFs are still an area of concern as well. The central banks and pension fund driven search for yield to match obligations in today's credit market are forcing institutional and individual investors alike to plumb increasing depths for yield, moving down the capital structure and away from quality. A severe narrowing of the spread between high yield and investment grade could spark a rush for exit doors, doors that may be locked if redemptions on funds mount high enough. Should general sentiment on high-yield turn risk averse, the situation could become dire. The market will not sustain such flows.This may be redundant, but I expect that going into 2017, the high-yield market will continue to be heavily tied to commodity markets. Riding off the back of last years rally, I feel extremely cautious going forward, however stabilizing oil prices, corporate default and debt levels show potential relief. I am optimistic that there remain other high-yield corporate bond opportunities outside of the energy & mining sectors as well, providing good opportunities to diversify against turbulence in commodities and take profits off the table. In my opinion, the high yield bonds may have over stretched, HYG overperformance driven by optimism on crude despite massive energy defaults, the Fed suppression of rates, and the deep dive for yield across the board."
4032089,25166,2016-12-21T20:51:06-05:00,,"By Gershon DistenfeldStill casting about for a New Year's resolution? If you're an income-conscious investor, try this: expect that something unexpected will happen next year and act now to cushion your portfolio.That advice may seem to be at odds with the current mood. Financial markets have decided that the incoming Donald Trump administration means faster economic growth and higher inflation - both good things for higher-yielding, higher-risk assets such as high-yield bonds.We recognize the potential upside that a strong US economy and some of Trump's policies present, and we think investors should certainly maintain exposure to high-yielding assets.But what if everything doesn't go according to plan? What if Congress balks on some policy details? Or growth doesn't pick up as quickly as expected? When markets tilt too strongly in one direction, finding your inner contrarian can be good for your portfolio's health.Dialing Down High-Yield RiskContrarian does not mean pulling out of high yield altogether. A better idea might be to reduce risk by shortening maturities and focusing on quality. Our research has found that over time, high-quality, shorter-maturity bonds capture about 80% of upside moves in the high-yield market, but only about 70% of downside ones (Display).Why does this combination work so well? First, shorter maturities mean investors are less exposed to rising interest rates and just about any type of unexpected market hiccup. So they tend to hold up better in down markets.It's a similar story with credit quality. Higher-rated securities from companies with strong balance sheets can weather a period of higher borrowing costs and investment outflows better than the issuers of CCC-rated ""junk"" bonds.That's easy to forget when markets are booming. The broad US high-yield market is up more than 16% this year, and CCCs have been top performers; the more CCCs investors bought, the better they did.But this is not a viable long-term strategy, particularly at this late stage of the credit cycle. Even if the new policies do unleash faster growth, the inevitable rise in interest rates could push some CCC-rated issuers toward default.Reaching Beyond CorporatesThere's income to be had beyond high-yield corporates, of course. That's why a global, multi-sector approach is so important. The most effective high-income strategies seek diversification by drawing on multiple sources of income from around the world.Among them are emerging-market local-currency bonds. While high-yield corporates extended the year's rally after the US election results, these assets sold off sharply for fear of higher US interest rates and Trump's protectionist trade policies.That left valuations attractive in many cases - especially on assets from countries that have been cracking down on corruption and embracing tighter fiscal policies.Another potential income generator - and diversifier: US securitized assets, particularly credit risk transfer securities (CRTs) from US government housing agencies Fannie Mae (OTCQB:FNMA) and Freddie Mac (OTCQB:FMCC). These allow investors to tap into a strong US housing market, and their floating rates make them appealing in a rising rate environment. Unlike typical agency debt, they have credit risk. But investors are compensated handsomely for it with high yields.Recalibrating an investment strategy - even if only slightly - is always a good idea; we should all do it periodically throughout the year, not just in January. But with all the uncertainties facing investors now, it seems like a no-brainer this year.By all means, we think investors should continue to lean toward high-yielding assets in 2017. But selectivity and diversification are critically important.

Except for inflation-indexed Treasuries and foreign developed-market government bonds, all the major asset classes posted gains in December. For the year overall, everything was up, except for cash (three-month T-bills). The positive skew for 2016 marks a bullish change from 2015's year-end summary, when red ink weighed on most markets.Last month's big winner: US real estate investment trusts (MSCI REIT), which bounced back in December with a strong 4.7% total return after sliding for four straight months. December's biggest loser: foreign developed-market government bonds (Citi WGBI ex-US), which slumped 1.0% in last year's closing month.For the year, US junk bonds topped the list. Markit's iBoxx Liquid High Yield Index surged 15.3% in 2016, beating the 12.8% increase for the number-two performer (US stocks via the Russell 3000) by a comfortable margin. The only loser among the major asset classes last year: cash (three-month T-bills), which inched down 0.1%.The upside bias in December lifted the Global Market Index (GMI), an unmanaged benchmark that holds all the major asset classes in market-value weights. GMI added 1.5% last month, boosting the benchmark's total return for 2016 to a respectable 6.5%."
4030919,25166,2016-12-16T06:08:44-05:00,,"By Erin BigleySo following the election, we think that the range of potential outcomes has really widened. What the market is pricing in, knowing that we've got a Trump administration and a Republican Congress, is a pro-growth, moderate increase in inflation type of environment, which is good for risk assets like high yield bonds.What is not necessarily being recognized or priced into the markets is the potential for a larger negative tail.If things don't work out as rosy as currently priced in - and we see a geopolitical event or we see growth not picking up as we expect - that downside tail could be much bigger.And so what do you do in that environment? You do still want to lean into growth assets, risk assets - like high yield - because the potential upside is still there, but you want to try to find ways to buffer the downside.To us, that means shorten up your maturities and go higher quality. We have seen time after time that just taking those two simple steps - focusing on shorter maturities and raising the quality of a high yield portfolio - can actually buffer the downside, giving you roughly two-thirds of the downside in a high-volatility environment, with about 80% or so of the upside.The other thing that you can do within a higher-yielding portfolio is to think beyond just corporate high yield. Corporate high yield has been on a great tear so far this year - it's up about 15% for the year to date, and it's been rising largely on the back of lower-quality, energy-driven sectors.At this point, it's a great time to take a step back and think about what's the best strategy going forward. And we think it is looking beyond the corporate high yield sector to other bonds that have high yields but are in different areas.For example, the emerging markets have sold off - pretty meaningfully - in the wake of the election, so we've been adding some local currency emerging market bonds to the portfolio and actually keeping some unhedged currency, which provides you with yield in a different way from corporates and gives you some nice liquidity, particularly in the currency.The other thing that we've been doing is to look to additional sectors, like the mortgage market in the United States. Now these aren't your low-yielding guaranteed agency pass-throughs. These are credit risk-sharing transactions, or CRTs. They're issued by Fannie and Freddie, but they have some credit risk associated with them. But accordingly, you're being paid high yield-like yields.The other thing we really like about CRTs is that, number one, the fundamentals are solid. The US real estate market continues to improve, and so you're tapping into a fundamentally improving sector. Also, they're floating-rate securities. So they're tied to a floating-rate one-month LIBOR. So in the environment that we've seen of rising rates, these securities should be buffered.Going into 2017, we think it still makes sense to have a bias within your fixed-income portfolio to be overweight growth assets, credit assets - like higher-yielding bonds.But you need to be very focused and very selective on what types of high yield bonds do you own. So you want to make sure you're avoiding the lowest-quality sectors. You want to make sure you're not going too far out in terms of maturities. You want to make sure that you're not owning too much in the corporate-only sector and that you're looking farther afield, whether that be through geography - by looking to the emerging markets - or looking to other sectors like securitizations, where we're tapping into credit risk-sharing mortgage transactions.The views expressed herein do not constitute research, investment advice or trade recommendations and do not necessarily represent the views of all AB portfolio management teams."
4031114,68695,2016-12-17T08:58:12-05:00,"High-yield credits have performed well over the last several years, leading to many voicing concerns about a bubble in “junk bonds”.However, this run-up is really just a recognition by the markets of what has historically been a significant mispricing, with aggregate CDS and Intrinsic CDS (iCDS) values converging.This convergence does indicate however, that the market may be fully-valued, and it will require even more diligence to make money in the fixed income markets going forward.","Anytime an asset, or group of assets, sees material improvements in value, investors begin to worry. As investors are naturally risk-averse, we are prone to questioning whether the recent run-up in our favorite investment idea means it's time to get out. After all we don't want to re-live the late 90s or the mid-aughts if we can avoid it. The term bubble gets thrown around often in the investing community, and any outsized return results in calls for a looming bear market. The recent strong performance of high-yield credit markets is far from immune to this, and a simple google search of the high-yield market outlook resulted in the following (all on the front page):September 28, 2015 - There's a New, Massive Threat to the U.S. Economy, TimeApril 11, 2016 - UBS Says Junk Bond Bubble Just a Slowdown Away From Popping, BloombergApril 14, 2016 - There's a $1 trillion bubble that's ready to burst, Business InsiderJuly 22, 2016 - Analyst: Junk Bond Bubble is About to Burst, ETF Daily NewsAugust 25, 2016 - Is There a Bond Market Bubble?, CFA InstituteOctober 9, 2016 - Is the Bond Market in a Bubble?, Wall Street JournalNot only has the high-yield market kept pace with the equity market over the last year (13.27% return for Barclays High Yield ETF (NYSEARCA:JNK) versus 13.57% return for the SPY), but in aggregate, pricing on credit default swaps in the high-yield market has come down substantially since 2010-2011, driving concerns that the run may be coming to an end, as it has been building for over five years. Many point to the recent spike in yields post-election as a sign of this.In the chart above, we highlight trends in aggregate CDS for the three major classes of corporate debt, Investment Grade (IG), Cross-over credits (lower medium grade credits that don't quite merit an IG designation - XO), and High Yield (HY).The multi-year trend of HY credits appears to reflect the market's slow recognition of safer fundamental risk, where CDS has collapsed from 1,000bps+ levels to ~400bps levels over the last several years.So what does this trend mean? Does the fact that HY credits, which were priced at levels nearly 5x their IG peers only 5 years ago, and are now trading at only a 200bps premium to Investment Grade credits, indicate that that market is far too heated?Intrinsic Credit Risk - iCDSUsing Valens' Intrinsic CDS metrics, which are derived from Uniform Adjusted Financial Reporting Standards (UAFRS), it is clear the answer is no. Moreover, it is apparent that the markets are just now correcting after years of overpessimism.One of the benefits of UAFRS, is that it is easier to identify intrinsic credit risk, just as you would identify the intrinsic value of a stock. When using traditional metrics, such as interest coverage, cash flow to debt, debt to equity and the like, as-reported numbers makes it impossible to compare from company to company within an industry, let alone across the entire high-yield universe. However, when using a uniform standard to adjust for the accounting distortions found in GAAP and IFRS, one can more accurately understand both economic profitability of a firm, and also how this compares to peers.Similarly, UAFRS based adjustments allow for a more accurate understanding of a firm's ability to service obligations, which at the end of the day, is all that is important to debt investors. Combining improved understanding of firms' liquidity with the ability to quickly compare credit risk relative to peers allows one to come up with an intrinsic value of risk.Valens' intrinsic CDS metric, or iCDS, is a factor of several variables, including a firm's ability to service obligations, both operating and debt-servicing related, the recovery rate on debt should the firm default, and their ability to access liquidity, should cash flows falter in the future.The chart above highlights the aggregate iCDS for all three groups of corporate debt for the last several years. What is initially apparent is that CDS has been far more volatile than the actual intrinsic risk of the firms themselves. What is also apparent is that high yield iCDS has ranged from ~400-600bps since late 2011, levels CDS markets only reflected consistently starting in 2013-2014, indicating that the run in pricing was actually just the market reflecting intrinsic risk, albeit materially delayed.What are the implications?What this indicates to us is that the market is definitely not in a bubble, but ""fully priced"" considering the fact that iCDS and as-reported CDS are now roughly in-line. Said differently, we may be entering a ""bond-pickers market"" to steal a phrase from the equity markets. In order to do so however, diligent adjusting of financials is required, as traditional metrics and services (such as traditional ratings agencies) don't offer the depth or accurateness required to be consistently correct going forward.The one place where there still appears to be macro, as opposed to company specific, mispricing is in the cross-over universe, between Investment Grade and High Yield bonds. These bonds specifically are being treated like they are High Yield, while their characteristics have grown to be more like the Investment Grade credits.While we can breathe a sigh of relief that the world is not falling on the bond markets, or even the high yield markets in particular, making money in fixed income may soon require more work, as the tide is no longer rising to lift all boats.AppendixValens' creates proprietary CDS baskets for the U.S. market, based on the 270+ companies that have liquidly-traded CDS. Those baskets are based on the company's corporate credit rating. By looking at each of these baskets against themselves over time, and against each other, insights can be gleaned in terms of when the market is panicking, when credit risk is improving, and when there are potentially interesting relative value trade opportunities.We also use our proprietary Intrinsic CDS (iCDS) to create baskets for the same companies, showing the company's fundamental credit risk, compared to their market credit risk, based on CDS. By comparing the iCDS for the different baskets to CDS, further opportunities for finding undervalued or overvalued credits can be presented. iCDS is Valens' ""fair value"" of credit risk metric, priced in bps and comparable to CDS. Please refer to the following charts to see the spreads between CDS and iCDS levels for each of the baskets."

        Have we come too far too fast?
        Here's everything you need to know about the market heading into 2017.","Early Wednesday morning I began the Heisenberg daily kickstart with the following quote from former PIMCO chief Mohamed El-Erian:I was turning those two sentences over in my head at lunch while picking through some overwrought wild mushroom risotto when it occurred to me that although I've spent most of my career black swan watching, the idea of hedging tail risk almost never finds its way into my personal life.Thinking about what might go wrong is second nature to me when it comes to thinking about markets. But when it comes to taking risks in life I can scarcely remember a time when I've applied the same level of circumspection as that I employ when gauging investment opportunities.Now maybe that's a good thing. I've certainly done a lot of living for someone my age (that's a story for another time). Or maybe it's a bad thing. Just last month a real-life black swan landed on my pancreas and proceeded to escort me directly to death's doorstep.I suspect my approach to markets is probably the safer bet. To paraphrase El-Erian, failing to price in any ""accidents"" whatsoever while simultaneously ignoring ""all sorts"" of ""issues"" is a rather perilous road to take whether looking after one's life or one's investments.Whether or not I'll henceforth keep a closer eye on lifestyle risks remains to be seen, but I can say with some degree of certainty that I'm unlikely to abandon my approach to markets any time soon.That is, I'll continue to keep my eyes peeled for potential tail risks.Tail risks like the collapse of the HY bond market (NYSEARCA:HYG).For around two years now, I've been pounding the proverbial table on the risks associated with junk bond ETFs. The issue I see is pretty simple to explain.Artificially suppressed rates have pushed investors further and further down the quality ladder in what has become a seemingly interminable quest for yield. That insatiable appetite has helped to keep capital markets open for borrowers that might otherwise have lost access.The problem for HY ETFs is that there really is no market for the underlying bonds thanks to a post-crisis regulatory regime that's effectively scared the Street away from its traditional role as market maker. In short, Wall Street doesn't want to inventory bonds anymore and if the Street's books aren't available, managers with outflows are forced to sell portfolio products (like ETFs) to managers with inflows. The flows thus offset and are known as ""diversifiable.""(Chart: JPMorgan; Flowcharts: Barclays)So what happens, you might ask, when flows aren't diversifiable? What if they are unidirectional? Or, in layman's terms: what if everyone in the theatre wants out at once?Well, then you've got yourself a problem if you're a manager. You have to meet redemption requests, but so do all of your friends, so now instead of trading ETFs and portfolio products back and forth between yourselves, everyone needs to sell the actual bonds behind the ETF units. In the good old days, Wall Street would have opened up its balance sheet and inventoried the paper. There would have been liquidity. But not now. Now no one wants the bonds and thanks to the fact that everyone has been swapping portfolio products rather than trading the underlying, they're even more illiquid than they otherwise would have been. This sets up a fire sale - everything must go. The bonds plunge and so do the ETFs.I've argued that the Fed has made this scenario far more likely by keeping rates low for so long. By suppressing rates, officials have effectively kept a bid under paper issued by corporates that otherwise might have gone the way of the Dodo. You might not want to buy bonds issued by a US E&P, but you will if you can't get anything in terms of yield from IG paper. In this way, the Fed effectively destroyed creative destruction and thereby contributed to the disinflationary impulse that for years gripped the economy.Now I thought that eventually the HY energy defaults would start to pile up, weaker companies would see their RBL lines cut, and before long, there would be a mass exodus from HY triggering the self-feeding dynamic described above.I was right about one thing: the defaults did indeed pile up. Here's Goldman:But instead of underperforming, HY has massively outperformed, helped in large part by the rally in crude prices off the February lows:Here's Goldman again:To boot, all five of the top weeks for HY inflows and all but one of the top five weeks for HY outflows occurred this year:(Table: Goldman)Here's a bit of color that's particularly salient given everything said above:Note two things there: single name depth ""remains challenged"" and ""macro products"" are being used to plug liquidity holes. In other words, the problems are still there it's just that no one has panicked yet.Just so you get a good idea of how truly impressive the bounce off the February lows was, have a look at the following graphics:(Graphics: Goldman)Ok, so if you've read all of this closely, you might be asking yourself the following question: if defaults on HY energy names are near all-time highs, the market has already rallied massively (see spread compression below, left pane), the percentage of HY bonds trading sub-$80 has plunged (middle pane below), and HY is trading massively rich to fair value (right pane below), then why should we not be more scared now than ever?(Left, middle panes: Goldman; right pane: Wells Fargo)Well, the answer is we probably should be - scared that is. But don't tell that to Goldman. Here's the bank's forecast (emphasis mine):So you know, make your own decision here, but after a 16% run, you may want to consider whether El-Erian is correct to suggest that ""it makes perfect sense to take some off the table."""
4029714,25321,2016-12-11T10:02:31-05:00,"The yield on the high yield corporate bond market is now atop the yield on the high yield corporate bond market ex-Energy.This distinction in the high yield bond market was formed during the massive dislocation in high yield energy bonds, which saw their average yield move into the high teens.After a great run in 2016, the article discusses the outlook for the high yield bond market in 2017.","In the last week, the high yield market has seen a unique circumstance occur that had been two years in the making. The High Yield Index is now trading atop the High Yield Index (ex-Energy).Why is this distinction important? The High Yield Index (ex-Energy) was created due to the massive dislocation in speculative grade energy bonds that occurred as oil prices tanked. Market participants wanted to understand the yield on non-commodity sensitive names as Energy issuers tanked. Today, Energy bonds are now trading at a yield-to-worst roughly atop the broader market as demonstrated on the graph below.Source: Bloomberg; BarclaysHigh yield bonds have had a great year in 2016, returning 16.3% year-to-date through Friday. The SPDR Bloomberg Barclays High Yield Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:JNK) had returned 13.9% and the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:HYG) has returned 13.0%.The Energy sub-component of the High Yield index has returned 36.4% year-to-date. Looking at the graph of these two most popular exchange-traded funds, and you can see that returns troughed in February as oil troughed.Source: BloombergAfter this tremendous rally for high yield Energy bonds, the average Energy constituent is now trading at 98% of par. When Energy bonds were last trading atop the broader index, oil prices were in the $80's in late 2014.Historically, high yield Energy has traded tighter than the broader index. Picture a small exploration and production company. That company typically would have divisible and liquid assets in the form of acreage that it could sell in the event of financial distress. Deep and liquid hedging markets for oil and gas can offer some short-term downside protection to producers. For these reasons, recoveries on defaulted Energy bonds had traditionally been higher than non-Energy bonds.Today, high yield investors have gleaned much of the returns from the oil rebound even as prices have only made it into the low-$50s post-OPEC. The further upside is limited, while the downside is still meaningful. The high yield market is uniquely exposed to the global competitiveness of North American oil and gas, and as we have seen, lower cost sovereign producers can increase supply and pressure domestic producers.What does this mean for Seeking Alpha investors? The energy-influenced High Yield bond rally is likely in the rearview. After this rally, Energy bonds now have much more downside; however, bond prices are likely to be more sticky in another oil price correction. Modest spread tightening is likely to continue in the short-run as a result of the market's increased expectation for pro-growth economic policies and calendar effects in the high yield bond market. High yield corporate bond defaults in 2017 will likely be lower than in 2016, but returns cannot echo the strong performance of 2016 as there is just less room to run after the rally.DisclaimerMy articles may contain statements and projections that are forward-looking in nature, and therefore inherently subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

4029333,25321,2016-12-08T19:47:08-05:00,"A seasonal supply/demand imbalance in high-yield bond markets has traditionally led to strong performance in December and January.While these anomalous returns have not persisted in recent years, I argue that was a function of the impact of oil prices on an oily HY market.I suggest that the strong gains of high-yield bonds are expected to continue over the next several weeks.","One of my favorite market anomalies is well underway, and it likely has meaningful implications for Seeking Alpha's fixed income investors. Since the advent of the modern high-yield debt market in the early 1980s, there has been a bankable calendar trade that has persisted. In the table below, readers can see that the highest excess returns over Treasuries in the high-yield market have historically been experienced in December (+1.76%) and January (+1.24%).These two months, which make up one-sixth of the calendar year, have historically generated one-third of the returns of the high-yield bond market.This reliable calendar effect is likely driven by a confluence of factors. Unlike equity markets, which will produce only several dozen domestic IPOs in even the most bullish of years, multiple, new high-yield bond issues will come to market each day when credit investors are receptive. While we have seen an uptick in primary supply in the high-yield market in the second half of 2016, markets still slow down materially around the Christmas holiday and early in the new year. In a dealer-driven market as opposed to the exchange-traded equity markets, market participants need to be at their desks to support deal flow. Issuers will obviously not bring deals if a market holiday slackens demand, increasing yield and interest expense on term debt that will be outstanding for many years. This is an especially acute issue for more levered high-yield borrowers who must remain focused on financing costs. This temporary absence of supply combined with a re-setting of return objectives at high-yield buyers at the beginning of the calendar year could lead to a favorable demand/supply imbalance that increases prices early in the new year.Astute observers will note that this calendar effect did not hold over the last two years. December 2015 and January 2016 were each month's worst monthly excess returns in the 30-plus year dataset. Returns were also weak in late 2014 and early 2015. While this could be a sign that the efficacy of this trade is waning, I would counter that the impact of falling oil prices had a disproportionately negative impact on the market that swamped the typical spread tightening that the holiday-influenced supply/demand imbalance creates.As I wrote in Oil And The Bifurcation Of High Yield, the Energy weight in the high-yield debt market tripled post-crisis as capital flowed to speculative grade shale companies. The drawdown in oil prices led to spread widening late in 2014 and early in 2016 that saw the market experience rare negative excess returns in typically strong months for high-yield bond investors.High-yield bonds have generated impressive returns in 2016, registering a 15% total return through the end of November. While some might be tempted to harvest their gains, I believe that we are likely to see spreads grind tighter through the remainder of the year and early in 2017.DisclaimerMy articles may contain statements and projections that are forward-looking in nature, and therefore inherently subject to numerous risks, uncertainties and assumptions.

4025419,98386,2016-11-22T07:59:42-05:00,"Since U.S. Treasury yields hit an all-time low during the third quarter, the hunt for yield has been top of mind for investors.We wonder if the answer is right in front of us, but we are too focused on what we know to see it.A closer examination of traditional fixed income markets reveals opportunities to find the yield investors seek, but they may not realize is available.","Since U.S. Treasury yields hit an all-time low in the beginning of the third quarter, the so-called hunt for yield has been a major topic for investors. Yet the search for yield reminds us of the famous psychology experiment and later YouTube sensation of The Invisible Gorilla. In that video, observers are asked to closely watch players and count how many times they passed a ball back and forth. As the observer focuses on the number of passes, a person in a gorilla suit walks through the middle of the screen. As comically obvious as this sounds, about half of viewers have no awareness of the gorilla whatsoever.As we repeatedly hear the accepted orthodoxy that there is no yield in fixed income and investors continue to look to alternatives either within or across asset classes, we ponder if the answer is right in front of us, hiding in plain sight, but we are too focused on what we know to see it. As we examine the fixed income landscape, we try not only to count the number of passes, but to see the gorilla as well. We examine four of these invisible dancing gorillas that offer investors yield, but are hidden to those focused elsewhere.Gorilla #1: What if the Grass isn't GreenerAs we have discussed in previous pieces, the U.S. yield environment remains quite attractive in a global context. The yield differential between the U.S. and other developed markets remains large and that has drawn international capital to U.S. markets. This substitution effect, whereby international investors buy U.S. high quality assets fixed income assets in place of their local market assets, has provided support for U.S. yields in recent years. From the non-U.S. perspective, it is important to note, these purchases are not a trade-off of liquidity for yield, they are in fact a trade up in both.While often a search for investment alternatives takes one beyond the boundaries of their domestic market, no such travel is necessary for American investors as global yields remain below American ones and the U.S. market remains the largest and most diverse available.Gorilla #2: Apples to ApplesA major topic continues to be high dividend paying equities and the seeming oddity that equities are paying comparable or at times a higher dividend than bonds are paying. The much touted high dividend equities approach (as measured by the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index) offered a dividend yield of 2.5% at quarter end, above the yield-to-worst (YTW) for the Barclays U.S. Aggregate of below 2%. On a current yield basis, a more comparable methodology to dividend yield, however, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate offered a 2.9% yield at quarter end. Since the quarter has ended and rates have drifted higher, fixed income yields have only become more attractive. The 10 year Treasury ended October at 1.83%, approximately 30 basis points higher than September, a trend which has continued in November.Further, the U.S. fixed income market does contain pockets of the yield that investors are seeking, but many of these opportunities are obscured by the overall index averages. For example, the U.S. Aggregate yield is largely driven by the 40% of the index that is U.S. Government securities and a 10 year Treasury yield of 1.59% at quarter end. As is typical, the non-government sectors within the index offer higher yields including U.S. Corporates offering 3.8% current yield at the end of September. In this more apt comparison, equity dividend yields fall below the yield of U.S. corporates, while of course adding higher equity risk to a portfolio than would U.S. corporates.Active equity portfolios may be able to create even more attractive dividend yields, a point we would echo for active fixed income portfolio.Source: Barclays, S&P 9/30/2016Gorilla #3: Missing the Trees for the ForestExamining overall corporate yields excludes the various pockets of yield within this 5,900 security index. For example, BBB securities are the largest quality cohort within corporates (48%) and offered a 3.3% YTW at the end of October. Further, the 10+ year component of U.S. corporates is the largest maturity segment of the index, comprising over 31% of corporate market value, and offers a YTW of 4.2%. Credit curve steepness is an important consideration - though it is important to observe how much the yield curve has flattened in the past three years in the U.S., credit curves remain steep offering meaningful premia to investors.When yield alternatives, notably private credit and infrastructure, are juxtaposed to their traditional counterparts with comparable maturities and credit risks, the yield pick-up is much less than one might anticipate. In effect, the biggest difference is the illiquidity premium. The lack of pricing for these assets due to illiquidity creates a liquidity/volatility paradox, as less frequently priced securities appear to show lower volatility. The liquidity of public debt, with the option to exit the position daily or hold to maturity, seems the more favorable risk of the two in our estimation.Gorilla #4: The Rising TideIt is not only the long end that is offering value. Leaving the confines of the standard index, but remaining rather conventional, we examine investment grade floating rate notes which have had an interesting and significant change in yields of late.In this case the shift in yields comes from the regulatory changes in money market funds where (to simplify a complex set of regulations) government securities will now be treated more beneficially than corporate ones for purposes of ensuring a daily NAV of 1 in money market funds. The result has been a marked increase in LIBOR rates vs. short term Treasuries. Thereby increasing yields for securities with coupons with a component tied to LIBOR, such as floating rate notes. It is also important to distinguish between investment grade corporate floaters and bank loans, another popular instrument. By contrast to bank loans, corporate floaters are highly liquid, investment grade instruments with no LIBOR floors, so the impact of the increase in LIBOR benefits the holder as soon as the reset date of the instrument.Outlook & Positioning:The increase in yields in the beginning of the fourth quarter has strengthened the case for the availability of yields in traditional fixed income. Contrary to long-standing expectations of significantly rising rates, the recent increase comes on the back of a significant decline in rates year-to-date in 2016 and in our view is a healthy bounce from the all-time lows set in the beginning of the third quarter. On balance, we view the more likely drift of rates to be higher, but this is against a backdrop of long Treasuries having returned nearly 15% in the first three quarters of the year.With the continued focus on the Fed and the second rate hike in this cycle expected in December, short-term volatility may escalate if Fed messaging is muddled regarding expectations for 2017. Particularly following the market reaction to their September 2015 statement, the Fed is keenly aware of potential consequences of its actions (or inactions) and is likely to tread lightly on policy and messaging. The possibility of short-term disruptions do not shift our expectation for the fixed income landscape and our focus remains on the underpinning of the U.S. economy, the differences between global monetary regimes and the specifics of each investment that will have the greater impact to markets and client portfolios.As fixed income markets have been returning to a more fundamental and nuanced pricing of risk, we have viewed that as an opportunity to exit positions that we either maintained or added opportunistically during bouts of volatility in the third quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016. We have either replaced these with new mispriced assets as available or with more liquid, high quality assets when spread differentials were not justified.Conclusions:In our view, a closer examination of traditional fixed income markets reveals opportunities to find the yield investors seek, but they may not realize is available. Investors' expectations and consensus opinion on investment options may be blinding us to that which is often times right in front of us. Further, many attractive options for investors are masked by the overall market, leading to different perceptions of the trade-offs investors are undertaking.While most investors recognize the inherent risks when so many market participant are seeking the same objective, it has not yet deterred more exotic approaches to yield generation. These take many forms, but by and large can be summarized as a trade-off of liquidity, quality or both for yield. We continue to see opportunities in traditional fixed income and view the relative yields from other sectors as less than meets the eye when placed into the proper context of maturity, quality and liquidity.There are indeed many balls in motion and it is easy to be distracted by them and focus only on the task of counting the number of passes. While counting the passes, we are also attempting to find the dancing gorilla in our midst.

But while we are not a believer in a run in rates, let's take that side of the trade for a minute. For the sake of argument, let's say the Fed raises the Fed funds rate 25 bps in December and then does another three 25 bps rate increases in 2017. So now the Fed funds rate is up 1% and let's assume over this year, Treasuries have increased 1% as well from the pre-election levels. What would that mean for us in the high-yield market? First, we need to keep in mind that Treasury rates are forward looking, so will price in expectations long before the Fed takes any action. Additionally, we would expect the short end of the curve to get hit more, less so for the medium and longer end of the curve that matter more to us in the high-yield market. Given the massive backup in rates over the last two weeks, the market has likely priced in much of this potential move. In Street parlance, buy the rumor, sell the news.History gives us a picture of how high yield has reacted during times of increasing rates. During the more recent ""Taper Tantrum"" in 2013, we saw the 10-year move up 136 bps from April 30th to December 31, 2013, and the 5-year move 107 bps over that same timeframe. During the first couple of months of that Treasury move, we saw the 10-year increase about 80 bps and while that increase was happening, the high-yield market fell 3.1%. But over the course of the rest of the year (July-December), during which the 10-year moved up another 54 bps, we saw the high-yield market return 5.8%.1 Keep in mind, going into this move in rates in 2013, the yield-to-worst on the high-yield index was 160 bps lower in April 2013 than it is now, and was hitting all-time lows in yields right as the ""Taper Tantrum"" was beginning.2 Not only that, currently yields are right about where they were at the peak of the ""Taper Tantrum.""3 So the high-yield market looks to have been more sensitive to changes in rates than versus where we are today, given the yield levels at the time.If we expand this view to look at the long-term 30-year history of the high-yield market, we continue to see that the high-yield market has performed well in the face of rate increases.4On average, returns have remained positive in the midst of the increases, and have performed very well over the next 3-6 months. So while we remain skeptics of a rising interest rate environment, we believe investors are well served by the high-yield market whether rates rise or not.For more as to the impact of rates and how the market has historically performed during periods of increases, see our writings ""Strategies for Investing in a Rising Rate Environment"" and ""High Yield in a Rising Rate Environment."" As noted in these pieces, historically, the high-yield market is negatively correlated to Treasuries, meaning as Treasury prices decline and rates/yields increase, high-yield prices increase. This market has historically performed well during years when we have seen rising rates, helped by the improving economy that has traditionally corresponded with increased rates, as well as the higher starting yields and a shorter maturities we generally see in the high-yield market versus other fixed income sectors, both of which help reduce duration.Duration is a measure of interest rate sensitivity, and that, along with yield, are important metrics to consider in the face of potentially higher rates. Keep in mind the high-yield market is not homogenous. As we have seen a swift rebound in high-yield bond prices so far this year, we have seen spreads compressed to very low yield levels on a number of high-yield issues. In looking at the Bank of America High Yield Index, nearly 40% of the individual tranches trade at a yield-to-worst of 5% or less5, while there is also a large portion of the market that offers yields that we would view as attractive. So if we were to see a 1% increase in rates, that would have a much more significant impact on securities yielding 3% or 4% within the high-yield market, along with investment grade and municipals that are yielding even less, versus the securities yielding 7%, 8%, 9% or even more, also available within the high-yield space. Yield is one of the main components of duration, so all else equal, the higher the yield, the lower the duration and vice versa, the lower the yield the higher the duration. This is just one way where an actively managed approach can add value.While we are not believers in the rising rate story, for those who do believe that rates are bound to rise from here, we see our high-yield bond and loan asset classes as one of the only places inside the fixed income universe that investors can make money.

4030598,66783,2016-12-14T20:15:16-05:00,,"The Hot Money returns, bets on Oil NirvanaThe costs of borrowing for the US government are jumping. On Monday, the US Treasury auctioned $34 billion of three-month bills at a discount rate of 0.53%, the highest since October 2008.These short-term bills sell for less than face value and are redeemed at face value. The difference is the yield for investors. For a three-month bill with a face value of $10,000, the price was $9,986.60. Holding this bill for three months until redeemed will make investors $13.40 in yield. That's an annualized rate of 0.538%.During the rest of trading on Monday, the yield settled down a bit, but today is up again, currently at 0.55%. While still low by historic measures, it's up from about zero in October last year (chart through Monday's close, via Trading Economics):The Treasury also auctioned $28 billion of six-month bills on Monday at a discount rate of 0.645%, the highest since November 2008. It brought the annualized yield to 0.656%. It settled down later on Monday, but today it rose again, and as I'm writing this, it's at 0.67%!The Treasury also auctioned $20 billion in 10-year notes on Monday. In the melee, the yield briefly spiked to 2.53%, before settling at 2.49%. Today, it briefly hit 2.50% again. As I'm writing this, it is back at 2.48%. In July, it was at 1.38% (chart through Monday's close, via StockCharts.com).This has been the continuation of weeks of bond drama that has been called variously, ""rout,"" ""carnage,"" ""meltdown"" and the like (read… Government Bond & Mortgage ""Carnage"" Enters Sixth Week).And it's a global thing. Fewer and fewer sovereign bonds around the globe trade at a negative yield. Some analysts have already pronounced the end of the NIRP era, with both the ECB and the BOJ backing off ever so slightly from their scorched-earth monetary policies.In the process of rising yields among government bonds, and falling bond prices, $1.7 trillion of the bond bubble's gains went up in smoke in November alone, according to Bloomberg.But even as the government bond bubble is bursting, it's party time at the bottom end of the bond market. The prices of the worst of even the worst energy junk bonds have soared, as have the prices of many other junk bonds. The junk bond market is now pricing in a return of oil nirvana.The deal that OPEC and non-OPEC countries worked out may well disintegrate into pandemic noncompliance. And the US shale producers have no appetite for cutting production, especially now that new money is flowing back into the sector. The US rig count has already jumped 54% from the low point in May to 624 rigs in the latest week. Everyone in the industry is licking their chops. This oil bust is over. Drillers are getting busy again. Production growth is back.This phenomenon - OPEC and non-OPEC noncompliance along with rising production in the US - is going to have consequences for the oil glut that continues unabated today. But no matter. The hot money is rushing back into the sector.And so with Treasury bonds getting beaten down and Treasury yields jumping, while the opposite has been the case month after month at the junk bond end, particularly in the energy sector, the spreads between Treasury yields and junk bond yields have collapsed.Here is the options adjusted spread between Treasuries and BB-rated junk bonds (the higher end of junk). The spread of 2.66 percentage points is the lowest since September 2014, when QE was still going on, albeit in tapered form, and before the oil bust was taken seriously:And the low end of the junk bond spectrum, the riskiest end, where bonds are teetering somewhere near default, has become the place to be for the hot money, as these bonds, many of them energy bonds, have soared in price, and yields have dropped to bond bubble levels. The current yield spread of 10.1 percentage points over Treasury bonds is less than half of where it had been on February 11:In other words, the junk bond bubble is back, alive, and well, driven largely by the recovery in energy junk bonds, as if the losses, restructurings, and bankruptcies had never occurred.To make this equation work, the hot money is, ironically, banking on some kind of miracle that OPEC and non-OPEC producers, particularly Russia, are going to perform, apparently out of the goodness of their hearts: cutting their own production in order to give US shale drillers another chance, allow them to gain market share, and enrich their investors.But something tells me that somewhere along the line, something doesn't add up in this equation, and that this renewed junk bond bubble is immensely vulnerable.What are bank insiders seeing from their perch that we don't?

4027782,25166,2016-12-02T07:40:25-05:00,,"By Gershon Distenfeld, Ivan Rudolph-ShabinskyA pending US interest rate hike and worries about inflation may have persuaded investors to start avoiding bonds. We think that's a mistake, especially when it comes to high yield - a sector that often thrives when rates rise.Bonds, of course, are highly sensitive to interest rate movements - when rates rise, prices fall. And rising rates can certainly create short-term volatility. We've seen our share of it in the past few weeks.The volatility - and the anxiety bond investors are feeling - increased after Donald Trump won the US presidential election and markets began betting his policies would trigger a jump in inflation. This scenario could convince the Federal Reserve to follow an interest rate hike in December with several more in 2017.But remember, interest rates have been low for decades, and inflation in developed economies all but evaporated in the years after the global financial crisis. Investors have grown accustomed to this situation. The reaction to tighter Fed policy and possible reflation in financial markets, including high yield and other credit markets, isn't a big surprise.The good news is that the backup we've seen in bond yields is largely self-correcting; higher yields eventually lead to higher returns. That's because as bonds mature, their prices drift back toward par. Investors who sit tight will soon be able to reinvest the principal from maturing, called or tendered securities and the coupon income that their portfolios pay in newer - and higher-yielding - bonds.Looking Past VolatilityIt's also important to remember that in high yield, sell-offs tend to be short-lived. Over the past two decades, high yield has recovered most big drawdowns - losses of more than 5% - in less than a year.US high yield bonds also have a strong track record during periods of Fed tightening (Display). This is partly because high yield isn't closely correlated with interest rates. Rather, the bonds are strongly linked to the business results and fundamentals of the companies they represent. When the Fed raises rates because the economy is strengthening, that tends to bode well for many high yield issuers.Shorter Duration, Higher Cash FlowSo how can investors maximize growth in a rising rate environment? By seeking out bonds that generate a high amount of income. The more cash flow your portfolio can deliver, the more you'll benefit.In our view, a short-duration high yield strategy can offer a particularly good opportunity to take advantage of rising rates; the quicker the bonds mature, the faster investors can put the proceeds to work in higher-yielding securities.Credit Quality Still MattersThere are exceptions, of course, and that's why investors shouldn't myopically chase the highest-yielding bonds on offer. High yield securities are more vulnerable to default than are investment-grade ones. And having grown used to low borrowing costs, some high yield companies may struggle to raise capital as those costs rise, putting their ability to pay back creditors at risk.That's why investors should do their credit homework carefully. Many CCC-rated bonds issued by companies with fragile finances could be vulnerable in a rising rate environment.It's also important to remember that talk of rising rates has made short-duration high yield strategies popular. That's another reason why credit quality matters. In our view, investors should be prepared to carry out careful credit analysis on each and every bond before buying.Investors may also want to look into floating-rate securities, which can benefit in a rising rate environment. But again, selectivity is important. Bank loans boast floating rates, but most are callable at par, with no penalty for the issuer. That means investors probably won't always reap the benefits of the floating-rate structure. Credit Risk Transfer securities (CRTs) from Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae may be another option.Don't Sell Your Bonds - It'll Cost YouThe biggest mistake investors can make, though, is to try to time the next interest rate rise or to sell their bonds just as yields start to move higher. Doing so will only lock in losses. And staying out of the market is an expensive proposition. The Fed has repeatedly said it intends to raise rates gradually. Translation: the yield on cash will be only slightly above 0% for some time to come.When yields are too low, bonds don't pull their weight in an investment portfolio. When yields hit zero or go negative, as they have in Japan and many European markets, bonds don't really work at all. That's why rising rates are a good news.Will there be more volatile trading ahead? Probably. But investors with a multi-year investment horizon are likely to benefit as rates rise. They can afford to overlook short-term volatility.The views expressed herein do not constitute research, investment advice or trade recommendations and do not necessarily represent the views of all AB portfolio management teams."
4028680,75725,2016-12-06T18:54:11-05:00,,"Looking at the results stemming from the Italian referendum in conjunction with the continued gyrations in financial markets on the back of rising FX volatility thanks to ""Mack the Knife"" aka King Dollar + positive real US interest rates, when it came to selecting our title analogy for this week's musing, we reminded ourselves of ""The spun-glass theory of the mind"" which is the belief that the human organism is so fragile that minor negative events, such as criticism, rejection, or failure, are bound to cause major trauma to the system (think Brexit, Trump's election). ""The spun-glass theory of the mind"" is essentially not giving humans, and sometimes patients, enough credit for their resilience and ability to recover, like central banks have been doing, dealing with economic woes with their ""overmedication"" programs (ZIRP, QE, NIRP, etc.). In 1973, the brilliant University of Minnesota clinical psychologist Paul Meehl poked fun at what he called the ""spun glass theory"" of the mind which is the false notion that most of us are delicate, fragile, and easily damaged creatures that need to be handled with kid gloves. Since then, many researchers have shown that most people are surprisingly resilient even in the face of extreme trauma. Economies are similar, such as the United Kingdom which showed it was more than tremendously resilient while many pundits were predicting ""trauma"" and disaster should Brexit happens. In similar fashion, Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his book ""Antifragile"" showed that there's an entire class of other things that do not simply resist stress but actually grow, strengthen, or otherwise gain from unforeseen and otherwise unwelcome stimuli (Iceland). The main underlying concepts of both ""The spun-glass theory of the mind"" and ""Antifragile"" is that the majority of causal relationships are nonlinear and so are market movements (hence the relative ineffectiveness of VaR models - Value At Risk we discussed in February in our conversation ""The disappearance of MS München""). Typically, both have a convex section where the curve rises exponentially upward and is associated with a positive effect (antifragile) and a concave section that declines exponentially downward and has a negative effect (fragile). Think of the dose of a prescription drug. At first, as central banks increase the dose, the health benefits improve (convexity) for financial assets. But, beyond a certain dose, side effects and toxicity cause harm (concavity), such as debt-fueled economies given debt has no flexibility. Therefore, highly leveraged economies cannot stand even a slowdown without risking implosion like our current situation, but we ramble again.How do you ""hedge"" in such a nonlinear world? The way to do it, we think, is to use a barbell strategy that positively captures the optionality of the variable (being long in the convex area and short in the concave area). If indeed, we live in a nonlinear world and given correlations are less and less static and change more and more frequently, leading to larger and larger standard deviation moves such as typically going way up during downturns, it, therefore, eliminates Markowitz portfolio theory of diversification benefit. Just when you think your diversification will render your portfolio ""antifragile"" it brings instability and ""fragility"" to it. A barbell strategy should render your portfolio more ""antifragile"". Why is so? Markowitz portfolio theory causes investors to ""overallocate"" to risky asset classes such as ""High Yield"" and/or Emerging Markets and play the same crowded ""beta"" game. In similar fashion, ""The spun-glass theory of the mind"" cause central bankers to ""overmedicate"". One could conclude that ""Overmedication"" leads to ""Overallocation"".In this week's conversation, we would like to look again at the importance of flows versus stocks from a macro and credit perspective, taking into account ""overmedication"" and ""overallocation"".Synopsis:Our core thought process relating to credit and economic growth is solely based around a very important concept namely the accounting principles of ""stocks"" versus ""flows"". We have used this core principle in the past when assessing the issues plaguing Europe versus the United States as per our September 2012 conversation ""Zemblanity"":Before we delve more into the nitty-gritty, it is important, we think to remind our readers of what is behind our thought process of the ""stocks"" versus ""flows"" macro approach.We encountered previously through our readings an essential post dealing with our core concept of ""stocks versus ""flows"" from Mr. Michael Biggs and Mr. Thomas Mayer on voxeu.org entitled - How central banks contributed to the financial crisis, which explains precisely why both Friedman, Keynes and the central banks have been behind the curve in preventing the previous financial crisis and potentially the next one:We have always wondered in relation to the global rounds of quantitative easings the following:Credit dynamic is based on growth. No growth or weak growth can lead to defaults and asset deflation. The change in credit growth is a flow variable and so is domestic and global demand!The big failure of QE on the real economy at least in Europe has been in ""impulsing"" spending growth via the second derivative of the development of debt, namely the change in credit growth. As we have argued before QE in Europe is not sufficient enough on its own to offset the lack of Aggregate Demand (AD) we think.As a reminder, in our part 2 conversation ""Availability heuristic"" from September 2015, the liabilities structure of industrial countries is mainly made up of debt (they are ""short debt""), in particular in Japan, the US and the UK. In contrast, the international balance sheet structure of emerging markets is typically composed of equity liabilities (""short equity""), which is the counterpart of strong FDI inflows that contributed to improve emerging markets' external profile in the last decade. With a rising US dollar, what has been playing out is a reverse of these imbalances hence our ""macro reverse osmosis"" discussed again recently relating to violent rotations inflows.From that perspective, we read with interest Citi Research note from November entitled ""How does active fund management survive in 2017?"" where as well they tackle the very important point of stock versus flows:As we have seen in recent weeks, and as we have remarked in our conversation ""Critical threshold"", higher yields leads to material fund outflows in the short term as indicated by Bank of America Merrill Lynch Follow the Flow note from the 2nd of December entitled ""Where's the money going?"":Whereas central banks tend to focus their attention on ""stocks"", we'd rather focus ours on ""flows"", from a macro perspective as well as from a fund perspective. Evidently, the consequences of ""Mack the Knife"" aka King Dollar + positive real US interest rates can also be seen in the ""Great Rotation"" from Europe and Emerging Markets towards the US hence validating our ""macro osmosis process"":As a reminder, more liquidity = greater economic instability once QE ends for Emerging Markets. Now if indeed ""flows"" matter, we took a keen interest in reading the impact ""Mack the Knife"" has had on Emerging Markets as indicated by Bank of America Merrill Lynch in its GEMs Flow Talk note from the 1st of December 2016 entitled ""Reported foreign holdings of local debt dropped 6% in November so far"":We recently pointed out that ""macro tourists"" and levered carry players alike did play the second half of 2016 more aggressively hence the extension of their credit risk and duration risk leading to faster deleveraging and consequently outflows and pain inflicted. Obviously, we guess that your next question is going to be how much more additional outflows could be expected particularly from the impact of a rising US dollar is having on Asia for example given capital outflows matter and matter a lot, so does a US dollar shortage as well although Stanley Fischer from the Fed thinks as of late there is no liquidity issue. Regarding this matter, we read yet another Bank of America Merrill Lynch note from its Connecting Asia series entitled ""Flow and flight"":While obviously the biggest ""known unknown"" lies in the foreign trade policies which will be adopted by the new US administration. As we pointed out in our last musing, measures that would restrict global trade would no doubt be bullish for gold in that particular case. For now, in relation to gold we still remain neutral.But moving back to credit and nonlinearity, one way of ""mitigating"" dwindling policy support given recent talks from the ECB in tapering its stance would be to ""embrace"" a barbell strategy as pointed out by Citi Research note from November entitled ""How does active fund management survive in 2017?"":What would be an interesting barbell credit wise in our opinion? We would favor US credit markets obviously from a flow and currency perspective. We would go long US investment grade credit than European investment grade and even selectively long European non-financial High Yield issuers due to lower leverage than their US peers. But should you want to play the beta game from a ""barbell"" perspective, then again US High Yield via its derivatives US CDX High Yield, given that it is less sensitive to convexity and interest rate risks and less exposed to CCCs (10% versus 16% weight in cash index), should the risk-on environment persist on the back of favorable macro data.From an allocation perspective, we are already seeing once again decoupling between US credit and Europe, because, as we stated on many occasions, the Fed tackled earlier one ""stocks"" issues on banks' balance sheet, which in effect, enabled a stronger credit income and better economic growth relative to Europe, whereas the ECB has in no way alleviated the burden of ""stocks"" plaguing peripheral banks in the form of nonperforming loans, therefore in no way repairing the broken credit mechanism that stills explain the ongoing ""japanification"" process and much weaker growth prospects. To that effect, if indeed the US reflation story is playing out, then again it makes sense to ""overallocate"" to US credit as once again decoupling could be on the menu between both regions. This is clearly illustrated by Bank of America Merrill Lynch in its European Credit Strategist note from the 2nd of December entitled ""The Italian job"":If indeed we get this ""reflationary"" case playing out, then again we might have a situation where US credit continues to outperform European credit in 2017.Going forward, when it comes to following a potential deterioration in US High Yield, we encourage you to keep an eye on a possible flattening of the CDX HY curve, being the derivatives proxy for the US High Yield market. As per Credit Market Analysis (CMA) latest chart, it is worth following the trend to see if indeed the CDX HY series 27 will be getting flattered as we move towards 2017. We noticed that one year protection has started to move upwards albeit very slowly, while it is yet a meaningful move for the moment contrary to what we had back in November last year where one year was only 50 bps apart from three year, you should keep an eye on the shape of the curve:- Source Credit Market AnalysisRight now, it is hard to be as sanguine as we were in November regarding US High Yield given at the time of the fast flattening movement we were seeing at the end of 2015. We continue to see a risk-on environment for the time being, although as we pointed out last week when discussing credit conditions in the US for Commercial Real Estate, it does appear to us that some segments including our CCC credit canary are already experiencing tightening financial conditions. The most important indicator to track, risk wise is ""Mack the Knife"" aka King Dollar + positive real US interest rates.Finally for our final chart and if the ""spun-glass theory of the mind"" is correct, then indeed we think if the US dollar continues to shine, then it makes sense to ""overallocate"" to Japan given earnings are higher there.While the risk-on mode is still prevailing thanks to the strong beliefs in the reflation story playing out, from an equity perspective, corporate earnings and payouts remain the principal drivers of equity returns. To that extent, our final chart comes from Barclays Global equity and cross-asset strategy note from the 28th of November entitled ""Reassessing the rotations"" and displays earnings in Japan relative to the US and Europe:- Source BarclaysWhile it remains to be seen how long the ""reflationary story"" continues to play out, for now, it is indeed ""risk-on"", but no doubt there are many political events lining up in 2017 that could put a spanner in the works. One thing clear to us though is that when it comes to markets commentators and some members of the sell-side, 2016 has proven with both Brexit and the US election that the spun-glass theory of the mind is alive and well...Stay tuned!"

Monetary policy in Europe and Japan continues to keep a lid on yields, and while inflation could surprise, markets have become more patient with the Fed and will need to see evidence before they act decisively. Absent large negative shocks to growth, inflation and labor markets, the committee expects one rate hike this year, likely in December.Fed Hike Implied Probabilities Have Moved Up and Down in 2016… But Mostly DownProbability of One 25 Basis Point Rate Increase in June, July, September, November and December 2016, Implied By Fed Fund Futures PricingSource: Bloomberg.Signs of Rising Yields and Curve-Steepening Feed Into Risk-Market VolatilitySource: Bloomberg.Developed Market Non-U.S. Debt: Negative interest rate policies being implemented by the likes of the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan have driven yields lower. However, there is no strong evidence that easing has worked in Japan or that inflation has picked up in Europe, despite growth expectations improving somewhat this year. The ECB left its policy unchanged at its meeting in September, but it maintains its commitment to achieving inflation below but close to 2%. The committee believes that the risk of a reversal in yields, with a loss of faith in monetary policy, could destabilize markets and prove costly for investors.High Yield Fixed Income: The committee downgraded High Yield from slight overweight to neutral. Though there may still be some room to run in credit, as spreads are within historical ranges, the committee reduced its outlook given the strong run from the asset class since March this year.

Bonds sold off in the days following the election, on expectations that higher growth - and inflation - are ahead. A key question on investors' minds now: What could the election results mean for bond markets over the long term?The outcome introduces many uncertainties regarding the future path of economic and monetary policy, legislation and international relations and trade policy. But there are some tentative points we can make about the implications of a President Trump and Republican Congress for fixed income markets.Key trends already in place are likely to accelerateWe are probably going to see a significant shift from monetary policy stimulus to fiscal policy initiatives, particularly in the area of infrastructure investment at the federal level. This may well aid in accelerating the pickup in inflation levels that already appeared underway before Nov. 8, and it likely will result in a steepening in the yield curve over time. We'll be watching closely for signals of how added spending will be financed.Rates won't always rally when risk assets are hurtThere are some common misconceptions that investors should guard against. Specifically, with bonds and equities more correlated today than in the past, investors must not assume that rates always rally when risk assets suffer. Moreover, while some believed that the U.S. dollar (USD) would ultimately decline on a Trump victory, we think this view is mistaken. The dollar is more likely to range-trade for a time, or even strengthen, depending on the direction legislation and policy take in 2017.We are cautious about how the election result will impact emerging markets debtTrade policy uncertainty and a potentially higher USD could potentially weigh on the asset class. Still, as we've argued in recent months, the need for income isn't going away, and the carry potential, particularly in the front to middle segments of select emerging market country rates curves, should remain attractive. What to watch: capital flows. A good amount of money has shifted in EMD, but it will be important to see if investors have the patience and wherewithal to stick out any near-term headline risks. In the meantime, we are cautiously optimistic on the carry prospects for shorter to intermediate EMD (as long as the USD remains contained and we do not descend into a trade war).We think the election result should be, broadly speaking, positive for U.S. corporate credit sectorsThey may now operate in a more business-friendly environment. We could potentially see relaxed regulatory burdens, lowered corporate tax rates (and/or one-time overseas capital repatriation), and several industry-specific tailwinds that aid credit markets. In particular, we are still positive on long-end investment-grade corporates. Further, some high cash flow securitized asset markets continue to appear attractive.We see a potential headwind for municipal bondsIf personal income tax rates were to decline, and additional infrastructure spend were partly financed in municipal markets, this could be marginally negative for muni performance.We continue to like rates markets ranging from the front end of the yield curve to its bellyWe think Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) have an important place in portfolios today. And given that the U.S. is likely to continue to progress down a path of interest rate normalization, diversifying rates exposures globally also makes a great deal of sense.Finally, over the short term, we believe a December Federal Reserve (Fed) hike is still likely. A lot can happen between now and then, but if markets remain stable, and labor markets don't dramatically falter, the central bank will probably go ahead with a quarter-point hike.This post originally appeared on the BlackRock Blog."
4024162,24206,2016-11-17T04:35:35-05:00,,"By New Deal DemocratA ""long leading indicator"" is an economic metric that reliably turns a year or more before the onset of a recession.Geoffrey Moore, who for decades published the Index of Leading Indicators, and in 1993 wrote Leading Economic Indicators: New Approaches and Forecasting Records identified 4:A variation of the above is Paul Kasriel's ""foolproof recession indicator,"" which combines real money supply with the yield curve, i.e., the difference in the interest rate between short and long-term treasury bonds. This turns negative a year or more before the next recession about half of the time.Another long leading indicator has been described by UCLA Prof. Edward E. Leamer who has written that ""Housing IS the Business Cycle."" In that article, he identified real residential investments as a share of GDP as an indicator that typically turns at least 5 quarters before the onset of a recessionSeveral other series appear to have merit as long leading indicators as well.Real retail sales in several forms also has value as a long leading indicator. Doug Short has identified real retail sales per capita as another important metric. In a similar vein, Steven Hansen of Econintersect has flagged retail employment vs. real retail sales as turning significantly in advance of recessions.It also appears that the Fed's Labor Market Conditions Index also turns negative serves as a long leading indicator, typically turning negative at least one year before the onset of a recession.Finally, the tightening of credit conditions also appears to have merit as a long leading indicator. Two measures, the Senior Loan Officer Survey, and the TED spread, are worth noting.That gives us a total of 9 varieties of long leading indicators. All of these economic series have a long-term history of turning a year or more before a recession.I haven't examined these in detail since the beginning of July. Then, I found them just slightly positive on balance. In light of recent interest rate moves, now is a good time for an update.Corporate Bond Yields:With the sole exception of the 1981 ""double-dip,"" corporate bond yields have always made their most recent low over 1 year before the onset of the next recession. Following Brexit, in the beginning of July, BAA corporate bonds yields made a new all-time low, and AAA bonds tied their all-time low. Treasuries yields also made new lows, but interestingly, mortgage rates did not. While that was a big positive, in the last week interest rates have moved near one-year highs, as shown by the Bloomberg corporate bond index:Treasuries also made new lows at the beginning of July, while significantly, mortgage rates didn't:On net, interest yields on bonds are still a positive, based on the new July lows. But a further increase of about 0.20% in yields to a 12-month high would be enough to make them a negative going forward.Housing:This is a complicated and changing picture. On the one hand, new single-family home sales made a new post-recession high 2 months ago, as did housing starts:Like starts, single-family permits have also been going sideways for a year, although they did eke out a new high, by 1,000, as just revised for September:And mortgage applications have not made a new high since June, and are on the verge of turning negative YoY (h/t Calculated Risk).A major negative is that housing as a share of GDP has also declined in the last two quarters.As a result, housing cannot reliably be scored a positive beyond Q2 of next year.Corporate ProfitsThe picture is mixed here as well. Corporate profits last made a new high over a year ago, but it looks like that may have bottomed in Q4 of last year:This cannot reliably be scored as either positive or negative.Real Money Supply:No recession has ever started without at least real M1 or real M2, minus 2.5%, turning negative. Both have remained relentlessly positive.The Yield Curve:This is an excellent long range forecasting tool in times of inflation. Typically, a recession begins after the Fed raises rates to combat inflation, sufficiently so that the yield curve inverts. Much was made of its recent tightening, which nevertheless was very positive, and recently has reversed anyway:The yield curve remains as positive even now, with the same slope as it had in the middle of the 1970s, 80s, and 90s expansions. The 5-year spread is even wider than it was during most of the 1960s.I do want to caution that the yield curve did not invert during the deflationary 1930s and low-flation 1940s, and several recessions happened anyway, so while I am including it, I suspect this is the long leading indicator most likely to signal falsely before the next recession.Credit ConditionsIn addition to money supply and interest rates, the loosening or tightening of credit appears to be an important component of changes in the economy over one year out. Although it does not have a lengthy track record, the Senior Loan Officer Survey looks promising, as does whether or not the TED spread is in excess of 0.5% (inverted in the graph below):Both of these are negative, the former for a year, and the latter for the last 3 months.Real Retail Sales Per Capita:These peaked more than a year before the onset of the last two recessions. Here's what they look like through September:On the other hand, retail hiring has outpaced real retail sales for about a year; a negative:So these are giving a mixed signal as well.The Labor Market Conditions IndexThis is a recently compiled index of 19 indicators from the Fed. This too typically turns negative at least one year before the onset of a recession:It has been negative for most of this year, although in the most recent report, it turned up. On balance, this remains a negative.So, to summarize:Enough of these metrics have made recent peaks that, for the next several quarters, growth should continue. Beyond next summer, however, the picture is simply too mixed to make a call. Much depends on whether the recent spike in interest rates continues, and causes the housing market to roll over, or whether last summer's post-Brexit lows in interest rates finally show up unambiguously in new post-recession highs in housing construction. So it is not out of the question that I could turn negative on Q4 of next year depending on data between now and the end of the year."
4008841,88676,2016-09-28T00:52:40-04:00,,"What do you make of the candidates' policies?At this point, the candidates' policy platforms are miles apart. Greater clarity and also revisions are expected from both as they make a push to attract independent and undecided voters as November 8 nears.Generally speaking, Democrat Hillary Clinton is focused on income inequality, with lower enthusiasm for free trade than the current administration. Republican Donald Trump's policies are less clear, with protectionist and anti-immigration overtones, presenting markets with some questions about his economic agenda.One thing the candidates seem to agree on: more fiscal stimulus. Both support higher infrastructure spending, but propose to finance this investment differently. We could see corporate tax reform under either, including the repatriation of some of the roughly $2 trillion in profits held abroad.What do you see for stocks as November 8 nears?Equity volatility should rise from current levels, which are at historic lows - especially for an election year. Investors tend to reduce risk and pull money out of equity funds in the month before presidential elections, a trend seen in the past four cycles.Uncertainty is weighing on corporate behavior already: Capital spending is lackluster, and many companies are shying away from providing long-term guidance. This is playing out globally in a flight to perceived equity ""safe havens,"" such as U.S. stocks, particularly quality companies and high yielders.But the election will not be the only driver of equity prices over the next few months: monetary policy, global growth and third-quarter earnings results will all play a big part in determining market direction.What should we expect from stocks post-Election Day?Any market softness in the weeks leading up to the decision could reverse once uncertainty wanes. We are also likely to see sector and industry differentiation depending on the outcome of the vote and the priorities of the new president.Infrastructure spending, which is favored by both candidates, is likely to target highways, mass transit and airports. Some U.S. construction and materials stocks have already rallied in anticipation. This outperformance may be premature, as new fiscal programs will take quarters to impact earnings.U.S. financials and healthcare, which make up roughly one-third of the U.S. stock market, could both face long-term headwinds. Clinton favors more intense regulation of Wall Street and has criticized abusive pricing practices by drug companies. Both candidates have been critical of free trade. This means little chance of any new trade agreements and possible headwinds for companies that derive a large proportion of income from global trade. U.S. companies with a higher percentage of domestic earnings, particularly small-caps, could outperform.What about bonds?Leading up to the election, we could see stocks and other risk assets struggle and ""safe haven"" assets such as Treasuries attract inflows. But valuations in some of these assets are already stretched. For that reason, gold (rather than Treasuries) may be a better hedge against uncertainty.That said, we could see yields drift higher if the Republican takes office due to potentially looser fiscal policies. Increased fiscal spending under either candidate should lead to a modest rise in interest rates, boosting the U.S. dollar. A key draw of municipal bonds - tax-exempt interest income - would lose some luster under Trump's promised income tax cuts. Clinton's higher taxes for top earners would be a positive for munis, barring a cap on tax exemption. Infrastructure spending, however, could offset these negatives, because state budgets would improve due to increased economic activity.We see U.S. corporate bonds following the trend of equities, although corporate profit repatriation would likely trigger more dividend payouts and share buybacks.Where do you expect the vote to go?While many polls show a high probability of a Clinton win, it is still early. We have spent a lot of time analyzing the polls, official statements and data to prepare for any outcome. The Brexit referendum in June and previous UK votes have shown the pitfalls of polls and prediction markets. The race could be tighter.The outcomes in Congress are important as well. Democrats could gain control of the Senate by taking just five of the 34 seats up for grabs. Of note, the recent voter tendency to stick to a single party when in the voting booth could mean the Senate goes to the party of the new president. The House seems likely to remain Republican. Democrats would need to win almost all of the 40 seats in play to assume a majority. Ultimately, however, history shows us that the party in the White House has little statistically significant effect on market returns.My advice to investors is to remain focused on your goals and on building a well-diversified portfolio that can weather all seasons, political and otherwise.Markets Brace for a Historic US Election originally appeared on BlackRock.com.

4007663,68695,2016-09-21T16:05:39-04:00,"U.S. credit risk is still substantially below 2012’s elevated risk levels.IG markets are currently fairly valued, as are HY markets.However, even as XO CDS has normalized in the last several months, it remains substantially above XO iCDS levels.This indicates that the XO market is overstating credit risk, and there may be investment opportunities in this space.","Analyzing credit default swaps (CDS) for corporate credits can be helpful to understand current market dynamics. It can help investors understand where there may be value inside the investible credit environment. It can also help investors understand when there is panic in the credit market that is not being reflected in the equity market, which may be an early warning sign for equity investors.It can also identify when panic in the equity market is not reflected in the credit market, which may be a sign that an equity sell-off is not the start of a larger move, and therefore a buying opportunity.After a period of panic earlier this year, credit risk is again moderatingValens' Custom Aggregate CDS Index shows the credit riskiness of companies as traded in the credit market, while Valens' Custom Aggregate iCDS Index shows what the CDS should be. The iCDS is calculated using a multi-variable, market-relative, fundamentally-driven regression analysis, with the goal of identifying the intrinsic value of credit risk for a company based on its fundamentals and the current market context.Over the past 12 months, the Aggregate CDS for High-Yield (HY) and Investment-Grade (IG) credits have been relatively flat and trending, though Cross-Over (XO) credits have seen yields move materially wider before falling back.We define XO credits as lower medium grade credits that don't quite merit an IG designation. These are credits we believe that have a good chance of becoming investment-grade if management does what is necessary to improve their companies' respective credit profiles, i.e. increasing cash available for servicing obligations. However, there is the caveat that XO credits could also fall into HY territory, especially when management chooses to overly focus on growth instead of profitability.The Aggregate CDS reflects that HY credit risk is still substantially below the elevated risk levels seen as recently as 2012. Moreover, after the move wider in HY and XO CDS and HY iCDS in 2015, these levels have declined again in 2016, representing a calming of credit market concerns.The long-term trend of HY credits represents recognition of reduced credit risk over the past four years, where CDS has collapsed from over 1,000bps levels to ~400bps levels over the last several years. After a period of high credit risk coming out of the 2008 crisis, the HY CDS dropped from 660bps in September 2012 to 500bps in just seven months. Its further decline to 398bps in March 2014 emphasizes that the risk of default for companies is nowhere near the recessionary levels that the market once perceived it to be at.The recent move wider in XO CDS and subsequent collapse highlights the panic that grew in the market in late 2015 that has subsequently subsided. Credit risk heightened among the Consumer Discretionary and Energy sectors in February, which mostly consisted of XO companies. In late February, both the HY and XO CDS started to move back down. After the HY CDS fell to year-ago levels, credit risk started to rise again in April. Furthermore, in recent months, the XO and HY CDS levels have diverged, after having tracked closely for several months, a sign that credit markets are again differentiating risk levels.Intrinsic CDS levels show that XO credit risk is being overstated, and that long-term secular moves in CDS down have been justified by credit riskAggregate iCDS highlights that the trend down for markets during the last three years was just a recognition from the markets of where credit risk has been over the same period. While all the tranches of CDS baskets have fallen materially, for most of the past four years, iCDS levels have been around the levels that CDS markets have currently settled at.The one interesting dislocation is XO credits. While fundamental analysis shows these names to be much more similar to IG names, the market has consistently treated them more like HY names, in particular recently.Currently, IG CDS fairly values credit risk relative to IG iCDS, as does HY CDS. On the other hand, XO CDS is overstating credit risk. The charts below in the Appendix further illustrate this by comparing the CDS and iCDS directly to each other for each type of credit.In ConclusionBased on the dislocation between HY, XO, and IG CDS & iCDS, it would make sense to bias a portfolio toward XO credits. This is the case because IG markets are fairly valuing credit risk, as are HY markets after HY iCDS moved slightly wider earlier this year as HY CDS moderated. On the other hand, XO CDS expansion has not been confirmed by XO iCDS.AppendixWe create proprietary CDS baskets for the U.S. market, based on the 270+ companies that have liquidly-traded CDS. Those baskets are based on the company's corporate credit rating. By looking at each of these baskets against themselves over time, and against each other, insights can be gleaned in terms of when the market is panicking, when credit risk is improving, and when there are potentially interesting relative value trade opportunities.We also use our proprietary Intrinsic CDS (iCDS) to create baskets for the same companies, showing the company's fundamental credit risk, compared to their market credit risk, based on CDS. By comparing the iCDS for the different baskets to CDS, further opportunities for finding undervalued or overvalued credits can be presented. iCDS is Valens' ""fair value"" of credit risk metric, priced in bps and comparable to CDS. Please refer to the following charts to see the spreads between CDS and iCDS levels for each of the baskets."
4007477,24716,2016-09-21T01:42:54-04:00,,"It is September. The leaves are turning, kids are back in school, and it is time for the next meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board of Governors (Fed). The September meeting is usually one of the more important sessions of the year. It comes after the close of the summer, when trading and market activity typically starts to pick back up. It is also the first meeting after the Fed's annual summit in Jackson Hole. Investors look to the September meeting for new insights or guidance about the Fed's next steps.As of September 15, the Fed funds futures market is pricing in only an 18% chance (source: Bloomberg data) that the Fed will raise its target interest rate from the current level of 0.25% to 0.50%. The odds of a rate hike have been declining in recent weeks as a combination of tepid data and comments by Fed governors have led most investors to believe that there won't be a move. However, the Fed does seem to be getting closer to a hike, and it is likely to drop some clues in the statement and press conference that follow the meeting. Best guess, we'll likely get a hike at the December meeting.Given this backdrop, what have investors been doing with their money? The chart below shows the capital flows for U.S. fixed income exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from the last Fed meeting to September 14.The first thing that jumps out at me from this Bloomberg data is the continued search for yield. Investors have put money into investment grade corporate bonds and emerging markets - two sectors that have historically provided above-average levels of income compared to other fixed income segments. This isn't really a surprise given how low yields are in the market. It is increasingly difficult to generate income in a bond portfolio, driving many investors to seek out new sources of income. Investment grade corporate bonds and emerging market debt have benefited from this trend for most of 2016. Flows into broad market funds are strong as well, which shows how investors are using fixed income at the core of their bond portfolio. Broad market funds tend to provide diversification against equity risk, potentially providing ballast to a portfolio.Another interesting trend has been the interest in high yield bonds. Flows have been positive, but not as strong as other bond sectors. I think many investors may still feel tentative about the high yield market in the wake of the volatility in energy-related bonds earlier this year.Flows into U.S. Treasury bonds have been more mixed. Nominal Treasury securities have had small net outflows, a big change from the large outflows they experienced leading up to the June Fed meeting. Meanwhile, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) had some inflows as investors position for potentially higher inflation down the road.Where does this leave us?From the fixed income flow data, investors don't seem to fear a Fed rate hike or expect a fast trajectory for rising rates. They have shown interest in funds that potentially provide some income or protection from inflation, and investment grade credit, emerging market debt and TIPS benefited from that. More and more yield-searching investors are considering nontraditional income asset classes, but keep in mind that higher income could mean higher volatility, with the most recent example being high yield debt. If you take on more risk, make sure you thoughtfully diversify your income sources, particularly as we near the next Fed rate increase.This post originally appeared on the BlackRock blog."

We see more spread compression ahead, based on our expectations for the ECB to extend its asset purchases.Chart of the weekNon-financial corporate credit spreads, 2015-2016Spreads are the difference in yields between corporate bonds and their government counterparts. The chart above shows how eurozone, U.S. and UK non-financial corporate credit spreads have shrunk. Stubbornly low eurozone inflation expectations should push the ECB to extend its stimulus beyond March 2017.The ECB's only way forward: Keep easingFurther ECB monetary easing measures could come as early as this week. We see an extension of the March end point for the ECB's QE program as more likely than an increase in the size of monthly purchases or a lowering of interest rates below the current -0.40% deposit rate.A longer QE program would require the ECB to relax its self-imposed asset purchasing rules to ensure it has enough eligible bonds to buy. A rule change could increase the percentage of any single bond the ECB can buy, broaden the composition of sovereign bonds bought, expand the universe of eligible corporate bonds or even expand the program to include stock purchases - a radical move we see as unlikely at this stage.Any QE-program change would likely result in price changes for asset classes affected by the rule relaxations. Bottom line: Ongoing strong central bank demand should support European and global bond prices, though selectivity is key. We see opportunities in eurozone peripheral government bonds.

And Is Set Up to Handle Interest Rate Moves.A few weeks ago I ran a summary of fixed-income CEFs (CEFs: Deep Discounts and High Yields) and called out four funds with discounts in the double digits and yields above 9%. These four (let's call them the A-Team for an obvious reason) are:A reader reminded me of this set and led me back to a deeper look at one of the A-Team players, AIF, which I'll get to here. As for the others, I did buy ACV. I added it with funds from selling half my Allianz GI Convertible & Income (NYSE:NCV) position which had run up a huge premium from my purchase. NCV and ACV are somewhat similar funds from Allianz, but at the time the discount/premium spread between the two was about 15 points in ACV's favor.I passed over AGC because I have convertibles adequately covered in other holdings, and I'm still interested in ACP.What I didn't pay much attention to at all was AIF. Then I received that reader query, did a bit of a face palm and went back to finish what I started. Frankly, I liked what I saw.So, here is my take on this Apollo fund.About the FundAIF has a history of about three and a half years; its inception date is 26 Feb 2013. It's a moderate size fund with $383M in total net assets.The fund is leveraged at 37.03%. Nearly all fixed-income CEFs are leveraged, but I'll note that the 37% cut put AIF in the highest quartile of general fixed-income funds for this metric. Management fees are reported at 2.25% with an additional interest expense of 0.72%.It invests in a range of credit instruments including senior, structured loans and high-yield corporate bonds. These charts and tables (from the August 31, 2016 Fact Sheet) illustrate the portfolio composition.For investors concerned about the potential impacts of interest rate hikes on the high-yield, fixed-income CEF market, AIF can offer an attractive choice. The portfolio's weighted average modified duration of 3.75 is lower than that of the overall junk-bond market. Furthermore, and the portfolio can shift between fixed- and floating-rate credit investments over time as market conditions shift. Note especially that today over 70% of the portfolio is in loans, with less than 20% in high-yield bonds.From Apollo's August 31, 2016 semi-annual report we can get an indication of portfolio characteristics.Again, I'd point out the average weighted maturities of the fixed-rate (5.22 years) and floating-rate (5.67 years) assets as well as the average modified duration of only 3.75 years. Weighted average credit rating is B (from Moody's) with about a quarter of the portfolio rated CCC+ or lower or unrated.Discount and YieldAt Tuesday's open AIF was holding a -11.8% discount to NAV and paying a 9.40% market yield.The fund's discount ranks in the top 12% of the 66 funds in cefanalyzer's general fixed-income category. The 9.4% market yield is in the top 30%. It is the only fund of the 66 that meets both of these criteria, i.e. top 12% in discount and top 30% in yield.The fund has paid a monthly distribution of $0.1170 every month since its inception. It added special distributions for 2014 ($0.252) and 2015 ($0.1537) which tells us that it has been earning its 8.3% NAV distribution consistently during a period that has not been generally favorable for high-yield fixed income.AIF's discount has been closing in the face of its performance gains this year, but there has been a recent dip of about 2%. At -11.89% the discount is close to the six-month average of -11.54. The one-year Z-Score is 0.70 but for three-months it is -1.40, reflecting the recent move. This chart (cefconnect) shows the year's values.Recent PerformanceWhile AIF's return lags its category for one year, it beats the category for more recent periods and for three-year returns at both market and NAV as these data from cefconnect show.The fund's performance over the past six months is well illustrated in this chart comparing its total return to iShares iBoxx High-Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:HYG), PIMCO Dynamic Credit and Mortgage Income Fund (NYSE: PCI), my personal favorite of the moment, and, for an equity-market comp, SPDR S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY). You can draw your own conclusions.SummaryIn summary, AIF is a fixed-income CEF with some considerable appeal in today's difficult market. It does have the potential downside of its relatively high leverage, which will concern some investors.But it has a lot of favorables as well.Its low average duration and high level of floating-rate-credit position it well for a rising-rate environment.The discount remains extremely attractive. At nearly -12%, it's sufficient to kick up the 8.3% NAV yield to a 9.4% market rate yield. I'd be surprised if the steady loss on the discount that has characterized the fund all year doesn't continue again after this brief respite.The distribution has been stable since inception and there is no red flag on the fund's ability to maintain it at its current level. Taken as a whole AIF looks like it should be a timely buy."
4000298,75725,2016-08-17T13:19:47-04:00,,"Looking at the continuation in the rally in risky assets and watching with interest our friend Michael Lebowitz getting blocked on Twitter by Narayana Kocherlakota, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, we made the following sarcastic comment that if you are not a ""cargo cult"" follower, you get blocked. While being a ""cargo cult member"" entails various ritualistic acts such as ""wealth effect"" via QE not manifesting itself in the appearance of material real economic recovery, we could have used this very reference for our title analogy, but, given our previous reference to the French Revolution in our last conversation, it made us want to dig further into history when it comes to selecting an appropriate title.The Cult of the Supreme Being (French: Culte de l'Être suprême) was a form of deism established in France by Maximilien Robespierre during the French Revolution. It was intended to become the state religion of the new French Republic and a replacement for Catholicism and its rival, the Cult of Reason. It can be easily argued that the Cult of Reason, namely reasonable/rational central banking, has indeed been replaced by the Cult of the Supreme Being, namely the ""cult of the central banker."" The Cult of Reason distilled a mixture of largely atheistic views into an anthropocentric philosophy. No gods at all were worshiped in the Cult - the guiding principle was devotion to the abstract conception of Reason, which seems to have been totally ditched by our central bankers, ""deities,"" as of late. For Maximilien Robespierre, ""The Cult of the Supreme Being"" was said to have contributed to the Thermidorian Reaction and the ultimate downfall of Robespierre and his execution.Furthermore, in our July conversation ""Confusion,"" we made another reference to French economist Florin Aftalion 1987 seminal book entitled ""The French Revolution - An Economic Interpretation"" given the extension of Negative Interest Rate Policy now in German banks affecting retail deposits above the €100,000 threshold, the words of revolutionary figure Louis Antoine de Saint-Just, one of Robespierre's closest ally during the French revolution who ended up guillotined the very same day on the 28th of July 1794, are very interesting in relation to ""monetary creation"" and ""assignats"" we have discussed in our recent musings:No offense to the Supreme Being Cult members out there, but, in our book, NIRP is insanity as there cannot be productivity and economic growth without accumulation of capital, because simply put, NIRP is killing capital (savings).In this week's conversation, we will look at the continuation of the rally thanks to inflows which validates our short-term ""Keynesian"" stance. We do remain though medium- to long-term ""Austrian"" when it comes to assessing the credit cycle and the slowly but surely tightening noose of financial conditions as displayed evidently in the below chart from Bank of America Merrill Lynch CMBS weekly note from the 12th of August entitled ""Bad news is once again good news; remain overweight"":Of course, the evolution of US Senior Loan Officers Survey is worth tracking as it will clearly impact going forward the default rate and the US High Yield asset class. For now, everyone is ""dancing"", but, we think, it's worth ""dancing"" closer towards the exit we think, hence our recommendation in favoring ""Style"" over ""Substance"", namely US Investment Grade over US High Yield or playing simply the ""beta"" game.Synopsis:Macro and Credit - The melt-up is ""Breaking bad"" thanks to ""cult members"" inflowsWhen looking at the continuing rally into risky assets and particularly ""credit"", one would indeed conclude that the cult of the Supreme Being is alive and well particularly in the light of some long-dated corporate bonds trading in the region of $200 cash price. As indicated by the Financial Times in its article, ""Latest bond rally eye sore: one for the price of two"", ""Bondzilla"" the NIRP monster is getting bigger every day, thanks to the Supreme Being cult members:In conjunction to cult members being induced price wise by their Supreme Being, putting aside any reason or rational thinking, flow wise, the latest move by the Bank of England has also added fuel to the fire leading to some ""overdrive"" in spread tightening but inflows as well! This can be clearly seen in the United Kingdom credit markets as shown by Bank of America Merrill Lynch in its Follow the Flow note from the 12th of August entitled ""Thank you Carney - Largest inflow ever"":We might be sounding like a broken record, at least for our ""Cult of Reason"" members, but, the ""Supreme Beings"" of various central banks are not only pushing investors outside their comfort zone into credit risk they should not be taking, but they are also pushing them into increasing significant duration risk rest assured. Some are indeed racing into the ""beta"" transformation game into ""alpha,"" in a dwindling liquidity world, this will not end well, but, for the time being, it's ""rally monkey"" time for the Cult of the Supreme Being Members.While we are indeed tactically bullish for ""religious"" reasons, we do think that we are witnessing the final melt-up in risky assets given that many signs are starting to add up when it comes to gauging the state of the credit markets.When it comes to ""Bondzilla"" the NIRP monster now close up to $13.4 trillion, we expect the Japanese to come back into play in September thanks to additional ""unconventional"" measures from the Bank of Japan, and its ""zealous devots.""In a world turned upside down by rising ""financial repression,"" Bondzilla's growth is evidently more and more ""Made in Japan."" This can be clearly seen in the below Nomura chart from its Flow Monitor note of the 8th of August entitled ""Lifers' foreign bond investment reached a record high"":While the ECB and now the Bank of England are in the corporate bond buying business making the ""fun"" going ""uphill"" thanks to the ""wealth effect"" and in no way flowing ""downhill"" to the ""real economy"" that is, the Japanese investor crowd is ratcheting up its bidding as the competition for financial assets rises.A good illustration of the success of the Cult of the Supreme Being, when it comes to ""capital destruction"" can be seen in Japanese's net household savings rate, thanks to ""financial repression"" as well as major demographic headwinds as illustrated in the below chart from Deutsche Bank's Japan Economics Weekly note from the 5th of August entitled ""Inconsistency of policy to promote 'savings into investment'"":We will not go back into the false ""rhetoric"" from ""The Cult of the Supreme Being"" related to the ""savings glut"" as we have already touched on this very subject in February in our conversation, ""The disappearance of MS München"". Put it simply, no offense to the ""zealous devots"" of the ""Supreme Beings"" but in our book (and also in Claudi Borio's book from the Bank for International Settlements), ""financing"" doesn't equate ""savings"", at least in our cult, ""The Cult of Reason"" that is. If NIRP is killing ""savings,"" there cannot be ""proper"" financing"" to the ""real economy"" as stipulated earlier on in our conversation.Furthermore, we keep hammering this, but, our ""core"" macro approach lies in distinguishing ""stocks"" from ""flows."" When it comes to dealing swiftly with ""stocks"" of nonperforming loans (NPLs) such as in Italy via ""flows"" of liquidity, it looks to us that the ""Supreme Beings"" do not understand that ""liquidity"" doesn't equate solvency.Moving one to our second point, while the rally is ""technically"" driven thanks to ""financial repression"" thanks to the mischiefs of the ""religious cult"", we continue to believe we are in the last inning of this credit cycle, making us continue to believe in quality and capital preservation rather than chasing yield for the sake of it.Macro and Credit - While credit spreads are grinding tighter, quality is eroding fasterAs we pointed out at the beginning of our conversation, we will continue to monitor closely US Senior Loan Officers Surveys in the coming quarters as it has always been driving the default rate in the past. Of course, ""flows"" are driving the relentless search for yield while ""credit tourists"" are punting for ""beta,"" but, nevertheless, we do believe that no matter how ""zealous"" the members of the ""Cult of the Supreme Beings"" are, the credit cycle is slowly but surely turning. On that note, we read with interest Wells Fargo Securities' latest Credit Connections note from the 12th of August entitled ""The Linchpin"":There could no better illustration of all the ""fun"" playing ""uphill"" in the bond market that is than the above chart. You can indeed put aside the ""Great Rotation"" marketing ploy by some pundits, given, as we stated before, the only ""riskless"" game for now, worth playing thanks to the ""Supreme Beings"" is the bond market.While ""The Cult of the Supreme Being"" is still thriving, credit investors should be well advised to read the wise words of one of the members of the ""Cult of Reason"", namely Nassim Taleb from his recently published note entitled ""The Most Intolerant Wins: The Dictatorship of the Small Minority"":Whereas credit risk is increasing, giving the lower for longer mantra, thanks to the macro fundamentals backdrop playing out and financial repression, not only, as we have highlighted, credit investors have been extending credit risk, but they also have extended their duration risk, increasing in effect the duration mismatch between US cash investment grade and its synthetic credit hedge tool the CDX IG series 26 5 credit index as per our final point and final chart below.Final chart: US Investment Grade credit - Growing duration mismatch between cash and syntheticWhile we have been recommending since the beginning of the year to favor quality over quantity (High Yield and size of the coupon that is...) through US Investment Grade credit and extended duration, us, being in the camp of ""lower for longer,"" credit investors have had no choice but to take on both more credit risk as well as duration risk thanks to ""The Cult of the Supreme Being."" Our final chart comes as well from Wells Fargo Securities' latest Credit Connections note from the 12th of August entitled ""The Linchpin"" and illustrate the growing duration mismatch between ""cash"" and ""synthetic"":This means that as hedging tool, one would need to compensate for the extended duration rise in the cash market and needs to buy more ""protection"" to hedge a cash investment grade credit portfolio if one wants to be ""duration neutral"" that is.Finally for our parting quote, when it comes to ""The Cult of the Supreme Being,"" we would like to end up our conversation with yet another extract from Florin Aftalion's 1987 seminal book entitled ""The French Revolution - An Economic Interpretation,"" over the issues and discussions surrounding the ""assignats"" and what the abbé Maury, a deputy on the Right had to say about them at the French National Assembly during the French Revolution:Stay tuned!"

4007253,82866,2016-09-20T08:01:26-04:00,,"With crude oil futures weakening on schedule - at the beginning of the seasonally-weak September-March period - one has to wonder what would happen to other highly-correlated risk assets, like emerging markets and junk bonds. (Crude oil should be weaker in the next six months because 88% of the world's population lives in the Northern hemisphere, where fall and winter demand is lower.)Making matters worse, the global oil glut has only grown deeper over the past year, with the decline of production in the U.S. being picked up by an increase of crude oil supply elsewhere, most notably in Iran.Still, one has to wonder why emerging markets and junk bonds have been resilient while the oil price has weakened. Historically, such divergences have not lasted long. A sharply weakening oil price is not a factor of just ample supply, but also weak demand. I am of the opinion that China is facing a generational downshift in growth rates and is likely headed for a hard economic landing.As the largest consumer of commodities, most notably oil, the Chinese hard landing will show up in the commodity markets. In many respects their economic slowdown has already shown up in commodity prices, but since I believe that their economic slowdown will deepen in 2017, I think we may yet see new lows for the oil price.Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only. Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary.The 2016 topping pattern (in the chart, above) started this June and accelerated in July. Save for the August short-squeeze rebound, it is very similar to what we saw in 2015. One has to wonder where the crude oil price will be in early 2017. Right now, my working hypothesis is that it will be somewhere in the $20s.Such a negative view on crude oil causes me to be quite skeptical of other risk assets that are correlated to it. Both junk bonds and emerging markets have been holding up well. That divergence first became apparent in July as crude oil was heading towards $40 per barrel. As time has passed and the markets have zigged and zagged, the divergence has only gotten bigger (See August 11, 2016 MarketWatch article, ""One of these two risk assets is sending the wrong signal - but which one is it?"")Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only. Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary.There is some weakening in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index in September and it may be the start of a much bigger move if crude oil falls to $20/bbl early in 2017. Many of the economies in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index are driven by trade with China, either via export of commodities or manufactured goods. If China sneezes, its giant $11 trillion economy could cause most emerging markets to catch a cold.Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only. Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary.You can see what has happened to the CRB Commodity Index over the past couple of years as the Chinese economy has decelerated. The CRB was cut in half at one point, falling from 310 to 155 in January of this year, when it hit 40-year lows not seen since before the oil embargo in 1973. If we see a Chinese recession, which is coming sooner or later, in my view, I don't believe the 155 low will hold.The sharp weakening in the price of oil also raises interesting questions about the junk bond market, as much of the surge in production in the U.S. since 2008 has been financed via junk bonds. The new supply of shale oil is also very high-cost in nature. It is not uncommon for cash production costs per barrel to be in the $40s, $50s, and $60s, and in some cases even higher. You could say that the seasonal rebound we saw in mid-2016 saved many high-cost producers - some of them only temporarily - from bankruptcy.Many over-leveraged, high-cost producers produced oil at a loss in 2015 and early 2016 hoping for a rebound to bail them out; and they had to keep making payments on their bond and bank loans. What happens to those producers if oil makes a lower low in price and the seasonal rebound next year is much smaller than this year? There should be a notable pickup in bankruptcies in the sector under that scenario.Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only. Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary.The BofA Merrill Lynch B Option Adjusted Spread - a measure of the yield premium bond buyers are seeking to buy B-rated ""junk"" bonds over the comparable maturity Treasuries - topped out near a 900 basis point (9%) premium over Treasuries when the oil price went to $26/bbl in January. This spread index got as low as 498 bps at the end of August and it had only recently turned up to 524 bps at last count. Where will it be come next January if oil is at $26 or lower? My guess is near 900 bps or higher.While it is easy to see how emerging markets and junk bonds can be correlated to commodity prices and more importantly crude oil, the case of Deutsche Bank's (NYSE:DB) share price (green line in the chart below) and the 10-year Treasury note yield (black line) is a bit of a head scratcher.This could be caused by the decline in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield being seen as a deflationary sign, which in turn pressures DB's stock, while a rising U.S. 10-year Treasury yield is seen as a sign of easing deflation, therefore a boost for DB. (See June 24 MarketWatch article, ""A look at the global economic malaise through Deutsche Bank."") (Please note: Ivan Martchev does not currently own a position in DB. Navellier & Associates, Inc. does not currently own a position in DB for any client portfolios.)The peculiar point of this correlation is that one part of this equation is the risk-free interest rate in U.S. debt, while the other is the stock of the largest financial institution in Germany and continental Europe.Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only. Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary.The source of the latest divergence is Deutsche management declining to accept an offer from the U.S. DOJ to settle claims of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) for $14 billion. Deutsche's point is that other MBS players had to settle for way smaller amounts, so it is going to defend its ground against the DOJ. (see Bloomberg.com, September 19, 2016, ""Deutsche Bank Extends Losses as Analysts See Capital Threats."")The market didn't like Deutsche management's attitude and sent both its stock and its bonds lower last week by the largest magnitude since Brexit.Somehow I do not see the DOJ pressing its case against DB in the middle of the Brexit mess while DB is in a weakened position and may not even have the money to settle unless it forces a dilution on its shareholders. DB stock has a market capitalization of $18.3 billion and it trades at 24 cents on the book value dollar. Needless to say, this reflects a crisis valuation that is below the bank's 2008 low.If this DOJ drama continues, it has the potential to push DB stock to fresh 52-week lows faster, which were probably coming anyway due to the deflationary dynamics playing out in Europe. The trouble with such a depressed share price in a time of falling bond prices and surging credit default swaps is that DB's counterparties may simply lose confidence in the company. As we saw in 2008, particularly in the Bear Stearns situation, such ""death spirals"" can develop rather quickly.In this case, I think the German government, the Bundesbank, and even the Fed will step in as Deutsche Bank has a bigger balance sheet than Lehman Brothers at the time it went bust eight years ago this week. The fact that DB stock may be imploding surely does not seem reassuring at the moment."
4000169,22049,2016-08-17T06:54:02-04:00,,"A great deal of commentary over the past few days has focused on the recent equity market trifecta, i.e., the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite Index all hit new all-time highs on the same day and the heightened potential for an equity market correction. Over the past week or so, LPL Financial Research has published some good analysis around the broad index participation in new highs and potential future market outcomes.Since 1980, 12-month rolling returns have been positive 76.5% of the time. As the below table shows, when the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq hit all-time highs on the same day, the 12-month forward return is positive 75% of the time and averages 11.9%. I would recommend readers read the LPL article.Source: LPL Financial ResearchEquities have certainly had a nice move to the upside following the February market lows. And given the strength of this move, some downside consolidation would be expected. However, simply because the three indexes hit new all-time highs, this does not mean stocks are necessarily due for a correction.What investors might not be focused on though is the strength in fixed income returns this year. As the year got underway, market expectations were the Fed could raise the Fed Funds rate up to as many as four times over the course of 2016. Now, if we get one rate increase, that might be all the market will need to digest in 2016.As a result of this lower trajectory in potential rate increases, fixed income returns have far exceeded many investors' expectations. The below chart clearly shows the strength of a select few fixed income vehicles along with the S&P 500 Index.The S&P 500 Index year to date return has trailed the return of the long-term Treasury Index and high-yield index. Additionally, with these strong returns in a number of fixed income categories, should investors be more concerned about future bond returns than future stock returns? The iShares High Yield Bond Index (NYSEARCA:HYG) has hit a record high and the 30-year Treasury yield is near a record low and I am only showing a couple of examples.For investors, if one-year forward corporate earnings meet expectations, this could be one tailwind for stocks. We have discussed this in several earlier posts along with the fact economic data is largely coming in better than expected, not only in the U.S. but in Europe as well. Some of these variables suggest there is greater potential downside risk in some bond categories and the stars may be aligning for further upside in stocks over the next twelve months. Higher equity prices certainly will not unfold in a straight line though."

I took a prolonged summer break and have been traveling Europe for months now. As a matter of fact, I've been traveling the world for 11 months now and have not yet returned back to Australia. Last newsletter, which initially did not work properly due to technical issues (but works now), showed a few places I recently visited including the beautiful Adriatic coastline.Since I haven't properly commented on asset class performance in awhile, today's post will be more in-depth than usual. Furthermore, in coming posts I will also be diving into some commentary that covers various portfolio returns, and not just classic tactical opinions. There are many ways to do this, but I shall try to track the ""imitational lookalike"" performance of several famous asset allocators and comparing them against the way I invest my own capital. But for now, let us cover recent market conditions.2016 has been a great year for asset classes, in particular the bond market. Federal Reserve raised rates at precisely the wrong time at the end of 2015, just as the global economy continued to slow. What followed was a nasty equity market correction in January and February, which pushed the Fed back into the dovish corner. The bond market started a powerful rally, sensing that the US central bank was in a ""one-and-done"" case scenario.The chart above shows annualised performance for Treasuries, Treasury Inflation Linkers, Investment Grade bonds, Emerging Market bonds and High Yield Junk. While EM debt has outperformed over the last 12 months (up 15.3%), every other sector of the bond market has done very well, including Junk Bonds (up 7.3%). This is precisely why we made a tactical call in early July that the bond market and other safe havens should correct.On the risk asset side (not shown in the chart above), we have sound performing assets as well. On an annualised basis US equities are up 12.9%, EAFE equities are up 1.0%, EM equities are up 16.3%, US commercial real estate is up 18.3% and finally gold is up 15.5%. Please note that all data above is from the middle of August. Basically, it's been difficult to lose money in 2016, not matter what one did. But the question is, what should we expect from here onwards?First and foremost, it seems to me that we are still in a yield flattening environment. In plain English, this has almost always meant tighter monetary and credit conditions. The spread between the 2s and 10s, as well as the 5s and 30s seen in the chart above, continues to narrow. Every student of market history should know that an inverted yield curve has been a pretty decent predictor of recessions and the last two occurrences (in 1999 prior to the Tech crash & in 2006 prior to the Lehman crash) are no different. While we are not there yet (still another 105 basis points left), the recent consolidation of yield spreads narrowed within a small triangle and broke downwards. This breakdown has been linked to the recent comments by Janet Yellen & Co. Hawkish comments could be preparing us for a rate hike after the elections, as long as economic data continues to improve.This could be a bit of a worry for the Treasury bond market investors, which on aggregate hold a decently bullish position within the futures market. Treasury COT data can sometimes send wrong signals, so I like to focus on the group known as Non Reportables or Small Speculators. When we combine the positioning throughout the whole yield curve, we can see that Specs aren't net long so extreme optimism isn't a worry here. However, they do hold only a small net short position relative to other major extremes such as early 2007, middle of 2008, early 2011, late 2013 and late 2015 (all of those marked major bond market bottoms). Therefore, if the Fed was to move rates higher in coming months, there is a chance that hedge funds will be forced to increase their Treasury net shorts as prices correct.At this point, I know that some readers will automatically assume that shorting the US Treasury market, in particular the very volatile long duration maturity, could be a slam dunk play. However, that is very far from certain. Over the last three years, we have seen the Fed move slowly towards tighter monetary policy. Firstly, we had the tapering of the QE, where Mr. Bernanke decided to stop printing money. Afterwards, we had the Federal Reserve start its tightening cycle, admittedly at a very slow pace. So how did bond bears do over the last 3 years? Not so well, to be quite honest. The 30 Year Long Bond has produced a 12.8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR).One could argue that this is the slowest and most dovish tightening cycle in Federal Reserve history (dating back to 1913). I wouldn't argue against that. Therefore, let us focus on the tightening cycle prior to this one, where Ben Bernanke & Co. raised rates multiple times during mid 2000s and yet the 30 Year Long Bond never lost money when held over that 3 year rolling period as well. As a matter of fact, the last time longest maturity total return declined in any meaningful way was during inflationary periods of the 1970s (Oil Embargo I & II). Even then, nominal losses were only around 5 percent per annum (very different story when adjusted for inflation).I am not suggesting that the 30 Year Bond cannot drop in price. Long term bond investors suffered serious corrections in 1973, 1979/81, 1987, 1994, 1999, 2009 and 2013. However, unless you are an amazing market timer, shorting bonds isn't for the faint-hearted investors. The same case could be made with the ML Junk Bond Total Return Index. Expectations by bearish investors that high yielding bond market will implode in similar fashion to 2008 was short lived… very short lived. Once again, great market timers would have made a nice profit by shorting in May 2015 (around the same time MSCI World peaked out) and closing those shorts in early 2016 (around the same time crude oil bottomed out).But how many of us are truly capable of doing that on a consistent basis? On the other hand, long term investors who earn interest and reinvest proceeds back into the index, have done great over the last two decades. Let us remember that to achieve this return, one must be able to ride though the volatile periods of 1998 Asian Financial Crisis, 2001 US Recession & Tech Crash, 2008 Global Financial Crisis, 2011 Eurozone Debt Crisis and finally the 2015 China Slowdown & Commodities Crash. So…should we be surprised that the High Yield market is now posting yet another record high in August?As a result of the Federal Reserve turning dovish and backing away from aggressive rate hikes in the first half of 2016, credit spreads have narrowed dramatically. Worst quality high yielding bonds (CCC Or Below) have narrowed from 20.2% all the way to 12.5% against equivalent maturity risk free Treasuries, while BBBs have come down from 3% towards 1.8% last week. Finally, the recent commodity collapse did not put much pressure on the highest quality bonds and the spreads in this area have not been affected much since the Eurozone Debt crisis in 2011/12.Speaking of the Eurozone debt crisis, 2015 was the worst performing year for global equities since the 2011/12 period. As I've written many times before on my blog, the US has outperformed and continues to outperform, posting new record highs. This is the stock market that has been tricking all the global macro investors. If one was to closely observe the chart above, other Developed Markets including Japan suffered throughout 2015, while Emerging Markets (and in particular China) went through an outright crash.After the February lows, global equities have staged a seriously strong comeback. The S&P 500 has broken out of its trading range, while the MSCI All Country World Index is playing catch up and is trading at the highest level since the middle of 2015. Technical analysts could make a case that the ACWI has now successfully completed an inverse head & shoulders bottom and new highs may lay ahead. Additionally, February also marked the low in breadth readings and for the first time since mid 2014 we have 100% of major global indices (priced in USD) trading above their respective 200 day moving average. While this does signal short term overbought readings (and a potential for a pullback), it also tends to signal wide participation rate over the medium to long term (and a potential for higher prices ahead). Over the short term time frame, breadth isn't the only important indicator signalling a potential for a pullback. Volume and volatility have dropped to levels which indicate that complacency is widespread (especially volume on the QQQ ETF). Furthermore, while ""Sell in May and go away"" has not worked this year, it is important to remember that September is traditionally and historically the worst month for equities. Finally, looking at the NAAIM survey and to a lesser extent II survey, bullish sentiment has returned to levels where equity pullbacks tend to occur. As a result of these indicators, and several others not discussed here, I wouldn't chase equities immediately despite a bullish S&P breakout from an 18 month trading range.While my personal message and tone is leaning more towards a bullish stance, and a cautiously bullish one at that, certain readers will disagree. Don't worry, all it takes is for me to look at the extremely high equity valuations by any one of the more widely followed metrics (CAPE, PB ratio, Price to Sales, etc, etc) and I will also disagree with myself too. Having said that, here I would like to add a few points.Firstly, sentiment was universally bullish coming into late 2014 and early 2015. At the same time, breadth was very weak as far more NYSE stocks declined during 2014/15 period than rose. As we noted above, credit spreads were already widening. Also of importance was the decline in company earnings and slowdown in economic growth (in particular places outside of the US like China). Many famous investors, ""celebrity"" hedge fund managers and widely followed ""gurus"" called for the S&P 500 to decline and yet over the last 3 years US equities have managed to achieve an 11.8% compound annual return…slaughtering the bears. And now we have a two year long consolidation, which has been broken to the upside and could have bullish consequences.A very successful and wise investor once told me that ""good traders get out when the market moves against them, while great traders reverse their position."" I believe that US equities' resilience is a surprise to just about all of us. So maybe if it doesn't want to go down, it still wants to go up?One way to play the remaining innings of the bull market could be via value stocks instead of chasing market darlings and momentum. More depressed sectors, such as Energy, have gone through a serious bear market while S&P 500 traded sideways. We discussed how the Large Cap index posted impressive compound returns over the last 3 or even 5 years, but obviously this is not the case for commodity producers and other related sectors. I would argue that the US Energy sector is now attractive both nominally as well as relatively.There is an above average probability that we have seen the bottom in this downhearted part of the market and on any meaningful pullback, I would start to acquire some positions. The sector is so oversold (even despite a strong rebound in the first half) that the 3 year rolling CAGR remains one and a half standard deviations below the 50 year mean. Such dreadful performance happens during major oil busts like we saw in the mid 1980s, early 2000s and during the 2008 GFC…and that is usually the best time to buy.Keeping value as the central point and emphasis, certain investors could make a case that relative to both US stocks and US bonds (which are at all time record highs) gold remains very attractive. The bear market from September 2011 until December 2015 shed more than 40% (on monthly closing basis) of yellow metals value. Furthermore, despite a robust first half performance, the precious metal is still in a drawdown of almost 30%.There are merits to this argument, however I would like to add a few important pieces of information. Historically, gold investors have accepted the same risk and volatility of EM equities, but for only half the return. Observing the chart above, some readers might come to a conclusion that gold is possibly one of the more lousy asset classes for the long run, providing the worst risk relative to reward.Furthermore, consider the fact that over any 2 year rolling period within the last 50 years, global equities tend to achieve positive returns 83% of the time while gold does so only 56% of the time. By the same token, record highs are achieved only 9% of the time and drawdowns can last for generations (please refer to the first gold chart). Obviously, past performance isn't a good predictor of the future and at times this precious metal has done fabulously well. Sometimes up 11 years in the row, like from 2001 until 2012.I believe that we are now at an important cross road for gold, as well as the overall precious metals sector. Last week's technical bullish reversal on the USD Index could mean that the bull market in the reserve currency is resuming (the chart below shows a consolation period over the last 18 months). I wonder if we will look back on the current gold & silver rally as a dead cat bounce or the start of a new bull market? If it's the former, quite a few people will be wrong. So many reports have been published about how gold has started a new bull market. So many speculators and hedge funds have jumped into futures contracts and ETFs (chart above).Nevertheless, we live in strange times as global central banks continue their monetary policy experiments. In the world of negative interest rates, bonds aren't an asset but an actual liability (and a money losing proposition). Over and above that, in the world of negative interest rates, gold is actually a positive yielding asset class. Finally, there have been periods in time when both the dollar and gold rose as safe havens (even though they are quite rare), so there should always be a place for gold in any asset allocation strategy.Holidays are always great. Amazing food, green & blue crystal clear waters and wonderful weather is always a blessing…what more could we ask from our life? But I am very happy to be back in work mode and fully focused.Original Post"
3999078,24386,2016-08-12T02:41:37-04:00,,"Between the market low in February and the July peak, high-yield bonds rallied roughly 15%, according to Bloomberg data. After adjusting for risk, the bounce in high yield was even greater than the rally in stocks. More recently, however, high yield has started to fade. Although interest rates remain low and the search for yield continues, after such a strong rally, it is worth asking: ""Is it time to start selling high yield?""The easy money boat has sailedThe case for high yield rests largely on the fact that it remains one of the few asset classes left that can offer a greater than 5% yield. Spreads (the difference between the yield of a high-yield bond and a U.S. Treasury) have come in considerably since the winter lows. But relative to Treasuries, high yield still provides a spread of around 540 basis points (5.4%), close to the long-term average (source: Bloomberg). It is true that if you strip out energy companies, spreads are a bit tighter. This suggests that while high-yield pricing is not particularly daunting, the easy money has already been made. Historically, the best time to buy high yield is when spreads are wide, such as earlier this year when spreads briefly climbed over 800 basis points (source: Bloomberg).An improving economic outlook is a plusIn short, valuations can be described as reasonable but not cheap. In that case, it is important to consider the economic outlook. More than most other segments of the fixed income market, high yield typically performs better when the economic outlook is improving. For example, high-yield returns have been positively correlated with quarterly changes in my preferred leading indicator, the Chicago Fed National Activity Index (CFNAI). On this score, the outlook for high yield looks a bit better. While still suggesting lackluster growth, the CFNAI recently moved back into positive territory, signaling the expansion can continue.Average valuations and a decent, if lackluster, economy probably equate with modest but positive returns. In the current environment, modest may be good enough. The reason comes back to yield - although current yields are low by historical standards, they look more compelling in the context of an ever-shrinking pool of high yielding assets.Still has a place in most portfoliosEven if you assume some widening of spreads and a lower total return, there is still a case to be made for including high yield in portfolios. Using the BlackRock Investment Institute's five-year capital market assumptions of 3.6%, which take into account how we think current economic and market conditions will play out in the medium term, traditional portfolio construction methods suggest a 5%-10% allocation in all but the most conservative portfolios. The reason - volatility is low compared to stocks, and yields are generous compared to other types of bonds.What are the caveats?The big one is the economy. With growth stuck below 2%, investors are not being paranoid in worrying about the next recession. Should the economy start to contract, high yield would likely trail investment grade and government bonds.Another risk factor is oil. Given exposure to smaller, more speculative energy companies, for most of the past year, high yield has been trading in line with oil. The correlation has weakened a bit in recent months, but if oil remains below $40 a barrel, investors are likely to refocus on the solvency of smaller energy companies.Bottom line: While the risks are real, in a world of slow but steady growth high yield still has a place in most portfolios.This post originally appeared on the BlackRock Blog."
3996934,75725,2016-08-07T07:08:48-04:00,,"Watching with interest the disappointment unfold thanks to Bank of Japan's holding pattern, pushing us to quickly take our loss and cut our small short yen exposure, while looking at the news that France was about to harvest the least wheat in 28 Years, it reminded us for our title analogy, the French Republican Calendar implemented during the French revolution and used by the French government for about 12 years from late 1793 until 1805, with Thermidor (or Fervidor) starting the 19th or 20th of July and coming from the Greek ""thermon"" meaning ""summer heat"". On many printed calendars of Year II (1793-94), the month of Thermidor was named Fervidor (from Latin fervens, ""hot""). Looking at the performance of European banks' stocks since the beginning of the year and following the publication of the ""stress tests"", we do think indeed that our title is indicative of a build up in ""summer heat"", at the same time it is as well indicative of the significant performance in credit which was yet given another boost thanks to the latest Bank of England raft of decisions.What is of interest in the Republican calendar was the tentative in the alteration of time measurement we think:This was part of a larger attempt at decimalisation in France (which also included decimal time of day, decimalisation of currency, and metrication). When we look at the effects of Negative Interest Rate Policy aka NIRP, we can only think about the attempt of central bankers towards ""decimation"" of European bank stocks, decimation meaning to destroy a great number or proportion of. On a side note France introduced ""decimilisation"" of the franc in 1795 to replace the ""livre tournois"", abolished during the French Revolution whereas the United States introduced decimal denomination from the outset of home minted currency in 1792 with the dollar being equal to 100 cents.Of course our use of a French revolutionary calendar term is as well a reference to our previous conversation from September 2012 ""Pareto Efficiency"" where we indicated the following when it comes to ""wheat prices"" and ""revolutions"":Now, going towards 2017 with first the Italian referendum in October, then with some important elections taking place next year in both France and Germany, we are wondering if indeed ""Thermidor"" will not lead to yet another summer of discontent in 2017 given the the significant rise of populism tied to the ""War on Inequality"" mentioned recently by Michael Hartnett's team in the latest Bank of America Merrill Lynch Thundering Word note from the 29th of July entitled ""Fiscal Flip...Get Real"":Could this rotation from ""deflation"" to ""inflation"" trigger indeed a surge in commodities? We wonder...The only issue is once the ""Inflation Genie"" is ""Out of the Bottle"" as warned by Fed's Bullard in 2012, it is hard to get it back under control:As we have repeatedly pointed out, the money is flowing ""uphill"" where all the ""fun"" is namely the bond market, not ""downhill"" to the ""real economy"" as shown by the latest yet unsurprisingly dismal US GDP print. This of course leading to a ""pre-revolutionary"" mindset setting in, leading to the rise of ""populism"" and the deafening sound of ""helicopter money"" and fiscal profligacy as the ""elites"" and their central bankers are starting in earnest to ""panic"" somewhat. We will touch more on this in our conversation.In this week's conversation we would like to reiterate, like many others our concern relating to the continuation of tightening financial conditions as per the US Senior Loan Officia Survey relative to the rally seen so far in US High Yield thanks to massive inflows from the retail crowd. While we remain tactically short term bullish, or ""Keynesian"", we do feel fundamentally ""medium term"" bearish"" or ""Austrian"" given current ""credit valuations"" do not reflect the deterioration in economic fundamentals. On that note we were not surprised at all by the latest US GDP print, given in January 2016 in our conversation the ""Ninth Wave"" we indicated:When it comes to our positioning relative to the US recessionary crowd, we believe that a flattening of the US yield curve is never a good sign, particularly for the financial sector which has been vaunted by some as a ""compelling"" buy.Why is so?Underperformance by the banking sector always is a bad sign for markets and the economy; it suggests that the credit mechanism is clogged, with knock-on effects for the rest of the economy, that simple.Synopsis:Macro and Credit - Is it High Noon for US High Yield tourists?For tracking credit availability, you need to use the central banks' credit surveys. The most predictive variable for default rates remains credit availability.For the US you need to follow the Senior Loan Officer Survey of 60 large domestic US banks and 24 US branches and agencies of foreign banks. This is updated quarterly such that results are available in time for FOMC meetings. Questions cover changes in the standards and terms of the banks' lending and the state of business and household demand for loans.As we pointed out in our November conversation ""Ship of Fools"", credit investors are often too complacent when it comes to assessing the stage of the credit cycle and when it comes from the retail crowd aka the US High Yield tourists, they have been pouring ""inflows"" at a very late stage of the ""game"":Lather, rinse, repeat.While it isn't yet ""high noon"" per se for the US High Yield tourists, the latest publication of the US Senior Loan Officer Survey confirms clearly a deteriorating trend in financial conditions which is indeed down the line (most likely in 2017) a recipe for a serious ""repricing"" of the asset class as a whole. To re-iterate our November call, we remain short-term ""Keynesian"" bullish / long term ""Austrian"" bearish when it comes to assessing the current stage of this credit cycle. This should provide sufficient proof for us not being labelled ""perma-bears"" or having a ""pessimism bias"" but, rather a ""realistic bias"" we think.When it comes to assessing global credit conditions, we share our concerns with UBS and read with interest their latest Global Credit Strategy note from the 2nd of August entitled ""Q2 Lending Conditions: Why did lenders tighten?"":Whereas the SLOS survey doesn't yet point out to ""High Noon"" for our US High Yield tourist friends from the retail space, we do think that the evolution of tightening financial conditions is a harbinger for things to come in 2017, namely spread widening and a rise in defaults. We do agree with UBS and share their increasing discomfort.As well, on the deterioration of the credit cycle, we read with interest Oaktree's insights in their special edition ""Navigating cycles"":Excess stimulants have compressed yield spreads too fast leading to ""unhealthy"" rapid bond prices gain such as the gains seen in single A credit in the United Kingdom following's the Bank of England early ""Christmas present"" for the speculating crowd. Yes indeed, the fun is ""uphill"", in the bond market.When it comes to ""Thermidor"" or ""investment heat"", when it comes to ""investment grade"" credit, the summer heat is truly ""on"". This leads us to our second point below.Macro and Credit - Investing Greed leaning towards Investment GradeWhile we have been predicating for the right reasons to stick with quality Investment Grade credit since the beginning of the year (particularly as per our last post on Senior Unsecured bank credit rather than equities...), even recommending a long duration exposure to the asset class, the ECB playing the ""corporate credit game"" now being followed as of late by the Bank of England points towards even more ""fun"" running uphill to this particular segment, or, to put it bluntly, ""Investment Greed"" is leading to ""Investment Grade"". When it comes to ""flows"", the ""summer heat"" is indeed ""on"" during our ""Thermidor"" period rest assured as pointed out by Bank of America Merrill Lynch in their latest Follow The Flow note from the 5th of August entitled ""Largest inflow into IG funds ever"":So much for the much lauded ""Great Rotation"" story from ""equities"" towards ""bonds"". When it comes to having some ""fun"" uphill, Fixed Income is still ""the place to be"" and when it comes to ""greed"", Investment Grade credit rules the game for now thanks to central banks joining as well the ""party"".While equities are making news highs while flows are making new lows, we think that we haven't seen yet the lows of the current credit rally in investment Grade à la 2006. On this particular point we agree with JP Morgan's take in their Credit Market Outlook and Strategy from the 28th of July when it comes to US Investment Grade:Whereas we think equities have much more less room to rise in the US, we do think we are going to see additional melt-up in and records been broken in the US. When it comes to ""valuation"" and ""rotation"", we do think that in this ""japanification"" and ""Thermidor"" period, the trend is indeed, your friend and there is more ""fun"" to come given ""greed"" is still running high in the context of ""financial repression"".While we keep noticing the deterioration in ""financial conditions"" as pointed out by the US Senior Loan Officers Surveys (SLOS), we still recommend a ""rotation"" towards ""quality"". This recommendation was made again in our previous conversation when it comes to bank exposure and ""senior unsecured credit"" was less volatile than merely chasing ""beta"".When it comes to ""greed"" and ""Investment Grade"" credit, we continue to favor US Investment Grade credit and we do think that having the ECB, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan, competing with their local investment base when it comes to chasing assets, we do think that once more US credit will strongly benefit from investors in September after the summer lull or ""Thermidor"" period.We therefore agree with Bank of America Merrill Lynch's take from their Credit Market Strategist note from the 29th of July entitled ""Kuroda and Draghi and Yellen"":If indeed ""greed"" is ""good"" then obviously there is more room when it comes to spread tightening in US Investment Grade thanks to somewhat to some ""crowding out"" due to to central bankers competing with investors in this ""unhealthy"" yield chasing game. We can as well anticipate a significant return of the Japanese investor crowd to foreign bond markets while the Bank of Japan, while on hold, is preparing for some more ""unconventional"" bazooka in September when we will eventually revisit our short yen exposure.When it comes to ""crowding out"" and the ECB, we read with interest Bank of America Merrill Lynch's European credit strategist Barnaby Martin note ""Resistance is futile"" from the 28th of July highlighting how central banks are pushing outside of their comfort zone ""yield hogs"" towards more credit risk and/or higher duration exposure:In similar fashion than the Bank of Japan has completely destroyed the liquidity in its Government Bond Market (JGBs), the ECB is as well in the process of wreaking havoc in the liquidity of the Corporate bond market and has now been joined in a similar process by its neighbor the Bank of England.When it comes to the ""Thermidor"" period, we do live in pre-revolutionary times we think and wonder how long markets are going to cope with this financial repression.On a final note and in our final chart and in continuation to last week's conversation surrounding bank ""valuations"", we would like to point out how interest policies of our ""omnipotent"" central bankers and now with NIRP are destroying slowly but surely ""bank capital"".Final chart: Bank stocks under pressure? Blame central banksWe will not re-iterate why we dislike banks stocks and in particular European banks stocks given the ""japanification"" process and the significant on-going deleveraging. If there is indeed some clear culprits when it comes to ""capital destruction"" thanks to Zero Interest Rate Policies (ZIRP) and now with Negative Interest Rate Policies (NIRP), the blame is entirely on the shoulders of our ""generous gamblers"" aka central bankers and their experiments.This is clearly illustrated in our final chart displaying the correlation between interest rate policies and bank stocks as pointed out by this chart from Bank of America Merrill Lynch from their Credit Derivatives Strategist note from the 5th of August entitled ""Corporate 'QE²' - When CBPS met CSPP"":As a ""bonus chart"" we will point out to yet another chart from Bank of America Merrill Lynch's European credit strategist Barnaby Martin note ""Resistance is futile"" from the 28th of July chart displaying that the ""fun"" has been going ""uphill"", namely to the bond market and in particular German Bunds:- source Bank of America Merrill LynchFor the ""real economy"", downhill that is, we are not too sure they are getting their share of the ""fun"", which does indeed explain the rise in inequalities, populism and the rising prevailing ""pre-revolutionary"" mood in many parts of the world.Back in November 2014 in our conversation ""Chekhov's gun"" we argued the following:Obviously our ""Hopeful equation"" suffered from ""Optimism bias"" and we argued at the time:Increasingly it looks to us that we are moving towards the inevitable longer-term violent social wake-up calls (populist parties access to power, rise of protectionism, the 30's model…). That's our take and our ""realist bias"" for now unless of course we finally get a wake-up call from the political class leading to the realization of our ""Hopeful"" equation but we would not bet on it for the time being.Stay tuned!"
3995456,96646,2016-08-03T21:38:54-04:00,,"By Tom O'Reilly, CFA, Head of Non-Investment Grade Fixed Income; Daniel Doyle, CFA, Senior Portfolio Manager, Non-Investment Grade Fixed Income; and Patrick Flynn, CFA, Senior Portfolio Manager, Non-Investment Grade Fixed IncomePortfolio Managers Tom O'Reilly, Dan Doyle and Patrick Flynn share their outlook for the high-yield credit market and where they see opportunity over the next 18 months.Tom: When you look at the high-yield market today, we still think that the future is good for potential returns. Why do I say that? If you go back to 2008 and one of the worst recessions that we've had in our lifetimes, the high-yield market defaulted out over 10 percent of the companies that were in the market - those business models that could not operate within a very difficult economic time. Since 2008 and 2009, the majority of the companies that are in the market today have already been tested on a very severe downside.They've already survived 2008. So we think that fundamentally, when you look at the high-yield market and the underlying companies that are in the market, defaults away from commodities are going to be very low for the foreseeable future.Patrick: One of the questions we get a lot in high yield is: how do we deal with the volatility in the market related to energy, metals, and other commodities? Certainly for the last year, there has been quite a lot of price activity in basic materials. As a result, there have been a number of high-yield companies that have had problems.The way we deal with it is how we deal with every other credit issue that comes into our market, which is really our credit best practices and our disciplined credit approach. We only invest in commodities companies that we believe can live through a downcycle, whether it's because of their cost position or the amount of debt they have or the types of resources that they have in the company. We want to be sure that they're going to be able to pay their debt even in a prolonged downturn.Dan: You can think of the high-yield market as two separate markets: commodities that have been under severe pressure under the past couple of years and the non-commodity part of the high-yield market that's been much more stable. We expect that non-commodity part of the market, or 80 percent of the high-yield market, to continue to have a relatively low default experience over the next few years. As opposed to that, we see an increasing default experience in the commodities space in 2016 and 2017.The low interest rate environment we have had over the past few years is likely to continue going forward. When that interest rate does begin to rise, I don't think it'll be a surprise to investors. I think it's likely to rise slowly and not shock the market. But again, when that rate begins to rise, it generally means that US GDP or the US economy is beginning to recover more. And that is significantly positive for high-yield bonds.Tom: We're always looking for secular changes in businesses. You know, you saw that in the paper industry. You saw it certainly within certain retailers like video retailers. But it's not just about secular changes within industries. It's also regulatory changes.For example, the healthcare industry relies on reimbursement rates for the government. If those reimbursement rates change significantly, that could also change the credit profile of a company to the point where it might default.For us, it's about any kind of signal within an industry that might be changing that could have a significant impact on the underlying credit.An investor should consider each Fund's investment objectives, risks and fees and expenses carefully before investing.

Investments could result in loss of principal.A bond's value may fluctuate based on interest rates, market conditions, credit quality and other factors. Generally, bond values will decline as interest rates rise. You may have a gain or a loss if you sell your bonds prior to maturity. Bonds are subject to the credit risk of the issuer. High yield bonds, also known as ""junk bonds,"" are considered speculative, involve greater risks, may fluctuate more widely in price and yield, and carry a greater risk of default, than investment-grade bonds.

3994411,24125,2016-08-02T06:29:40-04:00,,"By Matthew BorinEdward Altman says the benign credit cycle is in ""extra innings,"" but the metaphorical relief pitchers - central bankers - are running out of gas.Altman reviewed the current states of four credit cycle indicators and his Z-score measure of financial worthiness, in a presentation at the CFA Institute 2016 Financial Analysts Seminar. Altman's analyses focused on the risky high-yield bond market, where defaults are frequent during credit crunches. Though most indicators point towards the end of the benign cycle, Altman could not predict when the stress cycle will begin.""At the beginning of this year... particularly 11th February, when things turned around, we said we were in the ninth inning, but [the] score was tied,"" he said. ""Extra innings can last for one inning or it can last for many innings afterwards.""Default RateFew companies issuing high-yield bonds default during benign cycles, whereas default rates are high during stress cycles.The average annual default rate in dollar terms since 1971: 3.4% (over $100 million liabilities, four-quarter moving average). Over the last 12 months: 4.5%. Default rates are above the historical average for the first time in over six years. The longest benign credit cycle since 1972 was seven years, and the average length is five years and six months. Various forecasters have put the default rate for 2016 between 4.4% and 6%, all higher than the historical average, perhaps indicating the beginning of a stress cycle.Altman acknowledged that 60-65% of defaults are in the oil & gas and mining sectors, but warned against disregarding the data, as there is always an outlier industry.Recovery RatesAltman talks about recovery rate in terms of what a distressed investor could buy a bond for immediately after default. The average recovery rate since 1978 is 46% of par value just after default. Through 21st June, the recovery rate in 2016 is under 20%, a historic low. That is down from 63% in 2014 before the recovery rate dipped below 34% in 2015, mostly due to the mining and energy sectors. Based on the recovery rate alone, the benign cycle is already over.Yield SpreadsAltman also looks at the yield to maturity spreads (YTMS) between high-yield bonds and 10-year US Treasuries as an indicator of the market's willingness to put money into credit. The average YTMS since 1981: 543 basis points (bps). YTMS last June was 589 bps, indicating that the benign credit cycle was still going. Since reaching a historic high of over 2100 bps in December 2008, YTMS spiked in 2011 and late 2015. In both cases, central banks loosened monetary policy to lower spreads and possibly prolonged the benign cycle.LiquidityAltman uses the percentage of new issues rated B- or lower as an indicator of how much the market is willing to spend on very risky debt. This indicator tends to rise throughout the benign cycle before falling sharply.During the downturn in the fourth quarter of 2015, it appeared as though liquidity was low. B- or lower issues fell from 26% of the market in the third quarter to 2%. Despite the sell-off continuing into the new year, risky bonds are back up to 16% of issues in the first quarter of 2016.""Last week or last month was the biggest net inflows into the high-yield space ever. And the reason is quite obvious: search for yield. It's the only place you can get yield these days,"" Altman said.CCC rated bonds alone made up 12% of the dollar value of new issuances last quarter. Between 1971 and 2013, 47% of CCC bonds defaulted within five years after issuance. Altman expects low-rated bond issuances to stay high for the next two quarters as companies perceive a last chance to capitalize on low interest rates.""Junk is back in style,"" he said.Z-ScoresAltman's Z-score uses four or five weighted variables to assess the likelihood a firm will go bankrupt. The lower the Z-Score, the less solvent a company, with scores under 1.81 indicating bankruptcy is likely.In 2007, the median score for US companies was 1.81, the equivalent of a B rating. The rating in 2014: 1.80. Firms are no more credit-worthy than they were just before the Great Recession.Altman predicts the beginning of a stress cycle this year or next. Default rates may or may not exceed 10%, which would almost certainly coincide with a recession.According to Altman, central bankers' attempts to prolong the benign cycle with rock-bottom and even negative rates have done more harm than good. Low rates incentivized corporate firms to take amounts of leverage reminiscent of banks in 2007. Moreover, the preoccupation with growth forces fixed-income investors to sacrifice income.""I think it's really sad. Folks who have to depend on fixed-income securities... they've been disadvantaged for so long with these low interest rates all in the name of growth,"" Altman said. ""Let's face it, it hasn't worked. We've been growing at 2%.""All posts are the opinion of the author.

Since then, concerns have also surfaced that corporate debt is rising everywhere, giving us ""Crexit,"" a mashup of the twin risks of Brexit and credit.Global corporate debt jumpsStandard & Poor's recently voiced concerns that, ""heightened sensitivity to unexpected developments similar to the UK's referendum to leave the European Union could lead to a crisis of confidence and rapid departure of both lenders and lower-quality borrowers from the debt markets.""[1]Corporate debt has climbed because borrowing has been cheap and global central banks are likely to keep rates low. Too much borrowing, however, could spell widespread trouble unless credit quality remains high, economic growth continues and inflation and interest rates stay low.[2]S&P predicts global corporate debt which stood last year at $51.4 trillion could ramp up to $62 trillion by the year 2020 and $75 trillion by 2021, a 21 percent rise. China is predicted to be the largest borrower accounting for about 45 percent of this debt followed by the U.S. at 22 percent and Europe at 15 percent.[3]The Fed continues to keep interest rates low. Shaded areas represent U.S. recessions. Source: FREDWorse-case scenarioIf the Federal Reserve raises rates and the U.S. economy slows, many businesses could struggle to manage their growing debt effectively as some are likely to suffer when the economy is doing poorly.Investors could take a hit too if stock valuations drop and debt becomes more expensive. Actions like rolling over bonds or refinancing loans are harder to do when rates go up and inflation increases.If borrowers start defaulting on their loans, many lenders could decide to pull out of the market and this sudden tightening could set off another financial panic, i.e. Crexit.What's the worst that could happen? According to Standard & Poor's, it would be a In addition, S&P thinks some degree of a credit market correction is inevitable because the growth of corporate borrowing has outpaced that of the global economy and the actions of monetary policy so far have been increasing financial risk.[4]More leverage, more defaultsNot only are a lot of companies borrowing money, many of them are already highly leveraged. For example, about 50 percent of companies within the financial sector carry significantly more debt than equity. When companies increase their leverage, not only do they become riskier investments, they are more likely to go into default. Close to 5 percent of the financial sector has negative cash flows or earnings today and it's possible that this ratio could rise.[5]There have been 100 corporate bond defaults so far this year. That's 50 percent higher than they were a year ago, largely thanks to volatility in financial markets and slumping prices of oil and other commodities. No doubt energy and natural resources businesses accounted for a majority of defaults this year. This has led some analysts to predict a spillover effect into other sectors in the upcoming quarters.[6]Note that corporate defaults are up 87 percent from last year with the U.S. behind many of them.Many investors, however, do not appear to be aware of the rising bond defaults. Fixed-income funds are at their highest levels since February 2015 with trading volumes for corporate bonds up double digits amongst investment-grade and high-yield bonds.[7]Global corporate defaults are on the rise with the U.S. leading the way.

3994882,66783,2016-08-02T22:33:23-04:00,,"At a breath-taking pace. Default rate spikes. US stocks at record.Standard and Poor's default rate of US high-yield corporate bonds -the more appealing moniker for junk bonds - jumped to 4.5% in July, the worst since August 2010.But no problem. The S&P Distressed High-Yield Corporate Bond Index - comprised of 470 bond issues so troubled that they're trading at a yield that is at least 10 percentage points higher than the Treasury yield - has rallied 48% since February 12.This includes the 2.5% swoon on Friday, when some of the hot air was let out.Default rates blowing out to crisis proportions while institutional investors are piling into distressed junk bonds and drive up prices despite soaring defaults - these are the kinds of out-of-sync movements that our era of interest rate repression, QE and the relentless search for yield is becoming famous for.And so, in the same out-of-sync manner, despite rising junk bond prices and falling yields, US high-yield bond issuance in July dropped 32% from June, to $14.9 billion, according to LCD of S&P Global Market Intelligence. For the first seven months of the year, total issuance plunged to $196 billion, down 32% from a year ago.In Europe, it's even worse. According to LCD, high-yield issuance this year through July plunged nearly 50% year-over-year, to just €27.5 billion.And here's the conundrum in Europe: Corporate borrowing costs have dropped to a record low, repressed by the ECB's negative interest rates and QE under which it scoops up not only government bonds, asset-backed securities, covered bonds, and as a German politician fretted so wisely years ago, old bicycles, but also corporate bonds. So by Friday, the average yield of investment-grade euro-denominated corporate bonds has dropped to an all-time low of 0.7%.According to Bloomberg, about 26% of the 489 corporate bonds the ECB has mopped up so far have negative yields: Free money for corporations, financial repression for investors.Since the ECB started this in early June, it has bought €13 billion of corporate bonds. During the same period, companies issued only €19 billion of bonds. The ECB is also buying large quantities of government bonds and other assets from investors who then take this money and chase after the shrinking pile of the remaining securities.But the ECB isn't yet buying junk bonds, though surely, in addition to old bicycles, it will soon do so in its utter and rising desperation. But junk bond yields too have dropped in recent months and yet issuance is drying up.We know where a small part of this comes from: European energy bonds. They're collapsing, investors are getting worried, and companies are having trouble issuing new bonds.For example, in the second quarter, the trailing twelve-month Nordic high yield default rate jumped to 12.4%, the highest since the second quarter 2010, up from 9.7% in Q1, driven by 19 default events (including 12 distressed debt exchanges). Much of the activity happened in the oil and gas sector: In June, the Norwegian Oil & Gas default rate soared to a record 34.8%, higher even than during the Financial Crisis.In the US and the EU, oil & gas companies - except for the largest among them - are having trouble issuing bonds. But they had trouble last year too, and issuance had already plummeted in 2015 from a year earlier. So it doesn't fully explain the collapse of junk bond issuance on both sides of the Atlantic.Particularly interesting, and a warning sign: US stock markets are at record highs even while junk bond issuance has been grinding down this year, from an already lousy 2015, another one of those out-of-sync movements that are becoming symptomatic for our era of incessant market manipulations by central banks and their zero- and negative-interest-rate policies, QE and financial repression.So now, bond bull Grundlach makes U-turn and goes ""maximum negative"" on Treasuries - and just about everything else.

3995008,21992,2016-08-03T07:10:37-04:00,The high yield corporate bond market has shown tremendous resilience over the last several months.Notable cracks are growing in the high yield bond market facade.Another challenging stretch may lie ahead over the remainder of 2016.,"The high yield corporate bond market has shown tremendous resilience over the last several months. After plunging sharply along with oil prices through the early part of this year, the high yield bond market rallied just as swiftly once oil prices bounced from their lows. But despite the fact that it is just days removed from all-time highs according to selected measures, notable cracks are growing in the high yield bond market facade that may suggest another challenging stretch over the remainder of 2016.Looking Good On The SurfaceThe high yield corporate bond market certainly looks good on the surface. According to the iShares iBoxx High Yield Corporate Bond (NYSEARCA:HYG), which is the largest ETF in its category with more than $16 billion in assets, the category on a dividend adjusted basis touched a new all-time intraday on July 12. This was followed eight trading days later by a new all-time closing high on July 22. Thus, through Wednesday, we are only eight trading days removed from this category trading at all-time highs. What could possibly be wrong? A lot, as it turns out.Fundamental ProblemLet's begin with the fundamentals. High yield corporate bond spreads have been narrowing since their February 2016 peaks, which is indeed both reassuring and not surprising given the magnitude of the price gains over this same time period.But this improvement in spreads defies the recent trend in high yield corporate default rates. Roughly one year ago, the default rate in the high yield bond market was around 2%, which is well below the 35-year historical average of 3.8%. But over the past year, it has surged sharply higher to over 5% this summer. Moreover, the default rate is projected to continue rising through the remainder of the year and into next, potentially eclipsing the 6% mark along the way with some projecting rates as high as 7% or more.Beyond the fact that a growing number of creditors in the high yield bond market are expected to not meet their scheduled interest payments in the coming year, it is also problematic for the outlook for the entire asset class for the following reason. On only four occasions since the high yield corporate bond market emerged as a notable asset class in the late 1970s and early 1980s have default rates surged above 4%. And in each of these past four instances - the Savings and Loan Crisis in the late 1980s, the associated crash in the late 1980s and early 1990s that included the bankruptcy of Drexel Burnham, the bursting of the technology bubble in the early 2000s and the financial crisis at the end of the 2000s. In each of these past instances, the high yield corporate bond market suffered major losses in value. Put more simply, they were not trading at all-time highs under such conditions as they still are today.So exactly where is this rising credit risk coming from today? It remains primarily concentrated in the energy (NYSEARCA:XLE) and materials (NYSEARCA:XLB) sectors, which make up roughly one-fifth of the entire high yield bond market. It was the explosive price recovery among these beaten down names that propelled the high yield bond market back to the surface over the last several months. Thus, the recent sharp reversal of oil prices (NYSEARCA:USO) since early June is placing an increasing weight on the high yield bond market. In short, if the improvement in oil prices (NYSEARCA:OIL) supposedly gave many commodities related high yield issuers a lifeline of hope for survival, the subsequent reversal and accelerating decline of oil prices (NYSEARCA:DBO) over the past two months is increasingly undermining this once optimistic and hopeful narrative.Getting TechnicalA closer look at the technical behavior of the high yield corporate bond market raises some additional eyebrows.First, while the HYG recently touched new highs on a dividend adjusted basis, its junior counterpart in the SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bond (NYSEARCA:JNK) with its $12 billion in assets cannot make the same claim. Instead, its last highs came nearly two years ago in mid-2014.Also, while the dividend adjusted HYG may be trading just off of new all-time highs, the price unadjusted HYG has encountered a heavy technical resistance level at its 400-day moving average. After working to break through this resistance for nearly a month, it appears to have failed and has already fallen back to support at its 50-day moving average. And when looking at HYG on a price-only basis, it has all of the markings of a category that is entering a sustained bear phase.Back To The BattlefrontIn addition to examining the asset class in aggregate, it is also worthwhile to consider the individual names in the high yield bond market to identify specific areas of stress and those names that are currently most at risk.It was more than two months ago since we last visited the high yield corporate bond battlefield. And many of the familiar soldiers are still fighting the same tough fight.Intensive CareThe high yield ICU had been cleared out in the late spring, as business either entered into bankruptcy and passed away or found their footing and rallied higher. But despite the fact that the overall high yield bond market continued to rise, two companies have found their way back into the intensive care unit in trading between a 75% to 90% discount to par. These are listed below.Intelsat (I)Pacific Drilling (NYSE:PACD)The Front LineIn May, the list had narrowed to just 7 publicly traded names on the front lines as defined by trading at a highly stressed 50% to 75% discount to their par value. Two names as listed above entered the ICU. On the flip side, one name in Cliff Natural Resources (NYSE:CLF) improved so much that it made its way off of the battlefield entirely. As a result, only four names remain on the front line including two from the oil patch, another in drybulk commodities shipping and the last in geophysical services.California Resources (NYSE:CRC)CGG (NYSE:CGG-OLD)Memorial Production Partners (NASDAQ:MEMP)Navios Maritime (NYSE:NM)What is notable is the stock price performance of these names despite the fact that their credit status has remained largely unchanged over the last couple of months. For example, while Navios Maritime is doing marginally better from a stock price perspective since our last trip to the battlefield in late May, California Resources, CGG, Memorial Production Partners and Intelsat in the ICU above have all seen their stock prices fall anywhere between -19% and -42%. Such stock prices declines do not help the credit fortunes of companies like these that are already under strain.The Second WaveIn May, 17 companies still populated this list with debt that was trading at a 25% to 50% discount to par. Since that time, the total number of names on the list has shrunk to 10. A number of names have seen their credit fortunes improve and climbed their way out of the list. But the list also includes two new notable arrivals that were both fallen angels earlier this year from the investment grade category that are shown in bold below.Calumet Specialty Products (NASDAQ:CLMT)Chesapeake Energy (CHK)Denbury Resources (DNR)Ensco (ESV)Genworth Financial (NYSE:GNW)iHeartMedia (NASDAQ:IHRT)Navistar International (NYSE:NAV)Noble Corp. (NYSE:NE)Sanchez Energy (SN)Transocean (NYSE:RIG)While some names on the above list have seen stock price improvement since late May, others have not including Genworth, Denbury Resources, Ensco, Sanchez Energy and Noble Holdings, each of which are lower by anywhere between -13% to -32%.Thus, while the list of at-risk names has dwindled somewhat since the most recent battlefront visit in May, those that remain are finding themselves under increasingly heavy fire.Bottom LineCracks are increasingly building in the high yield corporate bond facade. Perhaps the chase for yield from income starved investors will help keep the asset class afloat for the foreseeable future. But one could reasonably imagine that rational investors may eventually seek out an alternative if more and more companies are unable to make the interest payments that feed those that are yield deprived. And the longer that oil prices keep plunging, the more pressure is likely to build on those companies that struggled to survive through the last wave of oil price declines just a few months ago.Credit risk is rising for the high yield corporate bond market. Those that are long would be well served to more closely examine current exposures for risk control reasons. And for those that are more aggressively inclined, opportunities to the short side (NYSEARCA:SJB) may have increasing appeal given the ongoing convergence of events in the high yield bond market.Disclosure: This article is for information purposes only.

3991380,82866,2016-07-26T04:45:19-04:00,,"One of these two camps of risk assets is sending the wrong signal: Emerging markets and junk bonds, or commodities – and more particularly, oil. While crude oil and commodities in general have weakened notably in July, both emerging markets and junk bonds finished on a high note last Friday. Emerging markets can be replicated in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, while commodities can be measured by the CRB Commodity Index or by the price of crude oil as the most important commodity. In this chart, the Emerging Markets Index (in red) roughly replicates the oil price (black line) until the last month.Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only. Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary.The correlation between emerging markets and commodities in general is not surprising as a great many emerging markets are commodity-driven economies. Most of Latin America, Russia, and Indonesia come to mind. Strong commodity markets and a strong oil price used to be a sign of concerted global economic growth. I suppose the opposite is also true, where many global economies are now weak and the U.S. has emerged as a relative island of safety.This is why when the MSCI Emerging Market Index and the price of oil and other key commodities move opposite to each other (as in the month of July; see chart, above), I am a bit puzzled. Divergences between correlated assets happens in financial markets all the time – I am in the camp that believes markets are not efficient – but the key is how to interpret those divergences, and what’s most important, how to exploit them profitably. In this case I think that risk assets like emerging markets and junk bonds are wrong and risk assets like commodities in general (and oil in particular) are right.The same is true for junk bond prices and crude oil. While the correlation is not as tight as it is with emerging markets, if we look at the price of the SPDR Barclays Junk Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:JNK) and the price of crude oil, we see the same divergence where junk bonds rallied in July while crude oil weakened notably.Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only. Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary.Keep in mind that a large part of the junk bond market is energy-related and junk bond defaults are rising with the present default rate at a six-year high, led by the energy sector. U.S. junk-bond defaults spiked to 5.1% of the total outstanding in the second quarter, up from 4.4% in the first. The global high-yield default rate could finish the year at 4.9%, with the U.S. default rate as high as 6.4%, according to Moody’s, who also forecasts the default rate for metals and mining at 10.2% and oil and gas at 8.6% over the next 12 months. Fitch estimates that with present junk bond defaults over $50 billion in 2016, the number can reach $90 billion by year-end (source: July 12, 2016 Bloomberg article, “Energy Failures Push U.S. High-Yield Default Rate to 6-Year High”).That type of surge in junk bond prices when the correlation between junk bonds and crude oil prices has never been as high as in 2016 (before July) is rather puzzling. Either junk bonds know something crude oil traders don’t know, or one of those two is wrong. Keep in mind that the surge of better than 50% in annual crude oil production in the U.S. was financed via high-yield debt. Also, a lot of that new crude oil production in the shale space is very high cost – in some cases, well north of $50/bbl – so many high-cost producers were producing at a loss for a while in order to make their junk-bond payments.Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only. Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary.While U.S. crude oil production is down to 8.494 million barrels a day for the week ending July 15 – or 1.06 million barrels a day lower than a year earlier – what many are not reporting is that the U.S. supply decline has been absorbed by rising Middle Eastern oil production resulting from Iran coming back onto the global market after the end of their nuclear sanctions. Also, the number of U.S. rigs has been rising for four straight weeks, which is a sign that domestic producers have changed their minds and are taking advantage of the oil price rebound since February, suggesting that U.S. crude oil production may not continue to fall as Middle East crude oil production is ramping up (see July 22, 2016 Marketwatch: “Largest U.S. oil-rig spike of 2016 is bad for prices, good for oil-service firms”).I am not surprised to see crude trading down to $43.74 on Friday on the September 2016 WTI futures contract, down from $52 last month. I have suspected all along that this rebound in oil was seasonal in nature. Crude oil demand tends to go up in March and weaken in September as there are simply more people living in the Northern hemisphere than in the Southern hemisphere. In 2015 we had a strong seasonal rebound of crude oil prices in March and April, flattening out in May and June, and coming down aggressively in July. This year the rebound started in February, but the weakening is right on schedule.I think that ultimately in this bear market for energy we may be headed to $20 or lower as a factor of surging global production and weak global demand. I am not aware of many crude oil producers factoring a coming economic hard landing in China – the world’s #1 consumer of oil – into their forecasts. That economic hard landing may come in 2017 as Chinese authorities seem to be encouraging accelerating lending into a busted credit bubble, which for the time being is postponing the unravelling. This may delay the outcome, but I sincerely doubt that China can avoid a hard landing. (See February 3, 2016 Marketwatch article, “Something Broke in China in 2016.”)If I had to pick who is right in the emerging markets/junk bond and commodity/oil price divergence, I would pick crude oil.We are meeting major “resistance” at 100 on the U.S. Dollar Index, so sooner or later I expect to hear that “the strong dollar is pushing down oil prices.”Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only. Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary.While the dollar may have a marginal effect on oil prices, in my opinion crude oil supply and demand is far more important than the dollar. While there aren't many commodity-driven currencies in the U.S. Dollar Index, the Broad Trade-Weighted Dollar Index contains many commodity- and oil-driven currencies. These currencies tend to weaken when oil prices are weak and the Broad Trade-Weighted Dollar Index tends to strengthen. There is no denying that there is some Soros-defined reflexivity in play here between crude oil and the dollar, but supply and demand is the more important factor, in my view.Graphs are for illustrative and discussion purposes only. Please read important disclosures at the end of this commentary.Therefore, it is not surprising that as crude oil prices have weakened in July, the Broad Trade-Weighted Dollar has strengthened. This broad index includes the Euro Area, Canada, Japan, Mexico, China, United Kingdom, Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Brazil, Switzerland, Thailand, Philippines, Australia, Indonesia, India, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Sweden, Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, and Colombia. It is trade-weighted, while the headline U.S. Dollar Index is not trade-weighted and includes only the Euro area, United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, Switzerland, and Sweden.Clearly, the Broad Trade-Weighted Dollar gives a better picture of what is going on with the greenback. The dollar is getting a major boost from weak crude oil prices, in addition to Brexit-accelerated deflationary trends in Europe and the coming deflation in China, which will be accelerated if and when the Chinese decide to devalue the yuan more aggressively, which is only a matter of time in my view.Disclosure: *Navellier may hold securities in one or more investment strategies offered to its clients.Disclaimer: Please click here for important disclosures located in the ""About"" section of the Navellier & Associates profile that accompany this article."
3989306,24423,2016-07-19T03:39:32-04:00,,"By FS StaffSource: S&P Global RatingsEdward Altman, Professor of Finance at NY University's Stern School of Business and a leading authority on the distressed debt market, recently spoke with Financial Sense about the massive surge in global corporate defaults this year (see chart above) and why this could become a problem if, as he believes, we are in the latter innings of the benign credit cycle that started in 2010.Professor Altman was named as one of the ""100 Most Influential People in Finance"" by the Treasury & Risk Management magazine in 2005 and is widely known for his development of the Altman Z-Score, which is commonly used to help predict the probability that a firm will go into bankruptcy.Here's some of what he had to say on Friday's podcast:""Four metrics of the credit cycle are the default rate (and I particularly look at high yield bonds - the more risky debt), the recovery rates when there are defaults and how much the investor actually loses, yields and yields spreads are the third - what is the cost of debt capital for companies raising capital in the leveraged finance market - and, finally, liquidity - how easy is it for companies to raise capital in the debt markets and how liquid are those instruments if and when they want to sell them.Those are the four metrics - default rates, recovery rates, yields or yield spreads, and liquidity - and all of them back in January-February when we last spoke were pointing in a direction that the benign cycle was just about over. Benign meaning low default rates, high recovery rates, low-interest rates, and a lot of liquidity - that would be the definition of a benign credit cycle - and I used the 7th or 8th inning as the sports metaphor at that time...To continue the sports metaphor of where we are today, I would say we are at the end of the game, the end of the ninth inning now, but the score is tied and we are in extra innings meaning that the end of the benign cycle or the end of the game is uncertain as to when it will happen and I think that's really where we are now.""Do you think the stock market is pricing in the state of the credit markets currently, especially when we look at the spike in global corporate defaults?""Well, I don't think they're pricing in the two metrics that I think are very important: the default rate and the recovery rate. I think they are ignoring it, to be honest with you, because the markets have been very bullish and we're seeing new record highs for the stock market when these two metrics are pointing toward a more stressed situation...I really don't think that the stock market is looking at the credit markets in the last few months as they did at the beginning of the year when things really looked grim and I think that's a mistake because the credit markets are still not strong with respect to the outlook. What is strong is the comeback since the beginning of the year and I think that's mainly a function of central bank activity and the price of oil, not the fundamentals in the credit markets. And so, if I was a betting man, I would say that we're just waiting for the next shoe to drop in those three areas-China, US, and oil - and when that happens I think you'll find a reversal not only in the bond markets but also in the stock market…""To listen to this entire podcast interview with Edward Altman on the credit cycle, corporate defaults, and more, log in and click here."

Such is the overheated state of the junk bond market this sweltering summer.In his latest missive, Deutsche Bank's Oleg Melentyev, arguably the best in class high yield analyst among his sell-side peers, warned of the perils of investing in this ""frenzied market.""Legendary high yield investor Marty Fridson shares Melentyev's concerns and has for some time. By his best estimate, high yield was already in ""extreme overvaluation"" territory on June 30th, defined as being one standard deviation above fair value. Flash forward two weeks, and he calculates that the standard deviation has doubled.(A quick Statistics 101 refresher: standard deviation tells you how tightly clustered or wide-of-the-center individual components of a given data set are from their mean. Remember the grade bell curve the engineering undergrads blew in business school? When all of the test scores came in on top of each other, the bell curve was super steep; when there was vast divergence, the bell curve was low and wide.)Defining bond valuation also requires one employ ""spreads,"" which compare the prevailing yields on a given credit to a supposedly risk-free Treasury of a comparable maturity. And that means you have to get down to the nitty-gritty of measuring risk in basis points (bps), or hundredths of a percentage point.In the event your eyes have rolled into the back of your head, listen up! This is important folks, your sweet grandparents could well own junk bonds in their desperate need to generate yield on their atrophying retirement funds!With that preamble posited, on July 15th the option-adjusted spread on Bank of America Merrill Lynch's High Yield Index was 542 basis points. That compares to 621 bps on June 30th. The lower the spread, the less extra compensation investors are demanding for taking on the added risk of being exposed to, well, junky bonds.Of the compression in spreads, an incredulous Fridson could only characterize the overvaluation which begat more overvaluation as, ""more staggering.""Now in light of this, just how did mom & pop investors react to the price increase? Well how else? They poured $4.4 billion into high yield mutual funds, the second highest weekly inflow on record after March 2nd's $5.3 billion inflow.Bloomberg caught up with yet another stunned strategist: ""They're out there scrounging through the dumpster looking for yield,"" worried Karyn Cavanaugh of Voya Capital Management. ""When you have artificially low rates, you force people to go out and look for things they normally wouldn't.""The question is, will investor insouciance ever come back to haunt them? They, as in investors, certainly don't seem to think so.The Daily Shot is a must-read email proffering just about every graph that's important for investors in one succinct one-stop shop, and it's free. The Shot's editor, the estimable Dr. Lev Borodovsky, is notoriously judicious with his editorial additives. So when he adds a quip, his readers understandably sit up and take note.In Tuesday's Shot, Borodovsky featured a graph of the VIX Index, the so-called 'fear gauge,' which depicts the perceived risk of owning stocks, which have traditionally moved in lockstep with junk bonds. Reflecting extreme complacency, the VIX is sitting at the lowest level since last August. ""In the equity markets,"" Borodovsky recapped, ""the VIX hits a multi-month low. All is well.""Or not. The Shot goes on to depict the price-to-earnings ratio on the S&P 500 at the highest level since at least 2006. ""These valuations rely on extremely low long-term rates,"" Borodovsky cautioned.As a punctuation mark, as in exclamation, Borodovsky features two charts on the high yield market. At the risk of over-paraphrasing, the high yield market is apparently no longer concerned about energy prices, which have yet to stage the oft-predicted blistering rebound. How so?Despite the defaults that continue to emanate from the oil patch, the performance of high yield bonds has completely divorced itself from that of still-depressed crude prices. The mirror image of this nonchalance is that investors are no longer demanding a premium level of compensation for owning high yield energy issuers vis-à-vis their non-energy brethren.In priceless understatement, Borodovsky concludes that, ""High yield is definitely starting to look frothy.""As for Deutsche's Melentyev, he isn't bothering to wait for the ink to dry on the clear message written on the wall. In his latest note to clients, he ratchets up his expectations for HY (high yield) defaults to rise this year beyond his worst case initial scenario - and it ain't just an energy story.In the event you've fallen off Planet Earth in recent weeks, the global corporate default count, as in companies reneging on their promises to make good on those coupon payments, is at the highest level since 2009. And if your memory's eye has erased 2009 to prevent permanent scarring, the economy was in a full meltdown state back then.Let's get this straight. Defaults are going through the roof and investors are flocking to the sector in record numbers? And how.Moody's Tiina Siilaberg keeps an eagle's eye on the concessions investors give to issuers in the form of protections they don't demand. They're called 'covenants,' which Investopedia defines as, By Siilaberg's latest tally, covenant protections are at their weakest level in recorded history. To translate, investors' collective interests are as vulnerable as they've ever been. Though the leveraged loan market remains open for business, Siilaberg is apprehensive about what's just over the horizon given stretched valuations.""Issuance in the high yield bond market is still relatively weak compared to historic levels,"" Siilaberg said. ""I worry, though, because refinancing risk for many lower-rated issuers is close to an all-time high.""The culprit? That would be a delusional reliance on what Melentyev refers to as, ""the new narrative,"" and ""its apparent reliance on (a) strong monetary response."" Unconventional monetary policy is delivering, ""little tangible benefit.""Overreaching central bankers are in fact doing more harm than good at this juncture. Though small investors may not be wise to the damage being wrought, veterans of financial market warfare are weary to the point of exhaustion.The endless waiting for Godot has apparently worn their resolve down to near nothing…with good reason. For all of central bankers' Herculean efforts, expectations that U.S. job losses will accelerate are at a two-year high while households' prospects for the economy over the next year have fallen to a two-year low.Pride will surely precede the fall of the orthodoxy of today's accepted monetary policy framework. But at what cost?""Everyone in the world needs yield and nothing else matters,"" Melentyev laments. ""This has never ended in any sort of a problem before, so we can all go back to sleep."" And what happens when we're abruptly shaken from our slumber?Recognizing the painfully obvious, Voya's Cavanaugh observed, ""This isn't a really normal environment.""Thank you Chair Yellen & Co. for rendering snarling, lawn mower toting junk bond dogs cute and cuddly critters to retirees on fixed incomes."
3989279,75725,2016-07-19T01:19:00-04:00,,"While watching with interest our home team, France, losing the Euro 2016 final against Portugal, being yet another case of ""Optimism Bias"" coming from our fellow countrymen, and looking at the significant rally in various asset classes, such as the iShares iBoxx $ Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:LQD) taking in $1.1 billion last Thursday - the largest-ever recorded inflow - as if ""Brexit"" had never happened, we reminded ourselves for our chosen title of the 2004 romantic comedy ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"". With various markets returning to dizzying heights, such as the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) or the US High Yield (NYSEARCA:HYG) markets, it seems to use that once again, investors have found ""romantic love"" with risky asset classes, and in many ways, their bad memories have been erased - hence, our title reference. As far as we are concerned, we haven't gone through the memory erasure procedure, and we continue to feel that when it comes to credit in general, and in particular US High Yield, we are in the last inning of the game - particularly when we look at the most recent Fed Senior Loan Officers survey, which clearly shows a slowly but surely deteriorating trend when it comes to financial conditions.In this week's conversation, we would like to focus on the ongoing deteriorating trend in credit fundamentals and discuss why we think we are in the final inning and, therefore, one could indeed expect a final and important melt-up in risky asset prices which could last well into September. We will as well discuss Japan, as there are indeed increasing ""helicopter"" noises in the background.Synopsis:Macro and Credit - Bondzilla, the NIRP monster, is more and more ""made in Japan""As we have pointed out in numerous conversations, just in case some of our readers went through a memory erasure procedure, when it comes to ""investor flows"", Japan matters - and matters a lot. Not only have the Government Pension Investment Funds (GPIF) and other pension funds become very large buyers of foreign bonds and equities, but Mrs Watanabe is as well a significant ""carry"" player through Uridashi funds, aka the famously known ""Double-Deckers"". This ""Bondzilla"" frenzy leading our ""NIRP"" monster to grow larger by the day is indeed more and more ""made in Japan"". On the subject of this Japanese foreign allocation, we read with interest the UBS Global Rates Strategy ""What Japanese Investors Are Buying"" from 8th July:What is as well of interest in UBS note is that since the implementation of NIRP by the Bank of Japan (BOJ), Japanese life insurance companies have gone into ""overdrive"":No surprise, therefore, that ""Bondzilla's size"" has indeed been increasing at a rapid pace. This sudden acceleration in negative-yielding bonds has clearly been ""made in Japan"", we think. The acceleration in ""Lifers"" bond purchases is as well confirmed by Nomura in their JPY Flow Monitor, entitled ""Foreign Investment continues amid increased uncertainty"" from 8th July:If indeed ""Bondzilla"" is ""made in Japan"", this is clearly thanks to the acceleration of ""Lifers"" in the global reach for yield, particularly since the implementation of NIRP by the Bank of Japan, but as pointed out by Nomura's note, this time around with a higher hedge ratio:From the above, we think the implications are as follows in the short term: we have most likely seen the lows for now on developed markets' long-term sovereign bonds, and in terms of the Japanese yen, further depreciation of the currency depends on the implications of the deployment of some form of ""helicopter money"" in Japan. We must confide we have re-initiated, therefore, a short Japanese yen position, and are thinking about adding going long Nikkei, but in ""euros"" via a quanto ETF (currency-hedged). Given we have not fallen to a memory erasure procedure, we reminded ourselves clearly of our April 2015 conversation, ""The Secondguesser"":On a side note, in our April conversation, we showed that flows had lagged performance in emerging markets. We think now the time is ripe to add on some EM equity exposure, which can be relatively easily done through the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (NYSEARCA:EEM). EM equity funds saw $1.6 billion of inflows recently.When it comes to the benefits of ""helicopter money"", we read with interest Bank of America Merrill Lynch's take from their Japan Watch note from 15th July, entitled ""Japan for ""whatever it takes""; monetaryfiscal coordination not helicopter money"":Once again, you probably want to think about ""front-running"" the Bank of Japan, hence our interest in going long the Nikkei index, but currency-hedged.When it comes to the options, Abe and Kuroda have to reverse the deflationary woes of Japan. Bank of America Merrill Lynch makes some interesting points:While it is always hard to fathom the impossible, where we slightly disagree with Bank of America Merrill Lynch is that we could have yet another case of ""optimism bias"", and that Japan could decide to be even bolder. We touched on the ""boldness"" of Japan in our April conversation, ""The Coffin corner"":If central bankers are now joining forces with Ben Bernanke advising directly the Bank of Japan, there is indeed a strong possibility they will go for ""bolder"" policies, such as ""helicopter money"". This policy is fraught with danger, we think, and agree with Nomura's take on the subject from their Japan Trade Ideas note from 15th July, entitled ""The danger of helicopter money"":And perhaps indeed that running the risk of negative equity is not the right amount of ""crazy"" for the bold pilots running the Bank of Japan. And if indeed money has a cost too, ultimately the cost will be borne by Japanese taxpayers, and in the process, the Japanese currency could depreciate rapidly in conjunction with horrendous liquidity problems for the foreign investors still holding to their Japanese Government Bonds (JGBs).So overall, it's risk-on again and most likely in Japan, but then again, if we are tactically short-term bullish, our long-term appreciation of the credit cycle is telling us we are in the last inning, as shown by the continued deterioration in financial conditions, which we develop in our next point.Macro and Credit - US High Yield has gone through the memory erasure procedure, but nonetheless, financial conditions are tighteningWhat is ultimately driving default rates, you might rightly ask?For us and our good friends at Rcube Global Macro Research, the most predictive variable for default rates remains credit availability. Availability of credit can be tracked via the ECB lending surveys in Europe as well as the Senior Loan Officer Survey (SLOSurvey):For the US, you need to follow the Senior Loan Officer Survey of 60 large domestic US banks and 24 US branches and agencies of foreign banks. This is updated quarterly, such that the results are available in time for FOMC meetings. Questions cover changes in the standards and terms of the banks' lending and the state of business and household demand for loans.From a medium-term perspective, and assessing the ""credit cycle"", we believe the latest US Senior Loan Officer Survey points to yet another ""warning"" sign in the deterioration of the ongoing credit cycle, which has been so far pushed into ""overtime"" by central banks with ZIRP and their various iterations of QEs.From a tactical and leverage perspective, we would continue to be overweight European High Yield versus US High Yield, and remain more inclined towards US Investment Grade credit versus Europe.We would not, at the moment, go against the ""flow"", given the latest inflows so far in US High Yield have been very significant - hence, our tactical ""Keynesian"" bullishness. But then again, the latest survey is validating our heightened concerns as highlighted by Deutsche Bank in their US Fixed Income Weekly note from 8th July:Since February, we have highlighted the Commercial Real Estate Market (CRE), and particularly through CMBX series 6, the most exposed to retail, the latest survey does indeed confirm the debilitating trend of the underlying. In our recent conversation, ""Through The Looking-Glass"" in May, we indicated the following:We do think you need to track both the CRE and its derivatives CMBX series, as well as the US Senior Loan Officer Survey in the near future.In our final point, we will revisit what represents to us, yet again, a manifestation of Gibson paradox.Final charts: The Gold rush into gold funds is feeding on Bondzilla, the NIRP monsterWhile we won't bother going into much the details of Alfred Herbert Gibson's 1923 theory of the negative correlation between gold prices and real interest rates, we believe the real interest rate is the most important macro factor for gold prices. When it comes to the deflationary forces of our very potent ""bondzilla monster"", this can be assessed by the below chart from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, displaying the relationship between negative-yielding assets and gold fund flows from their Credit Derivatives Strategist note from 14th July, entitled ""Deflationary flows, the Central Banks' put and yield hunting"":This relationship was as well confirmed in another note from Bank of America Merrill Lynch in their Follow the Flow note, entitled ""Deflationary flows into gold, IG and govies"":Obviously, the more our NIRP monster grows, the more inflows gold funds will get, given Gibson's paradox. What we are monitoring from a tactically more bearish approach is that very recently, surprises, real rates and breakevens are on the rise, as displayed in this final chart from Bank of America Merrill Lynch's latest Securitization note from 15th July:So overall, tactically we think that, indeed, ""risk-on"" can further continue, and that we could have seen the lows for now on government bond yields, which would entice further short-term weakness on both bond prices as well as gold in true ""Gibson's paradox fashion.Gold price and real interest rates are highly negatively correlated. When rates go down, gold goes up, and when real interest rates are below 2%, you get a bull market in gold. But when you get positive real interest rates, which has been the case with the rally we saw in the 10-year US government bond getting close to 3% before receding, then of course, gold prices went down as a consequence of the interest rate impact.Stay tuned!"
3987906,60501,2016-07-12T14:18:07-04:00,"With high yield bonds up this year, there is fear that they may be poised to drop.Several recent articles have been very negative on this asset class.This article will analyze the data that will help answer the question in the title.","Once again high yield bonds are in the cross hairs of analysts who are certain that this asset class is about to crash. It seems like every couple of months several articles on Seeking Alpha and elsewhere come out at the same time bashing high yield (see here, here, here, here and here). Despite high yield's superior performance to stocks over the last 10, 15 and 25 years (data shown below), it still carries the moniker ""junk bonds,"" which makes it seem riskier than stocks even though the actual risk is far less. Like most risk asset classes, high yield has recovered strongly since its February lows; with this run up in mind, is high yield poised to plunge or should high yield bond investors relax?The answer partially depends on your point of view. If you are a trader, moving in and out of investments and asset classes, then high yield may be due for a short-term dip as part of the normal ebb and flow of investing. So short high yield for a quick return, right? It's probably a bad move, in fact, profiting from shorting high yield is quite difficult. Remember, high yield pays about a 6% yield (the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:HYG) is listed at 5.7%, the SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:JNK) at 6.3%), so this means just to break even on a short, high yield bond prices have to drop at a 6% annual rate since short sellers are responsible for paying the dividend (after factoring in the cost of borrowing the shares, the breakeven hurdle is even higher). The interest income generated by high yield bonds is ""relentless,"" accruing daily, which is why high yield has only experienced five negative years out of the last 36 years and never in two consecutive years. Short sellers are thus at a big disadvantage shorting high yield. Better to short stocks if you think the market is about enter a so-called ""risk off"" period.So is high yield a buy? Again, it depends on your strategy. If you have a short-term perspective or are a trader, the answer is probably also no. In the next few weeks, high yield may certainly experience a pullback. These ups and downs are perfectly natural, and experienced bond investors view pullbacks as buying opportunities. The point is that fundamentally, high yield should not be viewed as a short-term play. It's well known that dealer inventories of high yield bonds have declined, meaning there is less liquidity. This means even more so that high yield should not be considered for short-term investors. For investors with a longer-term perspective, who are willing to lock in their capital for 5 to 10 years and earn and compound a steady stream of interest income, the short-term gyrations and sentiment of the market are irrelevant. With this perspective in mind, high yield, with a current spread of 6% over treasuries, should certainly be considered, and for those with existing high yield portfolios, should simply be held.So is high yield going to keep going up or about to go down in the near term? Of course no one knows. But the data shows that high yield does not appear to be overvalued. One popular statistic that many analysts cite are inflows and outflows from mutual funds and ETFs. But the available statistics are generally meaningless. A few billion dollars plus or minus does not tell us much relative to the $1.8 trillion market for dollar-denominated high yield. The statistics that really matter, which are institutional moves, are not typically publicly available. Let's look at some statistics that do matter.First, total returns for the asset class. After all, a bubble is typically created only after a large run-up in prices. Have high yield bonds experienced this run up? Sure, since February 11th, high yield is up 16% - but that followed a panic-driven 10% decline in the three months prior. Going back to the beginning of 2015, high yield is only up 5.2%, or 3.4% per annum. In fact, high yield has not even earned its yield, which means the average price of a high yield bond has dropped over the past 18 months. Hardly seems like ""bubble"" territory.What about spreads, a key statistic that measures the relative prices of high yield bonds versus treasuries? The chart below shows the high yield spread since 2012. The lower the spread, the more high yield bonds are being bid up, which may mean prices are too high and a bubble is forming. The higher the spread, the more likely high yield bonds have room to rise, as the elevated spread attracts investors who bid up the prices of the bonds. As of July 7th, the spread was 6.02%, which is above the long-term average spread of 5.8% (which is true for the last 20- and 30-year periods), and except for the recent spike, at levels not seen since 2012. We have a hard time calling high yield ""overvalued"" when spreads are above their historical average.Yes, but high yield bonds are still ""junk"" right? Let's look at actual returns for high yield bonds versus stocks, which can be eye opening in the chart that I maintain. The chart below compares high yield returns (BOA Merrill Lynch Index) versus the S&P 500 since the beginning of 2000, 16 ½ years of data:As can be seen, in the past 16 ½ years, high yield has returned 6.9% per annum, significantly higher than stocks at 4.2%. The lower risk is obvious - in the 2000-2002 crash stocks fell 38%, while high yield fell 2.5%; in 2008, stocks fell 37% but high yield only 26%. The rebound in high yield was also much stronger, up 58% in 2009. In fact, it took stocks until 2012 to recover to pre-crash levels while high yield powered ahead with a 16% gain in the two years 2008 and 2009 - quite a difference compared to stocks. In the nearly 10-year period from 2007 through June 30, 2016, high yield has also outperformed stocks (85% gain versus 72% over this entire period), so through the crash, rebound, oil crash and everything else that has happened, high yield has been a better investment.Does this mean high yield will continue to outperform? No one can say. But how much more evidence is needed to convince investors to increase their allocation to high yield and to stop classifying this asset class as somehow too risky, while stocks are seen as the best ""risk"" investment? The 25-year data is also instructive, as seen in the chart below from Credit Suisse data. Going back to the bull market of the 1990s, stocks have slightly outperformed bonds, but with nearly double the risk. Once again, high yield looks like the better choice long term. Does this mean stocks should be abandoned for high yield? Our answer is no, since we can't know what the future will hold and diversification among asset classes is important. But in my view high yield is a good way for investors to reduce portfolio risk, as a substitute for stocks. Sure, government and high grade bonds are less risky, but we are finding it difficult to see a path towards building wealth and retirement savings with such low yields.What are the current risks to high yield and how can an investor deal with these risks?Oil Prices. The correlation between high yield and oil prices in the past 18 months is obvious. What if oil prices plunge again? It's a good question because we believe oil will have a difficult time breaking $50 and may go back into the $30s. It seems that there is a natural ceiling for oil prices since once it reaches $50, the shale fracking probably ramps up. However, the risk to high yield is far lower than in 2014 and 2015. After all, the damage is mostly done. Investors already took the ""hit"" from $10 billion of Linn Energy (LINEQ) bonds and dozens of other issuers, as well as the coal companies like Peabody Energy (BTUUQ). Here is the best way to avoid this risk today: avoid the high yield bonds of the oil & gas producers. If you own index funds or managed funds, consider if the allocation to energy is acceptable.Interest Rates. At the end of 2013, 97% of experts polled by Bloomberg predicted that rates (10-year Treasury) would be higher by June 2014 - no real reason was given, it seemed the sentiment was that they simply ""had to"" go up. Instead, they dropped from 3.02% to 2.52%; today they are at record lows in the 1.4% range. The chart below is a couple of weeks old, but shows why U.S. rates are likely to stay below 3%, and probably below 2%, for quite some time - compared to the rest of the world, U.S. bonds are a bargain. Despite all of the above, we remain cautious about rising rates and refuse to invest in high yield bonds with a greater than 8-year maturity, with a portfolio that averages about 5-6 years. With a hold-to-maturity strategy and reinvestment of income, interest rate risk can be greatly reduced.Defaults. Default rates have risen to 4.7% by mid-June, according to Fitch, and may be headed to 6% by year-end. However, more than 4% of this 6% is related to energy, while under 2% is everything else, including mining. These numbers are not a surprise; we all know energy is still hurting. The 6% default rate may seem scary, but again, the ""hit"" to high yield portfolios has already been taken. The bond prices of companies at high risk of default have already plunged. We can be sure that many of the companies with bonds trading in the 30s-70s will be part of this 6% defaulting, even though they have not defaulted yet. The way to avoid this risk is the same as above: avoid the oil & gas producers and do not dabble in distressed bonds. By performing solid credit analysis and avoiding CCC and other risky sectors, an investor can greatly reduce default risk. The indexes by definition must include all these segments and index funds will be exposed to the full extent of the default rate. The default rate for everything outside of energy held steady and there is no data showing rising defaults. There is also no issue with ""contagion."" Reduced cash flows in the oil sector will not impact the ability of other independent businesses from servicing their debt.Liquidity. As discussed, liquidity in the high yield market is down. This only presents a problem if you need to sell. Our advice is not to invest in this asset class unless you can commit to at least a 5- to 10-year investment horizon. Then liquidity is not an issue. In fact, we advise not to invest in any ""risk"" asset unless you have a 5- to 10-year time horizon.Stock Market Crash. Who knows if and when this might or might not happen. If the market crashes high yield is certain to decline as well, as will just about everything else (gold does not appear to be a safe haven either). However, the experience of the last two crashes has shown that the high yield bond decline will probably be lower and the rebound faster. The only solution is to maintain the hold position with the 5- to 10-year investment horizon in mind. By holding individual bonds, an investor can even better ignore the market decline by ""waiting it out"" until the maturity date.Our final comment and recommendation on high yield bonds refers to a great article that proves a point that our advisory firm has been stating for a long time: managed high yield bond portfolios are far superior to high yield index funds. While in any given year 80% of stock pickers fail to beat the indexes (and well over 90% in the long run according to research), the opposite is true when it comes to high yield bonds. In fact, according to data discussed in the article, since 2008 more than 90% of active high yield managers have beaten the indexes. This makes perfect sense to us since we believe that performing our own credit analysis, avoiding the riskiest segments of the market, and purchasing bonds with a buy-and-hold to maturity strategy is the best way to invest in this asset class.Going back to the title of our article.

Market timing any asset class rarely works.Please consider Downtown Investment Advisory's subscription service through Seeking Alpha, The High Yield Bond Investor.

3986054,67473,2016-07-04T03:42:35-04:00,,"By Rupert Hargreaves""If the 8% decline in the trade-weighted British pound fails to kick up much dust in U.S. credit markets, it would be a historical outlier,"" that's according to credit analysts at Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), which published a report this week on the possible pass-through effects Brexit could have on US corporate credit.Based on past events, Deutsche's analysts point out that since 2000 there has been a strong negative relationship between the British pound's decline against a basket of five major trading partners and the excess returns of US investment grade bonds. Based on a simple linear regression, the expected decline in IG bonds following Brexit was 2.5%, this time around negative excess returns are only 0.5% so far.Weaker sterling will pose many problems over the long term. If the UK's economic troubles spread to the rest of Europe, then capital goods companies such as Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) will take a hit. Caterpillar only has a single-digit percentage revenue exposure to the UK. That said, the company has production facilities in the UK, and with costs incurred in GBP there is arguably some benefit to the weaker pound.Going back to the historic data, Deutsche's analysis shows that, when the dust settles after currency shocks (pound against a basket of five major trading partners), financials and goods-based sectors such as consumer products, food and capital goods tend to underperform the IG credit market, while services sectors such as utilities, media, telecommunications and transportation tend to be supported.One interesting trend that has emerged since last week is that UK assets are outperforming EU assets in recent sessions. This includes both equities and yield curves. If you were to base your view on what happens next to the European Union purely on this data, it would be easy to believe that the Eurozone is on the verge of breaking down while the UK, having got out early, is set to thrive.High-yield stresses starting to showIn the US high-yield market, stresses are beginning to show, stresses that have only been compounded by Brexit.On Tuesday of this week, high-yield funds reported their second largest daily outflow on record of $-1.9 billion, second only to $-2.7 billion the day after the Third Avenue fund closure. Meanwhile, the HY ex-commodity cash index initially widened 68bps on Friday and Monday, or as much as it did in the first two days following Lehman bankruptcy. It has since retraced some of these losses. Year-to-date, high yield spreads excluding commodity are 29 bps wider so far. Other leading indicators, such as implied vol, AA spreads and financials, all touched on their mid-February levels over the past few days.Deutsche expects modest spread widening throughout the rest of the year. Moreover, the developed market high-yield ex-commodity default rate, as measured on an annualised three-month basis, hit 4% at the end of May. Recent developments are only likely to lead to an increase in the default rate. In fact, Deutsche stops short of increasing its default rate forecast as the bank's credit analysts ""continue to assess the consequences of recent events."" Yet another group of analysts have been blindsided by Brexit and are just simply unable to attempt to guess where markets will go from here.The high-yield sectors to avoid post-shock--------Disclosure: Rupert may hold positions in one or more of the companies mentioned in this article.

3985991,25166,2016-07-03T09:01:44-04:00,,"By Gershon M. Distenfeld, CFABrexit has made at least one thing certain: markets are in for a stormy summer. Even so, there are steps that investors who rely on fickle global credit markets for income can take to stay afloat.Britain's decision to cut ties with the European Union took markets by surprise and hit risky assets hard. European and US corporate bond markets sold off and credit spreads - the extra yield corporates offer over comparable government bonds - widened.The referendum result also makes it more likely that global central banks will hold rates low for longer as they redouble efforts to fight stubbornly slow growth.Here's the thing: volatility and slow growth aren't bad things for credit markets or income investors. The former provides opportunities to uncover value, while the latter should keep interest rates low.Companies also tend to be more conservative and avoid taking on too much debt during periods of slow growth. That may not be good news for equity valuations but it is for bond prices and creditors. When growth is strong, on the other hand, companies can get carried away with adding leverage, and that rarely ends well. For a recent example, look no further than the recent rise in energy company defaults.So as long as the global economy avoids recession, income assets are likely to do well. Here are a few things to keep in mind:1. Keep your hands on the wheel.Volatility creates opportunities. When something like Brexit happens, an initial wave of knee-jerk selling can lead to exaggerated price moves that are out of sync with underlying fundamentals. Managers who build liquidity buffers into a portfolio put themselves in position to snap up bargains before they get bid higher again.We saw this recently with high-yield energy bonds, which were punished indiscriminately last year when oil prices fell. After the Brexit result, sell-offs in European high-yield debt, select emerging-market (EM) currencies, and corporate bonds issued by European banks and financial firms brought in a wave of eager buyers who picked up these assets at attractive prices.None of this can be done, though, with a portfolio on autopilot. A hands-on approach gives managers flexibility to ferret out mispriced securities. Tracking an index doesn't. That's why even average active high-yield mutual funds routinely beat passive exchange-traded funds.2. Diversify, diversify, diversify.There are still a lot of crowded trades out there. That's why we see investors rush out of various sectors every time market turbulence rises. This creates opportunities for those who can take a contrarian view. A global multi-sector approach that diversifies exposure to sectors and regions also diversifies sources of return and income.In fact, valuations in many high-income sectors, such as EM currencies and debt, are more attractive today than they've been in years. In high yield, the compensation investors receive for the risk of default is well above average. This may not last long. If Brexit prompts central banks in Europe, Japan and other slow-growth economies to escalate their quantitative easing programs, as we think it will, the opportunity to lock in these attractive valuations will disappear.3. Pay attention to credit cycles.Diversification is always important, but it takes on added significance during the late stages of a credit cycle. And that's exactly where we are in many market sectors today. It's important to remember that there isn't just one ""credit cycle."" There are multiple ones under way at any given time around the world.In the past, they were usually closely correlated. But divergent monetary policies and growth rates today mean there's considerable variation by region. European industrials, for instance, are still in expansion mode, while Latin American corporates are in the repair phase and US financials are in recovery. Cycles also vary by sector, since different industries respond differently to monetary stimulus.Flexible investors might decide to ratchet down exposure to late-cycle sectors or regions - say, parts of the US high-yield market or European industrials - and increase exposure to sectors where valuations are more attractive, such as US mortgage-related securities.In the short run, the UK's referendum result will make for a rougher ride in global markets. But with the right approach, income investors may find that the volatility adds wind to their sails.The views expressed herein do not constitute research, investment advice or trade recommendations and do not necessarily represent the views of all AB portfolio-management teams.Gershon M.

Bad breath of reality next?If you bought the crappiest bonds on February 10, you've made a killing unless the company defaulted, in which case you got killed, and a lot of companies defaulted. But so much money poured into junk bonds that prices soared and yields plunged even for the riskiest near-default issues.At the riskiest end, junk bonds rated CCC and lower, with D being default; the average yield, as per BofA Merrill Lynch High Yield index, plunged from over 21% on February 10 to 15% at the close Thursday. And bond prices skyrocketed. The BofA Merrill Lynch total return index for CCC and lower rated bonds soared 30% over the period:Retail investors have difficulties buying junk bonds. Retail brokers usually sell only investment grade bonds. And that may be a good thing because each bond issue is a treacherous contract full of pitfalls and landmines that even specialists fall into or step on and often end up buying what they didn't think they were buying. That can cause some painful surprises when the bonds default, which is a significant probability with low-rated junk bonds.So retail investors have to make do with junk-bond mutual funds and ETFs. They give their money to institutional investors who then buy the actual bonds. Those funds have done well too over the period: for example, the high-yield bond ETF HYG has risen 12.6%, though it remains 11% off its recent high in June 2014.But over the last three weeks bond-fund investors have soured on this gamble and have yanked their money out.During the week ended June 29, $1.63 billion were pulled out of junk-bond funds, according to LCD of S&P Capital IQ. It was the third weekly outflow in a row. All three of them combined totaled $4.2 billion ($3.62 billion from mutual funds and $581 million from ETFs):LCD put it this way:That last time 21 weeks ago was in February when investors were running scared.After the massive inflows since February, the outflows of the past three weeks brought total year-to-date inflows down to $3.2 billion.For the week, fund balances also dropped by $680 million or 0.4%, due to ""market conditions.""A similar pattern has played out in leveraged loans. These junk-rated loans are too risky for banks to keep on their books. So they sell them to institutional investors, including loan funds, or they slice and dice and repackage them into highly-rated Collateralized Loan Obligations to be sold to institutional investors.Investors pulled $525 million out of loan funds in the week ended June 29, ""the largest one-week redemption in 18 weeks,"" as LCD of S&P Capital IQ put it. It was the third week in a row of outflows, totaling $682 million:But loan funds have seen their heyday. The Fed has been warning about the risks of leveraged loans for over two years, not because it gives a hoot about retail investors, but because it doesn't want banks to get stuck with these loans during the next Financial Crisis, which is what happened during the last Financial Crisis, and it contributed to the banking fiasco at the time.After the Financial Crisis, loan fund net asset values began to balloon again, doubling from November 2012 to March 2014 on a parabolic curve to hit $178 billion - which is when the Fed started exhorting banks about them. These loans trade like securities, but the SEC considers them loans and doesn't regulate them. No one regulates them. And the Fed got nervous about the banks. Retail investors picked up the vibes and started bailing out of these funds.So year-to-date, net outflows from loan funds have reached $5.6 billion, knocking the net asset value of loan funds down to $60.9 billion. In a little over two years, loan funds have collapsed by 66%!Yet banks aren't about to walk away from this lucrative business. More of them end up in CLOs. Hedge funds and other institutional investors are loading up on them. And they get repackaged into yen-denominated highly rated bonds for yield-desperate Japanese investors that the Bank of Japan has whipped into buying just about anything….But that investors are once again yanking their money out of junk-bond funds is a sign that the high-yield honeymoon since February may have run its course, and that the bad breath of reality might once again muck up the scenario.As investors open their eyes just a little wider about where they put their money, ""the bezzle,"" as it's called, begins to shrink.

3987281,22576,2016-07-09T16:58:06-04:00,,"By Jeffrey P. SniderOne of the consequences of last year's junk bond blowup was, unsurprisingly, a dramatic decline in high yield gross issuance. The numbers were pretty stark. According to SIFMA, high yield gross issuance in Q1 was 60% less than Q1 2015, following Q4 which was 47% below Q4 2014. As the market has come back since March, for all sorts of reasons including Mario Draghi, issuance has as well - but not to the same sort of condition as before. In other words, volume is only relatively better than the worst months.Gross junk issuance in June 2016 is preliminarily figured to have been $24 billion, higher than the $21.7 billion in June 2015 but significantly less than the nearly $30 billion floated in June 2014. These tough comparisons underscore the nature of not just the depth of market effects but really the prolonged period of irregularity. For Q2 overall, junk bond issuance was still 8% less than the same quarter in 2015. Again, that is better than the near-collapse of Q1, but not anything like full restoration let alone making up for a lost year.From the annual figures, you can clearly see that junk bonds have struggled since 2013. The ""rising dollar"" hasn't been kind to this part of the credit market, an obvious economic problem given that huge burst in issuance starting in 2012 offered at least some marginal (artificial) support to the economy. As issuance slowed in 2014, especially later in that year, it is likely more than coincidence that seemingly steady and slow economic growth gave up to slow and steady contraction especially in manufacturing and industry.But as much as junk bonds are (rightly) emphasized, it may be that investment grade corporate issuance suggests the next stage of destabilization in credit. Since last summer, IG volume has also dropped off. And though the estimated gross for May 2016 was the highest in years, overall in Q2 total issuance was down slightly compared to Q2 2015 when 10-20% growth in IG volume had become seemingly normal. With three consecutive quarters now of below-trend totals, it seems reasonable to assume that there are deeper corporate credit problems than just the junk bubble.It is more good evidence that ""something"" changed in the middle of last year, meaning a durable or even permanent deviation from the prior trend. Given the early estimates for June issuance filling out Q2, we can also reasonably infer that despite the seemingly more (outwardly) benign conditions in the past few months after the end of the last liquidation wave/""dollar"" run, it was not representative of a true inflection or turnaround back toward pre-summer 2015 operation.We have suspected as much all along, especially since the more fundamental indications of eurodollar liquidity and capacity did not participate in the relief to nearly the same extent as stocks or oil prices. In some places, such as eurodollar futures, the warning of ""dollar"" condition hasn't much changed, if at all, from the low of February 11. The issuance figures seem to confirm that view in the vital connection between liquidity or funding to credit to the real economy (or, as may be in the case of IG corporate debt, stock prices through buybacks).This drawdown also seems to have extended into at least some parts of the banking system, as well. The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that ABS issuance was off 37%, again including Q2, not just Q1.There are several possible explanations, including first the liquidations themselves. Disruptive volatility in isolation may cause only temporary pause, but repeated volatility can turn off financial interest entirely. I also have to believe that the nature of especially the second liquidation was confirming of suspicions that had been forming throughout this ""rising dollar"" period. In other words, central bank promises had alarmingly fallen short or even unwound in real economic conditions that looked nothing like what was ""supposed"" to have been delivered by effective monetary policy. That has very real implications not just for the economy, but especially credit markets as a whole and modeled projections for both the credit and default cycles.The further erosion in financial terms of central bank myths would only add to any reluctance of the market to absorb forever increasing supply, whether junk or IG. The same effect on the liquidity system would also be a related and similar negative factor in what might be a durable alteration to such aggregate risk appetite.It is astounding both the similarities between especially the ""rising dollar"" period of the post-2012 slowdown and the monetary/eurodollar irregularities of 2007-08. The primary difference, however, seems to be pace. In the earlier crisis period, events conspired in condensed fashion to create a cascading financial effect that quickly and sharply imperiled the global economy. This time, however, the financial blows are spaced further apart but no less relentless and concerning. It is, almost, a slow-motion crash with plenty of time in between specific events to question why it might not be what it so easily seems. All the same elements are clicking into their unwelcome but familiar places, they are just doing so at a frustratingly leisurely pace.This lack of follow-through urgency may be in good part misleading, especially since it allows policymakers and the mainstream to continue to treat each episode as unrelated and distinct; almost (regular) randomness. In fact, they are all related if drawn-out warnings about further financial and economic deterioration. There is a direct line between June 2014 repo irregularities and October 15, 2014, January 15, 2015, the events of last August, the events of January/February and now the continuing or even escalating negative pressures.From the narrow standpoint of corporate credit and gross issuance, these estimates do suggest just that kind of escalation, especially given that Q2 was supposed to have been appreciably better than Q1. Again, liquidity and funding market indications were never possessed with so much exuberance after February 11 and the PBOC's ""dollar"" injections, leaving the past few months to be properly classified as only the absence of further disorder and liquidation rather than meaningful retracement or systemic rebound.Disclosure: None"
3984857,101450,2016-06-28T09:25:13-04:00,"According to major banks, the junk bond market is expected to grow at a modest rate of about 4-6 percent in 2016.The uptrend in commodity prices, especially oil, has caused investors to reenter the high-yield market, pushing spreads tighter.After the June Fed meeting and Brexit vote, bond investors can expect rate hike delays to help default rates and risk to remain lower for longer.","The junk bond market in 2016 looks to be a favorable investment for investors that are looking for high yields and a reasonable amount of risk as the global economy leaves the troubled year of 2015 behind. Returns for the riskier bonds in 2015 were negative for the first time since 2008 dropping to -5.15 percent by December 15, according to HighYieldBond.com.Small-cap energy defaults weighed on the performance of the high yield sector as oil prices approached its bottom at the end of the year. In fact, ""the U.S. speculative-grade default rate"" in 2015 reached highs not seen since October 2013 when it reached 2.8 percent. An already unstable junk market came into 2016 expecting short-term interest rates to be on the rise as the Federal Reserve had proclaimed their desire to raise rates, and as a result, analysts were wary in their projections for 2016.From HighYieldBond.comBoth Bank of America and Deutsche Bank claimed a bearish outlook for 2016 projecting -2.5 percent and -1 percent return respectively. Other banks voiced their optimism with J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Credit Suisse, and Barclays pegging their estimates between 4-6 percent. A 2016 scenario reflecting average predictions would be relatively flat, and that mindset seems reasonable considering the unpredictability of a lot of the sectors of the economy going into the new year. No one really knew where oil prices were headed with OPEC still in talks of a freeze at the time.Weakness in China appeared to have reached a bottom, and the central bank kept rates low in hopes of a smooth ride back to the top. However, weak earnings forced uncertainty on the optimists. Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. High Yield rates reached their near-term highs around the time that these projections were coming out reflecting the perplexing trend in default rates and earnings. If we jump forward to the current state of the bond market in June, almost seven months later, the reservations voiced at the beginning of 2016 are evident, and due to recent events, refutable.High yield rates peaked after the sell-offs at the beginning of 2016, but since February 12th, have fallen almost 300 basis points. Investors have been buying up these junk bonds pushing their rates closer to Treasury rates even though safer rates have fallen as well. Falling yields signal the strength of a market that is posting above-average returns. Morningstar's high-yield bond fund data reports a year-to-date 5.69 percent return for the year of 2016 so far with many of the best high-income funds boasting rates well over 8 percent.The BofA Merrill Lynch High Yield Index, a popular symbol of the market as a whole, has returned 8.15 percent year to date. So far, junk bond returns have beaten many of the banks' projections, and there may be more optimism going forward from here. Because these securities typically have short maturities, their fundamentals rely heavily on short-term outlooks, and these outlooks are bullish due to recent developments in the commodity market and monetary policy.Junk bonds in the energy sector performed poorly in 2015 because of defaults and low oil prices. In 2016, the sector has turned around in response to the uptrend in energy spot prices. In Calamos Investments' most recent High-Yield Market Review and Outlook, the energy sector led all other sectors for the third month in a row posting a return of 2.6 percent in May 2016. In the same month, Brent and WTI oil prices threaten to top $50 as global demand showed a robust recovery and U.S. supply shrunk.With mining and mineral default growth mitigated by commodity price growth, investors have been more confident in trading high-yield bonds as shown by the comparison of SPDR Barclays High-Yield Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:JNK) and the Commodity Research Bureau's basket index (CRB). Both bottomed at the beginning of the year and have been recovering aggressively in the first half of 2016 up to June. In 2009, we saw junk bonds stage an impressive 55 percent recovery in the year after the financial crisis. If oil prices continue to show more upside and approach $55 to $60 a barrel, a strong recovery reminiscence of 2009 could take place.Up until the June Fed meeting, stock and bond investors have been preparing their portfolios for the change in interest rates as communicated by the Board of Governors in December 2015. Janet Yellen and the other FOMC members appeared ready to initiate a series of three gradual rate hikes throughout 2016 and were even able to sneak one in at the beginning of the year. After the June meeting, investors can take a deep breath and adjust their expectations. The FOMC has consistently reduced its median Fed Funds rate projections since December 2015.In June, the Fed adjusted 2016 projections to 0.9 percent, 0.5 percent below the 1.4 percent estimate in December. Long-run expectations for 2017 and 2018 have been adjusted too with June estimates 0.8 percent and 0.9 percent lower respectively. These dovish maneuvers will bode well for the high-yield market, which was threatened by the pressure of rate hikes that were all but guaranteed by the Federal Reserve's crystal ball. Market instability caused by Brexit will likely delay rate hikes even more as the G-7 central banks called for liquidity measures to be preserved after losses on June 24th.The junk bond market has performed well so far this year, but investors can look forward to even more growth in the third and fourth quarter of 2016. As shown by the decline in high-yield interest rates, traders are increasingly buying into the market, which will bolster bond prices and liquidity in the near term. Rebounding oil prices will also provide a crucial support for mineral and mining debt as opportunities from profit arise from high-yield energy securities in the latter half of 2016.Finally, dovish expectations inspired by the Fed's June remarks should reverse any adverse developments caused by Brexit instability. All three points should combine to support a bullish push in the junk bond market, which could post returns of 8-10 percent by the end of 2016."
3986809,67473,2016-07-07T04:13:27-04:00,,"By Rupert HargreavesEven though the UK counts for a tiny percentage of the world's economic output, the prospect of Brexit has sent shockwaves through the global financial system. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has acted swiftly to try to ease concerns about the state of the UK's banking industry by hinting that rate cuts are ahead, and today the BoE announced that it was reducing capital buffers by £5.7 billion, effectively allowing banks to lend £150 billion more to households and businesses.While the UK struggles to get to grips with the risks now emanating as a result of Brexit, the risk that the UK might leave the EU has had a severe impact on the global credit markets.This is becoming a big headache for the European Central Bank and its bond-buying programme - a theme Bank of America discusses in a new research report issued to clients today.ECB QE will be forced to expand by its limitationsThe ECB's QE buying programme has three key constraints: 1) obeying the capital key, 2) only buying bonds that yield more than the deposit rate (-40 bps) and 3) Only buy up to 33% of any given issuer.Brexit has sent investors running for cover, and the risk-off tone in markets is putting the second criteria above under severe strain. Indeed, between June 23 and June 27, the share of the German bund market two-year or more with a yield of -40 bps dropped from around 70% at close on the 23 to around 55% at close on the 27. The ECB is currently buying €20 billion a month of German paper across eligible assets. As more and more German bonds move into negative territory, it's going to be harder for the bank to keep up this run rate.BoA points out that if the ECB wants to keep up its current level of QE bond purchases, without changing its buying criteria, the bank is going to have to move further out the rate curve. This shift could involve more buying of peripheral debt or buying lower quality corporate debt.ECB QE - Great news for high yieldGood news for US high yieldAnalysts at Bank of America speculate that either of these two scenarios could be good news for US high-yield investors. Buying by the ECB along the curve would push rates further down across Europe, leaving the US market the ""only game in town where investors can find meaningful credit risk.""The good news is that the US high-yield market remains relatively well supplied, so there are still plenty of issues for yield hungry investors to choose.BoA notes that high-grade new issue supply volumes totaled $86 billion in June, down significantly from the record $176 billion priced in May and also below $96 billion issued in June of last year. Year-to-date supply stands at $706 billion, down 2% from last year's $720 billion priced over the same period.Disclosure: Rupert may hold positions in one or more of the companies mentioned in this article.

3984483,101638,2016-06-27T03:09:52-04:00,"Do you understand your bond ETFs and funds?You need to - especially if you own any junk (which we affectionately call ""high yield"").Could your manager sell what your money is buying if he or she had to? And at what price?","Ok, let's go over this again, because I am still not convinced everyone gets it.High yield is high yield for a reason. The reason is that the companies issuing it belong in a salvage yard at best and a landfill at worst. That's why they're called junk bonds.Previously, it was harder for people to buy them. Why? Because easily accessible funds that invest in relatively esoteric parts of the bond market hadn't proliferated yet. Now they have. Now anyone with an E*trade account can become a fixed income trader. Yay.(Chart: Citi with my additions)Even ""better,"" ETFs provide daily liquidity, which means mom and pop can easily trade in and out of their fixed income positions. Hooray for price discovery! Here's a look at retail ownership of HY. As you can see, the post-crisis peak was around 2012, but we're still at the highest levels since the aftermath of the dot-com crash:(Chart: BofAML with my additions)Make no mistake, this represents the complete abandonment of anything that even approximates common sense. It's an egregious aberration vividly depicted in the following simple chart:(Chart: Deutsche Bank)Obviously, this has been to some extent a function of ZIRP and QE. Investors are being herded into corporate credit (and subsequently pushed down the quality ladder) as the yield on riskless government bonds falls and eventually goes negative. Demand for IG, HY, and equity issuance rises as investors frantically search for some semblance of return.So what, exactly, is the problem? Well, I've gone over it using analogies, stories, and technical discussions, so I'll be brief in recounting the issues before showing you some new charts.People like bond ETFs because they can trade them easily. There's ""liquidity."" Only there's not. It's an illusion made possible by what Barclays calls ""diversifiable flows."" That's not as complicated as it sounds. When one manager has outflows (i.e. people are selling), he simply swaps portfolio products with another manager who is experiencing inflows (i.e. people are buying).(Barclays)Note that there's no middleman in that equation. You'll also note that no one there is actually buying or selling any bonds. And therein lies the absurdity. Here's how the system worked before the crisis:(Barclays)There's a middleman (Wall Street), and the underlying assets (the bonds) are actually being bought and sold. That's liquidity.So you should be asking yourself the following simple question with regard to the first diagram above: ""now wait just a minute here, what happens when there's no one on the right side of the grey arrow?""And here's a followup question you should also pose to yourself: ""what happens when the flows are not diversifiable but rather unidirectional?""And a third, simpler question you might also want to ponder: ""how does a model with no middleman work when everyone is selling their ETFs at once?""Let me answer those three questions in order:Without Wall Street to inventory the paper, there are fewer buyers for the actual cash bonds. In other words: the market for the assets your ETFs are based on is very, very thin. And importantly, the practice of swapping portfolio products when flows are diversifiable makes it even thinner (everyone is habitually avoiding the actual buying and selling of the bonds).Ok, got it. But why would everyone suddenly sell their bond ETFs and funds? Well there are a lot of reasons, not the least of which is the looming threat of HY energy's complete collapse. Guess what folks? Uneconomic US oil production isn't going to outlast OPEC. Yes, Saudi Arabia might end up going broke. Yes, the Gulf monarchies are tapping debt markets to fund widening budget gaps. But collectively they've got a lot of borrowing capacity, a lot of oil, and a lot of reserves:(Charts: Deutsche Bank)And don't forget about Iran, who has promised to keep pumping ""even if oil goes to $20.""The point is, if the market gets spooked by further bankruptcies and defaults from beleaguered energy companies who are finally forced to throw in the towel, you'll get selling pressure on HY funds.So that's a good story and all, but what are the actual numbers? Well, let's have a look. Here's HY leverage including and excluding energy names:(Chart: Citi)And have a look at these rather alarming bar charts. Hopefully, you would have been able to see the glaring problem on your own, but just in case, I've highlighted it for you:(Charts: BofAML)Here's some color from BofAML:How about another fun graphic? What I've done below is take Goldman's forecast of HY spreads and dropped in an inset from BofAML that shows HY issuer default rates:(Chart: Goldman; inset: BofAML)See a possible discrepancy there?Another problem is that HY credit doesn't seem to be very good at pricing vol. lately. The graph below is the iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corp Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:HYG) with an inset depicting how the options market was pricing volatility in the weeks leading up to the UK referendum:(Chart: Heisenberg; inset: BofAML)Ultimately, the question is this: if you get a wave of ETF and fund selling triggered by a HY meltdown and managers are actually forced to sell the underlying bonds to meet redemptions, who is going to buy them?Not Wall Street.Who is going to want HY energy bonds (for instance) knowing that the defaults are spreading? If they're not completely illiquid, they'll have to be sold at a big discount and that means falling prices and thus steep declines in the ETFs and NAVs.I'll close with one last quote from BofAML:"
3983525,20757,2016-06-22T02:52:46-04:00,,"High yield spreads have really come in by a large margin since they widened out to just under 900 bps earlier this year. Through yesterday's close, spreads were sitting at 600 bps above Treasuries, according to the yield on the Merrill Lynch High Yield Master Index. Most readers are aware that tighter spreads indicate looser risk appetites, so when spreads narrow, it indicates that investors are more open to riskier assets, and vice versa. As things currently stand, spreads are testing a key level here, representing the uptrend line from their cycle lows nearly two years ago. High yield spreads bounced off of that trend line on June 8th, when they got as low as 582 bps, but then widened out to as much as 632 bps last Thursday. Since then, they have come in by 32 bps in a pattern resembling the one we saw back in late March, when spreads initially tested and bounced at the trend line from last summer's low just before oil prices collapsed. If you are a bull here, you really want to see spreads repeat the pattern from March once again this time around."
3981825,39491,2016-06-14T05:55:52-04:00,,"The big news last week was that Fed Chair Janet Yellen was apparently surprised by the disappointing May payroll report and the downward payroll revisions for March and April. In her speech last Monday before the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia, Yellen said that she expects that the U.S. economy will continue to improve and expects further gradual rate increases will “probably” be appropriate. Translated from Fedspeak, she seems to be hinting that there will be no interest rate increase at this week’s meeting.Yellen added, “I continue to believe that it will be appropriate to gradually reduce the degree of monetary policy accommodation, provided that labor market conditions strengthen further and inflation continues to make progress toward our objective.” In tying the Fed’s action to the labor market, she showed that wage inflation is a key indicator. As we get closer to the November Presidential election, the “data dependent” Fed may be reluctant to raise rates, since any rate hike could further widen the controversial wealth gap.In the meantime, since the Fed has apparently reversed its hawkish stance, Treasury yields have fallen and the U.S. dollar has softened considerably. This has caused commodity prices to rise, which raises the prospect for more inflation. Ironically, the confluence of weak job creation and inflation will likely put the Fed in a pickle this week. As a result, their statement will be closely scrutinized to see if inflation fears are mounting and whether inflation fears trump their employment mandate. In the meantime, “stagflation” – slow economic growth combined with brewing inflation – is a growing possibility.The Fed is also concerned about the “Brexit” vote on June 23. If Britain votes to leave the European Union, the British pound and the euro are expected to suffer. The beneficiary of a Brexit could be the U.S. dollar, so be prepared for a possible dollar rally late next week. Any significant rally in the dollar will help to squelch commodity price inflation and may also cause crude oil prices to peak near-term.Amidst all the uncertainty regarding “Brexit,” as well as the pace of the global economy, interest rates around the world continue to plunge. On Friday, 10-year government bonds were yielding -0.155% in Japan, 0.01% in Germany, 1.211% in Britain, and 1.651% in the U.S. Longer-term, the fact that the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond yields substantially more than other countries means that the dollar will likely remain strong, despite last week’s weakness based on mounting evidence that the Fed may not raise rates.Corporate bond yields around the world also continue to decline, due largely to quantitative easing by the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank (ECB). This has led to a massive corporate bond rally.As bond yields fall, companies with high interest rate burdens can also rally strongly. Last week (in “Quality Issues,” June 8), Bespoke Investment Group showed that companies with low credit ratings have done better than companies with high credit ratings since the market low on February 11th. Specifically, companies with junk bonds have rallied 34.64%, while the companies with AAA credit rating have rallied only 12.47% since the February 11th market lows (through last Tuesday). This almost 3-to-1 advantage with “junk” companies is also being fueled (near-term) by energy and other commodity-related stocks.However, if you look at the past full year, stocks in high quality companies (i.e., AAA and AA credit ratings) have beaten low quality (i.e., junk) with less volatility. (Note: Only two companies currently sport a AAA credit rating, so a more inclusive group of “top quality” stocks would include AA stocks.)The most interesting news last week is that the former heads of the Bank of England and the Fed, namely Mervyn King and Alan Greenspan, are now recommending that investors own some physical gold.Specifically, Mervyn King wrote in his new book, “The End of Alchemy,” that the current crop of central bankers “have thrown everything at their economies, and yet the results have been disappointing. Whatever can be said about the world recovery since the crisis, it has been neither strong, nor sustainable, nor balanced.” In this time of what he calls “radical uncertainty,” King is advocating gold ownership.King said in the June edition of the World Gold Council’s Gold Investor magazine that investors should own gold as an asset that is “negatively correlated or uncorrelated” to major stock and bond markets, adding that Alan Greenspan, in a May 26 interview with Fox Business News, said, “I think you have a very profound long-term problem of economic growth.” Greenspan concluded that the western world is headed for “a state of disaster.” King and Greenspan's comments undermine confidence in the power of governments and central banks, especially those that have embraced negative interest rates and quantitative easing, like the Bank of Japan and ECB. While King and Greenspan may not be hard-core gold bugs, their comments were timely as gold hit its highest level in three weeks as it appears that global rates are still declining.Disclosure: *Navellier may hold securities in one or more investment strategies offered to its clients.Disclaimer: Please click here for important disclosures located in the ""About"" section of the Navellier & Associates profile that accompany this article."
3983235,24423,2016-06-21T03:10:58-04:00,,"By FS StaffWith near-zero interest rates and even negative rates appearing around the world, investors have rushed into high-yield (""junk"") debt. This time on FS Insider, Tyler Kling of Macro-Ops explained why markets are likely facing a major inflection point depending on what happens in the junk bond market.Junk Debt Will Signal Inflection""What's happened since the financial crisis is the Fed has lowered interest rates to zero and... you can no longer earn that much income just investing in government fixed income,"" Kling told listeners.As a result, investors are seeking riskier alternatives to government debt, such as high-yield (""junk"") debt, real estate, dividend-paying assets and energy MLPs.Junk debt now serves as key watchpoint for which direction the market is likely to head, or if higher highs in the stock market are sustainable.""If junk debt continues to stay bid up, and emerging markets continue to stay bid up, then investors are going to have a risk-on mindset, and any type of deleveraging scenario will be pushed off farther down the line,"" he said.Two Scenarios to Play OutFor bonds, this gets tricky, because while Kling sees the danger in long-dated debt that's held into the medium term or long term, he thinks long-dated debt will actually rally in the short term.""This may sound counterintuitive, but in the shorter term, we actually like longer-term debt, because we think the market's going to go into a deleveraging scenario, and in that case, long-term bonds will rally,"" he said. ""It's not like interest rates can stay negative forever.""After short-term action plays out, he sees one of two scenarios emerging: either deflation and deleveraging set in, or we'll get an inflationary scenario.Kling sees a higher probability of the deflationary scenario taking hold, and noted that he's been proven right so far by the price action in the 30-year this year. It's actually had a pretty good year.""If (deflation) happens, stocks will get hit and the 30-year will do just fine,"" he said.A big signal is that if central banks are throwing everything they have at the problem, and we still can't get inflation, and we can't get growth to go up, that means we're experiencing a debt problem, Kling stated. The only way to fix that is to reduce debt.""That's why risk assets all sell off,"" he said. ""In that scenario, you have that flight to safety.""Sharpe Ratios and Implications for the 60/40 PortfolioWe can't expect the traditional portfolio to perform too well going forward, Kling said.""Over the last 5 years, that 60/40 (stock/bond) portfolio has had a 9.8 percent return per year,"" Kling noted. ""That's with a standard deviation around 7.25 percent.""Given these conditions, the Sharpe ratio - which measures return per each unit of risk - averaged 1.33 over those five years. That's extremely good, Kling noted, and he doesn't think that's sustainable.The 70-year long-term ratio is .45, and right now we're at 1.33, so to maintain the long-term average, we'll need to see performance revert back to the downside, he added.""As a 60/40, you've done very well in the last 40 years, and that's great,"" Kling said. ""If you want to be prudent going forward, it might be wise to look at other options."""
3980926,24716,2016-06-09T05:37:28-04:00,,"In a recent post, my colleague Russ Koesterich talked about the role of fixed income in a portfolio. It was a good reminder of why most of us invest in bonds: to help provide diversification against our equity holdings. Historically, when equities are down, Treasury bonds are often up. And when equities are up, Treasuries are often down. This creates diversification in a portfolio. The value of your investment doesn't move around as much, which gives you a better idea of how much it'd be worth in the future. The fewer surprises, the better, so to speak.Part bond, part stock?Russ's comments were focused on U.S. Treasury securities. But I want to extend the conversation and talk about another fixed income sector, high yield bonds. High yield bonds are interesting because they have some properties of Treasury bonds, and some properties of equities. They are typically structured like other bonds with regular coupon payments and a return of principal at maturity. They also have sensitivity to interest rates, so as interest rates rise, the value of a high yield bond can decline, and vice versa.Of course, the coupons paid by high yield bonds are generally higher than what Treasury bonds of similar maturity would pay. The extra yield is compensation for taking on credit risk when you lend your money to the bond issuer. Like equity, the value of a high yield bond is tied to the fate of its corporate issuer. When a bond issuer is doing well, generally its stocks and bonds go up in value. But when hard times hit an issuer, its stock and bond values tend to decline. So in many ways, high yield is somewhat of a hybrid of Treasuries and equities: It has properties of both but isn't exactly like one or the other.The graph below shows the performance of Treasuries, equities and high yield over the past year. I normalized the returns to start at 100 for an easy comparison.As you can see, the Treasury market just jogged along, rising slightly but not fluctuating too much. This is a reflection of the lower volatility of Treasuries. Equities moved around the most, whipping down and then back up in response to market sentiment. High yield was somewhere in the middle. For the most part it tracked equities down, but without the same level of volatility.The trends are more obvious if you look at a longer horizon, as Bloomberg data shows. For longer time periods, we find that Treasuries and equities have a low to negative correlation to each other, meaning when one is up, the other tends to be down. With high yield, we find a low level of correlation with Treasuries, and a medium level of correlation with equities. High yield hasn't given you quite the diversification against equities that Treasuries have, but it also hasn't moved in lockstep with stocks either.A supporting roleHigh yield can be a source of income and diversification in a portfolio, but don't expect it to be your ballast against equities. Always keep moderation and diversification in mind. High yield in my opinion is used more effectively as a complement to a core bond position: A potential yield tilt that can help boost income without compromising that diversification benefit investors look for in bonds.Matt Tucker, CFA, is the iShares Head of Fixed Income Strategy and a regular contributor to The Blog.This post originally appeared on the BlackRock Blog."
3974720,37141,2016-05-12T23:26:19-04:00,,"By Dr. Chenjiazi ZhongKey Macro Themes and the ImplicationsLow inflation: Inflation is low but it does not mean inflation is zero. The slow growth in global economy keeps inflation subdued even as CPI slowly rises.Global policy divergence: Fed continues to normalize slowly as other central banks pursue stimulus policies. Investors should expect yields to rise modestly.Supply-side weakness: Across developed countries, the low productivity and growth in labor force will ultimately cap longer-dated yields.Strength in U.S. economy: U.S. economy remains resilient; recession risks are being overpriced for 2016, which indicates a good environment for high yield bond.Gradual recovery in Europe: The expansion in Europe is on track; monetary policy is a key factor that will support EU stocks and credit markets.Japan - beyond Abenomics: The economic risk in Japan is becoming more binary; the asset returns will be more geared to fiscal response.Emerging markets rebalancing: The stats of emerging markets implies that the environment is stabilizing and the valuations are undemanding. The short-term risks exist but investors can expect the conditions will improve in 2016.China in transition: That China is shifting from resources to services will continue to weigh on global trade.U.S. High Yield BondsIn an environment of full valuation, fragile investor sentiment, favorable relative valuations of credit over equity, slow but positive growth with limited recession risk that is priced in, high yield credit that offers equity-like returns is an attractive proxy for stocks. U.S. High yield credit spreads widened the most since 2011.U.S. high yield bonds offer lower volatility than equities due to their coupon income. In down markets, a larger coupon for high yield bonds helps to offset market declines; in up markets, high yield bonds usually correlate to rising equities. Moreover, high yield bonds are generally not impacted by modest rise in interest rates; spreads are more a reflection of market expectations for future default rates rather than expectations for higher interest rates. Furthermore, high yield bonds managers charge lower fees as compared to the hedge funds specializing in distressed debt.Despite U.S. high yield bonds offer equity-like return, investors need to adjust or discount the asset class for its potential for downside losses, liquidity constraints, sector risks, and other realities:The key to long-term success in investing in high yield bonds is managing credit risk, avoiding dangerous concentrations and minimizing defaults in the portfolio. In addition, in harvesting carry across extended credit markets, security selectivity becomes even more crucial. Investors shall stay engaged, know the securities; do not be afraid of sentiment.The increase in volatility is creating numerous opportunities for fundamental, bottom-up investors. With more movement in the market, there is a wider range of possible outcomes, some of them lost, but some of them gained. While the downside increases, so does the upside. As with any investment, the riskier it is, the greater the possible return is. Furthermore, a contrarian stance, backed by a comprehensive understanding of companies' long-term fundamental prospects, will provide a strong foundation to withstand as well as profit from a world of rising volatility."
2301615,59311,2014-07-08T08:33:03-04:00,"AIF offers a high yield, with low volatility.
        The fund is managed by a well regarded advisor.
        Article explores attractive attributes of this fund.","Apollo Tactical Income Fund (NYSE:AIF) - Strong Carry for Low VolatilityOverviewApollo Tactical Income Fund is a relatively new fixed income (NYSE:FI) closed end fund (NYSEARCA:CEF) that invests across the corporate capital stack. This fund has been discussed briskly in a prior note; this is a more extensive inquiry into the value proposition. Like many of the best bargains in FI CEF space, this was IPO'ed just before 2013's bond sell off and shares continue to change hands at a considerable discount despite management's history in growing net asset value (NYSE:NAV) with minimal volatility. Management has added value over passive indexing, as demonstrated by a number of methods. The discount to NAV combined with a dividend that is adequately covered present one of the better opportunities for investors seeking a low volatility offering that may be protected against rising rates. A fund card and link to filings is here.Source: BloombergThe fund's advisor, Apollo, is a large alternatives manager, with a full menu of listed offerings as shown below.Source: Sponsor websitePortfolio CharacteristicsThe fund invests up and down the corporate credit seniority ladder such as loans and bonds; this even includes complex structured instruments like CDO/CLO's. If desired the fund can hold the riskiest tranches of securitized issues such as residual equity interests. Those are often described as asset backed securities in the fund's filings, although they are different than the MBS, CMBS also referred to generically as ABS by other sponsors.Source: Sponsor websiteThe advisor's summary above shows that they hold a wide range of securities, diversified by issuer. Although, they are primarily a domestic oriented manager, there are some international holdings. After reviewing the holdings of hundreds of similar funds, one attribute that sticks out is how the alternatives style managers tend to have less broadly syndicated loans, and more of the smaller, specialty sponsor underwritten paper. These tend to be less liquid but juicier in terms of yield; and some would argue that they have better metrics like debt/EBITDA or interest coverage than the bigger better known borrowers obligations.Source: BloombergBelow is the breakdown between bonds, loans, and CLOs. These numbers are slightly different from other reports presented here due to the timing of data. The manager is able to use May 30, 2014 information for their internal fund cards, while external analytics are based on the last regulatory filings. Comparing the differences, Apollo seems to be tilting more towards loans in recent months.Source: Sponsor websiteBelow are estimates of the portfolio's fixed income metrics, such as yield to worst (YTW) and option adjusted duration (OAD). Note that the AIF vehicle is offering levered exposure to the underlying portfolio, so these should be adjusted by the +32% of fund leverage.Source: BloombergManagement's EffectivenessThe Apollo Tactical Income Fund does not have a long track record, but the advisor is respected and has been managing both tradable and control credit for decades. One can review a history of the sponsor here, and if one drills down, there is a rich collection of links for more background information. Long term investors will find reading the underlying source links to be helpful in understanding how management differentiates itself from other investors.Source: Sponsor websiteThe alternative managers (Blackstone, KKR, Apollo etc.) who are running liquid credit vehicles are all growing their assets under management by making a similar claim. That is -- by controlling private portfolio companies -- they have a better real time understanding of the economy than non-control managers, and as such, can act upon turning points in the business cycle faster. They also believe they can invest in complex, or illiquid situations that are too thorny for trillion dollar industry giants like BlackRock or Vanguard.Source: Sponsor websiteThe quantitative tools to measure effectiveness become less reliable with small data sets, but one can look at a factor loading study to understand how NAV returns were generated. [As a side note - for CEF management assessment, investors should use NAV returns, not market price returns. NAV is what portfolio management has control over; CEF market prices add two degrees of freedom (discount/premiums, and dilution/buyback) that add noise to the studies.]Source: BloombergThis analysis above suggests that a simple collection of FI beta factors would have only explained 83% of the variation in the fund's NAV movements. In addition, there is both alpha, suggesting value is being added above simple beta exposure, and a high information ratio, suggesting that when the manager takes risk (with respect to a factor benchmark) it has been rewarded. This analysis was done using a blend of benchmarks selected by what the manager most ""looks like"" by comparing their NAV returns to a range of indices. A conventional Lehman Agg benchmark (like the BND or LAG ETF benchmark) was also presented side by side to show how that would look under the same kind of analysis. The numbers of that secondary analysis indeed line up closely to the known composition of the Lehman Agg, which provide confidence in the AIF NAV study.Source: BloombergIn addition we can run a more conventional static single index comparison to see if the manager is adding value beyond cheap leverage. Above is a graphical plot of AIF NAV returns vs. the Lehman HY total return benchmark. One can see after the first bout of taper tantrums, the fund shrugged off the secondary Fall 2013 sell off in credit quite well.Source: BloombergAbove is an alpha/beta study of the NAV returns for AIF vs. the Lehman HY index, which suggests that the vehicle is - at least for this short time history - not just levered up beta being billed out at high fees. The alpha residual appears to be significant, so perhaps management's claim that their organization can harness their credit insights from private companies to tradable paper is indeed valid. Below is a rolling factor loading graph suggesting that dynamic swinging between dominant exposures has not been a driver of returns. It's rare, but some managers do adjust exposures materially, and are able to add edge with market/sector timing. AIF's dominant persistent exposures have been, as expected, to high yield credit.Source: BloombergDividend SafetyMost investors in CEF's are income oriented, and as such the level and security of the yield on offer is paramount. The dividend yield at NAV is 7.04% but because the market is offering the fund at a sizable discount, investors can obtain 7.68% assuming recent prices. That indicated yield does not include the potential for a small special dividend from any spillover earnings that may not have been paid out during the calendar year. Mgmt. may distribute those in the year end cleanup.Source: BloombergDividend safety can be derived from a couple of sources. First is the annual report from February where the financial highlights present earnings, and distributions. One can observe that earnings have historically covered distributions, from the statement below.Source: SEC filingsIn addition, there is also an accounting entry item called undistributed net investment income (UNII) that is presented. When that is negative it tends to be more likely for funds to cut their dividend. There are nuances around interpreting that number for instruments with complex accounting like REITs and MLPs, but for now, we can gloss over that because UNII is positive as of the last filing.Source: SEC FilingsIn addition there is another filing to watch for called a Section 19 notice. Essentially this is a notification from a fund that they are paying out more in dividends than generating in earnings. Not all fund companies report these as well as they should, but usually the lack of Sec 19 notice is another hint that the dividend is covered. So far, no Sec 19 filings have been dropped recently for AIF. A last way to back into a theoretical earnings rate is to take the YTW (show previously), adjust for the leverage, subtract expenses / interest costs, and then correct for discount. This technique for estimating earnings is discussed in more detail in a prior note.By following this checklist, the dividend looks secure, but there is ongoing yield compression in the high yield and loan space, and this will have to be re-verified in late August 2014 when the next semiannual earnings statement will be filed. For now, there is no obvious cause for concern nor is the yield extreme compared to its peer group.LeverageSource: Sponsor websiteAIF is a leveraged vehicle which increases the potential risk and reward of the fund. The leverage used is similar to a margin loan in economic performance, although not precisely. However the core tradeoff is comparable: if the fund's holdings drop in value steeply, and stay down, the fund could be forced to reduce its risk at an inopportune time, by selling assets at low prices, and locking in losses. Many leveraged funds managed gearing poorly during the financial crisis, and that led to a permanent impairment of capital, beyond mere mark to market volatility. Below are the details of the funds borrowing; note that these are better terms than what retail investors would be able obtain themselves, even if they had accounts at a firm like Interactive Brokers that caters to semi-professionals. The expenses, shown in a prior table, are high at 2.55% per annum, but that includes interest costs. Investors need to consider whether the higher fees for active management and leverage are justified versus cheaper, passive alternatives.Source: SEC filingsCo InvestorsSometimes it can be instructive to investigate the shareholder constituency for a security. This might give insight into what the patience will be for underperforming management, or the receptiveness of fellow owners to an activist/proxy campaign. Some analysts also believe it has implications for trading liquidity and volatility.Source: BloombergAbove is a list of large holders, composed from 13F filings as well as other disclosures. Green check marks flag those holders who might be regarded as 'smart money'. Most other institutions are clearing firms for financial advisors or retail investors, and are not particularly better informed. AIF's holder list looks a little better than average in terms of smart money involvement. Alternatives managers do occasionally make large investments from affiliated funds though, which is a good sign. In this case Apollo does own some AIF, acquired recently, as can be seen above. Below is a list of insider ownership, such as management and affiliates. Unfortunately this roster is fairly thin, with minimal involvement by Apollo's own staff. Although it's comforting to see large personal management holdings, like Bill Gross's 200mm ownership of various PIMCO CEFs, it's not a requirement. Often the investment team of private equity firms has access to better opportunities in employee incentive programs than a public listed fund, so it's not surprising that personal investments in AIF are small.Source: BloombergRates Shock Stress TestInvestors were given an example during the early summer of 2013 of how bonds may not be low risk during a rising rate environment. One measure of interest rate risk is called duration (presented previously in the portfolio characteristics, as OAD) which is expressed as a measure of how much a portfolio will move for a 1 or 100 bps move in interest rates. Typically this is shown for a parallel shift in the yield curve, which is a situation where short, intermediate, and long rates all move the same amount. Although that's unrealistic, it's a simple way to quickly get a sense of the risks a portfolio is carrying versus rates movements. The NAV of a CEF fund will be sensitive to both the duration of its holdings, and the leverage that has been applied. Below is an analysis from a quantitative risk system, of how AIF's portfolio might react to an instantaneous rate shock, note that the fund's shares will also additionally react scaled by leverage, and changes in discount/premium levels.Source: BloombergValue-at-RiskAnother analysis closely linked the stress test above, is a Value-at-Risk analysis. Interested readers can do more research into that if they are motivated, but a quick explanation is that this tries to quantify all the various risks that may confront a portfolio, and by probability weighting them, come up with one number that expresses the riskiness (defined here as market price volatility) of the portfolio. This is typically measured in regulatory mandated time horizons like (10 day, 99% confidence intervals), but for this analysis, we have taken a 1 year time frame, with a 95% confidence band. The numbers presented below suggest that the portfolio will 95% of the time, move less than +/- 2.77% over the course of a year. The conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) number suggests that when limits are breached, the expected portfolio movement would be 3.89%; NAV movement would be portfolio movement scaled by leverage. Note that the raw unadjusted numbers are less than the broad investment grade bond index the AIF portfolio is compared to.Source: BloombergTracking ErrorAnother similar analysis is a forecast tracking error vs. the same investment grade index. The projected 3.81% difference shows that the underlying portfolio is indeed, unlikely to behave like a conventional investment grade bond index. Investors who are naively switching out of 'core bonds' for vehicles like AIF should understand that the yield pickup is at the expense of meaningful tracking error. This could be positive of course, and reflect excess returns over conventional bonds. Although unlikely to be of interest to most investors, the decomposition also shows whether the risk is coming from systematic forces or idiosyncratic issuer risk. Most of the risk (defined as deviation from the benchmark) here is coming from the sector differences between the portfolios.Source: BloombergVolatilityOne of the most compelling features of AIF is management's control of portfolio volatility. Investors are assumed to prefer high returns over low, and penalize risk (as defined by market volatility), so high returns with low risk is preferred. Apollo has done an admirable job in controlling the realized NAV volatility the portfolio has experienced. Managers can do this by holding a blend of securities whose behavior is expected to react to different economic forces, as well as different stages of the business cycle. Loans for example might be well positioned for rising rates, while bonds are better during falling rates. The lowest rungs on the credit ladder might benefit strongest from an early cycle economic expansion, while the highest rated issues might perform better as leading economic indicators roll over. Below is a depiction of the rolling realized volatility of AIF NAV, versus peer proxies like junk bonds, investment grade corporates, and PIMCO/Bill Gross's high yield flagship PHK -- one can plainly see that AIF has the lowest realized volatility. Combined with the high yield, this makes for a high prospective Sharpe's ratio (excess return/volatility). In fact, among the universe of credit CEFs, AIF has an exceptional ratio, which is why it popped up on quantitative screening. This fund will suffer if there is a sharp recession similar to the 2008-2009 downturn, and may even have permanent impairment of capital. Investors should understand that tradeoff prior to investing.Source: BloombergConclusionThe Apollo Tactical Income Fund offers a high secure yield while advised by a well regarded private equity/control credit sponsor. Valuation is attractive versus other closed end bond funds given the 8% discount shares change hands at, and the 7.7% current distribution. The discount is excessive because volatility is low, management is competent, and NAV has been grinding upwards since fund launch. If the fund was more seasoned, and had established a stable shareholder base before market volatility struck, it would be less likely to be available at the attractive entry point offered today. Income oriented investors concerned about rising rates might consider this fund for further research and/or portfolio addition given the attractive attributes detailed in this note. Investors who are concerned about a harsh recession should steer clear of this.Disclosure: The author is long AIF. The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.

1736232,20502,2013-10-09T10:05:22-04:00,,"We are rapidly approaching the time of year when investors review their portfolios to look for opportunities to realize a short-term capital gains tax loss. Short term tax losses can be used to offset realized capital gains in other securities and up to $3,000 in net losses can be deducted against taxable income.Nearly every year, at least some CEF sector experiences strong tax loss selling pressure, which widens discounts to NAV coming up to the year end. These CEFs often bounce back strongly in January and February when the selling pressure lets up.This year, equity CEFs have generally had strong performances and there are not many losses to be had. It is unlikely discounts on equity CEFs will widen considerably due to tax loss selling.But many fixed income CEF asset classes have suffered losses this year. Investors who may have realized gains on their equity investments can reduce their tax bill by taking tax losses on their fixed income investments. In some cases, they may just swap one fixed income CEF for another to generate a tax loss, but some may reduce their overall exposure to fixed income adding to the selling pressure.There are many fixed income sectors along with some precious metal funds that will likely experience tax loss selling this year. We may have already seen much of this tax loss selling, since weakness in fixed income and precious metals began earlier this year.Some of the best opportunities this year to capitalize on the tax loss selling ""bounce"" in January, may come from the fixed income CEFs initial public offerings that occurred early in the year when fixed income was still a hot asset class. There are two reasons these busted IPOs are ripe candidates for tax loss selling now that they are trading near their all-time low price:1) Every investor who bought at the IPO is holding the fund at a loss, and most investors who bought in later are also sitting on a loss.2) The holding period is under one year, so investors can realize short-term capital losses, which are more valuable than long term capital losses.Because of the large number of tax loss candidates this year, I've decided to publish a series of articles that focus on different asset classes. In this article, I highlight two busted CEF IPOs in the high-yield bond asset class.I) Apollo Tactical Income Fund (NYSE:AIF)Inception Date: February, 25, 2013Inception Price: $20.00Inception NAV: $19.06- Invests mainly in senior loans, high-yield corporate bonds and other credit instruments made to companies whose debt is below investment grade.- Conservative approach to credit selection - focus on collateral coverage, structural seniority, stable companies with positive cash flow and proven management teams.- Uses tactical allocation between loans and bonds as market conditions change.- Lower duration than the overall high-yield marketPortfolio Composition (as of 08/31/2013)As often occurs, the market timing of the AIF initial public offering was optimized for the issuer, but not the best time for investors and near the peak level for fixed income prices. But AIF has decent NAV performance since the IPO. The NAV of 19.25 is above the inception NAV, and the fund has also paid out $0.585 in dividends.Morningstar gives the 6-month NAV return of +2.82%, which compares well with the -1.77% return of the Barclays US AGG Bond index, and the +1.73% return of its high-yield competitors. (On the other hand, the market price return was -13.71%, which explains why this is one of my tax loss ""bounce"" candidates).AIF is currently selling at a discount to NAV of -11.17% compared to the 6-month average discount of -7.09%. At the IPO in late February, it sold at a premium of over 4.9%!Top 5 Industries Breakdown (as of August 31, 2013)Bond Rating Distribution (08/31/2013)Here are some other stats on AIF:Apollo Tactical Income FundII) Ivy High Income Opportunities (NYSE:IVH)Inception Date: May 29, 2013Inception Price: $20.00Inception NAV: $19.061) Invests primarily in high-yield corporate bonds and first and second secured loans.2) Uses bottom-up credit research of individual issuers.3) Ivy Fund's first entry into the closed-end marketplace. The investment process substantially replicates the investment process of the open-end Ivy High Income Fund. Both funds are managed by Bryan C. Krug who has been with Ivy Funds for twelve years and was named a Rising Star of Mutual Funds by Institutional Investor.4) Krug is backed up by six skilled credit analysts and the firm's global equity research team.Portfolio Composition (as of 09/30/2013)The IPO for IVH came out about a week after Ben Bernanke stated in testimony before Congress that the Fed might start to ""taper"" the bond buying program. Most bond funds were hit hard since then, but IVH has pretty decent NAV performance since its IPO. The NAV of 19.60 is well above the inception NAV, and the fund has paid out $0.25 in dividends.Morningstar gives the 3-month NAV return of +5.10%, which compares well with the 1.17% return of the Barclays US AGG Bond index, and the +3.80% return of its high-yield competitors. (On the other hand, the market price 3-month return was -11.70%, which explains why this is another tax loss ""bounce"" candidate).IVH is currently selling at a discount to NAV of -10.97% compared to the average discount of -7.52% since inception. At the IPO in late May, it sold at a premium of over 4.9%!Bond Rating Distribution (09/31/2013)Here are some other stats on IVH:Ivy High Income Opportunities Both AIF and IVH are good candidates to play the tax loss selling ""bounce"" strategy. They have both performed well on an NAV basis. Investors who are holding the open-end Ivy High Income fund (MUTF:WHIYX) may want to consider a swap into IVH.Since all of the tax loss selling may not be over yet, a short-term trader may want to wait until Thanksgiving before accumulating shares. But for a longer-term investor who wants to accumulate a larger position, I think the funds have already been beaten up enough so that you may want to gradually start dollar cost averaging into these funds right now.Disclosure: I am long IVH.

What's going on?FRAN RODILOSSO: Tom, to say the least there's been a rally, although it's been more of a V-shaped trade in U.S. high-yield, and global high-yield in 2016. Up until February 11, the U.S. high-yield market, if you look at the BofA Merrill Lynch US High Yield Index (H0A0), it was down over 5%. That means that in the first 5 to 6 weeks of 2016, the Index had a return that was worse than its overall return for all of 2015 [-4.64%].Since February 11, the market has rallied significantly, and is up more than 6% year to date [as of 04/30/16]. Some of the higher quality high-yield, the double Bs, as reflected by Merrill Lynch's fallen angel index [the BofA Merrill Lynch US Fallen Angel High Yield Index (H0FA)] are up 10% year to date through the early third week of April.But in all cases, we have seen a continuation of what we saw largely in late 2015: a fairly significant selloff heading into early February. What sparked the selloff is an interesting question. Clearly the market came into 2016 concerned about several factors, one being the Federal Reserve (Fed), including the pace of Fed rate hikes, what this would do for yields overall, and what this would do for investors’ risk appetites. Since early February the market has changed its mind as the Fed has indicated that it will hold back on the pace of rate hikes. This has been one of the key driving factors.TOM BUTCHER: Have all high-yield bonds moved in sync?RODILOSSO: No, they have not. Although if you look at the Merrill Lynch Index [the BofA Merrill Lynch US High Yield Index (H0A0)], and break it down into 18 broad sectors within the high-yield universe, 17 of the 18 have shown positive returns year to date. Only the banking sector is slightly negative in its return. From that perspective, the high yield universe appears fairly correlated. But the bulk of return has been driven by two sectors, and those were the two sectors that drove negative returns last year: Energy and Basic Industry, the latter of which encompasses the metals and mining universe within high yield. These two sectors exerted downward pressure into early February, and have also driven the rally since February. One interesting note: of the 18 sectors I mentioned, 10 of them through mid-April still had wider, higher spreads versus U.S. Treasuries year to date. Now, they have had positive returns as Treasury yields have come down between 45 and 50 basis points, both the 5-year yields and the 10-year yields. Although the return on all those high yield sectors, except for banking, have been positive, their spreads right now are indicating a little more risk premium than they did on December 31, 2015.It's important to note that really over a two-year period the high-yield market is still actually posting a negative return. And even over the last 12 months, a 2% negative return-- more than 2% negative return. And again, that downward movement in high-yield was largely driven by energy and these basic industry sectors. But also, it was driven more by the lower end of the credit spectrum-- so triple C single B issuers. If you look at their correlation, for instance, with oil prices, it's been extremely high-- not as high as with the double B or or high single B issuers. And so what you've seen is the higher quality end of the market has done better net over that two-year period, over the last 12 month period. And even year to date, when the market starts racing ahead, sometimes the lowest rated credits will lead that move. But that's why Fallen Angels have had actually a very important and positive impact on overall high-yield performance this year. And Fallen Angels as a category, which tend to be much higher percentage double B, Fallen Angels are 80% double B-- They've outperformed the high-yield market by more than several hundred basis points year-to-date.BUTCHER: Fran, what are the current perceived risks and how has the market reacted to them?RODILOSSO: I mentioned the interest-rate risk, the Fed risk, that prevailed at the beginning of the year, and that is still impacting the market. What if the Fed is behind the curve? Or what if the Fed just goes with the 4 to 5 planned moves over the next 12 months? In addition, the market came into 2016 very concerned about commodity prices, and this has not yet gone away. Clearly this has been a big driver other than the interest rate non-movement, or actually falling interest rates, and global central bank actions. It wasn't just the Fed saying it is going to move slower, it was Europe finding more ways to ease. It's the Bank of Japan wondering what it is going to do next.There's downward pressure on interest rates across the globe, which also means more liquidity. This has helped boost commodity prices, which have been a big question for the high-yield market. More and more energy issuers have fallen into the high-yield sector as metals and mining issuers have been downgraded, and people began worrying about default rates. Expected default rates outside those two sectors are actually well below historical averages for the high-yield market, but well above historical averages within those two sectors: Energy and Basic Industry.Overall markets are concerned about commodities, concerned about interest rates, and China is tied into both, mainly the commodity story. The China growth story dominated headlines for the first month or two of 2016, with the question being would China be able to engineer a soft landing? A question we had been asking for two years. But also would China need to devalue its currency more rapidly, or deploy some kind of macro devaluation? Thus far China seems to be navigating well, but not without increased leverage within its economy and obvious pockets of risk. Overall, however, the China story has become much less dominant in terms of the thinking of global investors.IMPORTANT DISCLOSUREThe views and opinions expressed are those of the speaker and are current as of the video’s posting date.

3965049,67473,2016-04-13T13:55:40-04:00,,"By Rupert HargreavesIs there a US corporate credit bubble? That's the question explored in a Global Macro strategy research note from UBS.Sent to clients at the beginning of this week, the note put together by UBS's macro strategists Matthew Mish, CFA and Stephen Caprio, CFA explores the thesis that there is a bubble in speculative grade credit.The bubble hypothesis originates from the fact that easy money policies from central banks have kept 'zombie' firms afloat and QE programs have triggered substantial inflows into credit funds, igniting a material reach for yield since 2012. This has translated into elevated competition, easing credit standards, and massive issuance.UBS's analysts go on to speculate that as much as $1 trillion of corporate credit could end up as 'distressed debt' in the next credit cycle - which is already starting to take shape.Credit bubble: The bulls and the bearsCredit bulls will tell you that the US corporate credit remains an attractive place to invest. Corporate debts to profits, assets, and market values do not appear extreme and corporate profit margins remain wide with no scope of contracting materially in the near term.However, if you dig into US corporate credit figures, a different, more concerning picture appears.Credit fundamentals, particularly in US speculative-grade are in a more dire state. High-yield issuance is down 53% in 2016, indicative of a substantial tightening in credit conditions. While higher-grade firms still have relatively clean balance sheets, speculative-grade companies have been more reliant upon debt issuance to supplement earnings streams in this cycle. Simply put, lower quality firms have been structurally increasing debt faster than earnings as interest rates have declined.Is There A US Corporate Credit Bubble?At present, these high levels of leverage can be sustained, but credit investors should keep in mind that rating agencies typically incorporate other operating financial metrics when rating speculative-grade bonds and loans. This means that in the current environment, with the economy growing at a steady rate, interest rates depressed to artificially low levels and investors seemingly willing to ignore deteriorating fundamentals in favor of yield (liquidity) a speculative-grade company is likely to earn a higher credit rating. If any one of these factors were to change, speculative-grade companies could suddenly find their credit ratings being re-evaluated, which would likely be followed by higher interest costs and less liquidity. This trend is already starting to play out, as UBS explains:Is There A US Corporate Credit Bubble?""Herded into lower quality credit""From late 2012 to early 2015, spreads across the credit market were relatively compressed and investors were essentially herded into lower quality credit risk for a yield pickup of a couple of hundred basis points.As UBS's credit research team points out, the problem with this is that the default risk is exponential, not linear in these securities and clients were not being compensated appropriately for the risk being taken on. Further, evidence suggested credit loss or delinquency curves across credit tiers are exponential not only the corporate credits, but also for other forms of consumer credit. The reach for yield and deterioration in lending conditions has been well documented in other credit segments, e.g., commercial real estate, consumer auto, student loans and unsecured loans.Is There A US Corporate Credit Bubble?In short, UBS believes that there is a ""corporate credit bubble in speculative grade credit:""Disclosure: Rupert may hold positions in one or more of the companies mentioned in this article.

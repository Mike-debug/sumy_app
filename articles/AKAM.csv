Through its latest acquisition, Akamai continues to establish its dominance in the space.While the company seems fully priced, it is a business we are happy to buy and hold for the long term.","Akamai Technologies Inc. (AKAM) provides CDN and cloud services. It has been around for over 20 years and is a leader in cybersecurity and edge computing. While the stock is fully priced, we believe that it is still a good company to add to your portfolio. Akamai has “utility-like” characteristics that make its revenues reliable and secure. Furthermore, the company will enjoy continued growth thanks to cybersecurity and its pioneering Edge Platform.Source: wbur.orgAkamai Technologies provides CDN and cloud services for delivering content around the internet. It provides the necessary infrastructure to companies around the world to deliver data in a fast and secure way. The company has been around since the days of the tech bubble and has a long track record of growth and profitability. The latest quarterly numbers are no different, and we can gain some insight into the direction the market and business is going:Source: Investor RelationsYoY, revenues are up 11% after accounting for foreign exchange. The company operates in two main segments; Web Division, and Media and Carrier Division. The service provided is essentially the same, but the profile of the clients and specific needs are different. Web Division serves data to “traditional” HTML websites, such as Airbnb Inc. (AIRB). Meanwhile, Media and Carrier provide services to clients like the NBA and Riot Games. Revenues are split quite evenly between these two segments at $418M and $375M, respectively, in the latest quarter. However, the Media and Carrier grew at 16%, more than twice as fast as the Web.Perhaps though, a more interesting breakdown of revenues would be by service and geography. Akamai has established itself as a leader in the cybersecurity space. Cloud Security Solutions brought in $266M and grew 23% YoY. Geographically, U.S. revenue was $437 million, up 6% year over year, while international revenue came in at $355 million, an 18% increase.In terms of revenue growth, the company has achieved a very reasonable 12% CAGR over the last 10 years. The appeal of the steady double-digit growth, though, is at least matched, if not outweighed, by that of the balance sheet.Source: Investor RelationsWith $742M in cash, over $2 billion in short-term assets, and only $3.4 billion in total liabilities, Akamai has an above-average balance sheet. The question for investors is whether the company can maintain the last few years' levels of growth in the future. The area is getting incredibly competitive, but the company enjoys some significant advantages and also new growth opportunities.The strength of the balance sheet, as mentioned above, is a big plus. The other thing we love about Akamai is its distribution of revenues, giving investors good exposure to the international market. But what surely separates Akamai from its peers are two things; its vast and established network and its leadership in cybersecurity and edge computing.Akamai has over 300,000 servers around the world. This level of infrastructure is unrivaled and is what allows the company to deliver data so fast. The final iteration of this infrastructure comes in the form of Akamai’s Edge Platform. Edge computing is a “decentralized” way of delivering information. It connects devices directly, rather than having to go through servers, and Akamai is unparalleled in this area.Source: Company WebsiteThe company has been a pioneer in edge computing for the last 10 years, but edge computing represents the future even more than the past. The decentralized nature of edge computing is what will enable future technologies such as AI, IoT, and 5G. The growth prospects are unquantifiable.The other area where the company is thriving is cybersecurity, a segment that is poised to grow at a 10% CAGR from 2020-2027. Cybersecurity has become a very significant issue for companies scaling their digitalization. A recent survey by Asavie shows that this has become an even bigger issue following the COVID-19 pandemic:As we can see, scaling endpoint security was the top concern for large companies. Furthermore, over 44% of companies cited receiving cyberattacks during the COVID-19 months.Cybersecurity represents a growth opportunity which we believe could far exceed 10% CAGR. Akamai’s security services already grew at over 20% in the last quarter, and the company continues to assert its leadership with the recent acquisition of Asavie. Asavie’s technology focuses on creating secure networks for mobile applications. The key driver behind the acquisition was the scalability of Asavie’s technology. With this new integration, Akamai can reinforce its cybersecurity offerings and capture further growth from 5G.On a final note, regarding this section, we’d like to point out the fact that the revenues are incredibly steady and secure. Akamai offers a service that is the backbone of the internet. It is part of the infrastructure that allows the internet to work, and as such, it is protected to a certain extent from demand headwinds, as many of its services are “necessities”. Furthermore, the company displays a moat-like quality thanks to its unparalleled infrastructure and superior technology.As far as weaknesses and threats, there are at least two significant issues that the company could face in the next few years:First and foremost, the biggest issue that the company faces is competition. Not competition from its competitors, but rather from its clients. When it comes to the CDN market, we have seen a tendency for the “Big boys” to develop in-house solutions for their specific networks. This is something we saw with Netflix Inc. (NFLX), which used to be a client of Akamai’s.The other problem is that Akamai may lose out to some of the other players in the space as CDN becomes “commoditized”. Despite Akamai’s superior offerings, companies like Amazon.com (AMZN) and Microsoft, Inc. (MSFT) can offer cheaper and more “standardized” solutions. This would take market share from Akamai, or at the very least, could put heavy downward pressure on profitability. Having said this, what we see as a much more real possibility, is that Akamai could one day be absorbed by one of these key players.The valuation method is based on our estimates of potential unlevered free cash flow to common shareholders. To do this, we analyze some key ratios regarding investment, revenue, and operating expenses. If you'd like to learn more about our valuation method, you can read about it here.Akamai has a strong growth prospect for 2020 and further years to come, but we did adjust investment spending, which has increased so far in 2020, with net asset turnover decreasing slightly. Profitability is set to remain solid and consistent, and the balance sheet looks healthy, as the debt burden is more than compensated with short- and long-term financial investments, with net interest expense minimal.Overall, we expect an approximate long-term cash return of 6.43% for common stock at the current price ($106.72, October 28). You can see a summary of our forecasted financial data below:Source: Author’s workGiven what we believe to be very reasonable growth expectations, the return for Akamai does look, on the surface, rather underwhelming. However, we are still bullish on the company given the strengths and resilience of its revenues. We invite you to think about Akamai as a utility company, as much as it is a technology company. It provides infrastructure which is essential to the workings of the internet. Akamai serves around 30% of all internet traffic today and that is something that can’t disappear overnight. A look at the stock price chart shows that the company has followed a steady appreciation over the years. Given the fact that revenues are reliable, there are significant growth opportunities, and the incredible strength of the balance sheet, AKAM is a stock we are happy to buy and hold."
4377967,21702,2020-10-07T08:20:50-04:00,"The company's cybersecurity segment is now growing faster than its content delivery networks (""CDN"") business.For 2020, cybersecurity related revenue could approach $1 billion.As a result of continued growth in cybersecurity and a strong comeback in CDN, Q2 results were very strong.While the transition from the stagnating CDN segment to faster-growing cybersecurity seems rational, it opens the door to competition.","Akamai (AKAM) had a blowout Q2 as its content delivery network (""CDN"") segment made a comeback and its cybersecurity business continued to rapidly expand. However, the CDN business that Akamai has dominated for years is stagnant at best and declining at worst while network security - whether accomplished in the cloud, in hardware, or both - is a highly competitive market. So far, management has been able to exploit its existing edge network to rapidly advance its cybersecurity business. Going forward, AKAM will have to wall off its existing network security business from competitors while working hard to gain new customers.Akamai's Q2 EPS report was a blowout and soundly beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines. Revenue of $795 million was up 13% yoy and cost controls helped push EBITDA margin up to 32.7% vs. 31.1% in Q1. As a result, EPS of $0.98/share was up 42% from Q2 of 2019. It was a great quarter but the stock actually closed down a tad the day of the report.As the graphic below shows, AKAM's cloud security business grew 27% in Q2 - continuing a trend that stretches back more than a year. What was surprising in Q2 was an uptick in what had been a rather stagnate CDN business (revenue up 7% yoy), likely due to customers scrambling to provide solutions to handle a massive surge in internet traffic due to the global pandemic:Source: Q2 EPS ReportNote from the above graphic that AKAM's Cloud Security Solutions segment has grown to be ~1/3 of total revenue. But that means CDN is still responsible for ~2/3 or revenue. And that's the problem.AKAM was a pioneer in CDN and really the first company to build a widely dispersed CDN. Akamai's CDN is still one of the largest, if not the largest, in the world:As a result, Akamai has an advantage today because of the scale and resiliency of its existing network (more than 240,000 servers in over 130 countries) and its existing customer base:Source: AkamaiHowever, as shown in the graphic above, prior to Q2, CDN revenue was relatively flat - or even declining - in 2019. That's because the big cloud providers - notably Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOG) - operate CDNs of their own and already serve some of Akamai's customers. That puts them in an ideal position to steal business away from Akamai should they choose to do so. That is, Akamai doesn't have a wide moat to keep CDN competition at bay.As a result, the company's full-year 2020 guidance does not appear to build on the strength of Q2, which looks to be a temporary uptick:Source: 2020 Full-Year GuidanceThe midpoint of Q3 revenue guidance ($772.5 million) is significantly below the $794 million posted in Q2. That may be why the stock traded slightly lower after the Q2 results were released. Yet the $772.5 million midpoint in Q3 revenue guidance would still be +8.8% as compared to the $709.9 million in revenue for Q3 of 2019. And the midpoint of full-year 2020 non-GAAP net income ($5.07/share) compares well to full-year 2019's $4.49 per diluted share. So in the near term, Akamai looks to be performing well and benefiting from the COVID-19 tailwinds that have resulted in more internet usage and traffic.However, going forward and considering the big players that could erode AKAM's CDN business, the company's network security business - which has been growing at a near 30% clip - appear to be the catalyst and investment thesis. Akamai's primary initiative to leverage its existing dispersed network business into its cybersecurity solutions, as well as gain new customers, is what it calls the Akamai Intelligent Edge Platform - which it describes as a ""defensive shield that can surround and protect everything — sites, users, devices, data centers, clouds. It is the technology that eliminates friction and enables immersion."" The company is getting high marks with its security products while increased video streaming and cyber attacks on video gaming provide excellent opportunities for the company to expand its market position.The big question seems to be whether or not Akamai's security solutions can keep growing at a rate that will make up for the potential loss of revenue in CDNs going forward. That is uncertain and hard to ascertain given the COVID-19 juiced Q2 results.Akamai currently trades at a P/E=32.9 TTM earnings. The stock closed Friday at $108.61, which at the midpoint of guided (non-GAAP) 2020 earnings of $5.07 implies a forward P/E=21.4x. However, on a GAAP basis, according to Yahoo Finance, AKAM won't hit the ~$5.07 mark until full-year 2021:Source: Yahoo FinanceGiven the excellent Q2 EPS report and the company's full-year guidance, Akamai's stock looks reasonably valued. The company's cybersecurity related solutions are growing at a near 30% clip and looks to be the primary investment thesis going forward. However, that assumes the CDN business segment can maintain current revenue run-rates. And that is uncertain given the potential competition from big players like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google that could steal away a substantial slice of Akamai's CDN business. As a result, I advise investors to take a ""wait-and-see"" approach with AKAM and analyze coming earnings reports and management commentary before taking a position in the stock. For current shareholders, AKAM is a Hold."
4378138,102785,2020-10-08T09:24:09-04:00,Akamai Technologies is one of the leaders in Internet infrastructure and cloud security.A low beta of 0.43 and relatively healthy profitability margins make it a stable long-term tech player.Akamai's management should watch the competition and monitor the company's debt.Our rating for Akamai is outperform.,"Trading at $17.8 billion in market cap, Akamai Technologies is one of the leaders in Internet infrastructure and cloud security. Its stock shows a low beta of 0.43 and relatively healthy profitability margins, making it a stable long-term tech player. One area to work on for Akamai's management is to watch the competition and monitor the company's debt. Our rating for Akamai is outperform.The plumbers of the InternetAkamai owns and operates networks of hundreds of thousands of server nodes that help the Internet run smoothly. The company can be considered as the plumber of the Internet because of its role facilitating the flow of data across the world.Akamai's servers help clients (usually other companies with a strong online presence) bring traffic faster and safer to consumers.The use of its infrastructure is reported by Akamai separated by two types of clients as per the Q2 2020 earnings report:A global network of 300,000+ serversThe goal of Akamai's content delivery network is to reduce the delay between submitting a request for online content (being this a website, a video stream, or any other type of digital media) and the content fully loading on the consumer's device. For example, if a US consumer tries to access a website based in Australia, the data would need to cross the Pacific Ocean and the user will experience long loading times. To combat this, Akamai stores a cached version of the website in as many as possible geographical locations around the world. The company is currently offering ""a single network hop"" to 85% of the world's internet users (source: corporate website on 10/8/2020).Figure 1 - Approximate location of Akamai Content Delivery Network serversFounded by academicsAkamai Technologies was incubated in MIT in the late 1990s by a team of professors and researchers. One of them, Tom Leighton, still holds the role of CEO at the company. Another of the co-founders, Daniel Lewin, was tragically murdered in the September 11 terrorist attacks when he was reportedly stabbed aboard the AA11 flight after he attempted to foil the hijacking.A survivor of the Dot-com eraAkamai was founded in 1998 and saw its business boom in the mid-2000s with the advent of video platforms like YouTube (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and streaming providers such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).Headquartered in the Bay StateAs opposed to other tech giants that make Silicon Valley their home, Akamai Technologies has its base in Cambridge, Massachusetts, honoring its MIT beginnings.In terms of clients, 56% are US based while 44% are international. Non-US clients provide the most attractive growth rate being up 24% YoY.Does Akamai have a moat?The largest revenue growth area (+27% YoY) for Akamai is its security solutions against Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) cyberattacks. DDoS is a tactic cybercriminals use to ""overwhelm"" the servers of a company, with the purpose of making their internet connection collapse. How do the perpetrators achieve this? Usually, with thousands or even millions of ""zombie"" infected computers that simultaneously (and in a coordinated fashion) initiate connection requests to the victim's server. The victim's infrastructure becomes ""clogged"" with too much traffic and its service goes offline.Figure 2 - DDoS diagram (source: Alibaba)A famous example of this cyberattack was the March 12, 2012, ""Six Banks DDoS Attack"" in which Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), US Bank, Citibank (NYSE:C), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), and PNC Bank (NYSE:PNC) went offline after being the target of a hacker network. These attacks represent substantial losses, both monetary and in consumer confidence.The protection that Akamai offers can be explained in simple terms as a ""shield"" of thousands of nodes that protect the connectivity of their client's end server in case of a DDoS attack. The attackers hit Akamai servers, while the client's servers remain online allowing legitimate connections.Akamai is getting stiffer competition. However, the nature of Akamai's business gives the company a major advantage: economies of scale. Being the largest CDN and cloud security provider out there gives Akamai a moat, although entrants will keep expanding in niche areas. If the management of Akamai doesn't sleep in their laurels, the company will continue enjoying relatively stable profits.Figure 3 - Akamai's stock price chartWhat we like about AkamaiWe see Akamai Technologies almost as a utility company of the Information Age and the stock shows some peculiarly conservative characteristics for a tech company of this size:Table 1 - Profitability ratios of AkamaiOptions markets display optimism about the next earnings releaseOn October 27th, Akamai is expected to release its earnings report for Q3 2020. The Oct 30th expiration implied volatility smile points to a positive sentiment towards earnings release: higher strikes show higher prices in terms of implied volatility vs. farther expiration dates, making us think investors are betting on a potential earnings surprise.In the chart below, it can be observed how lower strikes' volatility runs almost parallel to future expirations, while higher strikes are way steeper in the nearest expiration to earnings date:Figure 4 - Volatility smile of Oct 30th (orange) vs. Nov (orange-yellow) vs. Jan (red)Akamai's debt is the darker spot in the company profileAkamai's long-term debt for the quarter ending June 30, 2020, was $1.873 billion. Although it has a somewhat worse debt position compared to its peers, half of that debt was issued in 2019 in what we believe was a move to take advantage of low interest rates, which at that time their CFO might have considered rock bottom. Now, in 2020, we know that the Fed rate went even lower, but that's another story for another day.Analysts are upgrading their ratings on AkamaiOnce the COVID19 crisis started in March, a variety of analysts shifted focus to Akamai as a potentially safer bet during uncertain times, especially considering the expected surge in Internet traffic from homestayers that would surely benefit the company. Cowen, Raymond James, and Robert W. Baird went from Neutral to Outperform. Goldman Sachs, which was more pessimistic previously with a Sell rating, upgraded to Neutral. Evercore initiated coverage with Outperform.Akamai Technologies is an interesting company for a diversified portfolio. Being one of the leaders of Internet infrastructure and security, we foresee continued use of its services and solutions in the future. Akamai enjoys economies of scale which gives the company a competitive advantage against smaller competitors; however, management needs to be focused on two areas of the competitive landscape: a) larger players that want to vertically integrate their service and b) smaller startups that focus on fast growth niches. Finally, in the company's financials, we wish to see thinner debt in the future. Our overall rating is outperform."
4379686,35181,2020-10-19T07:20:48-04:00,"Akamai is the granddaddy of CDN with a 20-year history of intelligent edge computing and more POPs than all of its competitors combined.Pandemic-driven internet traffic growth has driven revenue growth,  up by 13% and Cloud Security Solutions by 28% in Q2 2020 YoY.The CDN business is lumpy and large enterprises often leave for greener pastures. Fastly investors have just discovered this phenomenon with recent events involving TikTok.Akamai stands to gain from its last-mile cybersecurity offering and emergence of 5G which will dramatically increase internet traffic levels.Akamai a long-term buy.","(Source: Shutterstock)Akamai Technologies, Inc. (AKAM) is the granddaddy of Content Delivery Network (“CDN”), in business for more than 2 decades and transporting an estimated 25% of all web traffic. Akamai provides more locations, or points of presence (“POPs”), than all of its competitors combined with 300,000 servers in 4,000+ locations.To be clear, the CDN market is quite mature with little apparent upside apart from increased traffic over time. The market for CDN customers is close to saturation and enterprises tend to disappear once they reach a certain size. They employ their own performance metrics and often decide that they can do better elsewhere, leading them to abandon their existing provider in favor of a competitor. As an example, Netflix (NFLX) was once an Akamai customer but subsequently abandoned Akamai due to apparent performance issues.Another area of concern for Akamai are so-called upstarts such as Fastly, Inc. (FSLY), that claim to be market disruptors. In Fastly’s case, it claims to be disruptive by providing fewer but more powerful POPs with solid-state storage and large cache situated in strategic locations. By employing this strategy, Fastly believes it will improve the cache hit ratio for static applications and event-driven content. The improved cache hit ratio will compensate for the additional transmission time between source and server due to the greater distance away from the source. And the strategy will also lead to reduced costs as less POPs need to be supported. The rationale for Fastly’s approach is as follows:This argument has a lot of merit, but Akamai of course has a different perspective on this topic as it dominates the “last mile” of internet traffic which is critical for some applications. Here is what Akamai management has to say about edge computing.Akamai’s position is that it has been in the edge computing business for many years and that the technology isn’t a new revelation or market disruptor by any means. Akamai has a myriad of edge computing solutions as shown below.(Source: Akamai)I am more inclined to be on Akamai’s side. By being at the edge instead of in a data center hundreds of miles away, local traffic is processed more efficiently, saving milliseconds that are extremely important for next generation high-speed applications and the current pandemic-driven increase in cyberattacks.(Source: Akamai/Fastly)In any case, if Akamai considers Fastly to be a serious threat, then Akamai could easily upgrade 10% of its POPs in two years and compete with Fastly head-on while still maintaining its current CDN network for existing applications. My time-frame assessment of two years is based on Akamai’s current number of locations (4000+) and length of time the company has been in business (20+ years). Akamai could provide 400 upgraded PoPs, equivalent to what Fastly has now, and I suspect that Akamai has been busy trying to do so for some time.Akamai has benefited from the pandemic as internet traffic and cyberattacks have grown substantially. The company’s Q2 YoY results reflect this new reality with revenue up by 13% and Cloud Security Solutions YoY revenue growth of 28%. By the way, Akamai’s cloud security business alone has just recently reached a $1 billion run rate, which is substantially more than many of its cybersecurity competitors.While the current economic conditions are a tremendous shot in the arm for the company, the pandemic will ultimately end and people will resume their previous lives. Internet traffic will decline to some extent. And as I indicated previously, larger customers tend to up and leave, or downgrade services. Fastly investors have recently discovered this phenomenon with the announcement that revenue from TikTok will be substantially reduced. And finally, Akamai's cybersecurity offering is really only of benefit to its CDN users. While there has been fairly good revenue growth in the area of cybersecurity, the primary target market is with existing CDN customers which has limited growth.As a side note, Akamai management has indicated that the company’s US TikTok revenues are not substantial and a possible ban from the US will not significantly impact Akamai’s revenue.While Akamai’s future appears to have limited promise, there is a bright side. We have some emerging technology trends, including 5G and the Internet of Things (“IoT”), that will be a tremendous opportunity for Akamai. My opinion is that Akamai is better positioned to capture the internet-related growth resulting from these emerging technologies.Amazing new applications will emerge in the next decade, based on vast increases in transmission speed and data movement. As one example, Chinese companies are now implementing robotaxi services that employ vehicles with no steering wheel or other driving-related controls. When needed, operators intend to provide a remote driver with vehicle operation using a 5G network.Akamai stands to benefit more so than its competitors when next-generation applications arrive, primarily due to its dominance of the last mile, increased traffic flow, and its greater financial resources which are at least an order of magnitude more than competitors such as Fastly.(Source: Akamai)In addition, the recent pandemic-related improvement in financial performance has provided Akamai with additional cash flow that could allow Akamai to advance its IoT Edge Cloud platform, an area that may have a very bright future. Akamai considers 5G to be part of the IoT classification.While Akamai’s stock price has been quite volatile this year, the chart is still bullish remaining above the $105 support level.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)There are numerous techniques for valuing stocks. Some analysts use fundamental ratios such as P/E, P/S, EV/P, or EV/S. I believe that one should not employ a simple ratio, and the reason is simple. Higher-growth stocks are valued more than lower-growth stocks, and rightly so. Growth is a significant parameter in discounted cash flow valuation.Therefore, I employ a technique that uses a scatter plot to determine relative valuation for the stock of interest versus the remaining 170+ stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The Y-axis represents the enterprise value/forward gross profits estimate, while the X-axis is the estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth.The plot below illustrates how Akamai stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis based on forward gross profits multiple.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red and represents an average valuation based on next year's sales growth. The higher the anticipated revenue growth, the higher the accepted valuation. In this instance, Akamai is positioned near the best-fit line, suggesting that the company is fairly valued relative to its peers. I have also accented CDN competitors Fastly, Cloudflare, Inc. (NET), and Limelight Networks, Inc. (LLNW) for comparison purposes. The growth expectations for Fastly and Cloudflare are much higher which makes sense considering they are much smaller companies.There are several risks that investors should consider before investing in Akamai. First of all, I view the current stock market action to be reminiscent of the dot.com era, immediately prior to the crash starting in 2000. Technology stocks were performing well beyond what many analysts considered acceptable valuations. It wasn't long before the market turned into a disaster, and the same could happen here, although I believe that there is much more substance behind the internet companies than existed 20 years ago.Akamai's performance is very much tied to the economy and we are in a recession which could become a depression without new government subsidies being held up by politics. No one really knows how long the recession will persist or how deep it will get. Ultimately, economic recovery will drive Akamai's success.We also don't know how successful Akamai will be in capturing business relating to next-generation internet applications or retaining existing customers on a long-term basis.Akamai is the granddaddy of CDNs, with approximately 300,000 servers, 4,000 POPs, and located in 135+ countries. It is estimated that 25% of all internet traffic runs through Akamai's servers and 85% of all internet traffic is one hop away.The CDN market is considered to be quite mature and its future driven by the economy and internet usage. Revenue is quite lumpy with large enterprises shifting between one CDN and another.But Akamai has maximized its opportunities with services like Cloud Security Solutions which grew revenue 28% YoY and now has a run rate of $1 billion per year, accounting for 1/3 of Akamai's total revenue. While this is a terrific growth driver, it is growth into a somewhat limited market of existing CDN customers.On the bright side, the pandemic has caused a significant increase in internet traffic and cybersecurity attacks, both of which have bolstered the company's near-term financial performance. The new-found fortune is expected to be funneled into the company's future products which include the IoT Edge Cloud platform which interfaces with a wide variety of IoT devices and protocols.Akamai appears to be better positioned than its competitors for the eventual rise of 5G and IoT next-generation applications due to its dominance in the last-mile, vast increase in network traffic, and its financial resources.Akamai is fairly valued according to my relative valuation technique, and has approximately $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. That, along with a healthy free cash flow margin of 16% puts this company in good shape to survive the current recession. For these reasons, I am giving Akamai a Buy rating. I believe that it is a smart long-term investment."
4356963,102293,2020-07-05T06:54:19-04:00,"Akamai stands to benefit from secular tailwinds such as an increase in e-commerce penetration and online media consumption.The company’s security business has also emerged as a major growth driver.Investors should consider risks such as the impact of a deep and persistent recession on certain businesses, probability of increasing bad debt, and competitive pressures.","Cloud security and CDN (content delivery network) player Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) seems to have been left behind in what can only be called an enviable rally of the software infrastructure companies. I dare say this even when Akamai itself is trading 30.96% higher on a YTD (year-to-date) basis.However, these gains look pretty low when we see how competing cloud security and CDN companies have performed in 2020. Peers such as Cloudflare (NET), Limelight Networks (LLNW), and Fastly (FSLY) are up by 113.77%, 90.69%, and 321.08%, respectively, on a YTD basis. Akamai is trading at PS multiple of 6.07x, much lower than the valuation levels of its peers. Here again, Cloudflare and Fastly are trading at staggering PS multiples of 35.45x and 37.74x, respectively. There seems to be no valid reason why Akamai is trading at such a significant discount to its peers, considering the company's scale, profitability, and growth potential.The Covid-19 pandemic has forced the entire world to change the way it lives and works. With stay-at-home and work-from-home becoming the new normal, the demand for technology has spiked like never before. Even before the first wave of Covid infections could be completely eradicated, there has been a second wave of infections in some parts of the world. Since an effective and accessible vaccine is expected not before the first half of 2021, people will continue to stay at home for the most part of 2020.People quarantined at home are consuming media such as VOD (video-on-demand) and gaming services at an alarming pace. Besides solid demand trends, gaming companies are also planning several launches to benefit from the literally captive audience. These trends translated into an almost 30% YoY increase in traffic for the company's platform in a four-week period at the end of the first quarter. The company managed a traffic peak of 167 terabits per second, almost 100% higher than the peak seen in the first quarter of 2019. Akamai prices its customers based on usage and bits delivered, which implies higher traffic translates directly into higher top line growth for the company.Higher demand for data has triggered the roll-out of various video-streaming services in 2020. This has led to astronomical demand for cloud computing solutions as well as for cloud security solutions. The data has to be transmitted from one place to another in a cheap, bandwidth-efficient, available, and secure manner, which has fueled demand for CDN services.In the first quarter, Akamai's revenues of $764.3 million grew YoY by 8.18% and were ahead of the consensus by $14.55 million. The company's non-GAAP EPS of $1.2 also beat the consensus by $0.04.Akamai is banking on this huge market opportunity in 2020. The company aims to leverage its relationships with the big media players and capture a significant share of the content delivery business of all their OTT (over-the-top) offerings. The number of big names in the OTT business have kept on piling since the second half of 2019. Besides Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon Prime (NASDAQ:AMZN), we have biggies like Disney (NYSE:DIS), WarnerMedia, and NBC in the game.Akamai has seen robust traffic in April and May 2020. There may have been a slight moderation in traffic growth in June, considering that people were keen to come out of their houses. The company has accounted for this possibility in its second-quarter non-GAAP EPS guidance of $1.18 to $1.24, implying a rise of 14% to 20% on a CC (constant currency) basis. However, the company withdrew its fiscal 2020 guidance due to the high degree of uncertainty about the state of the economy in the second half of 2020.In November 2019, Disney's streaming service Disney+ was launched, and this proved to be a huge success garnering almost 10 million subscribers in a single day. WarnerMedia's HBO Max service was launched on May 27, 2020. Peacock, an OTT offering from NBC, is scheduled to be launched on July 15, 2020. Although the newer launches may not reach the success level of Disney, they have definitely increased the overall addressable market for Akamai. Besides, the company is also looking ahead to switch some share of the existing OTT business, which is currently using the cable and other standard methods, to its CDN platform.Then again, there are rumors about Amazon planning to add 24/7 live programming to differentiate its Prime Video OTT service. If this proves true, it will also have a favorable impact on Akamai's top line.As the pandemic is unfolding, we are seeing a phenomenal increase in the rate of cyber-attacks, both in terms of number and ferocity, across the world. WHO has seen a five-fold increase in cyber-attacks since the start of the pandemic. The trend has been seen across the world and has only escalated in the aftermath of the increasing U.S.-China hostilities. Subsequently, cloud security solutions are seeing a huge spike in demand.Akamai has also been benefiting from this trend. In the first quarter, the company's cloud security solutions business reported revenues of $240.3 million, a YoY rise of 26.4% on a reported basis and 28% on a CC basis. The performance has been ahead of the company's guidance of 20%. Sales were mainly driven by security services targeting DDoS prevention, application-layer firewall, and bot management. The company also reported robust growth in orders for next-gen Zero Trust enterprise security solutions. Akamai has managed to secure one of the biggest deals ever in the security business with a large media company.The company now expects second-quarter revenue growth for the cloud security solutions business to be around 20% or higher. Despite the challenges of in-person sales, Akamai has been seeing promising enterprise sales in the security business. The company is also seeing robust uptake of its security solutions in international markets especially in Latin America where penetration rates are still pretty low.Akamai now expects enterprises to increasingly shift to the Zero Trust security model amidst urgent demand due to the pandemic. The company is also launching new security solutions such as page integrity and secure web gateway and expects these to drive revenues in the coming years.Akamai's technologies have faced some impact from the cancellation and postponement of live sports broadcasting. This impact, however, has not been that significant.A bigger impact of the Covid-19 related shelter-in-place orders is being felt by the company's Web division, especially in travel & hospitality and commerce & retail verticals. The travel and hospitality vertical accounted for 4% of the company's revenues and comprised of over 200 customers. This business will remain under duress so long as people do not start traveling.Akamai's revenue exposure to the commerce and retail vertical via its Web division is 16%. Here, the company services around 900 customers. The trend in this vertical is rather mixed, with some e-commerce players performing well while mostly brick-and-mortar players especially in the high-end retail segment are struggling. Some retail players have even gone bankrupt. This may result in a significant loss of business as well as an accrual of bad debt for Akamai.The travel & hospitality and commerce & retail verticals also include some of the major customers for Akamai's security business. In case some of the customers go bankrupt, it can also affect the company's security solutions sales in 2020.For long, Akamai's CDN business has struggled with some of its big customers moving the content in-house. The possibility of contract renegotiations and declining Christmas spending can also affect its fiscal 2020 performance. Finally, the tiered pricing structure involving lower prices at higher volumes may also eat into the company's margins. The company also faces the risk of losing some of its CDN business to the very fast growing Fastly.According to Finviz, the 12-month consensus target price for the company is $112.24. I believe that this is too low, considering that the company stands to benefit from potentially permanent changes in consumer behavior in areas such as e-commerce and online media. The bookings for enterprise security products are also rising and will continue to grow for the foreseeable future.In this backdrop, I believe that the target price of $150, the target price set by Cowen analyst Colby Synesael, is a better reflection of the company's potential in the next 12 months. The analyst has also upgraded the company's rating from Market Perform to Outperform. The target price of $150 implies a PS multiple of 8.05 x, still much lower than most competitors.Many other analysts have also rated the company on a positive note. On June 24, Goldman Sachs analyst Heather Bellini reiterated Neutral rating but raised the target price to $107 from $102. On April 29, Craig-Hallum analyst Jeff Van Rhee raised the firm's target price to $120 from $115 and reiterated Buy rating. On April 29, JPMorgan analyst Sterling Auty reiterated Buy rating and set the target price at $110. On April 29, SunTrust analyst Greg Miller reiterated Buy rating and raised the target price from $108 to $117. On April 29, B. Riley FBR analyst Lee Krowl reiterated Buy rating and raised the target price from $120 to $125. On April 29, Morgan Stanley analyst Keith Weiss downgraded the company's rating to Equal Weight from Overweight and reiterated the target price of $107.At the end of the first quarter, Akamai had cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities worth $2.2 billion and total debt of $2.3 billion on its balance sheet. There are no near-term debt maturities for the company and hence no immediate need for liquidity to repay debt. The company also repurchased shares worth $81 million in the first quarter and has around $750 million remaining on our previously announced share repurchase authorization.Akamai's Web Products business is currently under pressure and the company is feeling some heat from cancellation or delay of the live sporting events. However, the company is expecting the increasing traffic in the media business to mostly offset these headwinds at least in the second quarter. I believe that Akamai stands to emerge as an overall winner in 2020 due to multiple secular tailwinds. Hence, the stock can prove to be an attractive pick for retail investors with above-average risk appetite and investment horizon of at least a year."
4335204,104722,2020-03-31T10:15:00-04:00,"The recent outbreak of COVID-19 has forced a significant portion of the global population to self-isolate at home, leading to an uptick in work-from-home and streaming activity.As a top provider of content delivery network solutions (CND) and cloud security, Akamai stands to benefit from this shift in consumer activity.Even before the coronavirus outbreak Akamai was reporting operating results above Wall Street analyst expectations, and has posted consistent GAAP & Non-GAAP net income and EBITDA.The company's market position has gone largely unnoticed by investors as shares have not seen the meteoric gains of similar beneficiaries Zoom (ZM) and Slack (WORK), or speculative beneficiaries such as Blue Apron (APRN) or Waitr Holdings (WTRH).Akamai seems to be a diamond in the rough among the debris of the COVID-19 selloff.","Data by YChartsIn my view, Akamai Technologies (AKAM) is the one of the best kept secret of the current COVID-19 stricken stock market. In a time when hundreds of millions have shifted to working from home and streaming has become so overwhelmed by demand that Netflix (NFLX) has been ordered to reduce video qualities, you may be surprised to hear that a company that facilitates both of these functions has traded down from recent highs along with the broader market. Consumers have flocked to beneficiaries of increased video streaming like Zoom (ZM) despite the company trading at an EV-to-revenue multiple of over 50x, and speculative food-delivery plays like Blue Apron (APRN) despite the company being in a highly distressed state and having a very troubling cash burn, but thus far Akamai has been seemingly snubbed despite its strong financial position and its strength in the cloud security and CDN industries. As a proponent of overall market efficiency, I do not believe this trend can continue for long. I am of the believe that Akamai is poised for a significant upside correction by the time it discloses 1Q20 earnings, and as of now, it is one of the few long positions that I feel comfortable initiating despite the extended market uncertainty.Image SourceAkamai is a leading cloud and content delivery network provider that offers a suite of solutions for businesses needing top-of-class cloud security and particularly those that require over-the-top (""OTT"") content delivery capabilities. Their customers are in industries including video streaming, software as a service (""SaaS""), mobile/on-demand gaming, and major federal government agencies. The company lists several notable customers in the following excerpt from their most recent 10-k filing:Akamai extrapolates the details of its operating results into geography, business-unit, activity-type, and core-internet platform customers. The company defines operating geography as US and Rest of World, operating activities as Media and Carrier and Web, and business units as CDN & Other and Cloud Security Solutions. As previously mentioned, management breaks-out core ""Internet Platform"" customers which they define as their six largest customers and the total sales attributable to these relationships.The company is headquartered out of Cambridge, MA and has been led by CEO Frank Thomas Leighton since 2013.Source: TIKR Terminal (Underlying data provided by S&P Capital IQ)Akamai is a business which has consistently operated as a net profit positive enterprise, with FY19 margins posting the strongest numbers since 2015. Additionally, free cash flow margins have also been relatively between 12-16% when adjusted for new debt and equity capital raises. Unlike some of the other high-flying beneficiaries of the COVID-19 selloff, Akamai offers investors a stable business model that is able to turn a profit, rather than relying on leverage to purchase sales growth. (For a nominal view of the company's GAAP balance sheet, see below)Source: Author Model, Data From Company 10-K & 10-Q filingsAdditionally, Akamai reports several Non-GAAP figures including Non-GAAP operating & net incomes. These figures represent what the company views as a more pure version of their operating results that adds back the effects of legal matters, restructuring costs, amortization, and other key charges. Historical reconciliations can be found in the snippets below:Source: Author Model, Data From Company 10-K & 10-Q filings, and Investor Relations Non-GAAP ReconciliationsAdjusted, Akamai is posting over $4.25 earnings per share vs $2.90 on a GAAP basis. From an EBITDA standpoint, the company has posted $1.2 billion up approximately 20% y/y. This reliable stream of operating profits means that the company's balance sheets are not being strained by any leverage beyond that of which the company's management deems appropriate for their road map (See below). Source: Author Model, Data From Company 10-K & 10-Q filingsAt the time of writing, Akamai is reporting cash & short-term investments of over $1.5 billion against long-term debt of just $2.53 billion (in senior notes and capital lease obligation).Source: Guidance From Investor RelationsThe table above has been taken from the company's investor relations page in a document detailing forward looking guidance. Although these expectations set by management of the business are reasonably aligned with historical results, many analysts feel these figures are overly conservative. In a note dated February 11th, 2020, Credit Suisse Analyst, Brad Zelnick noted ""(The firm) expect(s) full year guidance will prove conservative given the increase in capex guidance and commentary indicating rational pricing."" This is a sentiment that I generally agree with, and given the current market conditions, and macro environment, I believe there could be a justified catalyst for fairly significant out-performance. For my estimates (assuming 15% and 2% growth in Cloud Security and CDN respectively, while backing out the $6 million in non-recurring event specific revenues from 4Q20) see the snippets from my model below:Source: Author's Proprietary ModelThe key driver of deviation from my estimates vs consensus and guidance is the current transition of work from home and high demand for CDNs and OTT content leading sales to grow on aggregate 9% y/y FY20 vs estimates of 7%. This might not sound like a huge deviation, but given the company's strong margins flowing directly into free cash flow, and current rates leading to a low cost of equity, this makes for significant upside potential in my valuation.My valuation is based on a discounted cash flow (or ""DCF"") analysis. This valuation methodology examines the company's expected future free cash flow to firm and the weighted average cost of capital (""WACC"" or opportunity cost). A price objective is derived by summing the future cash flows discounted by the WACC to estimate the company's terminal enterprise value (or value of all capital invested). From here, the analyst is able to back into equity value per share by subtracting debt & preferred shares, and adding back the company's cash balance, before dividing the result by diluted shares outstanding. This is one of the more conservative methods of equity valuation, but given the company's relatively low rate of sales growth, sustained trend of free cash flow generation, and the volatility of current markets making it difficult to spread forward comparable multiples (or ""Comps""), it is my preferred method for evaluating Akamai.Source: TIKR Terminal, Akamai Investor Relations, Author EstimatesThe tables above show the inputs I used in finding cost of equity, cost of debt, and ultimately WACC. This is one of the most beneficial components of the company's strong valuation. Interest rates are currently near record lows on US government debt (used as the benchmark for risk-free asset returns), thus driving the cost of capital down. Additionally, Akamai is not a volatile security by any measure, thus its Beta coefficient (a measure of covariance with the market against the variance of the market, used to define a line of central tendency in linear regression of price activity) of less than 0.5 also drives down the capital cost. The result is a WACC of 3.72% meaning a very low discount rate for the future cash flows in my projection. For those curious as to how changes in cost of debt and cost of equity would impact the discount rate, you will find a sensitivity table adjacent to my projections.Source: Author's Proprietary ModelAbove you will find my projected unlevered free cash flow to firm, and a corresponding present value when discounted to the aforementioned WACC. The final figure in the bottom right-hand corner is the firm's terminal cash flow based on an 8x EBITDA multiple. A summation of these outputs and the corresponding calculations to reach a fair valuation can be found below: Source: Author's Proprietary ModelThe penultimate output of my model can be found in the tables above. A fair value per share of $113 is implied by the discounted cash flow model and my previously discussed estimated future operating results. The adjacent sensitivity table describes the various potential prices investors could expect based on changes in WACC and terminal EBITDA multiple. An implied bearish grey-sky scenario of $93 and a bullish blue-sky $133 per share represent the two extremes in the various hypothetical scenarios the table details. At the time of writing, my base price objective of $113 represents around 20% upside potential, making this a very attractive investment in a down market.In my view, the biggest risk described in the company's 10-K is the risk of aggressive competitor pricing and internal development leading to a loss in core customer accounts. Internal research and development have cost Akamai key customers in the past, in fact Netflix (NFLX) was previously a key customer of Akamai technologies a decade ago. In the scenario we see customers abandon the platform, we could see unexpected strain on net & EBITDA margins, and future thus cash flows which would somewhat undermine the integrity of the discounted cash flow valuation. That being said, I view this outcome as unlikely given the current economic and market conditions.Companies are currently looking to cut costs and of the two of the first places they are looking to are variable costs like R&D and advertising. It is unlikely a company will want to expend significant R&D expenditures into building an in-house replacement for Akamai during this time of crisis. Additionally, I do not view it likely that customers will be interested into entering into commitments with cheaper competitors that do not have as strong a financial position. In uncertain times, management teams will be wary of potential service providers that could go out of business or discontinue support of some of their product suite. This would leave a potential client in a precarious position and the subsequent expense could ultimately prove more costly than partnering with the higher priced, but more stable alternative.Akamai is a well-positioned company that will certainly prove to be a trusted partner to companies undergoing remote a transition to combat COVID-19. Even without these tailwinds, the company is in a strong financial position and deserves more attention from the market that it currently receives. I am initiating coverage of Akamai technologies going forward and I am assigning an initial price objective of $113 dollars with a 12-month time-horizon. My sentiment on the company is very bullish, and I will keep you updated as the company reports operating results in the coming months."

It is time to get on board.","Akamai Technologies, Inc. (AKAM) is another cloud company breaking out to a new 52-week high. In my last article entitled ""Akamai: Not A Compelling Investment Opportunity,"" I was not excited about this company and gave it a Neutral rating. But now I see signs of life and a bullish market environment in 2020.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)Akamai's legacy CDN business should improve this year, given the 2020 summer Olympics, the presidential election and the abundance of new video streaming services provided by the likes of The Walt Disney Company (DIS) and Apple Inc. (AAPL). The traffic benefits, at least from the Olympics and the election, will be shorter-term, not persisting beyond November of this year. And the new streaming services may, in fact, build their own CDNs eventually, just like Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) did a few years back.This company should have good short-term performance, but the longer term hold promise as well. Akamai is well-positioned to profit from the emergence of 5G technology and IoT, and the company's move into cybersecurity appears to be a smart one.Despite the anemic growth seen in recent years and failure to meet the Rule of 40, I believe that Akamai holds some promise going forward. And it doesn't hurt that the stock price is showing signs of life. For these reasons, I am modifying my rating from Neutral to Bullish.When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the software company ""Rule of 40"" and relative valuation, a concept that I recently developed that compares forward sales multiple versus estimated sales growth.Note that while Akamai is technically an IT Services company, its gross margin is north of 75%. The average IT Services company has gross margin of under 40%. That and its move into cybersecurity makes me analyze Akamai as one would analyze a software company.Akamai's annual sales growth rate is 6.6%. This anemic growth is due to the relatively mature legacy CDN products, along with the shrinking market for large enterprises as they build out their own CDNs or switch to competing services.(Source: Portfolio123)(Source: Akamai 2018 Analyst Day)As I stated earlier, I expect that 2020 will be an above-normal year for Akamai due to the traffic generation expected from the summer Olympics, presidential election and various new streaming video services. Longer term, I expect the CDN network to be stimulated by 5G, smart cities and IoT. In addition, Akamai's cybersecurity portfolio will start to contribute an ever-larger portion of revenue growth. Therefore, I expect that revenue growth of 6.6% probably represents a minimum growth level for the next several years.Akamai's free cash flow margin TTM is a relatively healthy 18.2%.(Source: Portfolio123)One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40 - some analysts use EBITDA and others use free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin TTM.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the SaaS company has growth and cash flow in balance and is considered financially healthy. In Akamai's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 6.6% + 18.2% = 24.8%The calculation comes out substantially lower than 40%. In this case, I like to ascertain that the company is not burning an excessive amount of cash.One method of ascertaining cash burn is to examine the SG&A expense margin. Note: In the chart below, the SG&A expense margin has R&D expenses included.(Source: Portfolio123)The SG&A expense margin is 42.5%, quite a reasonable figure and very competitive in the world of digital transformation stocks. My conclusion is that Akamai is not burning cash, at least not the way that some software companies are.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated Y-o-Y sales growth for the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated Y-o-Y sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Akamai is slightly above the best-fit line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is mildly higher than its peers', given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that Akamai is very slightly overvalued relative to the typical stock in my digital transformation universe, but not enough for concern.While software stock valuations have come down in recent months, they are still considered high on a historical basis. Uncertainties, such as rising tension in the Middle East, trade disputes and President Trump's impeachment, could cause a market downturn. Software stocks tend to get hit hard during any market turbulence.I view cybersecurity as the path for Akamai's future success. Cybersecurity is a very competitive market, and there is always a risk that competitors could take market share away from the company.Akamai was the original creator of the CDN industry and is still the market leader. While this industry is somewhat stagnant, with the large enterprise market shrinking, I see optimism for 2020. The summer Olympics, presidential election and new third-party initiatives in video streaming services will cause a fairly significant increase in traffic this year and will bolster Akamai's bottom line. The company will also benefit from emerging technologies such as 5G, smart cities and IoT.Akamai's move into cybersecurity will contribute to revenue growth, making this a more attractive longer-term investment. While the current level of revenue growth is somewhat anemic, I am optimistic that this is a low point and will soon be higher. The company fails the Rule of 40, primarily due to the low revenue growth, which should be higher in the coming years. It isn't burning cash, at least anywhere near the level that other software companies are.When making an investment, one has to weigh the pros and cons. In the case of Akamai, I believe that the pros outweigh the cons. It is not a high-growth company, so I can't say that it is a favorite of mine, but there is sufficient reason to raise my rating from Neutral to Bullish. The stock breakout doesn't hurt in this decision."

Yes. Their scale and distribution is something a cloud provider would love to integrate into their systems.","I wanted to love Akamai (AKAM) when I started researching the company, I really did. But as I thought about the prospects more and more, I remembered a quote I read from Warren Buffett:Thinking back to that quote, and looking at Akamai's future prospects in a super competitive landscape a sour taste formed in my mouth. While that sour taste doesn't make me a bear on the stock, it certainly makes me want to invest my capital elsewhere.Still, I would like to present my bull and bear case for this company, as well as where I think it will end up, likely acquired within the next five years.Data by YChartsAkamai is a $16B technology company which, in the fewest possible words, helps keep the web running smoothly.In a few more words, the company uses their globally-distributed Akamai Intelligent Edge Platform to protect their customers from malicious attacks, route traffic in efficient ways, and deliver media (like the TV you stream) to customers in a manner that doesn't leave them ripping their hair out. Their platform is deployed around the world with more than 200,000 servers in more than 130 countries (Per 10K - PDF) and within 1,700 unique networks. Such deployment affords them a unique insight into how the world's internet is operating at that point-in-time, allowing them to assist customers in navigating the complexity.Image: Akamai's global distribution of delivery nodesBusiness has been good for Akamai too. Utilizing their scale to their advantage, Akamai continues to put up impressive top-line growth and has impressed the markets by beating on all of their earnings reports this year.Let's assume my introduction to this article did not exist, and allow me to lay out the ground work here for my bull case.My bull case, in its simplest form, is that the world is moving online, and that's where Akamai is. I see four catalysts over the next decade which Akamai, if it were to continue its success, would hope to be in the thick of:OTT GrowthWith streaming services continuing to pop up and people continuing to cut-the-cord, OTT really is the future. Akamai is well positioned for this future and has a variety of offerings that will help whether it's the first season of a hit new show, or live sports.The company's wide distribution of servers means that, according to marketing materials, ""your content [is] one network hop away from more than 90% of the world's Internet users."" This means less lag, and more consistent streams for companies who use Akamai's content delivery network (CDN) to distribute content.How big is the market? Huge. Just using Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) as an example, they eat up 15% of the world's downstream traffic. Throw on top Disney+, HBO, YouTube TV, Sling, and the whole consortium of programming either online, or moving there, and you've got yourself a whole lot of content to deliver.Remote WorkIt should come as no surprise that people want to work remotely. It also should come as no surprise that remote work is taking off, with 159% growth since 2005.With all these new people online Akamai helps enterprises out in a variety of ways. Their Enterprise Application Access tool competes with Citrix (CTXS) or Okta (OKTA) to centralize security and access control. These types of tools allow companies to put all of the applications an employee might need in one place, with a single, controllable login.Alongside that, Akamai has their Zero Trust Security solution to help ensure that only those who should be allowed to access information are accessing that information. Again, another tool that helps employers, and will only become more necessary as the world moves towards remote work.IoT GrowthThe Internet of Things is also taking off. With everything from your watch to your toaster now needing an internet connection, enterprises need to ensure they're protected.Built on the Akamai Intelligent Platform, Kona DDoS Defender is a tool that enterprises will want to ensure they have access to in the years ahead. The tool helps mitigate and defend against DDoS attacks (large amounts of traffic going to one place), which is something that one third of companies in the US experience.CybersecurityIn much the same breath as DDoS attacks, cybersecurity in general is becoming a bigger need by the day. All the products I have mentioned so far in this article, and more, are provided by Akamai to help mitigate risk in a less secure world.Kona site defender can prevent DDoS attacks, SQL injection (the most common attack), cross-site scripting (XSS) and more. With the scope of their network, Akamai also monitors traffic and can block malicious actors before they even make it to a client's site.Other tools, such as Enterprise Threat Detector can be used to tackle internal attack vectors. You know, you're only as secure as your least secure employee, right?Data by YChartsWith the aforementioned areas of growth, it's no wonder why so many are bullish on a company like Akamai. I was too. The company showed strength in the areas we covered above throughout 2019. Growth in security was 29%, which led to EPS growth of ~17% YoY. Not too shabby.When compared to competitors (similar, not high growth like PANW/OKTA) Akamai looks good too:At 19x forward P/E Akamai is trading below their 10-year FPE average of 21x and way below their 10-year average P/E of ~34.The average analyst EPS estimate for FY20 is $4.78 (~8% growth YoY), which gives us a base PT of $100.38. The more bullish case of $4.96 would give us a PT of $104.16, or ~10% growth over today's price.Even with these highly conservative numbers, especially for tech infrastructure / cybersecurity, Akamai appears to offer some value to buyers over the next 12 months. More bullish cases would point also towards increasing margins, which could give the stock an even bigger jolt, especially as events like the 2020 Olympics will boost streaming worldwide requiring CDNs to deliver content.The Buffett quote to open this article likely gives you an idea. Akamai plays in an incredibly tough market. New companies enter daily, and I believe that their core, content delivery, may one day be commoditized away by the big players (Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure).If AWS and Azure commoditizing things isn't enough, content delivery is so key to some businesses that they may decide to take things in house. Netflix did just this several years ago with their Open Connect program. Companies that rely on delivering content to their customers in an efficient manner may, like Netflix, elect to take control themselves. Others may elect for the cheaper options like AWS Cloudfront, Azure's CDN, Cloudflare, Google Cloud CDN, or any number of other providers.One surefire way to beat out competition is to simply be the best in the industry, and Akamai is doing that today. They have the largest most distributed network which is why bulls continue to pile in. The battle will, as always in this space, be with ever evolving technology. Can Akamai stand up to the biggest companies in the world, even the ISPs themselves, and continue to lead the way in CDNs? Sure. Can they do it in a way that helps me sleep safe at night knowing my money is growing? Not really. Massive competition, an ever-changing market, new entrants seemingly daily, and their core competency will suffer from commoditization.In fact, I see Akamai as an acquisition target within the next five years, perhaps when things stagnate a little. A company like Microsoft is the most likely suitor. Someone who would love to grow their CDN and cloud offerings. The two companies are already engaged in a partnership, to share Akamai's CDN offerings with Azure users. A fuller experience, bringing all of this technology and infrastructure in house at Microsoft does not seem out of the question.Akamai's future looks bright, for now. Their core market is ripe for commoditization, and they'll likely start to face those headwinds within the next five years. If things go well, they will be acquired, or merge with another infrastructure provider.My bullish price target for 2020 is $104.16, representing a 10% upside over the next year. As a long-term buy and hold investor, Akamai does not suit my portfolio, but I see no reason to fault holders of the company today."

With over 300,000 servers spanning 130 countries, 4,000 PoPs (Points of Presence), and 1,500 networks, it is one of the most expansive edge networks available to modern businesses looking to have their content and data delivered rapidly and securely to users across the world. It hosts content and applications for more than half of all Fortune 500 companies, and its clients straddle multiple industries, ranging from banking to retail to gaming to advertising and more.Thesis: As a segment leader in a fragmented market and boasting a vast physical presence, Akamai offers long-term value due to its current growth metrics, strong financial position, and a positive outlook for the edge computing services market.In spite of heavy competition from newer, niche players, Akamai continues to dominate the content delivery space in several areas. As of Q2-20, it commanded over 87% of the media delivery solutions market and over 81% of the service support solutions market. In terms of total segment market share, Akamai holds a 4.5% share of the overall content optimization, delivery, and security market.As a pioneer in edge computing and serverless technologies, Akamai boasts the largest programmable edge in the world - the Akamai Intelligent Edge Platform - with enviable related IP: roughly 20% of the company's 400+ patents cover innovations in edge computing. In addition, revenues of $2 billion were generated from edge computing solutions for the 12 months ending June 30, 2020, per a company blog post. Its edge computing solutions span a range of use cases in cutting-edge technologies, as shown in the table below:Source: Akamai BlogWith its expansive fingers in so many future-friendly pies, Akamai is well positioned to keep growing over the next several years. That brings us to recent growth trends and indicators for future growth.Despite being a leader in several segments within content delivery and application hosting, the company has managed to keep showing straight-line revenue growth over the past several years. Over the last decade, the company has nearly doubled its revenues even though smaller competitors like Fastly (FSLY) have been growing aggressively during that time.In Q2-20, Akamai's revenues grew by 12.7% to nearly $800 million over Q2-19. For H1-20, the revenue growth rate stands at over 10% over the prior period. On a TTM basis, revenues grew 8.8% between June 2019 and June 2020. This shows increasingly strong growth in spite of fast-growing competitors.Source: Seeking Alpha ChartingAt the bottom line, the company has been showing impressive growth for its scale and size. Although TTM earnings growth was relatively flat until mid-2018, since then, it's grown by more than 150%. In the past three years, the stock price has more than doubled, indicating strong price return momentum. Despite this, and the fact that the company is posting +20% net income margins as the bulk of its competitors continue to post net losses, the stock is still trading at forward non-GAAP earnings ratio of around 22, which is well below the sector median of around 27.In the short term, the company expects Q3-20 revenues of $760 million to $785 million, or 7% to 11% over the prior period on a constant-currency basis. Diluted non-GAAP EPS is forecasted at $1.20 to $1.24, representing a growth rate of between 8% and 12% over the prior period on a constant-currency basis.For FY-20, the company has guided for revenues of $3.125 billion to $3.175 billion, which includes $1 billion in revenues from the Cloud Security Solutions unit. The segment brought in revenues of $499.6 million for H1-20, representing a 26.5% increase over the prior period's revenues of $394.9 million. The growth was primarily driven by elevated media traffic volumes due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and we should be able to see some sustained gains during the back half of the year.These growth estimates are quite conservative. The security business, in particular, is something to be watched as the business world shifts to the work-from-home model. With most companies adopting this model for the long term, for at least part of their workforce, the need for security will keep growing as edge usage keeps growing.Source: DoubleVerify via ForbesIn addition, media consumption is at an all-time high. The key drivers of that growth are not just pandemic-related but also the sheer body of content that's being published, uploaded or streamed on a daily basis across news media sites, social media platforms, streaming portals, online gaming sites, advertising networks, etc.Akamai's expansive presence around the world makes it an easy choice for content producers and other companies that deliver content in terabytes and petabytes. Today's buzz-phrase is ""user experience"", and that's the broader market Akamai addresses with its products.From a financial standpoint, Akamai looks to be in good shape. Current ratio as of Q2-20 was around 3.34, and its cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities give the company adequate liquidity to address its capex, IT investment, acquisition and other requirements, as well as keep servicing its debt obligations, which primarily comprise convertible notes due in 2025 and 2027. Akamai had long-term debt commitments of around $1.9 million as at June 30, 2020, with a relatively conservative debt to equity ratio of about 0.48.I consider Akamai to be a relatively stable investment in edge computing because of the fundamentals as well as the long-term prospects for the edge computing market as a whole. The market is expected to grow at much faster rates moving forward:Specific to Akamai, there's near-double to double-digit growth expected at the top for this year, while margins are healthy and earnings over the past few years have been growing at double-digit rates. As the world moves toward greater automation and the number of edge devices exponentially increases over the next decade and beyond, companies like Akamai stand to make significant top-line gains. The company already has achieved economies of scale, which is showing up at the bottom line. Moreover, Akamai continues to invest heavily in capex (22% to 23% of FY-20 revenues) and R&D (13% to 14% of revenues.) This is one of the things that will keep it relevant in the years ahead.In terms of valuation, we've already seen that the stock is trading at a discount to the sector median. This indicates some hidden upside that the market hasn't yet priced into the stock. Analysts on WSJ have a 12-month median price target of $126.50, representing a 12% upside as of this writing. As such, there's definitely a lot of long-term value in this stock at the current price."
4356593,104952,2020-07-01T13:58:48-04:00,"Akamai should expect a continuing increase in demand in its CDN and cloud security businesses until the rest of the year, driven by increase in network traffic.We believe that the pandemic has changed customer behavior to some extent, in which more people will still opt to spend less time outdoors even without shelter-in-place orders.Pandemic-impacted commerce and retail customers drive 16% of the business, but we expect most of them to start investing more in online initiatives, benefiting Akamai.","We believe that Akamai's (AKAM) CDN and cloud security businesses should continue to benefit from the increase in network traffic, driven by the shelter-in-place and increasing preference for in-home activities even upon lifting of restrictions. The company withdrew the full-year guidance nonetheless, err on the side of being conservative, considering the pandemic impact on its commerce and retail customers, which make up ~16% of the business. However, we think that Akamai is in a strong position to more than offset the negative impact. Following a strong Q1, we expect that offline-to-online budget shifts in some retail and commerce customers as well as multi-product adoption in the cloud security business to drive growth and expand margins in Q2 and beyond.As the shelter-in-place, as well as the new normal behaviors, persists, we think that Akamai can drive growth and expand margins in two ways. First, OTT streaming and gaming activities will continue driving the adoptions for CDN and cloud security offerings at a lowered marketing spend. Furthermore, with that in mind, the multi-product adoption uptrend within the cloud security should also continue subsequently, driving larger deal sizes at lower customer acquisition costs.(Source: Akamai's 10-Q)Q1 2020 was not an ordinary quarter for Akamai, as it was able to deliver growth expectations without having to incur extra marketing costs. In Q1, Akamai saw an almost 200 bps decline in S&M as a percentage of revenue, indicating that Akamai can sustain its growth without relying on costly marketing events. Marketing programs and related costs dropped the most by ~37% YoY, as we understand that most of them got cancelled or postponed due to the pandemic. Nonetheless, Akamai still beat the guidance as revenue grew by +8%, with the cloud security business driving much of that with 28% growth.(Source: comscore.com)The growth was also due to the increasing demand for CDN offerings, which many media services companies use to improve the network performance amid the surge in streaming usage. Given that more people are staying indoors due to the shelter-in-place direction globally, OTT streaming usage increased by 20% - 47% across the board, based on Comscore's data.As Akamai is guiding Q2 revenue in the range of $752 million - $778 million, or up 6% - 12% YoY, we believe that Akamai will likely still see sustained growth even beyond Q2. In particular, we feel that the pandemic has changed consumer behavior more structurally, in that people will still choose to spend less time outdoors even after shelter-in-place order is lifted. Furthermore, we think that Akamai's commerce and retail customers may also consider investing more in online initiatives, as offline traffic will not fully recover anytime soon. Commerce and retail customers make up 16% of revenue, and considering Akamai's $2.89 billion of revenue last year, it means they will offset the full-year revenue by +$460 million in the worst case.(Increase in malware threat drives demand for cloud security. for source: Akamai)But as the online shift gets underway, we believe that Akamai is in a good position to indirectly reduce that 16% to ~14% in the near term, most likely through increasing CDN adoptions. We have seen some early macro trends in June, as Microsoft (MSFT) recently announced closing all of its retail stores, while online players like Amazon (AMZN) even investing further in live TV programs, which should drive the overall demand for CDN. Moreover, Akamai will then benefit from the cloud security adoption that typically moves in lockstep with increasing demand in CDN. In Q1, we have seen how the multi-product sales increased by 29%, effectively driving higher deal size and margin expansion.Given that Akamai is well-insulated from the effect of the pandemic, we cannot identify too many key risk factors in the business, aside from the increasing competition from Fastly (FSLY) or Cloudflare (NET), which should benefit from the overall market demand for CDN as well. (Akamai's EPS. source: seeking alpha)Akamai reached an all-time-high at ~$107 per share very recently, but it will likely reach new highs going forward. From a forward-looking perspective, valuation should also be more attractive. While current P/E has slightly increased to +34x, EPS guidance is conservative. In Q2 alone, Akamai will expect 14% - 20% EPS growth. As we expect the catalysts to improve bottom-line further, full-year EPS can reach the FY 2021 EPS target of 5.4, a year ahead of the expectation. It represents ~84% EPS growth, which is plausible considering Akamai's EPS has already been accelerating over the last two years from 40% to 65%, even without as many catalysts. At the expected forward P/E of ~22, we set a conservative price target of ~$118 per share, and maintain an overweight rating on the stock."
4315740,104012,2020-01-08T09:25:56-05:00,"Akamai Technologies stock has moved up by more than 40% this year.In CDN industry the company is a clear market leader, companies like Amazon and Cloudflare have come up. In web security CrowdStrike and Imperva are seeing impressive growth.In the coming years, we expect that the introduction of 5G will lead to more web traffic and the demand for security and CDN services.","Akamai Technologies (AKAM) stock has moved up by more than 40% this year. It has outperformed the overall US stock market as measured by the main averages like Dow, S&P, and Nasdaq. The company's overall growth is expected to slow in the coming year. In this article, we will explain why it makes sense to invest in the company. First, we will explain the company's moat in the CDN and security industry. We will explain how its security services differ from those offered by other companies. Further, we will explain how the rise of 5G will lead to more demand. Finally, we will show that the company is reasonably valued.Akamai Technologies recently celebrated its 20 years as a public company. The company's stock price reached a peak of $328 during the dot com bubble. It then crashed to less than $3 in 2002 and then started moving upwards. As of this writing, the company's stock is trading at $85. It has gained by more than 240% in the past decade.The reasons for this are clear. Internet traffic has risen significantly. This was driven by the mass adoption of video and other multimedia products. At the same time, online vulnerabilities increased. Reports suggest that hackers steal more than $45 billion every year.This macro theme has had positive impacts on Akamai, a company that provides cybersecurity and content delivery technologies to companies. This has seen the company be the trusted provider of security and CDN services to the top ten banks in the United States and Europe. It is also trusted by large companies like Electronic Arts (EA), eBay (EBAY), PayPal (PYPL), and Sony among others. The company achieves this partly because of its strong network of servers, which are found in 4,000 locations, 1,000 cities, and 137 countries.At the same time, competition has been increasing. On CDN, while the company is a clear market leader, other companies like Amazon (AMZN) and Cloudflare (NET) have come up. The same is true when you look at the web security industry, where companies like CrowdStrike (OTC:CRWD) and Imperva (NASDAQ:IMPV) are seeing impressive growth.This has led to Akamai's growth to stagnate. In the most recent quarter, Akamai's revenue grew by 7% to $710 million. Growth has been declining from a high of 25% in 2015 to 7% in the most recent quarter. The same is true when you look at the company's annual revenue. In 2018, the company had more than $2.71 billion in revenue. In 2017, the company had a comprehensive revenue of more than $2.8 billion. In 2009, it had a total revenue of less than $1 billion. This is incredible growth. The market expects the revenue to reach $2.86 billion in 2019 and $3.1 billion and $3.29 billion in 2020 and 2021 respectively. In other words, Akamai will not continue to grow as it used to do in the past.Many analysts bearish on the company have argued that increasing competition means that the company may find itself having challenges competing. There could be some truth on that. Also, it is true to say that Akamai is not a growth story as its peers like Cloudflare and Fastly (FSLY) are. However, a case for investing in Akamai can be made when you consider the moat it has in the industry.Multiple reports by Gartner (IT) show that Akamai is the market leader in a number of products. For example, a recent report identified Akamai as a leader in web application firewalls for the third year in a row. The company was also identified as a leader in Forrester's (FORR) Forrester Wave report. The company was also listed as a leader by IDC on its Marketscape Worldwide CDN report.This recognition, coupled with Akamai's products, has made the company attract some of the biggest companies as customers. In the coming years, we expect that the introduction of 5G will lead to more web traffic and the demand for security and CDN services. As such, while Akamai's days of being a growth story are behind it, we expect that it will continue to be an essential cash flow generator. In the trailing twelve months, Akamai had FCF of more than $516 million, and the company has said that it will increase this FCF. This is also supported by the fact that Akamai has been expanding its margins. Its quarterly EBITDA margin has grown from 20% in 2018 to 36.77%. The company has said that it expects these margins to increase.There are other moat-related factors that will play into Akamai's advantage. For example, the company deals with enterprise customers, who have committed themselves for multiple years. CDN and security solutions are not easily replaceable. This means that the company will continue being a good FCF generator even as the overall growth slows. In addition, even if there is a recession, a company like Akamai that provides core solutions will not be easy to replace.As mentioned, the overall revenue is slowing down. However, the company continues to have its key segments like security continue to grow. In the last quarter, the security segment grew by 29% to $216 million. Part of the reason for this is that the company is partnering with carriers, who are then bundling the security features to small and medium companies.Akamai Technologies has a market valuation of more than $13 billion. Even when the revenue is not growing as fast, we don't believe that the company's valuation is ridiculous. First, the company is set to cross the $3 billion revenue mark in 2020. This means that it is trading at 4x its 2020 revenue. This is not high when you consider that companies like Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and Fortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) are trading more than 6x their 2020 revenue. The same is seen when you consider the forward EV to EBITDA ratios and the forward EV to EBITDA as shown below.Source: YChartsAkamai is also working to reward its shareholders. While the company does not pay dividends, it has rewarded shareholders by continuing repurchasing its own shares. In the recent quarter, it purchased shares worth more than $176 million. This is part of an $800 million repurchase plan. All this has led to a significant decline in outstanding shares. They have declined from more than 188 million in 2012 to 161 million.Akamai Technologies is a market leader in cloud security and other management industries. While the company's growth is slowing, the company has a moat that is a major pillar of its operations. It will continue to improve its margins and increase its cash flows. Also, it will continue to attract more large international customers even if there is a broad global slowdown. Finally, as we have shown, the company's valuation appears to be reasonable."
4313222,104888,2019-12-18T16:01:12-05:00,Akamai saw a 3Q beat and raise.Cloud security remains its fastest growing area.OTT pipeline is rich with other services like HBO Max launching their streaming services in 2020. U.S. elections should also boost viewership.Operating margin still expanding.Stock trades at a historically low valuation.,"I was positive about Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) back in June because it was a name that benefited from cloud security demand and improving operating margins. After 3Q's beat and raise, much of that still holds true. The stock has also steadily traded higher since then, but recently, there has been a pullback, which I believe is a buying opportunity as its OTT pipeline in 2020 should continue to be rich.Data by YChartsAkamai reported 3Q19 revenue of $709.9m, which was higher than Street's $701m. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.10 also handily beat Street's $1.00.Security division driving the upsideRevenue for security achieved $216 million, up 29% yoy in constant currency. Bot manager and its enterprise security solutions continue to lead the way in Q3, with revenue growing by more than 50% yoy.Not limited to selling its enterprise security services directly to major corporations, Akamai is also now equipping its carrier partners with services that they can sell to SMEs to defend against malware and bot attacks by embedding its technology in the carrier products such as the recently released Comcast Business Security Edge. A much larger number of enterprise customers, large or small, can now be reached efficiently. This helped drive growth in the web division, which delivered a revenue of $390 million in Q3, up 10% yoy in constant currency.Traffic remained robust in the summer lullTypically, the summer is seasonally softer in traffic without any major events, but this year traffic has been robust even in regions like Europe where it is usually light. According to the color provided by the management, traffic has been strong across all businesses, including OTT, gaming and software downloads.Akamai grew traffic in Q3 faster than the published growth rates for the Internet as a whole, which hints at traffic share gains. The company set a new record for peak traffic on October 15th when it delivered 106 terabits per second, 66% larger than the peak in 18Q3. This is solid evidence of the enormous capacity of the Akamai Edge platform.Media and carrier division softMedia and carrier revenue reached $319.7m, which increased 2.2% yoy, slightly missing Street estimates of 2.5% yoy growth. The reason behind the letdown might have been that it faced tough comparisons for media revenue last year, which was really strong. In addition, there have been consolidations in the media industry which saw a few extraordinarily large renewals with Akamai that were priced lower than expected.Both Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are launching their OTT streaming in 4Q19. I believe other services like HBO could follow suit with their OTT streaming. HBO Max is slated to launch in May 2020, which will be marketed with AT&T (NYSE:T). According to AT&T, the target audience is about 50M U.S. subscribers by 2025 and to expand into Europe and Latin America in 2021. Global subscriber targets are for 75-90M by 2025.I expect Akamai's high-quality CDN services to be the key factor in driving its forward success. Akamai has both U.S. and international presence.U.S. elections should also boost viewership in 2020.Operating margins continue to expandIn 3Q, operating margins reached 29.3% driven by lower R&D and sales & marketing expenses. The FY20 target is 30%, which I believe is easily achievable.Akamai's stock is trading about 18x forward earnings, which is one standard deviation below its mean of about 21x. I think current levels are attractive to have a long position for a high single-digit revenue and EPS growth company.Source: Bloomberg"
4312369,20599,2019-12-13T11:03:28-05:00,Stellar 2019 performance for Akamai - 60% up this year.Stiff competition threatens to spoil the party.Rising wedge or running triangle - something to consider for both bulls and bears.,"Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) is a software and Internet industry services company that had a fantastic 2019 so far. Its share price rose about 60% before dropping recently. Is this the start of a healthier correction or just a pause before attempting for new highs?With services ranging from cloud and enterprise securities, web and mobile performance, media delivery, and Dev/Ops, Akamai serves various industries like financial services, hotel & travel, media and entertainment, public sector, retail & consumer goods, software, and technology.According to the company's website, it interacts with a billion devices and 100+ million IP addresses every single day only in the area of Internet security, being trusted by the top 10 banks in the United States and Europe, to name a few of its customers.Despite the unlimited potential when serving clients on the Internet, the software and services industry in this space is relatively small in size. Akamai develops platforms, networks, solutions, and services for the online businesses – as more and more businesses have an online presence, the growth potential remains elevated.Because more and more businesses move their operations to the cloud (despite the concerns about security risks, such a move results in large scale savings from outsourcing internal services), the demand for related software and services will continue to increase.The Q3 2019 earnings release shows the GAAP income from operations rising 23% when compared with Q3 2018. Net income increased as well (up 28% over the same interval) and Akamai spent almost $180 million in Q3 2019 to repurchase two million common shares at an average price of $87.55 per share – just shy of the current $84.09, but a sign of confidence for the period ahead.In one of the last Lead-Lag Reports I wrote, I was looking at how various sectors performed for the month. While November was a tough month for utilities, the technology sector did well.Akamai consolidated for the month of November, and any technical setup should consider the short- to medium-term perspective and the long-term one. Here’s how and why.The price surge during 2019 ended with a potential double top formation around $92. With the measured move already completed and threatening to break the higher lows series belonging to the previous bullish trend, it is wise waiting for the next market move.Conservative traders might want to wait for the price to break above $92 before going long, while aggressive traders might find the 50% retracement of the 2019 market swing higher a good place to buy for new highs with a stop at $58.The bigger picture paints a grim perspective. The price seemed to evolve in a rising wedge formation – a bearish pattern pointing to lower levels. In the wedge seen below, the 2019 60% move to the upside represents the piercing of the so-called 1-3 trendline of the rising wedge. Almost always, the price pierces such a trendline before reversal.If we consider the double top discussed earlier formed against dynamic resistance, the bullish case begins to shake. Therefore, there’s something for both bulls and bears here.Bulls want to see $92 taken in a sustained move. This would transform the rising wedge into a running triangle, pointing to higher prices. Bears on the other hand should pay attention to a break below the lower edge of the pattern. While the double top remains intact, a break below $58 changes the bullish narrative dramatically.Into the new decade, cloud adoption by companies all over the world is poised to rise. New concepts like hybrid-cloud or multi-cloud begin to emerge. While growth potential exists, threats from stiff competition (e.g., Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google Cloud (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Azure (NASDAQ:MSFT)) from industry leaders may affect future performance.Rising wedge or running triangle?*Like this article?

The company has shown good and stable growth, has a strong financial position and is investor-friendly. However, its main source of revenue is under threat and it is likely that growth will slow-down.Given the projected growth rates for the CDN and Cybersecurity segments of the business, we have projected revenues fro 2020 and 2021 and found the company to be fairly valued. While the company doesn’t represent an immediate value opportunity, we like the core business and would consider adding a position for the long-term.Akamai is a software development technology company that recently celebrated the 20th anniversary of its IPO. The company is most well known for developing and implementing cloud security services and applications, as well as providing CDN. (Content Delivery Network). CDN’s are used by sites and organizations with large international traffic. When you enter a site, the CDN will recognize the user’s geographical area and will use the servers closest to the user to give access to the site. (To optimize speed and efficiency) In lamens terms, the company provides the infrastructure and software to deliver content quickly and also offers online security systems.At first glance, I thought Akamai looked like a great investment. The best of both worlds, growth, and value. The company is in a growing and innovative space, both in terms of cloud computing and cybersecurity. Akamai achieved YoY growth in 2018 of 6.5% and has a CAGR of ~10%. Furthermore, the company is very profitable, boasting an EBITDA margin of 28.4%.The company is run, in a very investor-friendly way, and indeed has active investors such as Elliot Management Corp. The company holds a strong balance sheet, is responsible for costs and returned value to investors through buybacks in 2018.Indeed, we can see institutional support was strong for Akamai., but this seems to have changed.Source: WhalewisdomThe above screenshot from Whalewisdom shows that, on the whole, financial institutions have reduced their position in Akamai. So what could be behind this change in sentiment?As I mentioned above, the company and stock looked great to me at the beginning. Even at today’s high valuation of $84. However, once I got into the financial statements, I saw a very clear reason to be concerned.The company generates revenue on two main lines of business, CDN, and Cybersecurity. About 35% of revenues can be attributed to Cybersecurity, while the much larger chunk of 65% is CDN.Source: 10-QAs we can see, the larger part of the business, CDN, has shrunk in the last 3 quarters. Growth has been -1% for this segment. On the other hand, Cloud security has grown steadily at a rate of around 30%.The problem is, CDN solutions are not incredibly specialized. While Akamai has one of the largest configuration servers and networks, it has to face competition on two fronts. Firstly, it must compete with alternative solutions offered by the all.-mighty tech giants like Amazon.com Inc (AMZN). Secondly, many companies are also setting up their delivery content networks, which seems to be economically justifiable once enterprises reach a certain level.Reading through the earnings call transcript, it seems that these figures are intentionally ignored, while “high traffic growth in CDN” is cited. This traffic is either not as high as they would want to make us think, or it is simply not producing revenue.Another interesting breakdown is that of national vs international revenue growth.Source: 10-QAgain, Akamai suffers from the same problem. Its largest segment is stumped, and all of the growth is coming internationally, which is growing at a rate of around 20%. This is also a reason for concern, although we can also take away that international growth is strong, and based on the market outlook it seems it will carry on this way.Management is aware of how this will affect growth, so how do they plan to manage this? On the earnings call for Q3, CFO Ed McGowan makes it quite clear that the company plans to remain active in M&A. ChameleonX, and Exceda are just some of the latest acquisitions on the table, The first, represents a move into expanding and improving their security service, while Exceda is a sales partner in South America in the CDN space. This last merger could be seen as vertical integration.Indeed, having just raised $1.5 billion and with a strong balance sheet, this seems to be the right direction for Akamai to take.While it will be hard to quantify exactly what revenues will look like, we will give it a try.Source: Author’s Work, figures expressed in billions of dollars.The above calculation is based on the revenue figures broken down into operations. Each operation has then been given an estimated growth rate based on previous performance. Cloud security is projected to maintain a 25% growth rate, while we have assumed CDN to stay flat.Based on the projected market outlook and growth plans, I believe these to be reasonable figures on the conservative side. Given management's intentions to aggressively expand through M&A, I think the CDN segment of the business could remain flat, although it fell in 2019. Cybersecurity has grown at near 30%, so a 25% growth rate is quite conservative.Revenues of $3,12 billion would mean an EPS of almost 4,5$. Using a forward P/E of around 20 would give us a price target of $90 for 2020 and near $100 by 2021. By our calculations, Akamai is set to grow at a rate of around 8.71% in 2020 and 10,46% in 2021. With Cloud Security becoming a larger part of revenue, we can expect future overall growth to be positively impacted.According to our forecasts, Akamai is currently adequately valued and we can expect the share price to remain similar during 2020. However, the investment looks more attractive the further into the future we go. Furthermore, an argument could be made that P/E of 20 is too punitive, with a sector median of 22. Applying the latter would give us a price target in 2020 of 100$. Also, an argument could be made for a 30% growth in cybersecurity, but I like to err on the safe side.Akamai is a very solid business, with a good balance sheet, and a competitive edge in a growing market. However, most of its business is CDN is a saturated market, as is the domestic market. While the company is by no means overvalued and I expect it to keep posting solid financial results, most of the immediate growth is already factored in. I believe Akamai will deliver more value in the future as the Cloud security side of the business gains more importance. The valuation is hefty, but I like the stock right now and moving forward.If the price fell below $80 I would put some money in."

(AKAM) is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) provider with one of the world’s largest configurations consisting of 240,000 servers, 1,700 networks, 3,900 locations in 133 countries, and is responsible for up to 30% of all web traffic.The company is also making a push into the security industry by providing a defensive shield at the ‘edge’ of the CDN as shown in the figure below.(Source: Akamai 2018 Analyst Day)Although Akamai has positive free cash flow and earnings (a rarity these days for internet companies), the trailing twelve-month revenue growth of 7.6% is anemic and, in my opinion, there are better investment opportunities out there. Akamai is buying back shares and pushing margins higher as the business erodes through competition and pricing pressure. Akamai doesn’t score well on the Rule of 40 and the stock price is somewhat overvalued. For these reasons, I am giving Akamai a neutral rating.While Akamai has the largest global infrastructure, it doesn’t have the highest market share in terms of website count, primarily because they serve mostly large organizations. Akamai is fifth behind Amazon (AMZN) CloudFront, Cloudflare, jsDelivr and Fastly (FSLY).A big problem for Akamai is that they don’t have a significant economic moat. With the internet shift towards video and large file download, Akamai has been losing business from the internet giants, having determined that they could provide similar services themselves.(Source: Akamai 2018 Analyst Day)The highly competitive market for CDN is also driving down pricing. Highly disruptive companies such as Fastly are of concern along with new video streaming services such as Disney+. When Disney+ is launched in November by The Walt Disney Company (DIS), Akamai may get some of the action, but the expectation is that Disney will force down pricing for CDN services.Akamai’s main hope for growth is their security products which are expected to make their CDN service more valuable and sticky. There are two problems with this strategy. First of all, the revenues from the security products do not make a significant impact on total revenues this year. The second problem is that Akamai’s CDN competition will undoubtedly be developing their own security solutions as well, leveling the playing field.While Akamai is in a very unique position by having the largest global infrastructure, they are managing their business like an old lady. Instead of aggressively growing their TAM as other cloud players are doing, they are buying back shares and trying to expand their operating margin. While Akamai may continue growing at an ~8% pace for a few years, their business is eroding, and this isn’t an exciting opportunity for investors.(Source: Portfolio123)When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the software company ""Rule of 40"" and relative valuation, a concept that I recently developed that compares forward sales multiple versus estimated sales growth.Note that while Akamai is technically an IT Services company, their gross margin is north of 75%. The average IT Services company has a gross margin of under 40%. That and their move into cybersecurity makes me analyze Akamai as one would analyze a software company. (Source: Portfolio123)Akamai had a slightly below-average year with YoY trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue growth of 7.62%. The IT Services industry as a whole (206 companies) had revenue growth of 8.35% over the same time period. The software industry had revenue growth above 15% for the same period.Akamai's free cash flow margin TTM is 19.7%.(Source: Portfolio123)A rule of thumb often applied to software companies is the Rule of 40. This metric helps such companies balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA, and others use the free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin as I believe that it is the most meaningful factor from an investor perspective.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's revenue growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the company has balanced growth and cash flow resulting in financial health.Akamai's revenue growth for the most recent 12 months was 7.6%, while free cash flow margin for the trailing twelve months was 19.7%. Therefore:Revenue growth + FCF margin = 7.6% + 19.7% = 27.3%Since the calculation comes out lower than 40%, I conclude that Akamai has some work to do. But failing the Rule of 40 isn’t the end of the world. The company is mature and not ‘growing at any cost’ like some software companies.This is where things get interesting and somewhat controversial. It seems logical to me that high-growth companies should be valued more highly than slow-growth companies. To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value (EV)/forward sales versus estimated YoY sales growth for 77 stocks from my custom universe of digital transformation stocks.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Excel)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated YoY sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate"" also provided by Portfolio123.I use an exponential best-fit trendline as it appears to be more appropriate than a linear trendline for this application. As sales growth goes up, the valuation goes up exponentially. The trendline was calculated using MS Excel. I consider the stocks sitting above the trendline to be overvalued, while stocks lying under the trendline are undervalued.As can be seen from the chart, Akamai is sitting above the trendline, indicating that its EV/forward sales figure is overvalued relative to its peers. Keep in mind that this is a relative valuation based on a universe of digital transformation stocks, not an absolute valuation that one would attempt to calculate with a discounted cash flow model.I would like to note that Akamai’s stock price is on the verge of a breakout. But keep in mind that this stock has a repeating pattern of dropping fast in share price over the last few years, the last time just after piercing a multi-year high. I am therefore not too encouraged by this potential breakout. I believe that this stock is getting swept up in the cloud mania and I don’t see a specific reason for being bullish.(Source: Yahoo Finance)Akamai is a CDN provider with one of the world’s largest configurations of servers and networks. The company is also making a push into the security industry by providing a defensive shield at the ""edge"". Despite the obvious advantage of having one of the world's largest global infrastructures, Akamai appears to be treading water with an eroding business instead of aggressively growing its TAM. Given the expected 8% growth over the next couple of years and stock price overvaluation, I can't come up with a good reason for investing. Therefore, I have assigned this company a neutral rating.Keep an eye out for my soon-to-be-launched Digital Transformation marketplace service!"

Besides, the company controls a small stake in the market. It is the leader in the CDN space. We wonder why the company does not control a significant market share.

It is favorable that the company increased its sales and marketing expenses by 2.7%. Akamai does not need a lot of investment in marketing to report revenue growth.Value investors will most likely appreciate knowing that in the six months ended June 30, 2019, Akamai reported restructuring charges of $7 million.With that, what matters the most on this name is the company's net income increase of 128%.

The market capitalization figure is close to that of the enterprise value. Thus, we can use any of them to compare the company with Janrain. With annual revenue of $2.79 million and revenue growth of 6.89%, forward revenue of $2.98 million appears reasonable.

Shares are currently 16% below their all-time high.Akamai has two competitive edges, the number of servers it deploys and the cloud security solutions that it offers to its customers.The premium on its share price contains all the anticipated growth in the CDN and cloud security market.","Akamai's (AKAM) Q4 results are out, and the company beat expectations by 7%. Its share price jumped to $70.21, which is still 16% below its all-time high of $83.08. In this article, we are going to analyze Akamai's business, its opportunities, and if the current valuation is a good entry point or not.The CDN business is a highly competitive industry where the competitors have to invest heavily in new talent, software, and hardware to keep their networks up to date. Akamai is one of the biggest CDN providers worldwide, and it has a well-established global infrastructure which gives it an edge over its competitors. Its biggest competitors in the CDN market and its respective website count market share are:Akamai follows on rank #5 with a market share of 3.73%. The comparison of website count market share doesn't represent how much traffic goes over the respective providers. Akamai is one of the largest content delivery networks because it has more than 200k servers deployed in more than 130 countries. None of the other providers comes close to Akamai's size, which is also reflected in the amount of web-traffic that goes through its network. Akamai measured that it delivered approximately 15-30% of the world's web traffic through its CDN platform.Akamai's primary competitive advantage is its sheer size and second its cloud security solutions which are on top of the industry. The company targets large customers like Facebook (FB), Amazon, Airbnb (AIRB), Microsoft (MSFT), and many more. While Amazon and Microsoft have their content delivery networks, the sheer size of Akamai's network makes it a necessity for those big companies to work with Akamai to deliver content to customers outside their networks. In the long run, this competitive edge can be a two-sided sword for Akamai because the largest customers continue to deploy its servers if it makes sense from a business perspective. Here is a quote from Akamai's latest quarterly report:Source: Akamai Quarterly Report September 2017The biggest customers have the biggest incentive to build their own network of servers and deliver content to their customers, especially, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft which are also the three biggest cloud providers in the world. We can see this in the company's recent fourth-quarter results where revenue from internet platforms decreased by 14%, which includes customers like Netflix, Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft. Their contribution to Akamai's revenue got smaller over the years, but the point is that other large customers, who are Akamai's target, might follow.Akamai's income from its content delivery network is stagnating, and it switched its focus from content delivery to cloud security solutions which is its rapidly improving business segment. On the left side of the chart below, we can see that Media and Carrier division growth is now lower than that of its Web division which emphasizes the point that its content delivery segment is decelerating.Source: Akamai Annual & Quarterly ReportsIts cloud security offerings are on top of the business, which is the reason for the sharp acceleration in this business segment. It makes up a quarter of its total revenue with YoY growth of 35% in 2018. It is now concentrating on this business segment as it is another growing competitive edge against its competitors.Another point that I want to highlight is its international income, which makes up 38% of its total revenue. Akamai's highly distributed server structure makes it very attractive for international customers even though its price tag is relatively high compared to its competitors.Looking forward, it is leveraging its server structure to create a zero-trust architecture that would protect businesses from outside attacks. It can do this by having one of the biggest networks of servers globally. If it would improve its price transparency and customer acquisition process on its website to make its services more accessible, I am sure that it will be able to boost its revenue.Its network is its biggest asset and can be used to implement new technologies like a certain type of blockchain that would verify data transaction over its network in a very secure way.Source: codeinwp.comAfter researching for content delivery networks, I found various rankings that list providers depending on the needs of customers. I found out these needs are mostly associated with small businesses or WordPress websites that want quick access to the service. If you solely go after these rankings, Akamai is often listed at the bottom of these rankings or not at all. Only when people research a little further, one sees that Akamai's large scale network exceeds those of its competitors by far. But as mentioned before it is not targeting small customers or individuals as of this writing, thus it remains the primary choice for enterprises and large businesses.With a price tag of $70.21 per share, a P/E ratio of 39.89, and a PEG ratio of 1.11, investors are expecting the company to continue growing its business with a growth rate around 30% in the next years. Over the last 12 years, its margins have continuously decreased due to higher competition and more capital infusion in its business.Source: Author's CalculationThe company's revenue growth has been decelerating in the last eight years and the high-growth days of the past more or less stay in the past.Source: Author's CalculationIs it reasonable to assume that Akamai's revenue growth will improve? I don't think so, and the reason is that different sources estimate that the CDN market growth will be around 30% CAGR and the growth in the cloud security market is expected to be about 13% CAGR. With Akamai's total web traffic share of 15-30%, and assuming that its market share wouldn't drastically increase (if it doesn't change its pricing structure or improve transparency to target a new customer base), I see its revenue continue to grow in the 6-9% range.Investors are currently factoring in a growth rate of 30-36% into the share price, which reflects a slightly higher growth rate of the CDN market and cloud security market. We have to consider that Akamai's business is still weighted more towards the CDN market than the security market, which means that its security market has still more room to grow in the next 3-5 years.Akamai's share price is currently reflecting an adequate growth for the next 3-5 years and considering the estimates for the CDN and cloud security market, I don't think that Akamai's share price will drastically increase over the next 3-5 years. Its valuation metrics show me that a lot of growth is already considered in the premium that investors pay. I would even go so far as to say that small changes in the demand for content delivery networks and cloud security solutions will profoundly impact Akamai's share price as it has in the past.I like its business strategy and its competitive advantage in the market place, and at a lower price tag, I would consider Akamai as a good investment for long-term investors. At the moment I will continue to keep an eye on Akamai's share price and keep it on my watch list.I always welcome constructive criticism and open discussions.

In a world where oil has lost out to data, AKAM potentially represents a goldmine for the right buyer. While monetizing user data managed by AKAM may have its own set of challenges, in light of increased privacy oversight, adventurers may want to explore creative solutions leveraging AKAM’s cloud and the associated analytics.The company is no stranger to merger rumors – as far back as 2005, AKAM has been considered a potentially attractive M&A candidate. In 2011, the rumors became obstreperous to only die down again.So why is it different this time around? Well, for several reasons. In the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, central banks across the world embarked upon an expansionary monetary policy to stimulate growth. While Keynesian economics was able to help rev up the stalled economic engines, too much money chasing too few opportunities gave rise to a slew of consumer businesses (B2C and C2C). A large chunk of the easy money went into financing these castles in the air, to only result in grand failures. The upending of the consumer market and the associated demand on the back of the money also led to some of the more established players trying to fish inexpensive waters. While a small portion of consumer-centric M&A (WhatsApp, Instagram, etc.) has done remarkably well, the majority of attempts at establishing consumer plays have been extraordinary failures.Fast forward to the current day, the exuberance of consumer internet plays has been replaced by growing concerns of privacy and other ill-effects of unrestricted access to masses.While the monetary tightening has not led to a decrease in steep multiples for acquisitions (as seen over the last 18-24 months), there has been an increased focus on the time before such bets become NPV-positive as opposed to the mindset of burning cash to grow userbase (ever heard about a company called Uber (NYSE:UBER)?).AKAM presents a unique asset, one that is profitable, B2B and still has a B2C appeal. While there could be many suitors, as rumored in the past, the most suitable could be Google (GOOG) (GOOGL). In addition to the partnerships that the companies already have, AKAM presents natural synergies for GOOG's cloud business.Currently, AKAM trades at less than 4x P/S, which is abysmal considering the company is growing revenue 8% y/y. Applying a 20% higher (or 5x multiple) to 2019E revenue of ~$3 billion implies an intrinsic value of $15 billion or ~50% upside from the current levels. Given the bargain the stock is at, even a whiff of synergies can lead to the stock delivering multi-bagger returns.In the worst case, we assume 5% revenue synergies and 0 cost synergies.Source: Author's estimate of synergiesSource: Author's estimate of synergiesOn an average, the synergies could easily cross $100 billion. Since the synergies are likely to be driven by Google, AKAM shareholders may not expect a large share of those synergies. However, even in the case of 5-10% synergy sharing, the potential upside to AKAM's stock price is significant.Source: Author's estimate of synergiesNotwithstanding the similarity in DNA (similar to AKAM, GOOG was also born from the association between professors and students), GOOG’s focus on growing its cloud business can easily lead to GOOG changing the conjecture of GOOG buying Akamai into reality.For the long-term investor (12 months+), AKAM is a fundamentally very attractive companyAs per the hard disk companies, cloud companies are undergoing a ‘digestion phase’ before the next round of demand-led growth from the cloud can begin.Source: 1Q19 Seagate (STX) Earnings CallSource: 1Q19 Western Digital (WDC) Earnings CallA recent paper from Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) notes that global data center traffic is likely to grow 3x between 2016 and 2021, to reach ~21ZB. Furthermore,It appears that cloud providers are incrementally leaning towards the edge and are accordingly adjusting their demand for storage. Considering STX’s estimate of the digestion ending by September 2019 and conservatively adding another quarter, the end of 2019 / beginning of 2020 should see edge-driving massive demand for storage. It is also notable that while storage companies are citing slack, AKAM reported its highest peak web traffic at 72 Tbps. The increasing volume of data sloshing around is likely to see a massive bump-up in 2020, benefitting the likes of AKAM.What can further significantly increase traffic volumes for AKAM is the expected launch of a blockchain platform in association with Japan's largest bank, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) in 1H20. The proposed platform will be capable of processing up to 10 million transactions per second with latencies of 2 seconds. To put things into perspective, Bitcoin (BTC) could only handle around seven transactions with latencies of ~10 minutes.Source: AKAM Analyst DayWhile the volatility in BTC prices may have tempered interest in cryptocurrencies, BTC has undoubtedly established the financial use case for the distributed ledged technology.Source: MUFG PresentationsGiven MUFG’s focus on the blockchain, AKAM partnering with MUFG is likely to catapult AKAM into the mainstay of the global payment technology business. Since AKAM offers a comprehensive reach, blockchain as a service could catalyze adoption of the company's offerings. Furthermore, the evolution of edge computing can also impact blockchain architectures, again benefitting Akamai.The diminishing impact of internet platform companies on the overall revenue, structural shift towards the edge, sustained momentum in cloud security and the company’s margin focus all play in favor of AKAM. Notwithstanding the possibilities of a potential merger and the upside from the company’s blockchain initiatives, other than the perception of a commodity business in CDN, there isn’t much of a reason to not own the AKAM stock."

(NASDAQ:AKAM) provides cloud services for securing content over the Internet. The company has a history of steady revenue growth, but its earnings have slumped in recent years.Management expects earnings to significantly improve heading into 2020 with the release of their new Zero Trust Enterprise Security product. Management also expects that the Janrain acquisition will boost earnings.The company is conservatively financed, but its stock is expensive. I think that, at present, Akamai is a higher risk investment and would need a long time frame as there's volatility in the near term. Akamai does have a reliable history of revenue growth, and I think that sooner or later, the company will pull itself out of its earnings slump (which would give patient investors a solid capital gain). In the near term, I think its stock price will remain volatile.Akamai has reported full year financial results for 2018 (data from Seeking Alpha and Nasdaq).The company's revenue was up 8.5 percent over the 2017 fiscal year, and earnings were up 39 percent. Over the last five years, Akamai's revenue increased 8.4 percent per year, and its earnings declined by 1.1 percent per year (in recent years, its earnings have been below its 2014 earnings peak).The return on equity is fair at around 9 percent (which has been fairly consistent over the last decade). The profit margin (profit to revenue ratio) is reasonable at 11 percent. Over the last decade, the profit margin has dropped from a 15 percent average.Akamai's current ratio is 2.1, which means that its current assets exceed its current liabilities. Over the last decade, the company's current ratio has always been over 2 (meaning that the company has no problems in paying its bills).The total debt ratio (total liabilities to total assets) is 42 percent, which means that Akamai's total debt is 42 percent of the value of everything the company owns (note that the asset value is the book value and not the liquidated value of its assets).The company's book value is around $20, and with a stock price of $69, Akamai is trading at 3.5x book value.The analysts' consensus forecast is for revenue to increase by 5.2 percent in 2019 and increase 7.0 percent in 2020. Earnings are forecast to increase 77 percent in 2019 and 13 percent in 2020. The 2020 PE ratio is 19.4x.The financials highlight that Akamai's operates with ample working capital and has no difficulty in paying its bills. The company's long-term debt is under control and could easily take on more debt if needed. Akamai operates with a reasonable profit margin and a fair return on equity.As an investor, I personally like to examine the company's revenue and earnings history. To make this task easier and more convenient, I like to visually present the data on a chart.Akamai data by ADVFNThe above chart visually shows Akamai's revenue and earnings historical trend along with the next two years of consensus forecasts.Examining the chart shows that Akamai's revenue has increased over the last 15 years with a steady trend. The forecast revenue for 2019 and 2020 essentially continue on with this steady trend.The company's earnings have also increased with a general upwards trend. However, its earnings showed a slump from 2015 until the currently reported 2018 earnings. The 2019 and 2020 forecasts place Akamai's earnings back on track with its long-term trend. Excluding the 2006 earnings spike and the recent earnings slump period, Akamai's earnings trend (including the 2019 and 2020 forecasts) broadly follow its steady revenue trend.Tom Leighton - Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder stated in the company's Earnings Call,Akamai's profit margin is currently 11 percent, and its operating margin is 17 percent. These margins have fallen in recent years, and according to Tom Leighton, management expects its operating margin to reach 30 percent in 2020 (with its profit margin likely around 22 percent). I think this may be a little ambitious as these are much higher than they were prior to its recent earnings slump period.However, the company seems focused on achieving this. Jim Benson, Executive Vice President and CFO, made the following two statements in their earnings call,By the looks of it, management expects its acquisition of Janrain will boost its profitability in 2019. This certainly appears to be the case from the analysts who have provided earnings forecasts that are significantly higher than Akamai's highest earnings level back in 2014 (before its earnings slump).Akamai's new Zero Trust Enterprise Security product provides security to apps and data by requiring authentication by all users. Management seems confident that this new product will also aid in boosting the company's margins.We will have to wait and see if management can deliver on its margin increases. If they succeed, this will likely take its earnings out of its slump and put it back on track for future growth.As Akamai has a solid history of steady revenue growth and its earnings have a generally trended upwards, the PEG (PE divided by the earnings growth rate) would be an appropriate valuation method.The company's recent earnings have been in a slump, but the forecast earnings put its growth back on trend from before its slump. The earnings growth from the period starting 2014 and ending 2020 (excluding the slump years) are in line with the steady revenue growth.The average earnings growth rate from 2014 to 2020 is 11.5 percent per year, which results in a forward PEG of 1.7 with a 2020 PE multiple of 19.4x.It's commonly accepted that a stock is fairly valued when its forward PEG is 1.0, which means that Akamai is overvalued with a stock price of $69. Its fair value would be around $41.As an active investor, I personally like to determine some likely price targets. This gives me a feel for how high the stock price could go in the short term and how soon it could get there.Akamai chart by StockCharts.comThe stock chart reveals that Akamai has increased over the last decade, but its increase has been quite choppy with big rallies and big pullbacks. The stock peaked in 2018 and subsequently pulled back. The pullback continued in the latter part of 2018 when the market also pulled back from its high. The stock then rallied this year as the market rallied.Should the market continue to rally, then Akamai could rally back up to its 2018 high of $86 by the end of the year.Over the longer term, the stock could trade well past the 2018 high and will probably do so as long as Akamai's revenue and earnings continue to grow.Akamai's stock price faces two risks.Over the longer term, I would expect the stock price to continue higher. I believe this to be the case as Akamai's earnings growth is expected to continue well into the future.Akamai's has a history of steady revenue growth, but its earnings have been in a slump since 2015 with declining margins. The company has adequate working capital, and its long-term debt is under control.Akamai has plans to significantly improve its margins heading into 2020 with the new Zero Trust Enterprise Security product and its Janrain acquisition. Management expects these will increase the profitability of the company.While the company has plans to improve margins and pull itself out of its earnings slump, this has not happened yet. So, at present, the significant jump in 2019 earnings is just speculation (as they have not happened yet), and there's the risk that earnings won't improve as expected.At present, Akamai is a higher risk investment, and the stock is also expensive. Investors looking to buy now would need a long time frame as there's volatility in the near term. Over the long term, I suspect Akamai would recover from its earnings slump with its stock price following its earnings trend higher."

4146687,104099,2018-02-14T14:47:38-05:00,"Investors should take a hint from the relative underperformance of Akamai over the past year. There's more to come, in my view.The shares are priced for near perfection, though this is hardly a perfect company.At the moment, the market seems to be forecasting a long-term growth rate of about 9%, which is ridiculously optimistic, in my view.","Shares of Akamai Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:AKAM) are up about 2% over the past year, underperforming the overall market. In my view, investors would be wise to take this as a sign of ongoing underperformance and sell the shares. I'll go through my reasoning below by focusing on the financial history and the market's assumptions about the growth rate for the underlying business. As I see it, this is an example of a simplistic narrative ""e-commerce growing, so this is a good investment."" For something to be a good investment, the stock must represent a combination of robust growth and inexpensively priced shares. Unfortunately, Akamai represents neither, and so it presents the worst possible combination.A quick review of the financial history here indicates that Akamai is hardly a ""growth"" company in every way. For example, although revenue has grown at a CAGR of about 10.5% from 2012 to now, operating income and net income have barely budged (up at a CAGR of .1% and 1.4% respectively).That said, earnings per share have grown fairly robustly on the back of an aggressive share buyback program. The share count has been reduced at a CAGR of about .85% over the past six years. In general, I like to see share buybacks as long as they are undertaken at a reasonable price. As per this chart of the P/E for Akamai over the past six years, below, it could be said that the firm has never been ""cheap"" in any meaningful sense of the word, so it may turn out that these buybacks have destroyed shareholder value rather than enhanced it. In my view, the positive effects of this buyback, unlike so many others, aren't a foregone conclusion.(Source: GuruFocus)There is also a problem with the capital structure, in my view. The convertible note is a problem, as all debt increases risk, but most of my difficulty comes from the large proportion of intangible assets on the balance sheet.I'll go through the note first, as it does represent some risk. In February 2014, Akamai issued $690 million of convertible notes due in 2019. The notes are convertible into a potential 7.7 million shares anytime after August 15, 2018. In particular, the conversion price is about $89.56, and note holders will be given cash, or company stock, or a combination at the company's option. Akamai has also engaged in some hedging transactions to reduce the potential impact of the conversion, as per note 19 of its 2014 10-K:(Source: Akamai 10-K, 2014)I consider all debt ""bad"", but these notes are less troubling than they might otherwise be. For example, it's highly likely the company will be able to refinance in 2019, if it comes to that, and if the notes are fully converted into shares (unlikely at this point), the share count will only be brought back to 2015 levels.In my view, the level of intangible assets is far more troubling than the notes. Fully 37% of the assets are goodwill and other intangibles - a result of the many acquisitions this company has cobbled together over the years. In my view, acquisitions are troubling because they have a terrible track record of destroying shareholder value. In my view, the goodwill and other intangibles hang like the sword of Damocles over investors. They never know when there'll be a writedown that will impact the already sluggish earnings.(Source: Company Filings, 10-K, 10-Q)Now there are some risks present, and the growth isn't particularly robust. In spite of that, this could be a good investment at the right price. A company doesn't have to be perfect for it to be a good investment. Unfortunately, investors are being asked to pay way too much for this company at the moment.Investors, particularly investors who focus almost entirely on growth, need to remember that they are paying for that growth, and there is actually a very strong relationship between the price paid and the subsequent returns. Thus, valuation matters. A lot. When it comes to judging the valuation of a company, I do two things. First, I employ the methodology outlined by Professor Stephen Penman in his excellent book, Accounting for Value. For those unfamiliar with it, Penman isolates the ""g"" variable in a relatively standard finance formula to get at what the market thinks about long-term growth for the underlying business. At the current valuation, the market seems to be assuming that perpetual growth at Akamai will be in the order of 9%. That is a ridiculously optimistic assessment, especially in light of the fact that growth has been relatively sclerotic for years.I also apply a relatively standard price-to-free cash flow assessment of the company. Before getting into the price-to-free cash flow, though, I'd like to say something about the argument that we should in some sense give a company like Akamai a ""pass"" because it is capital-intensive. My response is, ""Why should we?"" There are far more profitable, less capital-intensive businesses that we can buy. Why would we skew the scales in favor of a particular company? Anyway, now that that rant is out of the way, I would point out that Akamai is expensive on a price-to-free cash flow basis.(Source: GuruFocus)In my view, for something to be a successful investment, the company must have some excellent growth characteristics. It must grow not only revenue, but also net income and free cash, as these are the source of all investor returns. At the same time, the shares must be reasonably priced. We must be able to buy the shares when others eschew them, because the more you pay for something, the lower your subsequent returns are going to be. At the moment, Akamai presents too much risk in its capital structure, has mediocre growth characteristics, and the shares are richly priced. This combination will eventually be the undoing of long investors, so I recommend they get out while the getting's good."
4090835,73185,2017-07-26T15:32:51-04:00,"AKAM continues to get killed by a pause in spending from the big six Internet companies.Media revenue growth will pick back up as the OTT video transition accelerates over the next several quarters.AKAM stock is a significant valuation trough, and that implies a bottom is near.","Akamai Technologies (AKAM) is taking another leg lower today, 7/26, after the company's Q2 results and Q3 guide disappointed investors. The stock is now down 31% YTD. Although the company's operating results are deteriorating (margin compression is causing earnings to fall), the stock is now getting too cheap to ignore. We believe the company will revamp its revenue growth story as OTT offerings become more robust. This revamped revenue growth will push margins higher, and earnings growth will resume a normal upwards trajectory from this year's depressed base. Consequently, we think the stock can head materially higher from these levels. AKAM data by YChartsThe quarter was more of the same stuff AKAM investors have been hearing for some time. Most of the business is progressing just fine. Performance and Security Solutions revenue rose 16% year-over-year to $376 million. Cloud Security Solutions revenue rose 34% year-over-year to $115 million. Services and Support Solutions revenue rose 13% year-over-year to $54 million. But the Media business continues to struggle. Media Delivery Solutions revenue fell back 9% year-over-year to $179 million. The year-over-year revenue decline is a result of a pause in spending from the big six Internet platform companies. Revenue from those giants, which include Amazon (AMZN) and Facebook (FB), fell 17% year-over-year. This is having an adverse affect on the margin picture. EBITDA margins, which were operating in the high 30's range, are now expected to be in the mid 30's range. But this revenue growth slowdown is just a temporary one, and the EBITDA margin impact is ephemeral. The Media business actually has exceptionally promising growth opportunities through OTT content offerings.On the OTT front, Netflix's (NFLX) domestic growth story isn't slowing, despite the user base getting close to what many believe is the company's domestic TAM. This up-and-up growth trajectory is showing the world that OTT video is the future. Cable is dead, and OTT entertainment will fully take its place in every internet household in America. The same transition will happen globally. More and more players will enter the space, like Disney (DIS) with its investment in BAMTech, and that will only spark more robust growth in the OTT space. AKAM is a big winner in this transition, since the company sells high-quality products which support high-performance streaming of this OTT content. As competition in the OTT space ramps up, so too will demand for high-performance streaming. Overall, then, revenue growth in the Media segment should resume sometime soon as the OTT transition ramps up. That will kick up EBITDA margins back to the high 30s, and AKAM stock should be able to trade at a markedly higher valuation.Right now, AKAM stock trades in a notable valuation trough. This sort of dramatic multiple compression from early 2017 to now has only been seen once in the stock over the past 5 years (late 2015 to early 2016). That sharp come-down in valuation was a solid buying opportunity, and AKAM stock proceeded to rally hard in 2016. AKAM data by YChartsOverall, AKAM is a good company with solid growth prospects. There is some near-term choppiness right now with revenue growth slowing and margins coming down due to a pause in spending from the big six Internet platform companies, but that pause won't last forever. We see the expansion of OTT offerings as a huge catalyst for AKAM's media segment over the next several years, and believe AKAM stock is attractively valued at these levels."
4130753,103998,2017-12-08T15:52:00-05:00,"With the holidays coming, there will be a lot of online traffic coming from e-commerce customers.AKAM will start to see revenue gains from their acquisition of Nominum this quarter.As traffic volume increases in the future, the company will continue to gain market share with focusing on OTT media distribution.","Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) is a company that has a diverse portfolio in information software and services. They provide cloud networks for companies to operate on while also having fast and secure services to protect customer's information from hackers. With an EBITDA margin of 31.6% and an operating margin of 19.64%, which is at the top of their industry, it shows that they retain the most money out of each dollar of revenue gained compared to other similar companies. In the fourth quarter, with the acquisition of Nominum incorporated into the company's financials and the future possibility of gaining market share from their over the top (OTT) focus, Akamai can be seen as underpriced at its current levels. I believe that Akamai also has the capability of continuous growth over the next year just as the industry did in the graph shown on Bloomberg below.Source: BloombergIn the third quarter earnings call, the CEO Tom Leighton said that they had a great quarter due to the continuous rapid growth of their security offerings and a very strong traffic acceleration in their Media Business. Akamai reported revenue in the third quarter of $621 million. This was above the high end of their guidance range and was a 6% increase from the third quarter of 2016. The Cloud Security section of the portfolio was the fastest growing part of their whole business with a total of $121 million in revenue and a growth of 27% year-over-year.As of September 30, 2017, Akamai had an EBITDA margin of 31.6% and an EPS of $1.86. They also reported a gross profit of $1.606.4 billion, which is the same gross margin percentage in the 9 months of 2017 as all of 2016. In 2016, they have an operating margin as a company of 19.64%. Although this is a decrease of 2% from 2015, it is a growth of 7.5% in year-over-year growth. They reported these numbers as negative growth in gross margin, EBITDA margin, operating margin and net income margin. Although negative because of a poor fiscal year in 2015, the company's overall trend in these four margins have been positive up until 2015 and close to increasing year-over-year margins again. With the company continuing to beat their EPS and revenue and keeping a mid-30% EBITDA margin, I believe this will allow the company to increase their growth margins to positive. All these positive growth margins will drive the company’s revenue and stock price up as the company continues to grow at a steady rate.Source: BloombergThe current CEO of Akamai, Dr. Tom Leighton, was one of the co-founders in 1998. He served as chief scientist from 1998 to 2013 when he was finally promoted to CEO. During his tenure as CEO, the company transitioned from a content delivery network to one of the most trusted cloud delivery and cybersecurity platforms. Under his watch, the company’s revenue and profit has grown 70%. Jim Benson operates as the VP and CFO for Akamai. He is the director for all the company’s accounting, tax, treasury, business finance and corporate services activities. Prior to joining Akamai(AKAM), in 2009, Benson was the CFO at HP. When he joined in September 2009, the price of the stock was $19.68. Within a year as CFO, the company’s stock grew to $50.18. Since 2014, as a whole Akamai has had stock base compensation grow from around $21 million to $31 million. This can be beneficial as employees will work harder to improve the company, since they will receive compensation based on the company's growth.From the beginning of the year, the company has had little change in ownership. They have had an increase since January 2017 in hedge fund ownership from 4.3% to 5% today. This shows us that many investors see potential growth in the company and they are starting to purchase the stock. Combining this information with a short interest of 3.27 days shows that investors are not shorting this company. If they choose to short this company, they only hold to the short position for an average of three and a quarter days. The majority of the company’s ownership is through Investment Advisor at 83.2% of their total ownership. Besides the top two, the other ownership types have not changed much in the past yearSource: BloombergSource: Akamai's WebsiteThe Industry Software and Services industry as a whole has been growing aggressively and it does not look like it is going to slow down. Software services revenue year over year has been growing at 35%. This looks like it will continue to grow as new software continues to be processed and integrated. Internet revenue year over year growth is growing at 25.1%. This is mainly from the big six platforms continuing acceleration growth and does not look like as it is going to slow down as Alphabet (GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Facebook(FB), Microsoft (MSFT) and Netflix (NFLX) are continuing to show massive revenue growth and profits. Software by itself has seenrevenue growth year-over-year of 10.7% stemming from new technologies and a high volume usage of these new software technologies. Lastly, Systems and PC hardware revenue growth year-over-year has been 9.7%. Although this growth for the industry is the smallest for these four sections, it is still vital for the industry as a whole. These software and hardware divisions cannot operate without the system and PC hardware to operate in.Akamai has three divisions that cover all their customers. The three divisions are their web division customers, media division customers and their enterprise and carrier division customers. The web division customers' revenue is $328 million which is up 14% from quarter three of 2016. Most of this segment is their Cloud Security offerings which is 53% of this division's revenue. This segment will continue to grow at a low digit 10% and will be driven by the bot manager premier (BMP). The BMP uses an artificial intelligence to distinguish the machines from human users. It can detect the ways that a human touches the screen, presses a key or even how the human moves with a mouse. They already had 70 customers willing to use BMP. They predict more people will try it as they believe billions of dollars are lost due to credential abuse annually from bot hacking. The second division is their Media Division customers which has been receiving the most focus. The division had a total revenue of $273 million which was down 1% year over year but up 3% excluding the impact of large internet platform customers. They saw the most year-over-year traffic growth in third quarter since 2015. This had a positive impact because they were working hard to increase traffic growth. The last division is their smallest which is the Enterprise and Carrier Division. This division has hit its mature stage and only accounts for $20 million of their revenue and is up 1% from a strong quarter three in 2016. The four solution categories that make up Akamai are performance and security solutions, cloud security solutions, media delivery solutions, and services and support solutions. The largest solution is the performance and security solutions with a total revenue for the third quarter of $381 million. This was growth of 10% year over year. Although this has declined throughout the years since their media division does not use their performance solutions as much, they still predict steady growth the next few years. The Cloud Security solutions is their fastest growing solutions and their flagship product. They had third quarter revenue of $121 million, which was up 27% year over year. This is mainly because of the Kona Site Defender. The Kona Site Defender examines all the traffic coming to a website and determines its safety. It can be used as a virtual patching layer in front of websites and apps which allows customers to be protected. This is growing rapidly because of numerous financial security breaches in the US, which exposed user financial information. The third solution is the Media Delivery Solution which had third quarter revenue of $183 million, which was down 3% year over year. The growth, although negative, was an improvement from the second quarter which was driven from the acceleration of media traffic. The smallest solution category is their services and support solutions which has revenue of $57 million. This is a growth of 12% year over year. Through all these divisions and solutions, Akamai will be driven by their Nominum acquisition and their cloud security segment to drive their margins back to positive percentages.Akamai is considered a large company compared to competitors. Although the sales one-year growth vs. competitors is less than the median, they outperformed most of their competitors in all other categories. Their EBITDA margin for the past three years is best in class at 35.74%, while the second best company is at 26.44%. They also are best in class for operating margin for one year and operating margin for the past three years. The operating margin for the past year is at 20.16% which means for every dollar of revenue, $.20 is left over after paying off all the costs. This is higher than all their competitors which shows they retain more money per dollar after costs than their competitors. Akamai has a positive ROE at 10.1% while competitors have negative ROEs in the industry. They also have a one-year revenue growth less than the median of the industry. However, most of these companies that are growing at 35%-40% revenue growth also have a negative earnings per share for the past year. The median for the industry is -6.40% while Akamai has a one year earnings per share growth of 5.21%. Although they do not lead in every category for the industry, they are first in class in what I believe are the two main categories of EBITDA margin and operating margin.Upside scenario: Source: Authors ProformaWith my one-year target price of $78.66, I believe the only thing that will change in this company will be their revenue and operating cost. Assumptions of forecasted revenue growth are 10% for the next quarter and four years after due to the acquisition of Nominum will have a direct increase of revenue of 3%. This will have a steady 10% revenue growth for the next four years and then slowly decline to a 6% revenue growth rate for the long term. Operating cost also will be cut by a couple of percent to 60% for the long term as they continue implementing and acquiring new companies to cut their costs. With these assumptions, we would see a 42.35% return if it reached the one-year target price.Downside Scenario:Source: Author's ProformaIf the company stayed at a revenue growth rate of 6% for the next 10 years and had their operating margin increase to 70% from 62.1%, they would have a negative one year return of -.24%. These assumptions of revenue and operating cost are if the implementation of Nominum does not perform as expected and has little effect on the company’s revenue. The operating cost could increase to 70% if they make another acquisition that does not work out as well as they thought and causes operating costs to go up instead of down. The likelihood of this is very unlikely.Akamai Technologies Inc is the most rounded company (although not at the top of their industry in every category). They lead the industry compared to their competitors in EBITDA margin and operating margin, which are the two main margins that show how much money they retain per dollar of revenue. With the acquisition of Nominum and anticipating EBITDA margin to increase by a couple of percentages, I believe Akamai Technologies in underpriced and is a certain buy."

For the second quarter in a row, the company disappointed investors. Although AKAM's latest quarter (to be discussed below) was relatively well received by investors, the company's weaker-than-expected second quarter 2017 revenue guidance due to significant weakness in video game downloads disappointed investors. With this in mind, let us remind readers unfamiliar with AKAM as to the company's background. The company develops solutions to accelerate, enhance, and secure the delivery of digital content and applications via the Internet and mobile networks. Specifically, AKAM's solutions are designed to help customers improve their revenues and decrease costs by maximizing the performance of their businesses. The company has three businesses: 1) the media division, which enables the provision of quality content at a size required to solve a problem (""at scale""); 2) the web division, which includes performance and security solutions for Internet applications; and 3) the enterprise and carrier division, which offers security/performance solutions for business users. AKAM uses proprietary solutions/specialized technologies, such as advanced routing, load balancing, and data collection and monitoring to deliver customer content and applications.AKAM's product/service platform and the related intellectual property provide it with substantive competitive advantages that it has leveraged to its benefit. While the company faces increasing competition, its strategy to focus on both dynamic distribution and markets beyond media/entertainment allow it to withstand substantial external pricing pressures. AKAM's lower-end business, however, is more subject to pricing pressures from competitors. Despite such pricing pressures, the company does not appear to show an interest in competing on price in lower end markets. AKAM has a recent history of making acquisitions to contribute to its overall growth and acquisitions are likely to continue. With this in mind, let us look at an overview of AKAM's most recent quarterly results. The company's revenue was $609 million, a 8 percent increase from the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.69, a 5 percent increase. AKAM's solid results were driven by its performance and security solutions business (over 60 percent of total revenue) where revenue grew 18 percent. The company's media business was significantly impacted by the ""do-it-yourself"" efforts of its six largest Internet platform customers. As a result, revenue from these six companies was $51 million, a 29 percent decrease. Traffic from AKAM's other media customers has continued to increase at a rapid rate, but at a slower pace historically.AKAM indicated that pricing in the media sector remained aggressive, and, given this, it believes that the revenue growth rate for its media business will continue to be below historical growth rates and AKAM's overall revenue growth rate (with a continued adverse impact on margins). Despite near-term adversities, the company believes that media is a good business for it given that it sees the impact of the large platform companies on its media business lessening and that the business overall will return to historic levels of performance. Specifically, AKAM is optimistic about the media market given its Over-The-Top business (""OTT"" - which is the audio, video, and other media content delivered over the Internet without the involvement of a multiple-system operator [""MSO""] in the control or distribution of the content) participates in a market where a recent study predicts that OTT viewing will exceed traditional broadcast viewing within five years. With a significant amount of video traffic moving online, AKAM is well-positioned to benefit. To prepare for the future, the company is working to enable virtual and augmented reality delivered seamlessly anywhere in the world over wired and wireless networks with virtually zero latency.AKAM remains confident about its future. The CEO, although he is already a large holder of AKAM (as the co-founder of the company), in a sign of his confidence in AKAM, announced that he would be continuing his ""personal stock buyback"" program through a 10b5-1 plan that will purchase $1 million of AKAM shares every month for the rest of 2017 (see insider purchase discussion below). AKAM and its CEO noted that there is a level of consistency in trends that favor the company's business such as favorable market trends, the uniqueness in differentiation of the AKAM platform, the leadership position it maintains and the very rapidly changing/evolving cloud ecosystem and its significant amount of innovation. The company states that it is innovating across its businesses and it believes that such innovation will drive double-digit growth. The fundamentals of AKAM's businesses remain strong, but the company notes that investments in its new adjacent product offerings will pressure near-term margins but will drive significant future revenue/profit growth long term. As for its second quarter 2017 results, the company expects its media business growth rates to continue to moderate, but remains bullish on the long-term growth prospects for the business due to the potential for an increase in the amount of video traffic that could move online.AKAM did not provide specific guidance for full year 2017, but believes that its investments in its businesses throughout 2017 will enable it to drive accelerated, sustainable, long-term double-digit revenue/profit growth. With this in mind, the company expects second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.59 to $0.61.CEO makes second significant share purchase in 2017One of the most positive signs to a potential investor in a company's stock is an insider purchase of its shares on the open market. Recently, the CEO and co-founder of AKAM made two significant purchases of the company's shares as part of his 2017 ""personal buyback program."" On July 14, 2017, Mr. T. Leighton purchased 19,817 shares at $50.45 for a total cost of $999,968. About a month earlier on June 15, 2017, Mr. Leighton purchased 20,397 shares at $49.02 for a total cost of $999,861. We find these multiple insider purchases closer to AKAM's 52-week lows as significant given the position such insider holds with AKAM. Such insider purchases are particularly significant given that investors have punished AKAM's shares due to near-term moderation in its media business and other market adversities. Although the CEO is a wealthy man who co-founded the company, we see his ongoing personal buyback program as a strong sign of his confidence in AKAM despite its shares trading near 52-week lows. Investors who find significance in such CEO's ongoing insider purchases should consider following up with their own purchase of AKAM's shares.As the CEO and co-founder of the company, Mr. Leighton is most knowledgeable about the direction AKAM is moving with respect to current/future products, the company's financials, cost reduction efforts and any acquisition strategy that the company may engage in. We see such multiple purchases as a sign of confidence in the company's efforts to innovate within its businesses and in the favorable market trends that the company sells into. With that said, such an insider, who is more likely to have an intermediate to long-term investing horizon, is sending strong signals to outside investors that they have strong confidence in AKAM's integration, innovation and transformational activities. This insider has also made a strong statement on the company's shares even though their purchases of AKAM shares were made near 52-week lows. AKAM shares are trading at about the insiders' purchase prices. So potential investors with a long-term holding period currently have the opportunity to purchase this company's shares at a price similar to such insider purchases - or, during an overall market sell off, to buy the shares at a level that's even lower than the insiders' purchase prices. Given that overall markets are at all-time highs, we believe investors should consider a half-position in AKAM's shares now and a full position upon a strong overall market sell off.AKAM is likely to record revenue growth in the 2017-18 time period due to the increasing use and importance of the Internet and mobile devices to distribute content and applications. The company is also likely to experience significant growth in its security product offerings. AKAM, however, faces adverse revenue headwinds from its six largest Internet platform customers doing an increasing amount of their own work in the media area in house. The company's margins are also expected to shrink in 2017 given its merger and acquisition activity and sizeable investments related to developing and selling new offerings, and scale benefits and efficiencies. Such margins, however, are likely to improve in 2018. Contrarian investors may want to take a longer look at the company's shares while they remain near 52-week lows. Although AKAM faces near-term adversities, it is an innovator and market leader in content/application distribution. Given such positive company characteristics, AKAM is likely to benefit from demand related to cloud computing and mobile offerings. The company's security business is also a likely growth driver for it. Finally, AKAM is also likely to drive growth through international expansion.AKAM is an innovator across its businesses, and, as such, it believes that such innovation will drive double-digit growth. The fundamentals of AKAM's businesses remain strong, but the company notes that its investments will depress near-term margins but will drive significant future revenue/profit growth long term. AKAM's forward price-to-earnings ratio is about 20.45 based on fiscal 2017 earnings estimates of $2.55, and about 18.35 based on fiscal 2018 earnings estimates of $2.84. Estimates for both fiscal 2017 and 2018 have decreased substantially recent months. Given that AKAM's share price is near the prices paid by AKAM's CEO, investors may want to establish a position in the company's shares now. With this said, we are wary of purchasing shares when overall market stand at all time highs. Over the long term, AKAM investors will benefit from share price appreciation and share buybacks as the company expands and drives revenue/earnings growth from its integration of its recent acquisitions, internal product pipeline innovation, product portfolio management and smaller bolt-on acquisitions to fill out its product offerings.(Click ""follow"" next to our contributor name at the top of this article to follow our upcoming articles on AKAM, insider purchases and more.)"
4044448,24992,2017-02-09T14:49:09-05:00,"Shares are trading at 38% premium to overall market.Shares were priced for perfection, and perfection didn't happen.Net income growth has not kept pace with revenue growth since 2010.ChartMasterPro downward target price of $59.00.","Shares of Akamai Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:AKAM) are up about 60% over the past year, in spite of the recent drop in price, and in this article I want to talk about why current investors would be best served by leaving and prospective investors should avoid the name.I'll focus on the seeming disconnect between revenue and net income, the narrative fallacy that causes people to value stocks associated with ""the cloud"" much more aggressively than they otherwise might and I want to close by talking about the stock and how it is dangerous to buy shares that are optimistically priced.Investors are compensated with net income. Revenue growth is excellent, but if a company consistently fails to turn that rising revenue into net income, at some point investors have to ask themselves what the point of the exercise is. The stock is down fairly significantly after the market reacted to negative guidance from the company, and in my view this reaction is telling. It's as if shares were priced for perfection and when the company failed to deliver on that perfection, the shares dropped by 12%. This may seem an overreaction to a short term event, unless you consider that the shares were priced to go nowhere but down prior to the guidance. This price activity in the face of a relatively minor guidance change on the part of the company says something about the inherent risks of investing in expensive stocks.Revenue and Net IncomeSince 2009, revenue has grown impressively at Akamai, (at a CAGR of ~13%) ,but net income has climbed at a rate of only about 10%. That seems like a small difference, but the compounding impact of this difference is enormous, as seen in the graph in this link comparing revenue and net income here. This seeming disconnect between revenue and net income is highlighted by the fact that during 2016 net income actually dropped by 1.6% in spite of a 6.5% increase in revenues. This prompts the question, if this company can't grow net income by at least the same rate as net income, why does the stock command the multiple it does?The CloudOne answer to this question relates to the business Akamai happens to be in. It is given a high multiple because it relates to ""The Cloud."" I remember the TMT bubble of the 90s when people drove share prices to nosebleed levels based on the very compelling sounding narratives about dark fiber, click-throughs, etc. I'm not suggesting that this company represents that level of overvaluation, or that we're in the midst of a new tech bubble, but human nature hasn't changed and we're not suddenly collectively wiser. We like compelling sounding narratives, and sometimes those narratives are poor proxies for real, critical analysis when it comes to all things related to ""the cloud.""The StockAs I've said repeatedly, the single biggest determinant in success in investments relates to the price you pay for an investment. The more you pay for a dollar of future earnings, the lower your subsequent returns will be. This is a truism. The shares of Akamai are overpriced in my view, in relation to the performance here. For instance, they trade at a 38% premium to the market and the EV/EBIT of 22.83 implies an earnings yield of only 4%.Finally, the market remains massively optimistic about the future of this company as demonstrated by the relationship between the TTM PE of 35.8 and the forward PE of 21.6. This suggest that, holding all else constant, the market is forecasting earnings growth in the neighborhood of 65%. There's nothing to assume this can happen here.Technical SnapshotShares of AKAM are about to fall from ""the cloud"" (sorry, couldn't resist) that they have formed on the daily chart. After popping on October 26, 2016 the stock has traded above $64.00. We believe that the $64.00 support will not hold and that the shares will fall to the $59.00 level over the next three months.In anticipation of the break below $59.00, today we will buy the AKAM 19MAY17 65 Put Options which will provide us with approximately 6x leverage on our SHORT trade. Our initial stop-loss exit signal will be a daily close above $66.50.For investors in the shares, we recommend that you SELL to avoid any further drop in the share price.ConclusionAkamai Technologies is a company that has grown its revenues at a robust pace over the past ten years. The problem is that net income hasn't kept pace, and it's earnings that are the basis for all investor returns. Far more problematic than this is the fact that the stock remains priced for perfection. Investors in this company saw very recently what happens when a stock that is priced for perfection delivers results that are not perfect. The shares get clobbered and investors wonder why the market had such a seeming overreaction. In my view current shareholders should get out now and prospective investors should avoid the name."
4010953,20875,2016-10-10T05:00:00-04:00,"For well over a year, customers of Akamai have been complaining about Akamai’s cache invalidation times, which has impacted manifest caching, real-time news feeds, and any time sensitive content.Historically, Akamai purges use to take at least 15 minutes and sometimes, in a couple of really terrible cases, I’ve heard of hours.Competitors like Fastly have been quick to jump on Akamai’s purging limitations and have been winning deals in the market based on Fastly’s ability to purge content within hundreds of milliseconds.","It seems that some CDNs caching strategies are old school and based around the idea that you have little to no real-time control of your caches. You set a TTL and if you need to invalidate, it can’t be mission critical, you just have to wait minutes or hours. So you set your caching strategy by identifying what you can afford to behave like this and then build against that, so your home page, news feeds, api’s, dynamic elements, HLS manifests etc. can’t be cached. Customers tell me that with Fastly, they have turned the caching strategy on its head. They cache everything (except truly uncacheable content like PII or specific to a single user), and then invalidate it as needed. It’s the difference between 90% cache hit rate and 99.999%. New York Times (NYSE:NYT) is a classic example of an Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) customer, which serves all their HTML from origin and only caches images on Akamai because they don’t have this capability.Akamai has been aware of the major limitations of their platform when it comes to purging content (see their blog post from January) and has been building out a new system, which allows purging as low as a few seconds. That is a dramatic improvement, but content owners have been asking me how widespread Akamai’s new system is, if it is available on their entire platform, or if there’s any rate limiting. Some Akamai customers tell me they are still in the 15 minute purge range. By comparison, when they compare Akamai to Fastly, their entire platform supports instant purge, they don’t rate limit and you can purge the entire cache if you want and it’s all API driven. Fastly customers tell me they have 150ms or less purging capabilities.So with all these questions out in the market, I had a chance to speak to Akamai about how they are addressing their purging issue and got details from the company on their new platform, made available this week, which looks to address some of their customer’s purging complaints. Akamai’s new “Fast Purge” solution enables Akamai customers to invalidate or delete their content from all of Akamai’s Edge servers via API and UI in “approximately 5 seconds”. With Akamai’s Fast Purge API, the company said their customers “can automate their publishing flow to maximize performance and offload without compromising on freshness.” With this “Hold Til Told” methodology, Akamai customers can now cache semi-dynamic content with long TTLs, and refresh it near instantly as soon as it changes.Akamai says the Fast Purge UI will complete the roll out process this week to all customers, and is already available to 85% of them. Fast Purge API has been adopted by almost 100 Akamai customers so far and they said it supports a “virtually unlimited throughput of over 100x that of our legacy purge APIs per customer.” Its early adopters include major retailers caching their entire product catalog and major media companies caching news stories and live API feeds for day-to-day operations. In Q1 2017, Akamai says Fast Purge will support purge-by-cpcode and purge-by-content-tag. With Fast Purge by content tag, customers will be able to apply tags to content, and then with one purge-by-tag request, refresh all content containing that specific tag. For example, eCommerce customers will be able to tag search result pages with the SKUs on them, and then when an SKU is out of stock, with one request remove all pages referencing it.It’s good to see Akamai finally offering a better purging solution in the market, but only customers will determine if what Akamai now offers will fit the bill or not. The keys to instant purge are speed and reliability at scale. Customers say their experience on the “Hold Til Told” approach suggests that you need to trust that purges will happen and they need to be reliable across the world and at scale. If your site depends on being updated in real-time to ensure you don’t sell something you don’t have or provide outdated information the users need to trust it will work. If purges do not happen reliably, it creates mistrust and damages the entire premise of “hold til told”. So customers of any CDN should test purge times under many different conditions and in various regions on the production network to ensure it actually works as advertised. Even more so for Akamai customers, since we don’t know what scale or reliability their new Fast Purge solution has. While Akamai said they now have a 100x increase on the throughput from the legacy system, the old system was so limited that it’s possible that a 100x increase simply isn’t enough and would not meet the needs of many large customers.Another unanswered question is what Akamai has done to integrate their underlying purging system into major CMS vendors and platforms, so that you get this feature as part of your basic install of the CMS. Akamai has not traditionally worked with the partner ecosystem well and it will be interesting to see how they plan to be on by default in the key CMS and platforms. Competitive CDNs have historically been developer friendly and have well-documented APIs for integrating with other platforms, and that has traditionally been a challenge for Akamai.On the speed front, it’s good to see Akamai improving, but many businesses would not function with 5 second purges times. For example, customers that have real-time inventory that cannot be oversold. I see this 5 second limitation and the unknown scale and reliability of the system being a huge challenge for Akamai in a market that is truly milliseconds based. It is great they went from minutes to seconds but the performance game is now measured in milliseconds. Scale, reliability and speed are words everyone uses when it comes to delivering content on the web but for purging of content, customers use real-world methodology to measure the impact it has, positive or negative on their business. Customers are the ultimate judge of any new service of feature in the market and at some point, as more look to adopt Akamai’s Fast Purge solution, we’ll find out if 5 seconds is fast enough or not."
4007877,20875,2016-09-22T11:59:40-04:00,"Akamai's got a short- and long-term problem with their media business and really needs to decide if they want to be in a business that is so volatile, with little to no margins.On average, Akamai is coming in about 15% cheaper trying to win new CDN business or keep the traffic they have.Akamai would be better off getting out of the media business over time and putting all of their efforts into their web performance and security product lines.","With Akamai's (NASDAQ:AKAM) top six media customers moving a large percentage of their traffic to their own in-house CDNs over the past 18 months, Akamai has been scrambling to try to fill the excess capacity left on their network. Over the past few weeks I have been tracking media pricing very closely and now have enough data points directly from customers and RFPs to see just how much Akamai is undercutting Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and Limelight (NASDAQ:LLNW) on CDN deals.On average, Akamai is coming in about 15% cheaper trying to win new CDN business or keep the traffic they have. The lowest price I have seen Akamai quoting is $0.002 per GB delivered. To date, that is the lowest pricing I have ever seen on any CDN deal ever. That price is for very large customers, but even for small deals where Level 3 is at $.005 and Limelight will be at $0.0045, Akamai has come in at $0.003. Akamai is making it clear with renewals and with new deals that they want to keep/win the traffic. And while lower pricing might help them with some RFPs, I see deals where they don't win it, even with the lower price. And many times if they do, it's harder for them to keep all the business they have, even with lower pricing, because many content owners are now using a multi-CDN strategy, sharing traffic amongst multiple CDNs. So in many cases, even when Akamai keeps a customer, they are keeping less traffic, at a lower price point.While selling on price alone has the potential to give Akamai a little bump in revenue if they can grab some more market share, it's not a long-term strategy. When you can no longer sell media delivery based on metrics like performance and have to win business based solely on the lowest price, that's a recipe for lower margins. In the first six months of this year, Akamai's margins were down 150 basis points. Value-added services which have healthy margins can make up for a lower margin service like CDN, but Akamai's year-over-year growth in their performance and security business has also slowed.Akamai, and all CDNs for this matter, can also get burned if they offer too low of a price and then realize a large percentage of the customer traffic is coming from regions like India, China or Australia. In those regions, it costs them substantially more to deliver the traffic and when they give a customer CDN pricing, it's a number they are picking based off of blended traffic coming from a global audience. Get that wrong and your costs are higher for business you already quoted at such a low price. While we don't know Akamai's true cost to deliver content since they don't break out CapEx dollars, I guarantee that Akamai is not making money on a CDN contract priced at $0.002. That's not a deal that is profitable to the company standing on its own. Maybe it has a bigger overall impact based on who the customer is, or it gets them other business, but many of the deals I am seeing are for straight CDN, nothing else. Akamai is sacrificing margins on their media business, just to add traffic to their network. That's not healthy for any business.Akamai is also facing a massive CapEx problem, where they have to spend a lot of money to constantly refresh their network and the number of servers they have. Akamai has said they have 200,000 edge servers and Limelight has said they have 10,000 edge servers. Limelight has 1/3 the capacity of Akamai, but spends far less in CapEx. In the first six months of this year, Akamai spent $160M in CapEx, Limelight spent $5M. Even if half of Akamai's CapEx is directed at their media business, it's $80M or 20 times Limelight's CapEx spend. Based on those numbers and other data I have, by my estimate, it costs Akamai about $5M in CapEx to add 1 Tbps of capacity to their network. Compare that to Limelight and Level 3 where I estimate it costs them about $1M in CapEx per Tbps of capacity in the U.S. or Europe.Highlighting this point even further is that on Limelight's last earnings call, the company talked about their CapEx costs and capacity, when compared to Akamai. Limelight has less than 1/20th the infrastructure to deliver 1/5th the revenue when compared to Akamai. We don't know the exact capacity of Akamai's network, but Limelight's current egress capability is just shy of 15 Tbps. And I think Akamai has said they hit a record 40 Tbps. Also, Limelight added almost as much capacity in the first half of 2016 than they did in the full year of 2015, while spending $7.6M less in CapEx year to date. Meanwhile, Akamai's CapEx costs are accelerating, while traffic growth has slowed with declining growth in revenue.Akamai's got a short- and long-term problem with their media business and really needs to decide if they want to be in a business that is so volatile with little to no margins. You have a commoditized service offering, customers that now compete against you, cloud providers that have more scale and ways to make money and competitors that own and operate the network, and others with distinct CapEx advantages. Akamai would be better off getting out of the media business over time and putting all of their efforts into their web performance and security product lines.On a side note, Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) NFL stream, taking place Thursday Sept 15th, will be delivered by Akamai and Level 3 and I do not expect it to have a large simultaneous audience. My estimate is under 2M simultaneous streams. Also, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS 10 update that came out on Tuesday, the vast majority of that is being delivered by Apple's in-house CDN, with only a small percentage of the overall traffic going to third-party CDN providers."
4010310,48501,2016-10-05T10:37:31-04:00,"While CDN and Security remain competitive markets, Akamai remains well positioned.Revenue growth should reaccelerate in FY17 as DIY impact dissipates.The shares are trading at a steep discount to the Nasdaq and the industry.","Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) specializes in Web performance solutions, media delivery and cloud security. The company has three reporting operating segments: Performance and Security Solutions, Media Delivery Solutions, and Service and Support Solutions.Recently there has been concern among investors that Akamai's customers are increasingly utilizing a do-it-yourself model. The revenue threat, as described by the leadership team, is to 11% of Q2 revenue and the overwhelming majority of problem is from 5.5% of revenue. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are said to be bringing more of the CDN work in-house rather than using Akamai as a service provider. The 5.5% of revenue annualized is $126M. The increase in sales during Q2 from Performance and Security Solutions annualized is $177M. In a worst-case scenario when the 5.5% of revenue drops to 0% of revenue, the increase in sales from the Performance and Security Solutions segments more than offsets the decline in sales from Media Delivery Solutions. Consequently, while this is a situation that is worth closely monitoring, it is also a situation that appears to be manageable.In addition to the CDN threat from DIY is the threat from a vast array of competitors. Two of the larger corporate competitors are CloudFront from Amazon Web Services and Azure CDN from Microsoft. Verizon Digital Media Services from Verizon (NYSE:VZ) is another CDN offering from a large corporation. All three CDN solutions are cheaper than Akamai's CDN solution, but when you are looking for a feature-rich CDN with scale Akamai is the clear leader. Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT), Limelight Networks (LLWN), CloudFlare and Incapsula also compete in the CDN market.Cloud security is a hot topic within IT and Akamai offers software solutions within the highly competitive market. On the Cybersecurity 500 list for 2016, Akamai ranked #76, meaning that the company isn't a leader in broader cybersecurity. In distributed denial of service protection, Akamai is ranked higher as several of its security offerings are geared toward DDoS protection, and according to Forrester Research, Akamai is amongst the leaders in DDoS protection services providers, alongside Imperva (NYSE:IMPV), Verisign (NASDAQ:VRSN), CloudFlare, and CenturyLink (NYSE:CTL).Akamai Kona Site Defender is recognized as a leading solution for Web application firewall (WAF). WAFs are used to protect companies from data theft and unwanted network penetration. The WAF market grew 23.5% in 2015 with Akamai having a 62% share of the market. The company is well positioned within the WAF market because of its massive content delivery network and intelligence platform, allowing Kona Site Defender to provide low false positive rates and low false negative rates. Ease of deployment and low required maintenance are also cited reasons for selecting Kona Site Defender.A company's competitive environment impacts its profitability and growth prospects. For Akamai, sales growth has slowed from 24% in FY14 to an estimated 6% in FY16. The operating margin is expected to decline from 26% in FY13 to 20% in FY16. A decline in the growth rate and/or profitability adversely impacts a company's value. Currently, Akamai is trading at a 36% discount to the Nasdaq and a 31% discount to the industry. In my view, this discount represents over pessimism and should shrink as investors fully digest the DIY efforts of a couple customers and sales growth reaccelerates in FY17.Rock Solid FinancialsAkamai's sales growth is expected to slow to 6% in FY16 as sales from Media Delivery and Solutions declines 7%. The Performance and Security Solutions and Service and Support Solutions segments are both expected to grow at 16% during FY16. While there is an adverse impact from the DIY efforts of Microsoft, Apple and Facebook, the rest of the segments are posting mid-teens growth rates, and the balance sheet is a fortress with the debt-to-equity ratio at about 20%. Cash flow from operations is anticipated to grow 15% in FY16.Data courtesy of Morningstar and forecast courtesy of Bottom Up InvestingWe have already touched on the declining profitability and slowing growth rate during FY16. Net income for the year is forecasted to come in at $324M with EPS of $1.86. For FY17, revenue is expected to reaccelerate (9%) as the drag from DIY dissipates and the Media segment returns to growth. I see profitability remaining depressed relative to prior years on continued intense competition. Net income for FY17 is expected to be $345M (+7% y/y) with EPS of $2.03 (+9% y/y). The return on equity (approx. 10%) is above with the company's cost of equity (8.7%).Data courtesy of Morningstar and forecast courtesy of Bottom Up InvestingFor FY16 cash flow from operations is expected to increase 15% to $878M and CFO is expected to grow by 6% in FY17 to $926M. Almost half of CFO is used to repurchase shares during FYs 2016 and 2017, with $850M being returned to shareholders. Capital expenditure is the other significant use of CFO.Data courtesy of Morningstar and forecast courtesy of Bottom Up InvestingIn examining the balance sheet, the low level of debt stands out. In my view, leadership should issue about $500M of debt to make a strategic acquisition in the $600M to $800M range. Obviously there are several factors that go into pricing a deal, but back of the envelope, the acquisition could provide approximately a 5% revenue boost. The debt to equity would increase from 20% to 35%.Cheap Shares and Bear MarketAKAM was in a primary degree bear market that may have bottomed earlier in the year. The MACD is nearing the buy signal level and the share price recently crossed over the 50-week simple moving average. This appears to be the early innings of a primary degree bull market.Data courtesy of Morningstar , Bloomberg, and forecast courtesy of Bottom Up InvestingBased on FY17 EPS of $2.03 (+9% y/y), AKAM is trading at a 36% discount to the Nasdaq. AKAM is also trading at a 31% discount to the industry based on FY17 sales (+9% y/y) with the industry's five-year sales CAGR being 14.7%. In my view, this is a low-risk and high-reward valuation."
4016921,21815,2016-10-30T23:07:13-04:00,"After the scare of the biggest customers leaving and starting their own content delivery networks, the shares have recovered strongly.The negative effect of the big customers that are leaving is wearing off, and growth is returning.Akamai has other tailwinds, like its fast-growing cyber security business.However, we feel the shares are due for a breather after an unusually fast run-up.","The shares of content distributor Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) has been in the doldrums ever since the third quarter last year, when the company noted a problem. The problem was that big customers, like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were starting their own content distribution network (CDN).These 'DIY CDNs' of big customers would lead to a decline of business from Akamai's biggest customers. That prospect crashed the shares, despite a 10% revenue beat in the third quarter of 2015 (and a 4 cents earnings beat).The shares managed a partial recovery after the fourth quarter earnings were published with a whopping 10 cents earnings beat (to an EPS of $0.72) and revenues being 8% above expectations.The company also predicted Q1 would be better, and announced a reorganization and authorized a potentially massive buyback program of up to $1 billion, some 12% of outstanding shares (at the time).During the CC after the third quarter figures were published, the company delved into the DIY problem of big clients, and argued that the problem would gradually decrease over time. The part of revenue they raked in declined from 17% a year ago to 10% in the third quarter.The company also argued that underlying growth (that is, taking those big 'DIY' customers out of the equation) was very healthy, at 15%.Perhaps, more importantly, the company is also managing to position itself successfully as an internet security company. For instance, the revenues of the cloud-based security services are growing by 46% and already constitute an interesting part of revenues ($95M of $584M in total).The total performance of security solutions is accelerating and achieved 19% growth to 60% (or $345M) of total revenue, and this part of the business enjoys a somewhat higher margin.The company is also introducing a raft of new security products and services in the near future, either developed in-house or acquired, such as the excellent Soha Systems, the product of which allows (Q3CC):Only a third of its existing customers buy these security products, and there is ample room to grow still. It's a hot topic, of course, with the unprecedented DOS attacks last week. The company even has a service (Fast DNS) that offers protection in many cases.Media delivery solutions (streaming live video) is the part of the business which is suffering most from the exodus of the six DIY companies; it shrank by 14% over the year to $188M. Without these six companies, growth would have been 5%.These Q3 figures were generally good, summed up from the Q3CC:However, GAAP EPS was just $0.43, considerably less than the non-GAAP figure, and more importantly, down significantly from last year (-12%). One of our bugbears is the share-based compensation, which is excluded from the non-GAAP earnings.To put that into perspective, it was literally said during the Q3CC that the share buyback was to counteract the dilution from share-based compensation, which is why it really should be treated as part of earnings.Akamai is hardly the only company to sin against this, but it is odd to see share-based compensation generally being excluded from earnings, and then compensated up by what is supposed to be another positive for shareholders - share buybacks.On the other hand, free cash flow was very high at a whopping 29% of revenue ($172M for Q3 and $444M for the first nine months of the year).The company has $773M left of its $1B share buyback program and has approximately $1B in net cash on the balance sheet.ConclusionAnalysts expect an EPS of $2.66 this year, rising to $2.89 in 2017. With the shares at $70, we think quite a bit of the acceleration in growth has already been priced in, especially given that the shares are massively overbought (the RSI closed at over 90 on Friday!)The company is improving and it is strategically placed in a growth market (internet security). But there is still some drag from DIY customers (and by extension, the customers of these, like the cloud businesses of Amazon, Google and Microsoft).That should taper off from Q1 2017, so overall revenue growth is expected to increase, but this is well expected and to a considerable degree priced in already, in our view. Meanwhile, the red-hot shares should cool off a bit and one should wait for a better entry point."
3966084,71085,2016-04-18T21:08:49-04:00,"This Seeking Alpha Eye on Tech column looks at several cloud-related announcements made by Google at the media industry's NAB conference.The announcements, which include a rendering service launched with Autodesk and a CDN service that will compete against Akamai, leave Google well positioned to service the video/animation industry.The moves come amid a big cloud expansion effort, and further Google's efforts to provide advanced services for the professionals directly using its cloud platform.","Google (GOOG, GOOGL) showed up in a big way at the media industry's annual NAB conference. Today, the web giant announced:Google also announced an expansion of its Cloud Vision API, which uses AI/machine learning to classify images, extract text, and detect objects/faces - the underlying technology enables Google Photos' image-analysis features.Source: GoogleAnd the company took its content delivery network, known as Cloud CDN, into beta. CDN giant Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) is among the companies whose offerings Cloud CDN, which should benefit from Google's large fiber network, will be competing with. As is Amazon, which offers AWS clients its CloudFront CDN service. Akamai's massive global network of CDN servers still acts as differentiator for apps in which low latency is a priority (for example, e-commerce transactions), but Google could deliver a cheap and effective solution for cloud clients looking to outsource media content delivery.Interestingly, Autodesk CEO Carl Bass suggests the huge bandwidth needs of the Maya cloud service were a reason Autodesk went with Google instead of Amazon. ""The best thing about Amazon is the ability to spin up servers quickly. When you get into production, where you have hundreds of thousands of servers running, I think the requirements change pretty dramatically."" The head of a cloud management software firm recently argued Google's huge fiber infrastructure delivers bandwidth cost savings relative to rival platforms.A major cloud expansion effortThe NAB announcements follow news Spotify (Private:MUSIC) is migrating its infrastructure to the Google Cloud Platform, and a report Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has used a mixture of AWS, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, and its own data center infrastructure to deliver cloud services, is now using Google and has ""significantly reduced its reliance"" on AWS. Other Google clients include Snapchat (CHAT), Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), and Sony (NYSE:SNE).Meanwhile, Google has plans to open 12 data centers over the next 12-18 months, is significantly upping its cloud-related sales and marketing spend, and is reportedly eying cloud software/services firms such as Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), Xactly (NYSE:XTLY), and Callidus (NASDAQ:CALD), with plans to move their apps to Google's infrastructure. New cloud chief Diane Greene, whose time at VMware (NYSE:VMW) gave her plenty of experience selling to enterprises, has apparently been given a large budget to take on Amazon/Microsoft and cement Google as a top-tier cloud infrastructure (""IaaS"") and app platform (""PaaS"") provider.Google vs. the competitionAmazon still has a much larger customer base, a service offering list that runs into the hundreds, and a large marketplace of supported third-party software. MSFT, meanwhile, has differentiated Azure by providing tight integration with on-premise Microsoft server software and more broadly pushing a hybrid cloud strategy to enterprises that want to keep some cloud workloads on their own infrastructures.But (with the help of its historical infrastructure strengths), Google has won high marks for its cloud performance and pricing, which are often considered best-in-class. And - as SA contributor BayesianLearner recently pointed out while highlighting Google's TensorFlow machine learning software library - GOOG has also been able to stand out by creating a slew of advanced tools and services that appeal to developers. With today's announcements, the company is set to do the same for content creators.There are still many billions of dollars worth of on-premise IT workloads due to move to the cloud over the next several years, as well as a large opportunity to support major cloud service providers (such as Spotify) for whom performance and scalability are big deals. In spite of a relatively slow start, Google is now looking well positioned to take advantage of the opportunity."
3979927,57891,2016-06-05T10:55:54-04:00,Cloud solutions are the future of an economy moving towards digitization.AKAM's product platforms are trying to offer solutions to some of the most pressing challenges in the space of digital security and cloud based data management.Strong numbers in fiscal 2015 show the company's ability to develop sustainable solutions in a field where data management and security is fast becoming a major inflection point for corporations.,"A globalised and hyper connected world has created significant challenges and opportunities for global corporations to cater to the needs of this forever online and connected population. To realise it, action needs to be taken to overcome the challenges of technology and move on the path of innovation and fast delivery.Adapting content for multiple devices, balancing the trade-offs in delivering a personalized experience without impacting performance, managing security and maintaining costs can slow businesses down.Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM), engaged in the business of cloud based business solutions is trying to solve this problem by offering what it calls the ""Akamai Intelligence Platform""; a platform providing extensive reach, coupled with unmatched reliability, security, visibility and expertise. The platform manages the underlying complexities of the Internet and conducting business in the cloud. As an overlay to the public Internet, it's a distributed network of servers and intelligent software that constantly monitors web conditions and gets users closer to the content they crave. 90% of all Internet users are only a single network hop away from Akamai.The unique solutions developed by AKAM gives them a significant edge over its other competitors and puts them on the path of high growth.Financial performance in a gistFY15 was financially a very strong and successful year for AKAM. It generated $2.2 billion in revenue, up 16% on constant currency basis over FY14. As a result, AKAM is part of an elite group of 11 U.S. public Internet software and services companies that has generated over $2 billion in annual revenue.AKAM's performance in Security Solutions business crossed $1 billion in revenue in FY15, making this its largest solution category. Contributing to that result were the Cloud Security Solutions, which grew 54% for the year to touch the annual revenue run rate of nearly $300 million. AKAM continued to showcase strong profitability indicators in FY15, generating non-GAAP net income of $454 million, up 6% over FY14 in constant currency terms.I believe AKAM's strong FY15 financial performance demonstrates that its business is strong, growing, and highly profitable, validating its comprehensive strategy to make the Internet fast, reliable, and secure for the consumers.Key growth factorsThe company's prime focus is to create technologies that deliver on 4 counts, essentially solve these four major problems as listed below, and they think disrupting these will create significant value advantage for AKAM.· Delivering video over the Internet with unparalleled quality, scale and affordability.· Providing near instant performance for websites and apps on any device, anywhere.· Securing websites and data centers from cyber attacks that aim to disrupt their online operations, corrupt their data or steal sensitive information.· Scaling enterprise networks to handle growing cloud workloads efficiently and securely.Cyber security in particular is an area that is fast becoming a major area of concern for the consumers and AKAM sees incredible business opportunity in this vertical.In addition to data protection, AKAM's cloud-based security solutions offer substantial advantages such as quick implementation without the need for data center hardware, easy deployment across a wide range of web infrastructures and enhanced performance for web applications.When deploying AKAM's security solutions, there is no need to upgrade or replace hardware to meet ever changing threats. Its cloud security infrastructure is designed to enable customers to rapidly deploy a known standard set of security protection across all of their websites, regardless of how or where they are hosted. This means that Akamai's solutions can be used in an always on proactive mode which provides substantially improved security for websites and applications.The Cloud Security Solutions are also differentiated by the quality of AKAM's security data. With a unique global platform, AKAM is able to gather more than 20 terabytes of security data every day. It processes this data using real-time behavioural analysis and machine learning algorithms to continuously improve the level of protection their platforms offer.Moving forward, AKAM plans to expand its suite of security solutions to also protect enterprise employees from phishing and malware attacks. its first offering in this area is scheduled to be released in FY17, and it will make use of the company's successful AnswerX recursive DNS platform to block access to malicious sites that propagate malware or aid in the exfiltration of confidential corporate data.Through partnerships with many of the world's leading carriers, AKAM's AnswerX platform is already being used on a daily basis in tens of millions of homes around the world to block access to undesirable content. By leveraging the AnswerX platform to provide security for its enterprise customers, it plans to substantially expand the addressable market for its security solutions.In the long run, I believe that the market for enterprise security solutions in the cloud could exceed AKAM's current market for protecting websites and applications and presents a significant growth opportunity for AKAM to explore.Moving forward, AKAM's ""Media Delivery Solutions"" vertical generated ~$1 billion of revenue in FY15 and with strong profit margins. The growth rate of its media business and of the company as a whole is influenced by the revenue that it receives from a few very large customers. Over the last few years, AKAM's largest two customers, in particular, have comprised about 13% of Akamai's overall revenue and AKAM forecasts that these customers will for the foreseeable future continue to be the dominating revenue churners for the company in this vertical.AKAM's advantages over alternative solutions include its unique approach of streaming content through a global network of 200,000 edge servers located close to end users, which allows it to bypass congested middle mile peering points, resulting in a more reliable viewing experience for end users.Its communication and video transport protocols, which are designed to deliver the kind of higher quality picture that is expected by users and broadcasters alike, combined with AKAM's client-side software, which is now installed on over 100 million devices around the world is designed to greatly improve quality scale while also lowering costs.It is hard to predict how quickly the demand for video services will increase, but as OTT grows, I believe Akamai is in an excellent position to benefit with its ability to deliver broadcast level quality at enormous scale and at an affordable price point.Closing thoughtsThe world is clearly moving towards the cloud, and with corporations expanding and people feeling the need to always stay connected with the latest information in their respective domain, cloud security and smooth data flow management is the need of the hour. I believe, basis the above discussion that AKAM has put itself in a sweet spot to leverage their technology abilities and take advantage of this changing business and social technology paradigm. I rate the company a buy and a definite addition to your portfolio."
3985799,98236,2016-07-01T14:00:00-04:00,"Akamai has become a company with normal investment parameters after spending its formative years as the poster child for the evils of the .com era.The company still does many of the things it always has done but has now developed a large and rapidly growing revenue stream in Web and Cloud security solutions.The company continues to dominate the market for content delivery with a current market share estimated at 53% despite fierce competition from at least five major vendors.The company's shares have been conspicuously weak since October 28, 2015, when the company reduced guidance due to two large domestic customers starting DIY projects.The bad news seems to be well priced into the shares and expectations for the balance of this year seem very conservative and beatable.","Akamai: A trove of memories from the storied pastWhen I think about Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM), the first things that come to mind are those frenzied years at the end of the 1990s and the Internet bubble. Irrational exuberance, b to this, b to that. A little bit of the Russian debt crisis, a little bit of the crisis with Long-Term Capital management… and oh yes, Akamai was part of that story.Yes, Akamai still does the things it has always done and it is still led by a very gifted man, Dr. Tom Leighton, who developed the ideas behind web content delivery, but this is not your father's Akamai - or even the Akamai of my memory.It is hard to believe that there's now a generation of investors arising that doesn't remember some of the lurid tales of that era, or come to that, the lurid tales of Akamai itself. So many names of that era have simply ceased to exist or they have long since been bought by other companies that were bought by other companies. PeopleSoft, Siebel, ITWO, Ariba. I remember my first purchase from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) when the company was just about cheap books and no sales tax. Of course, it all ended badly and it almost destroyed Akamai in the process.But this phoenix has risen so to speak and is now enjoying something like a comfortable middle age without all of the trading highlights from a long ago time.Akamai has always been about content delivery and if you are anywhere over the age of say 45, you might remember the company as the first pioneer of the streaming video concept. The company is still the leader in web-based content delivery services. These days, however, content delivery is not everything. These days, the CEO talks about protecting connected, autonomous cars from malicious attempts to take control of the vehicle and deny service. It is really a different world out there.The company launched commercial service in the spring of 1999 and bragged about having Yahoo (YHOO) as a charter customer. Times really do change.The company went public as a 14-month old start up having generated just $1.2 million of revenue. No matter - in those years, revenues didn't matter all that much and considering any other criteria classified you as a dinosaur who couldn't understand the new paradigm. The company sold 9 million shares at $26, but by the end of the first day of trading, the price was $145.As there were then some 91 million-plus shares outstanding, the market cap was an incredible $13.2 billion. EV/S - my goodness, how could one be so 1995? Investors clamored to get on the train even if they had no idea of what stops it might make and where was the final destination. The stock went on to peak at no less than $345/share on a day in which its share price increased by no less than 72%.After all, the company was stocked by some of the best minds from MIT and indeed, it was said in those years that MIT grad students were employed by the company to get the coffee and to bring in sack lunches. Dr. Tom Leighton was the company founder and was and remains the heart and soul of the company's vision. Dr. Leighton's specialty is that of algorithms for network applications - really the stuff that makes fast content delivery possible. What could possibly go wrong? Actually, the major issue for Akamai wasn't that things went wrong but that it staffed in anticipation of hyper-hyper growth and all they got was growth. It should never have become a public company in 1993 - but such was the environment.Of course, the bubble burst and this company was almost buried by the wave. It spent several years in one of Dante's circles - far below the first circle that Solzhenitsyn had made famous. By August 2002, the shares traded at $.75 before the company began its very long journey out of whatever circle of hell it inhabited. I think the history lesson is long enough. Nowadays, the company generates more than $2 billion a year in revenues and is comfortably profitable with GAAP operating margins in 2015 of over 21% and with cash flow last year of $764 million.So like many people who went through a rambunctious childhood, the company has settled down into middle-aged responsibility. It is still a volatile stock. This year alone, the shares made a low on February 9 at the bottom of the tech panic when they reached $39. A couple of months later and the shares appreciated to $55 and have basically stayed in that range since that time.I find it interesting (perhaps depressing is a better term) to see just how many companies and how much revenue is coming from the cyber-security space these days. As an analyst covering the space, it is depressing as to just how many anecdotal stories one has to wade through about the audacity and dare I say mendacity of these cyber criminals. It seems as though the eternal struggle between thieves and protectors is being projected across all IT companies and will be a cultural artifact of these times.For most investors, one of the major reasons to buy Akamai shares is the company's deep and rapidly growing set of security solutions. Most people remember Akamai as a leader in content delivery. But a lot of the sizzle and the growth these days comes from security and the company's product portfolio in delivering cloud security solutions.What is the current investment thesis for this company?I think it is fair to say that the company like others has its legacy business and its growth opportunities. The company has recently revamped its operations into a new divisional structure that recognizes the growth opportunities. The media division, which is the Akamai best known to most investors, I believe, had revenues of $292 million with no revenue growth this past quarter. Part of the issue here is that the company's two largest customers are trying to build out their own delivery capabilities. Outside of those two customers, the media delivery range actually rose 11%. The impact of revenue declines from the two large customers will put pressure on normal Q2 sequential growth. At some point, revenue declines from these customers will moderate and limit the negative impact that they currently have on growth rates.The web division, which is mainly about security of different kinds had revenues of $264 million, which were up 18% year on year. And the company's Enterprise and carrier division revenues were only $12 million but increased 45% year on year.Most specifically, investors are excited about the company's Cloud Security Solutions, which grew by 46% to $82 million. They also are interested in the solutions that monitor performance of web traffic and provide security for the content that users need delivered. But the fact is the CDN market still has a significant level of unrealized opportunity. The company has some clear competitive advantages as described later but it faces what can best be described as ferocious competitors.Unlike many other companies in the software/communications space, this company appears to have more growth potential outside of the US partially because of the impact on US revenues of the two large customers mentioned earlier. Revenues there grew 27% year on year and are 30% of the total. U.S. revenues fell 2% in Q1.I think that this company does have an interesting story to tell and with its valuation being within mainly reasonable bounds, it is interesting to explore the pieces that make up the company.Looking at the HomelandAkamai has become a far more stable business than it was a decade ago. It has a huge list of well-known names both in traditional industries but also involved with the web. Overall, Akamai has 53% of the CDN market. Having such a large base of customers across many different verticals and selling multiple products, the company's revenues are not hugely dependent on a single relationship. That being said, Akamai's two largest customers account for 15% of revenue and are not growing. The company's growth overall outside of those two large customers has been 15%.The single largest investor concerns these days' center around the potential for large Akamai customers to take CDN capabilities in-house - in essence DIY. On this last conference call, analysts were questioning how pervasive the trend has been or will be. There are essentially two answers to those concerns, both of which make sense to this writer. One is that eventually customers discover that DIY is not cheaper and that the reverse is true.Akamai - and its competitors - do one thing at which they are good at. Customers will never have the expertise or want to make the requisite investments to drive costs to a minimum. The build/buy phenomena is pervasive across the software space. It may be more visible at Akamai at this moment but it is not terribly different than other internal development efforts run by many large enterprises.For example, although Akamai has separate divisions into which revenues for CDN and for performance acceleration are assigned, most users are going to want to buy both of those solutions from the same vendor. But DIY users are then stuck with the unenviable task of building their own application acceleration solutions for a market of exactly one - and that is simply not economic.Interestingly, in the last few weeks, one of the two large customers has actually signed a new three-year deal with AKAM and the company believes that the other large customer will do so shortly. Signing a deal, three years or not, doesn't mean that these customers will start growing their business with Akamai.The deals are based on minimum commitments and are based on usage. So, these customers could conceivably pay the minimum commitment. What it does mean, I think, is that even large users who want to avoid paying vendors for network services find that they need to have continued relationships with service providers such as Akamai.Many observers continue to believe that the make/buy decision is black and white. As indicated above, it is not nor is it likely to be in the future. Akamai really has cost benefits of its scale and it has, over many years, chosen to use those cost savings to reduce the cost per bit that it charges users. So, over the length of a typical contract with a large user, the savings are significant.It is one of the reasons that the company has been able to preserve a 53% market share in CDN and it is one reason that DIY projects are unlikely to become pervasive. In something like delivering bits of data, much of the consideration is around price/cost analysis and the advantages of scale and lowering costs are considerable over the terms of a typical enterprise agreement in that regard.Beyond just the basic proposition that for most customers, most of the time, that DIY will prove more expensive than buying CDN services from an outside vendor, and especially from Akamai, there is another consideration. Many companies over the years are going to try DIY and some of them are going to retain DIY just as a way of keeping their vendors ""honest."" Enterprises can have DIY and have Akamai at the same time and many actually do. Even the two large customers that are in the process of going DIY are still Akamai customers and seem likely to remain so. DIY is not an all or none proposition - it is more like shades of gray so to speak.DIY will remain an investor concern, no doubt, and it is, I believe, the major factor in the company's share price performance since the company first indicated the issue when it reported numbers at the end of October 2015. The shares are down 25% since then while the IGV index has been flat. DIY will remain a concern, potential new market entrants such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will be rumored from time to time but the company's huge installed base, its enormous investment in capacity and its reasonable pricing will probably be factors limiting issues with DIY or with additional competitors. DIY will be a concern - it bears watching and it is impacting the growth rate of Q2 and possibly a bit beyond. I do not think it to be a long-term issue especially given the state of current expectations.The other issue that has to be considered by investors is that of the so-called competitive moat. Akamai is an industry pioneer and it sells elegant solutions. It has some level of scale advantage. It is almost impossible to compete against Akamai selling a full suite of CDN capabilities - well unless you happen to be Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and do not care about the economics of the matter.But there are plenty of niche players that do one or two things really well. Indeed, some companies in some niches do what they do better than Akamai according to some industry analysts. If readers are looking for a competitive moat similar to that which contributor Paolo Santos says will be the outcome of the iPhone 8 in a glass case - that really does not and will not exist in CDN or really in any of the other parts of the Akamai world.Overall, the company's impressive base of customers is both a good thing and a bad thing. It is hard to find large new customers in the world that haven't either bought from Akamai or gone with solutions offered by industry competitors. In the IT world, it is rare to see a company with a 53% market share.Market studies suggest that the overall CDN opportunity is growing significantly. Akamai's CDN can expand because of the amount of content that uses the company's platform is growing at 30%/year although price increases restrict the revenue growth of the market. But there are just not that many large new name logos that stream meaningful amounts of traffic that would help the growth of Akamai's media delivery business.Akamai CDN grows primarily because the company offers additional features, because its customers send more content across the delivery network and because they use the delivery network in different functional areas. Akamai has obviously benefited from the significant growth of the mobile cohort of consumer web experiences. The company also is benefiting from the need to deliver more image content as compared to text and to keep network performance stable despite delivering a greater amount of pictorial and graphic content.Overall, the company's network encompasses 216,000 servers on 1,500 networks. Akamai customers include the top 30 media businesses, all of the top 10 insurance carriers, all of the top global e-commerce sites, all branches of the US military all of the major sports leagues, and on and on.The CDN market is hotly competitive and the current competitors are more focused and more financially secure than the competitors of the past. The largest competitors include EdgeCast, Level 3 (NYSE:LVLT), Incapsula, Instant Logic and Akaya. These companies do not try to do all things for all users.EdgeCast, which is owned by Verizon, does try to compete against Akamai across the spectrum. So, its ownership gives it the potential to try to remain competitive with Akamai. But this is a capital-intensive business. Buying 250,000 servers to match Akamai is possible but companies like Verizon have other demands for their capital resources.The other companies are more specialized. Akaya is a specialist in what is called the wide-area augmentation system. Most observers think that Akaya has this market locked up although Akamai has partnered with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) to try to develop competitive was solutions. WAAS could be a growth market for Akamai CDN but the odds are against the company becoming an important competitor in that sub-space.Incapsula is a specialist in cyber-security for CDNs. It is a part of Imperva (NYSE:IMPV). Imperva has recently hit what might best be described as a rough patch and Elliot has purchased a 10% stake in the company. Obviously, web security is a focus for AKAM. It is possible that with some of the issues of the parent of Incapsula, the environment is favorable.The other two competitors of note are Level 3, which can compete in terms of available bandwidth and Instant Logic, which has reinvented the way web applications are delivered. There are industry observers who believe that the Instant Logic technology is a game changer and that Akamai needs to spend on acquisitions to remain competitive.Overall, the CDN market remains fragmented and competitive. The market opportunity remains staggering. Even now, after years of growth, the market potential for CDN remains more or less untapped. One market research firm says that the market will grow from about $5 billion in revenue that was achieved last year to almost $16 billion by 2020. That's a lot of potential and the relatively low growth rate for Akamai in the market is an opportunity, I believe.Apparently, there is more market potential in CDN than is believed by many observers. Akamai, excluding the two customers looking for a DIY solution, believes it can grow CDN solutions at around 10%-11% for the foreseeable future. It is clear that such an expectation is not reflected in consensus forecasts. On the other hand, Akamai certainly ought to be able to do better than 10%-11% growth in the CDN space if the market is really growing at 20%-plus.Where is the sizzle?When Akamai started, new start-up companies could obtain stratospheric valuations just by mentioning the words ""Web"" and ""Streaming Media."" Some think these days that the words ""Cloud"" and IoT"" are the equivalents. Not at all. There are cloud names that are overvalued - but they are, at least, real companies. And the IoT is here and visible - even Akamai has solutions that play in that market.There is, however a fair amount of ""enthusiastic sizzle"" for enterprises that say they are in the cloud security market and Akamai has a decent sized revenue stream coming from solutions in that space.It is difficult to describe website and mobile performance solutions as sexy. They might not be all that sexy but they are certainly a significant market opportunity in which this company participates. Even with two sets of buckets being reported it is hard to measure the solutions that are part of website and mobile performance enhancement. I think that these solutions were about $235 million last quarter and they are, at that rate, the largest bucket at Akamai. The growth rate in that segment, based on the information that has been supplied, was about was about 9% year on year in Q1.Most solutions that improve the performance of web sites basically have to do with data compression. On mobile device, application performance is even more important than it is on PCs. The users are… well mobile, and haven't an infinite amount of time in which lo look at web sites. The statistics about the impact of response times on commerce on mobile sites is pretty much what might be imagined. One recent survey said that an increase of 1 second in latency induces 97% of potential shoppers to abandon their carts. There are many techniques that are used to improve performance of mobile apps including the acceleration of API calls and the assembling of API calls at the edge.Akamai's Ion was launched about three years ago and has around 1,000 customers. Ion is focused on accelerating the performance of mobile websites. Does Ion have significant advantages compared to the competition? That is really difficult to determine.The market for these kinds of solutions in aggregate is supposed to grow from $5.6 billion last year to $12 billion in 2019. That's a CAGR of almost 19%. Data from other sources suggests a smaller market size and a lower CAGR. It is very much a matter of definitions and filters. Many surveys do not break their forecasts between mobile and web performance optimization. Mobile is growing far more rapidly while web is perhaps not growing at all. There are simply an incredible number of competitors who are in various silos within the performance optimization space, far more than can be covered in a report of this scope. As best I can determine, overall, Akamai appears to be maintaining its market position within the product segments in which it competes and that affords it significant growth opportunities.OK we have finally come to the sexy part of Akamai's overall product portfolio. Revenues in the Cloud Security space totaled $82 million, up by 46% from the year earlier quarter. One of the company's major areas of focus is on the threat posed by DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) intrusions. I wrote about DDoS in an earlier report I did on NTCT regarding its security portfolio. The DDoS space apparently has a CAGR of 23% and it has loads of large players many of whom also are Cloud Service Providers. Akamai recently launched a Bot Manager earlier this yearSo what does it all mean?Most readers at this point have probably read more than they feel they need to have done regarding what Akamai sells, to whom it sells it and how fast the markets are growing. Fair enough. I like to try to substantiate what I write rather than just try to scribble some guesses. But I think the investment thesis comes through plainly. It appears that Akamai ought to be able to sustain a low double-digit growth rate and possibly a bit higher for the next several years and to maintain operating margins near current levels.There will be perturbations to be sure on both sides of that number as there currently are because of the two North American DIY customers. But for the most part the company should have double-digit growth over the years. That's probably a bit above the current consensus, which calls for revenue growth this year of 7.6% rising to 12% next year. The investment case simply put rests on double-digit growth with stable or slightly rising margins and performance that modestly exceeds consensus estimates. The investment case rests on valuation, which I will detail below.It rests on competitive momentum and it rests on the relatively strong growth potentials of the markets in which the company competes. Not perhaps the Akamai that was going to take over the world back when it was launched, but a decent investment with reasonable upside and a solid balance sheet and a capital return program of some magnitude through the acquisition of shares at significant levels.A bit on valuation and timing!Akamai in its middle aged is like a cold sober man who had a misspent youth and now lives a more or less chaste life. The company currently has an enterprise value of $9.37 billion based on 176 million shares outstanding. Sales this year are estimated at $2.36 billion, which yields and EV/S of just below 4X. Reasonable for the growth, I think. The current EPS based on the estimates of 24 analysts is $2.69.As mentioned elsewhere, I think the earnings estimates could prove conservative. The company has a moderate valuation looking at comparables. The company, despite the capital intensity of the service that it sells, does generate significant cash flow because of the level of depreciation that flows through the P&L. Management does not explicitly guide cash flow - and it really doesn't guide any of the constituents either. The CFO said that Q1 is the seasonal low for operating cash flow. Q1 operating cash flow was $190 million, down from $217 million in Q2 2015, but up 90% from the year ago Q1.The major change in the year over year operating cash flow results was the turnaround of A/Rs, which benefited this Q1 by $16 million, while being a cash use of almost $33 million in the year earlier period. Operating cash flow for all of 2015 was $764 million. Given the $90 million improvement in Q1 and some modest further growth in operating cash flow in the balance of the year, I think a reasonable estimate for 2016 would be something in the range of $900-$915 million. That yields a very healthy operating cash flow margin of 38%. Obviously a company that actually builds a network in response to demand has substantial levels of CapEx.Last year, CapEx was $312 million. CapEx in Q1 of this year was $82 million compared to $79 million in Q1 2015. CapEx is more or less totally a function of network capacity growth. Given the rather modest growth projections for the balance of this year given the potential impact of the two DIY customers, I think that CapEx will be about comparable to 2015.The company is forecasting CapEx for Q2 of $90-$98 million; CapEx beyond that point reflects that, ""we have purposefully slowed down the rate and the pace… but we are continuing to make prudent investments in the business that we believe are necessary to support long-term growth and scale."" That yields free cash flow of about $610 million which would be a free cash flow yield of 6.5%. That isn't deep value to be sure but is certainly better than free cash flow yields of many other software vendors.Stock-based comp is not a major factor in either cash flow or as part of the income statement. Stock-based comp was $31 million for the quarter, down a bit from Q4 and up a bit from year-earlier levels. Stock-based comp was 5.4% of revenues and was 19% of non-GAAP profits.Akamai has $1.5 billion of gross cash and has $623 million of convertible notes that are outstanding. Like many companies, this one generates lots of cash offshore and the debt ameliorates that problem. The company repurchased 2.2 million shares last quarter and the company is working with a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. Overall, the company, at a minimum, plans to repurchase sufficient shares to prevent dilution from stock based comp. and depending on business conditions it plans to ""opportunistically"" return more.As mentioned earlier, the shares of this company have performed poorly since the company announced the issues with its DIY back in October. By this time, there's little bad news to come on that score. On the score of the two DIY customers, CFO James Benson said, ""Yeah, so on the guidance-I'd say we're being cautious to be frank - we have good visibilities within the quarter for those two customers. And I think what we are saying is that we're not 199% sure on the back half of the year, so we're being a little cautious in our projection that it could decline further.There are things that could stabilize it... there are features and capabilities that could cause it to grow as well, but I'd say what we're trying to provide you is a level of cautiousness."" The inference I draw is that at least with regards to those two customers, the forecast represents the lower bound of expectations and there is potential lagniappe to be had. The CFO went on to say that the two customers are on long-term contracts with minimum commitments, and that the customers have been spending substantially above those minimum commitments.I have no particular insight as to how Q2 will have come out. The company has had a generally decent record in its forecasts but not without a blemish or two. But overall, given the very low level of growth expectations, the overall strength of the end markets and the conservatism around the possible results of the two customers, I think that this is as reasonable time as any to make a commitment to the shares. As some readers ask in their comments, my personal plans will be to wait through pre-announcement season before making any commitment to the shares and I will consider what I want to do regarding a commitment after that time.Wrapping Up!"
3968638,20875,2016-04-27T15:39:18-04:00,,"When it comes to CDNs talking about the performance of their network, Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) wins the award for using the most vague, generic and high-level terms, providing little to no definition of what they actually mean. On Akamai’s Q1 earnings call, the company used the term “quality” eleven times to describe their ability to deliver video and said they “differentiate” themselves based on their “level of performance”. The problem is, when you look at real measurement numbers, not marketing terms, Akamai doesn’t perform better than the other CDNs and many times, performs much worse.On the day of their earnings call, Akamai was ranked 9th in performance, based on throughput, in the U.S., as measured by third-party company Cedexis. Akamai was beaten out by Level 3, EdgeCast (Verizon (NYSE:VZ)), Highwinds and others.Drilling down into specific regions, in Russia, Akamai’s ranked 4th in latency measurements from key locations around the world, beaten out by other providers. In China, Akamai didn’t even make it into the top 7 at all. This performance data is based on science and not marketing hype or anything else. Just actual performance measurements.Last year, Akamai was one of half a dozen CDNs Yahoo used for the NFL webcast, and Akamai was the only CDN out of all of them that had performance issues. And yet, Akamai continues to feed the market this garbage about “advanced video delivery capabilities”, “unparalleled quality and scale” and a “high-quality video experience”. And don’t get me started on this nonsense about “edge” delivery. All the major CDN are at the edge too! Akamai is not doing anything different at the “edge”. They say their servers are “located close to end users”. So are their competitors. In fact, Comcast’s (NASDAQ:CMCSA) CDN servers are even closer than Akamai’s inside Comcast’s network, since Comcast owns the last mile. From a performance standpoint, based on real metrics, no one has better performance than Comcast, on their own network.Akamai is not doing anything unique with their network footprint, and as we have learned in the market, there are many different ways to deliver content, with good performance. There is not only one right way to do it. How do we know this? Because customers tell us. The whole reason so many customers have a multi-CDN strategy, and split traffic amongst multiple providers is that when it comes to commodity CDN services, all of the major CDNs are usually very close to one another in performance, when looking at real metrics. If one CDN performed that much better, or had some kind of real advantage, customers wouldn’t use multiple CDNs.If there is one thing even worse that Akamai keeps talking about other than generic phrases about performance, it is the number of servers they have deployed on their network. Akamai’s still pitching that as a value, like it’s the year 2005 when customers bought CDN services based on how many simultaneous streams a network could support or how many servers it has. Today, no customer cares how many servers any CDN provider has. They want good performance and reliability, and how the CDN sets up their network from a topology standpoint, or how many servers they need, is up to the CDN. If I buy 500,000 servers tomorrow, and deploy them in my home, isn’t my network now better than Akamai’s? Of course not. Because the number of servers you have is only one of many things that determines the quality and scale of your network. Transit capacity and locations, public and private peering, interconnects etc. all these things and more determine quality, not just the number of servers.On the call Akamai said that, “because of our unique approach of streaming content through a global network of more than 200,000 edge servers located close to end users, which allows us to bypass congested middle mile peering points, resulting in a more reliable viewing experience for end users.” There is nothing unique about Akamai’s model at all. All CDNs work to bypass congestion on the Internet, that’s what a CDN is! And if Akamai’s network is so “unique”, why did they have performance failures for major live events for NASA and Yahoo last year and don’t show up first on performance ratings from companies like Cedexis? At times, Akamai will show up at the top of the Cedexis charts, but more often than not, when I check the reports, Akamai isn’t first on the list based on the measurement of throughput and latency.Akamai also mentioned on the call that they are investing in OTT and the example they gave was that they have opened a new Broadcast Operations Control Center that monitors all the live streams on their network. Welcome to 2016 Akamai. Your competitors have been doing that for years. You’re only just now realizing you need to have a “highly trained technical staff and a host of monitoring, analytics, reporting, quality and availability measurement tools” to monitor the streams on your network. That’s nothing special. Highlighting that you are only doing that now, to the degree you are, isn’t a good thing, it’s shows just how behind your competitors you are, when it comes to aspects of OTT.Akamai still has no real OTT workflow platform. Amazon acquired Elemental. Limelight acquired Delve. Verizon acquired Uplynk. Level 3 acquired Servecast. Comcast acquired thePlatform. IBM acquired multiple companies. All of Akamai’s competitors have acquired companies to put in place an end-to-end broadcast platform, for VOD and live linear, and Akamai still does not have one. They have pieces, but nothing that’s a true platform.Akamai needs to spend less time talking about the number of servers they have and trying to convince us they are unique being at the “edge” or that their CDN delivery is “unparalleled”. It’s all marketing fluff and as an industry, we’re not buying into Akamai’s nonsense. Akamai needs to fix their messaging, start talking real numbers, start defining words with real methodology and backup their vague and high-level statements with real data. Otherwise, it’s nothing but hot air."

3613736,20875,2015-10-28T11:24:17-04:00,"Akamai reported Q3 earnings and announced that revenue from their media delivery business would be flat or down for Q4, year-over-year.Akamai suggested the reason they expect media growth rates to continue to moderate in the ""near term"" was due to customers having ""less traffic growth overall.""The cause of what Akamai is seeing is a result of Apple, Microsoft and Facebook moving a larger percentage of their traffic to their in-house delivery networks.","Yesterday, Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) reported Q3 earnings and announced that revenue from their media delivery business would be flat or down for Q4, year-over-year. For Q3 their media revenue was up only 5% year-over-year and the company said, ""traffic and revenue growth slowed considerably in some of our largest media accounts."" Following guidance that was well below expectations, Akamai stock dropped $9.76 a share in after hours trading. It was an odd earnings call as Akamai suggested the reason they expect media growth rates to continue to moderate in the ""near term"" was due to customers having ""less traffic growth overall."" Except that's not what's happening.The cause of what Akamai is seeing is a result of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) moving a larger percentage of their traffic to their in-house delivery networks. This is a trend that all three companies, especially Apple, have been doing for some time, but in the past 45-60 days, Microsoft specifically has taken a lot of their traffic in-house, which is lost business for the CDNs. Akamai said the impact of what they are seeing is ""expected to be magnified by their do-it-yourself efforts"" but then said ""most of the impact is from less traffic growth overall."" Apple, Facebook and Microsoft aren't seeing ""less traffic"" and certainly aren't seeing lower traffic growth rates overall, compared to the past few quarters. So Akamai's explanation really makes no sense.All you have to do is trace where their content is being delivered from to see less of it is coming from third-party CDNs. Akamai said they, ""believe kind of the bigger slowdown in traffic here is that traffic overall is slowing."" And why do they ""believe"" that? What data do they have to show that Apple and Microsoft's overall traffic is slowing? I haven't seen any such data in the market, from third-party companies that track traffic growth among consumer services. And when Akamai was asked why customer traffic is slowing, like Akamai claims, they responded to the question by saying, ""why it's slowing for our customers is difficult for us to access."" Confused yet?In the Q&A potion of the call, Akamai said, ""if the overall traffic is less growing at a slower rate and less than expected well, there's a tendency to fill up the do-it-yourself effort first, and then we would get the remainder which leaves us with even slower traffic growth."" Earlier Akamai said overall traffic was slowing, but then later they say ""if"" it was slowing, and when they say ""less than expected."" Less than who expected, Akamai or the customer? Because if Akamai simply overestimated the percentage of traffic a customer who owns their own CDN is going to give Akamai, that's not a ""slower rate"" of traffic growth, that's just bad estimating on Akamai's part.Heading into 2016, Akamai expects media growth rates to continue to moderate in the ""near term,"" which isn't good news for them, especially considering how much they continue to talk about the impact OTT services have on their business. One thing many may not realize is that while OTT services are growing, the ones that are seeing the most growth don't have their content being delivered via third-party CDNs. Akamai also said it was ""worth noting that media pricing overall has continued to decline at normal historical levels,"" but they didn't say what those levels are or give out any numbers. For most customers, that is true, and the decline in pricing is stable, down about 20% this year. But for the largest handful of customers, who push the most traffic, pricing is down more this year than last, in the 40%-50% range.Akamai also said that ""competition in the media business remains constant but is not expected to be a significant factor in our traffic and revenue estimates."" This also is suspect as the term ""significant factor"" could mean a lot of things and doing some trace routes on those who have lots of traffic growth shows competition impacting Akamai. To highlight one example, looking at Sony's (NYSE:SNE) traffic for the PS4 now shows that Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT) has been added as another delivery network, in addition to what Akamai and Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) are already delivering. So while Level 3's share of traffic may not be taking away traffic Akamai and Limelight already have, it's less traffic they would have gotten, with Level 3 now being included.Note that when Akamai says ""media"" they don't necessarily mean ""video."" Media includes video but also non-video content and software downloads. So there could be other media customers involved that aren't video related that are also impacting the growth of revenue from Akamai's media customers. The company also said they have ""purposefully slowed down the rate and pace of head count additions and discretionary spending to align with our near-term top line growth expectations,"" which isn't surprising.One thing Akamai is still doing well is using vague and high-level statements without actually saying anything. The company mentions their new deal with Microsoft Azure saying, ""Microsoft sales force is also planning to sell Akamai's market-leading acceleration and security solutions."" While that is true, what they don't say is ""when"" Microsoft plans to start selling it. Because when I asked Microsoft, they said they would only be re-selling Akamai's CDN services and would not be re-selling value add services any time soon. Akamai also said their ""overall media traffic is still projected to grow at a substantial pace"" but again, substantial is a useless word without definition.As usual Akamai also went on to mention how many ""edge servers"" they have, which is a useless stat since we all know that capacity and performance is measured by more than just the number of servers a CDN has. No customer buys CDN services based on a server number from a vendor. Some parts of Akamai's business are still being marketed like it's 2002, when customers focused on server count and the simultaneous number of streams a CDN could support. Akamai also called out their ""superior communication and video transport protocols which are designed to deliver the kind of higher-quality picture that is expected by users and broadcasters alike,"" except that Akamai had problems delivering the 60fps stream for Yahoo's NFL stream this past Sunday.Akamai needs to focus more on data, numbers and giving the market real insight into their business, as opposed to lots of generic, vague and high-level words and phrases. At the end of the call Akamai said, ""media growth rates are going to be effectively flat to up very significantly, or down very significantly."" Flat, up, or down. There aren't any other options.Disclosure: None."
3452186,58481,2015-08-20T14:41:20-04:00,"Media content providers have been hit hard over the past several weeks from increased pressure from cord cutting.Akamai is a leading content delivery provider that stands to benefit from increased streaming content across mobile devices.The stock is fairly valued today, but is a strong buy on any significant pullback.","Earlier this month, Disney (NYSE:DIS) set off a firestorm among the media stock when the company announced ESPN experienced modest subscriber losses during the quarter and gave a candid view of where technology is going over the next several years. Disney CEO, Bob Iger, even went as far as to say he can see a day when ESPN could be sold directly to customers in an ""over-the-top"" platform.This frank discussion by one of the most powerful media entertainment companies in the world caused a dramatic sell-off across the industry. Investors and analysts feared cord cutting is the wave of the future and the traditional massive cash cow TV packages that Disney, CBS (CBS), Viacom (NASDAQ:VIAB), and Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (CMCSK) have enjoyed over the decades could be replaced by over-the-top content.Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM)Akamai is a global leading CDN with over 175,000 servers in over 100 countries with over 1,300 networks. Akamai's infrastructure is responsible for delivering 15-30% of all web traffic and accounts for over 2 trillion daily Internet interactions. The company serves the top 30 media and entertainment companies, all top 20 global e-commerce sites, 9 out of the top 10 social media sites, iTunes, and all the major US sports leagues. Akamai is perfectly situated to benefit from cord cutters and media content providers adopting OTT service options. The company has been heavily investing in its infrastructure to provide expanded capacity to meet growing demand that it expects in 2016.While the largest content and media sites, such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), have built out their own CDNs, this option is far too expensive for many companies. Akamai offers its customers enhanced web performance to handle large fluctuations in traffic, cloud security solutions to protect against the largest distributed denial-of-service and web application attacks without reducing performance, and media delivery solutions for instant access to high definition video content on any screen.Through the first 6 months of 2015, revenue is up 15%, with particular strength from its emerging cloud security business. The company has increased capital expenses over 50% to $233 million through the first half of the year as the company gears up for what they expect to be a substantial increase in OTT traffic in 2016. In particular, the company expects to benefit from a major increase in streaming video worldwide from the 2016 summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, as well as the growing cord-cutting trend.Once Akamai winds down their increased capital expenditures, the company should see a big jump in free cash flow. Through the first 6 months of 2015, cash flow from operations is up 25% to $363 million. The $79 million increase in capex has resulted in flat free cash flow YTD. Once capital expenses stabilize in 2016, free cash flow should increase 25-35% year over year to roughly $425-$450 million.AKAM Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsAkamai has been widely rumored to be gearing up for the eventual launch of the new Apple TV (NASDAQ:AAPL) subscription service. While rumors have persisted for years about when Apple would launch its TV subscription service, a new Bloomberg report states the company is now aiming for a 2016 launch. According to the report, negotiations to license programming from TV networks, such as those owned by CBS and 21st Century Fox (NASDAQ:FOXA), are progressing slowly. If rumors are true, Apple could eventually revolutionize television the same way it did for the music industry through iTunes. In order to accommodate the potentially massive new internet traffic that such a service would generate, would be a huge catalyst for Akamai. Even if Apple spent the millions and millions of dollars needed to develop a massive CDN, like Netflix did, it would still take time and Akamai would still be an immediate beneficiary.TakeawayWhether it's through Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Chromecast, Amazon's Fire TV, Hulu, Netflix, HBO Go, the revamped Apple TV, or the widely rumored Apple subscription TV service, content is rapidly migrating to an online streaming platform. To achieve the most reliable performance for high definition on multiple devices without buffering, these services will widely depend on CDNs. With Akamai's extensive CDN, it is perfectly positioned to benefit from this trend. The company has been heavily investing to expand its infrastructure to prepare for the increase in OTT traffic in 2016.I've put Akamai on my watch list to buy on any significant pullback. When the company provided soft Q3 guidance in late July, the stock fell 10% before regaining all that lost ground the next day. The stock historically tends to only briefly hit its 200-day moving average before sharply bouncing higher.AKAM data by YChartsI plan to remain on the sidelines in the immediate future and hope the stock can pull back to more attractive levels. Based on the strong catalysts and the company standing to capitalize on a shift in consumer habits, I think the stock is fairly valued at current levels.AKAM PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsAs you can see from the chart, the stock's P/E value is slightly higher than its historical performance, which unfavorably skews the risk/reward ratio. Based on the charts, I believe, in the short term, the downside potential outweighs the upside. Other than the September Apple event where the company is expected to unveil a revamped Apple TV set-top box, there aren't many catalysts on the horizon. The company is banking on 2016 to be a record breaking year for content delivery, so there's likely time to be patient to wait for a pullback. I'll look to be a buyer when the stock pulls back closer to its 200-day moving average around $68/share."

        Beats on revenue and EPS couldn't counteract poor Q1 2017 guidance.
        I think the market is right to push the stock price down, but a 10% drop is an overreaction.
        I rate Akamai Technologies a Speculative Buy on the drop.","IntroductionThis article is my 45th installment in a segment called ""Buy on the Drop?"" in which I choose a stock that recently experienced a large decrease in price and give a recommendation on whether investors should ""Buy on the Drop"" or not. The recommendations are Sell, Hold, Speculative Buy, Buy and Strong Buy. This is a recurring segment, so if you enjoy the article, ""Follow"" me to see more. You can read about my previous installment discussing Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR) here.Akamai Gets CrushedAkamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) announced fourth quarter 2016 results after the close Tuesday, and what was initially interpreted as favorable report was found to be disappointing when management provided Q1 2017 guidance below expectations. Akamai projected revenue significantly below consensus estimates and EPS below estimates as well, which sent investors scrambling for the exits.AKAM data by YChartsThe initial jump that investors saw after hours for AKAM was likely due to the market digesting Q4 without the guidance for Q1 2017, which was not included in the company's press release. However, when guidance was issued on the conference call, the stock dropped like a rock. Was this drop warranted? Was guidance for next quarter really that bad? Is this a buying opportunity? All questions I will attempt to address in this article.For those unaware, Akamai is a content delivery provider with hundreds of thousands of servers throughout 120 countries whose goal is to provide faster and more secure internet connectivity to its customers. The company has now reported year-over-year (""YoY"") revenue growth in 12 straight quarters, though that growth has slowed somewhat recently. The end of 2015 was a very rough period for the stock as the increases in revenue began to slow down and growth investors fled.AKAM went from the mid $70s down to the mid $40s in just three months:AKAM data by YChartsHowever, since that time the stock has seen a resurgence in 2016, with shares up 47% over the past 12 months even with the 10% drop Wednesday. Where will the price go next? Let's take a look at the fourth quarter report.Akamai reported Q4 2016 revenue of $616 million, which beat by $11 million and was an increase of 6.4% YoY, and EPS of $0.72, which beat by 4 cents and was unchanged YoY. Gross margin was up 1 bps sequentially and unchanged YoY. Straight away there's a noticeable concern here, mainly that revenue grew more than 6% yet EPS stayed put. A look at the income statement for the quarter will reveal that the jump in revenue was not enough to offset substantial increases in R&D and G&A expenses.While this may very well be a positive development in the long run, analysts speculated that AKAM's selloff was at least partially due to the combination of growing operating expenses and slowing top line growth. How founded these fears are remain to be seen but investors should certainly keep an eye on how revenue and operating expenses shape up in the coming quarters in regards to growth rates and their subsequent impacts on the bottom line. I'm always a fan of investing for the future rather than meeting short-term internal and Wall Street targets.Management addressed the increase in operating expenses explicitly stating:This segues into my next point which is that, investing in ""revenue growth in the longer term"" is well and good, but it must produce results. I think this is perhaps the root of the magnitude of the selloff: operating expenses are ramping up, but guidance for Q1 2017 and outlook beyond that was lackluster. On the conference call, management guided for Q1 revenue between $596 million and $610 million, which would represent YoY growth of 6.2%, and EPS of between $0.66 and $0.69, which is just a couple cents higher than Q1 2016. Of note here is 1) the same pattern of revenue growth with zero or little corresponding jump in EPS and 2) these numbers missed consensus estimates pretty significantly.This is not good and should be differentiated from my statement two paragraphs ago that meeting Wall Street targets is much less important than long-term stability and growth. For the EPS estimate, I'm not much concerned because, in most cases, when a firm grows revenue and maintains a consistent gross margin, that revenue can be fairly easily translated to the bottom line. However, missing on revenue estimates is a different beast.Sure, Wall Street estimates are not the be-all and end-all metric for gauging companies, but a given stock's valuation is often based on those estimates. At the midpoint of revenue guidance, Akamai expects to record $603 million, which is $20 million, or 3%, below consensus analyst estimates. What happens when a stock doesn't grow as fast as the market expects? The growth investors cut and run is what happens. This is not in itself a reason to sell (or buy) but it does call attention to the company's standing. Revenue growth is slowing significantly and there are legitimate concerns about how sustainable even mid-single digit top line growth will be going forward.I think much of the stock's movement in 2017 will be dependent on how successful Akamai's new investment cycle is at generating additional revenue growth. What is certain is that there will be a period of growing pains where operating expenses cut into earnings (Q4 is of course an example of this), but the crucial part for investors will be whether these increased expenses actually bear fruit. Evidently, Akamai believes this is the path forward will generate the most wealth for shareholders long-term, and while it's easy to spend money, it's not as easy to boost revenue with that money.Buying AKAM now is a bet on the company's ability to turn this renewed investment into increased sales. Because this is not guaranteed, I think an investment in the stock is a relatively speculative, medium-risk, high-reward play. Right now I think the reward outweighs the risks, but that could change quickly and the risk is not unsubstantial. With this in mind, I rate Akamai Technologies a Speculative Buy on the drop.If you want to stay up-to-date on my articles, you can ""Follow"" me by clicking ""Follow"" at the top of this page or by going to my author page.Thanks for reading!"
3464896,20875,2015-08-25T12:11:30-04:00,,"Last week I saw two reports published by Wall Street analysts suggesting that Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) still non-existent live OTT service will mean a lot of revenue for CDN provider Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM). Of course neither of the reports gave out any numbers, provided any estimates of revenue or even showed the formula anyone can use to get a rough idea of what the business would be worth. These reports need to stop being so vague and provide real numbers considering it's easy to estimate the value of the business using very simple math, which I detail below.When it comes to the topic of Apple's own CDN, I still see quite a few who say that Apple is ""reportedly building out its own CDN network,"" and they speak about it as if it's speculation. Apple is not ""reportedly"" building a CDN, they already built it and continue to expand it. Don't take my word for it, simply do a traceroute and look at how Apple is delivering their content. Apple has a CDN, with massive scale, which is not debatable. Suggesting otherwise or implying that they ""might"" have one is simply ignoring the facts.In one report an analyst said, ""we believe that Apple has used Akamai's CDN capabilities in the past."" You believe it? Why don't you confirm it? Doing a traceroute shows Apple is still using Akamai for a portion of their content delivery. They also say that Apple ""requires significant scale that its own CDN may not yet be able to handle,"" but don't say what that statement is based on. Stop using generic and vague phrases to make it sound like you know what you are talking about when you have no idea at all as to the size and scale of Apple's CDN. And while we are on the topic of OTT services, the launch of Verizon's new OTT service will not be a ""big deal"" for Akamai or provide any ""upside"" to the company as some suggest. Verizon's (NYSE:VZ) new service will run over their own CDN EdgeCast and not on Akamai.Whenever Apple rolls out their live OTT service, there are many ways they can handle the distribution of the video. They could use multiple third-party CDN providers like Akamai and Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT) to deliver everything, or they could use them in combination with their own CDN, splitting traffic among multiple providers. Apple also could use their own CDN as primary, and then use third-party CDNs for overflow and extra capacity. Apple also could simply not be involved with the delivery at all and let the content owners in the OTT service deliver the streams themselves, via contracts they already have with third-party CDNs. There are a lot of ways the video delivery can be managed and based on Apple’s history, it’s a safe bet that multiple providers would be involved.But for revenue calculations, let's just assume Apple uses Akamai to deliver 100% of the streams. The average HD stream delivered to a TV is about 3Mbps. To tablets and phones, it's about 700Kbps. We don't know how many users Apple would sign up for their service, so I'll use a number of 3M subs in the first month. Then we need to calculate how many hours per month each sub would use and for this example I'll use 30 hours a month. Then we have to decide what percentage of playback would be on the TV versus a mobile device. If we assume an even split of the traffic, it means one user, in one month, would consume 24.95GB.[3000Kbps x 60 minutes = 1.35GB per hour X 15 hours = 20.25GB. For the 50% that comes from mobile, 700Kbps x 60 minutes = 315MB per hour, x 15 hours = 4.7GB]If the traffic was being priced on per GB delivered, at a penny per GB, the value of one customer would be worth $0.25 to Akamai. Multiply that times 3M users and the value of the contract would be worth $750,000 a month. But Apple doesn't pay the CDNs based on a per GB delivered model, they pay per Mb/s (95/5). So if you assume that at any given time only 1M of the 3M users will be watching a stream concurrently, with 50% at 3Mbps and 50% at 700Kbps, it means that Apple would be using about 1.5Tb/s. Even at $1 per Mb/s, which is a high price for Apple to pay, the value to Akamai would be $1.5M a month. The numbers get bigger if you calculate them with more than 3M users a month and/or more than 30 hours a month consumed per viewer. But Apple won't get 3M subs in the first month and there's almost no chance that Apple would give Akamai 100% of the delivery.Part of the speculation of Akamai's involvement with Apple on a new OTT service is due to Akamai's recent earnings call, where the company said that their CAPEX spend would be higher than normal as they added more capacity for OTT video. But Akamai does not break out the percentage of money spent per service and at no time did they say they were adding capacity for a ""new"" OTT service. All CDNs, including Akamai, don't keep a ton of extra capacity available just sitting around unused. They operate their networks with a certain level of overflow capacity, but not more than necessary so as not to incur costs for capacity they aren't using. Akamai could simply be looking at their customers traffic growth and spending money now to put in place the capacity they need for the overall growth of the OTT business for the next 12 months.Apple's OTT service will not be a big revenue driver for Akamai or any other CDN right out of the gate. If Apple signs up tens of millions of subscribers and gives a large percentage of the delivery to third-party CDNs like Akamai, then the numbers could start to add up. But Apple would be lucky to get a few million subs, within a few quarters, with what's expected to be such a pared down selection of content available. Based on my calculations, Apple is already spending between $75M-$100M with Akamai this year. So adding a few hundred thousand dollars more a month to that for a new OTT service, or even $1M more per month, it really doesn't have a big impact on Akamai's overall numbers.Disclosure: None."
3218516,23471,2015-05-28T10:55:26-04:00,"AKAM is suitable for the Enterprising Investor following the ModernGraham approach.According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is overvalued at the present time.The market is implying 16.93% earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, but in recent years, the company's earnings growth has not been that strong.","A lot of investors and analysts considering Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) are focused primarily on qualitative speculation about the company's prospects. For example, Seeking Alpha contributor Trefis noted that the company's acquisition strategy will boost its long-term value. On the other hand, Stock Traders Daily recently focused on various valuation metrics such as the PEG ratio to determine that the company is generally attractive but carries some risk of a pull back. However, it is critical when analyzing Akamai to consider the company's intrinsic value in relation to its price.In fact, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether a company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here's a look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.AKAM data by YChartsDefensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 4/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey DataBalance Sheet - March 2015Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryAkamai does not pay a dividend.ConclusionAkamai passes the initial requirements of the Enterprising Investor but not of the more conservative Defensive Investor. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the lack of dividends and the high PEmg and PB ratios. The Enterprising Investor is only concerned by the lack of dividends. As a result, all value investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, the company has seen its EPSmg (normalized earnings) rise from $0.90 in 2011 to an estimated $1.83 for 2015. This level of earnings growth does not support the market's implied estimate for 16.93% annual growth over the next 7-10 years.In fact, the recent earnings growth has averaged nearly 21% per year, but a rate that high is very rarely attainable over the long term. As a result, the ModernGraham valuation model uses a much more conservative growth estimate and returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling below the market's price, indicating that Akamai is overvalued at the present time."

[1] The company also announced the opening of a new Security Operations Center (SOC) in Bangalore, India. [2] Security solutions is an integral part of Akamai's value added services and the company is clearly focusing on improving its capabilities on this front. We currently have a price estimate of $70 for Akamai, which implies a discount of around 4% to the market price.Akamai Bolsters Its Security Solutions CapabilitiesAkamai is a leading Content Delivery Network (CDN) provider and delivers between 15-30% of all Web traffic. [3] The company also has positioned itself as a full services provider by offering multiple value added services such as the delivery of targeted advertising, cloud-based services and security solutions to its customers. Akamai has made two big strategic moves in the last few days with a focus on security solutions. The company has decided to collaborate with Trustwave, a Chicago-based information security company. Trustwave comes to the table with its own set of cloud and managed security services, integrated technologies and a team of security experts, ethical hackers and researchers. According to Akamai, the two companies' collaborative efforts will be designed to help their customers fight more effectively against a wide range of malicious online activities through vulnerability assessment, denial of service prevention and incident response. The combination created leverages technology solutions and security services from each company's portfolio and they will provide a broader set of cyber security protections to customers, meeting a wide range of demands in a dynamic cyber security threat landscape. Security scanning and testing, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack protection, incident response and readiness, and Web application security are just some of the services and products included in the first phase of the collaboration. The collaboration gives Akamai an opportunity to publicize its product portfolio to Trustwave's 3 million strong customer base, which is spread across 96 countries. [4] A recent report by Forrester Research predicts that at least 60 percent of enterprises will encounter a breach of sensitive data in 2015. [5] Akamai senses an opportunity and is enhancing its capabilities in order to better serve existing and potential clients.Akamai also announced the opening of a new Security Operations Center in Bangalore, India. The SOC adds significant bandwidth capacity and 24/7 expertise to Akamai's extensive global cyber defense network. The Bangalore site is expected to become a major SOC for the company outside of the United States and will be at full capacity by year end. Looking at the current trends in DDoS attacks, the location of the SOC has strategic value. Akamai's Q1 2015 ""State of the Internet Security Report"" states that China was the top source country for DDoS attack traffic during the quarter, with more than 22 percent of recorded DDoS attack source traffic originating from the country. A DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack is an attempt to make a machine or network resource unavailable to its intended users. [6] DDoS attacks have become very common, with users encountering 28 such attacks each hour as of 2014. [7]The Growing Importance Of Value Added Services To AkamaiThe pure-play CDN business is becoming increasingly commoditized. Akamai is facing increased competition from rivals such as Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT), Limelight (NASDAQ:LLNW), Edgecast, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has heightened CDN pricing pressure in recent years. However, Akamai has been bolstering its performance by improving its value added services through collaborations, new launches and acquisitions. Akamai has acquired companies such as Xerocole, Prolexic, Verivue and Blaze in the past. This will help it mitigate the impact of the pure-play CDN commoditization and will help it grab a bigger share of the consumers. Akamai's value proposition has evolved beyond being the fastest content delivery network. As competitors grow increasingly capable of fast content delivery at similar prices, Akamai has positioned itself as a full services provider, touting its ability to offer multiple value-added services such as security solutions, app acceleration, delivery of targeted advertising and cloud-based services for its customers. Value-added services now account for more than 50% of Akamai's overall revenues and have higher gross margins compared to basic content delivery. This suggests that despite the commoditization of content delivery business, Akamai can improve, or at least sustain, its margins in the coming years.Disclosure: No positions."
2968276,20411,2015-03-03T09:33:35-05:00,AKAM is generally attractive.But it runs the risk of pulling back by 15 - 20% this year.Must pull back before it can move higher.,"This article defines the fair value of Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) as that relates specifically to earnings growth as that is expected in the years ahead. Our earnings growth model considers the PE multiple and peg ratio to determine whether or not Akamai Technologies is an attractive value for investors at this time.To begin, our evaluation of earnings growth comprises complete earnings cycles to avoid seasonal anomalies and we exclude onetime events to focus on truer earnings growth. We also do not believe that forward looking estimates that look beyond two years are reliable because we have found earnings expectations to change dramatically not only over multiyear timeframes, but sometimes even between quarters. Looking ahead two years seems reasonable, but beyond that is not in our opinion.Although our model does not include revenue specifically, it is important for us to point out that revenue growth at Akamai has been exceptional. It is steady, consistent, and growing. Those are very attractive qualities for investors.Recent earnings growth has also been solid, as noted in our yearly earnings growth graph for Akamai Technologies. As of the most recent release Akamai Technologies has been growing at 16.27%, which is a very nice growth rate, but that is expected to decline slightly this year if analysts are correct. The first red dot in our yearly earnings growth graph represents estimates for calendar 2015, and if analysts are correct about their estimates the growth rate will decline slightly to 12.22%.However, looking beyond 2015 and to 2016, the second red dot in our graph, we can see that earnings growth is expected to accelerate in 2016 and analysts are expecting earnings growth of 32.1%. That is a remarkable growth rate by all accounts, and it largely counters the lower growth rate expected in 2015.Our attention now turns to the PE multiple and the current PE multiple for Akamai Technologies is 29.05. This is represented by the blue bar in our PE chart, and we would consider it to be relatively rich, but if analysts are correct about their estimates for 2015 and the stock price remains the same that multiple is likely to decline to 26.44 by the end of 2015 and to 21.99 by the end of 2016 if analysts are right about that calendar year's earnings as well.This combination of yearly earnings growth and our forward looking PE multiples allow us to identify fair value for Akamai Technologies at this time. Our peg ratio chart for Akamai Technologies shows us that the current peg ratio for Akamai is 1.79 and if analysts are correct about their estimates for 2015 that will increase to 2.19. Fair value for slow growing companies, according to our model, exists when a peg ratio is between zero and 1.5, but that boundary can be stretched for companies who are growing faster than normal. We would consider Akamai to be one of those companies who is growing faster than others, and therefore the relatively stretched PE ratio that exist now at 1.79 is not completely out of line with fair value, but as that peg ratio increases over 2, which is expected this year if analysts are correct about their estimates, we would consider values to begin to look rich.The good news is, based on analysts' expectations for 2016 the valuation for Akamai improves considerably. In fact, the peg ratio declines below 1 to 0.69 at the end of 2016 if analysts are correct about their estimates and price remains the same.So that brings our attention to price. Should price remain the same given the outlook for earnings and earnings growth specifically? For value oriented investors this is a very important question because it helps them determine whether or not they should be investing in Akamai Technologies at this time.The first response to the question posed above is that the valuation that exist today will likely look more expensive as this year continues, if analysts are correct and price remains the same. That causes us to question the stocks ability to continue to move higher immediately if valuation metrics deteriorate, but clearly the following year looks better, so two years from now valuation will actually look quite attractive if analysts are correct.In association with our real time trading report for AKAM, our concern is that the stock is not offering immediate value and runs the risk of declining by about 20% from current levels, so in our opinion value oriented investors should not chase this stock. Value oriented investors who are more aggressive by nature should consider Akamai Technologies on dips only.ConclusionBecause valuation metrics look much more attractive in 2016 than they do in 2015 we would also expect the stock to pull back at some point during calendar 2015, probably sooner than later, but after it pulls back by 15 or 20% we would consider that to be relatively attractive for value oriented investors if the 2016 estimates remain the same. At current levels we would not consider the stock to be attractive for value oriented investors given the declining valuation metrics expected this year."

However, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here's an updated look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.Defensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 4/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 4/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - December 2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryAkamai does not pay a dividend.ConclusionAkamai is suitable for the Enterprising Investor, but not the more conservative Defensive Investor, who is concerned with the lack of dividends, as well as the high PEmg and PB ratios. The Enterprising Investor, on the other hand, is only concerned by the lack of dividends. As a result, the Enterprising Investor should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.From a valuation side of things, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $0.76 in 2010 to only $1.47 for 2014. This demonstrated growth does not support the market's implied estimate of 19.61%. As a result, the ModernGraham valuation model returns an estimate of intrinsic value below the market price at this time, and the company appears to be overvalued by the market."
2602015,23479,2014-10-27T18:30:42-04:00,"Growing Internet speeds, adoption of online streaming services and push from network providers are driving high data usage, and Akamai stands to gain.Security breaches have shaken customer faith. Therefore, we expect steps from merchants and content owners on security and privacy, which could benefit Akamai.Mobile data usage also is set to surge.","Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) will release Q3 2014 earnings on October 29th. We expect the company to report continued growth in CDN (content delivery network) services, due to growing media content on the Internet and accelerated demand for value-added services. There also was likely a mild contribution from the FIFA World Cup, which ended in mid July. Growing Internet speeds, adoption of online streaming services and push from network providers are driving high data usage, and Akamai stands to gain. Furthermore, recent security breaches such as that of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) and other companies have shaken up customer faith and therefore, we expect speedy steps from merchants and content owners regarding security and privacy. Akamai will have an opportunity to leverage this and grow its security solutions revenues.Our price estimate for Akamai stands at $61, implying a premium of more than 10% to the market. Growing Broadband Speeds And Data Demand Will Drive CDN BusinessThere is no doubt that Akamai's CDN business and value added solutions business will continue to benefit from the same trends of growing media content and demand for security services. Akamai released its second quarter ""State of the Internet"" report at the end of September 2014. The report indicates that global average broadband connection speeds grew by 21% sequentially in Q2 2014, and crossed the threshold of 4 Mbps for the first time. [1] Additionally, there are several countries with average broadband speed of over 15 Mbps, which is considered as a threshold for being 4K (ultra HD) ready. User demand for high-quality content for these new formats, which require higher bit rates than normal, means that bandwidth requirements are likely to increase significantly in the coming years. With the adoption of 4G LTE rising in developed markets and carriers in emerging markets looking to transition to the standard, mobile data usage is also set to surge. According to a recent Cisco VNI report, mobile data traffic grew 81% in 2013 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 60% over the next five years. [2] Akamai, which delivers 15-30% of all web traffic, stands to benefit hugely from this huge surge in online traffic.Security Solutions Will See Fast GrowthAkamai earns more than half of its revenues from value-added solutions. Among these, its security products are seeing the fastest growth. In Q2 2014, security revenues grew 30% over the same period last year and 10% sequentially, thus accelerating from the prior quarter's performance. Much of this can be attributed to the impact of the Prolexic acquisition. The acquisition is likely to help Akamai strengthen its sales as it integrates the acquired technology into its flagship Kona Site Defender and leverages the combined user base to upsell solutions. Before Prolexic, Akamai had 867 customers using its security solutions with around 260 on Kona. Prolexic increased that user base by almost 50% to 1,250.Mild Impact Of FIFA World CupAccording to FIFA, approximately 3.2 billion people watched at least some part of the soccer World Cup in 2010. [3] Additionally, the average in-home viewership for each of the 64 matches stood at a little over 188 million. [2] We gather from Akamai's website that the company's network saw an average streaming throughput of roughly 2.49 TBPS for these matches. [4] Going forward, as more important matches came up with teams entering knock out rounds, online traffic likely grew more heavily, thus lifting this average. For the purpose of calculation, we assume that the average Akamai throughput for the overall World Cup amounted to 3 TBPS.Given that there are 64 matches, with each match lasting roughly two hours (including the half time break and some commentary time in the beginning and the end of the match), we estimate that Akamai enabled the delivery of total media data of roughly 1.42 billion Gigabytes. Even at a rate of 3 cents per GB, World Cup streaming likely added incremental revenues of more than $40 million. That may be small in comparison to Akamai's overall revenues, but it was incremental and thus additive to margins in the short term. It must be noted that the actual incremental revenues resulting from the event was likely to be higher as users tend to watch replays, sports analysis and highlights related to matches. Additionally, the company also benefited from providing value added services related to the World Cup streaming, bringing in more revenues than commoditized CDN services. Overall revenue gains could be of the order of $90 million, half of which will reflect in third quarter's results as the World Cup stretched from mid June to mid July. Disclosure: No positions."
2981046,23479,2015-03-06T15:00:43-05:00,"Akamai recently acquired Xerocole, a Colorado-based Domain Name System (DNS) technology company.This deal is the latest in a long list of acquisitions the company has made over the years in order to improve its value added services.We believe that Akamai's strategy of focusing on its value added services in addition to its core CDN services will benefit the company in the long run.","Content Delivery Network giant Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) recently acquired Xerocole Inc., a Colorado-based Domain Name System (DNS) technology company. [1] Even though specific terms of the deal were not disclosed, Akamai states that the acquisition was completed in a cash transaction that's not material to Akamai's financials. This deal is the latest in a long list of acquisitions the company has made over the years in order to improve its value added services. We believe that Akamai's strategy of focusing on its value added services in addition to its core CDN services will benefit the company in the long run.Why Xerocole Is A Good Fit For AkamaiXerocole was founded in 2010 and is a provider of recursive Domain Name System (DNS) functionality. This acquisition will help Akamai in expanding its own DNS product offerings beyond the existing authoritative DNS products and better fulfill the needs of its customers and network partners. [1] The DNS is an integral component in the functioning of most Internet services because it is the Internet's primary directory service. [2] It translates domain names, which can be easily memorized by people, into numeric IP addresses and quickly directs the end users to their websites. Akamai has stated that Xerocole's intelligent recursive DNS technology helps provide carriers with security, speed, and the ability to dynamically and flexibly set DNS policy and user preferences. [1]Additionally, Xerocole's technology supports IPv6, the latest version of the Internet Protocol that provides an identification and location system for computers on networks and routes traffic across the Internet. [3] The company's DNS recursive resolver also supports Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC). [4] DNSSEC is used for securing different types of information provided by the DNS as used on IP networks. [5] Internet security is a very sensitive issue for clients since the recent data breaches at Sony (NYSE:SNE), Target (NYSE:TGT) and managed health care company Anthem Inc.The Growing Importance Of Value Added Services To AkamaiThe pure-play CDN business is becoming increasingly commoditized. Akamai is facing increased competition from rivals such as Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT), Limelight (NASDAQ:LLNW), Edgecast, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which has heightened CDN pricing pressure in recent years. However, Akamai has been bolstering its performance and has been improving its value added services through new launches and acquisitions. In addition to Xerocole, Akamai has acquired companies such as Prolexic, Verivue and Blaze in the past. This will help it mitigate the impact of the Pure-play CDN commoditization and will help it grab a bigger share of the consumers. Akamai's value proposition has evolved beyond being the fastest content delivery network. As competitors grow increasingly capable of fast content delivery at similar prices, Akamai has positioned itself as a full services provider - touting its ability to offer multiple value-added services such as security solutions, app accelerators, delivery of targeted advertising and cloud-based services for its customers. Value-added services now account for more than 50% of Akamai's overall revenues and have higher gross margins compared to basic content delivery. [6] This suggests that despite the commoditization of content delivery business, Akamai can improve, or at least sustain, its margins in the coming years. Disclosure: No positions."
2307005,20875,2014-07-09T19:04:09-04:00,,"This morning, Verizon (NYSE:VZ) announced a new cloud-based web application firewall (WAF) service as part of their Verizon Digital Media Services Defend product suite, which includes built-in protection against network-layer distributed denial of service attacks and origin-cloaking capabilities via Origin Shield. Verizon has launched the offering as a beta product for the next few months, with plans to have it go gold in Q4. Verizon has long been in the business of remotely managing security devices for their customers through their Verizon Security division, with thousands of customers. Some of these security technologies belong on-premise - such as network firewalls and intrusion protection systems, whereas other areas of security, such as those applied to websites and web applications, may be better done in the cloud. This fact has not been lost on Verizon and they are making a big entrance into the market with anti-DDoS, origin protection, and web application firewall solutions built into their recently acquired EdgeCast CDN platform.For those new to web application firewalls, or WAFs, they are primarily used to protect websites and web applications by inspecting HTTP/S traffic to ensure the HTTP/S requests are not being used to attack. While WAF's have traditionally been deployed on-premise - now the trend is to move this service to the cloud for all the standard benefits of cost savings, on-demand scalability, always-on capabilities and faster time to market. While Verizon is not the first to the market with security offerings, we all know Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) been in the security space for a while, Verizon says there are some key differences in how their platform operates. While most WAFs share a similar core approach in that they are inspecting HTTP/S traffic (requests) for attacks, Verizon says their WAF is delivering a set of capabilities previously unseen in the cloud-based WAF market by taking advantage of their existing EdgeCast content delivery network (CDN) for both scale and automation.For example, the Verizon WAF enables rule updates and WAF instances (rules are procedures that control access to websites) to be pushed out to all their CDN points of presence worldwide in less than 5 minutes. This means that once a new type of vulnerability is identified, new rules can be applied almost instantaneously thereby minimizing the exposure. And given that their WAF is tightly integrated into their CDN platform, customers are able to control (on a per domain or multiple domain basis) exactly what traffic types (e.g. HTML) and/or object types (e.g. json, jpg, etc.) they want to process through the WAF, minimizing both their expense and the amount of incremental performance overhead added to their traffic. Verizon is focusing a lot of the fact that they have a whole lot more rules available in their first version of their WAF product than other vendors do.By implementing both the OWASP ModSecurity core rule set and the ModSecurity commercial rule set from Trustwave, their customers are provided with the broadest set of rules available on the market. Include the EdgeCast security rules within their HTTP/S caching engine that can be applied to their HTTP/S traffic, and you really do have very deep and broad set of tools to that enable a higher degree of general protection. I think the Trustwave partnership is important to mention as it brings a ton of ""black hat"" credibility to the table for EdgeCast as a vendor as Trustwave's technology is considered top notch. The WAF also provides thousands of rules that are custom-built for specific applications like Microsoft SharePoint or Apache servers which makes sense for enterprise customers looking for quick out of the box implementations. From what EdgeCast tells me, they plan on leveraging their Verizon Security division as part of their ongoing roadmap as the Verizon Security folks have a ton of threat intelligence domain experience and can help the EdgeCast team enhance their WAF capabilities even further.While version 1.0 of Verizon's WAF hits all the basics and also offers some nice differentiators, it is not without some shortcomings. These include more complete protection against certain types of application layer DDoS attacks, bot mitigation technology, additional reporting, SIEM integration, and the advanced learning features found on some of the higher-end WAF appliances. Verizon EdgeCast has shown me that they have all of these on their roadmap and will be rolling out these capabilities over the next 12 months. They have a pretty good track record adding new capabilities quickly so I'm pretty confident that they will address these deficiencies soon.The projected market growth for WAFs is anywhere from 18-30% in 2013 with an overall market value of over $250M per year, (Source: Gartner said 30% growth in 2013 and greater than $337M revenue in 2013, TechNavio said 18% growth) and the complementary market for anti-DDoS services is over $500M per year (2014 estimates, IDC) and growing at close to 20% 2012-2017 (source: Infonetics). Hardware-based deployments are dominated by companies such as Imperva, Check Point Software and Trustwave. Verizon's WAF will be competing with cloud-based WAF vendors including Akamai, Incapsula (Imperva), CloudFlare and Qualys - which is also in beta test with their offering.Some Akamai customers I have spoken to have voiced discontent with the high setup fees and high ongoing monthly recurring costs, along with the lack of control associated with their WAF offering. To date, the only viable alternative to their WAF has been on-premise appliances. That is about to change, and given Verizon's prior experience re-selling Akamai's solutions, I think they are better prepared than anyone to compete head to head. EdgeCast says in the case of any customer using Akamai's stand-alone WAF or Kona bundle, the Verizon WAF supports a much more extensive set of WAF rules without the need for expensive professional services. It also provides the ability to selectively control what traffic and objects are processed through the WAF; deep visibility into what the WAF is actually seeing; a much higher degree of usability and configurability; and less exposure to the risk of attack from new threats given what EdgeCast says is the ability to push out rules updates more than 900% faster than what is offered by other WAF solutions in the market today. Pricing I've seen from both vendors indicated that the EdgeCast WAF service will come in very far below what Akamai is charging - both lower set up fees and lower recurring monthly fees. We'll know more once we see deal flow in the market.Verizon's WAF is well suited for mid-sized and enterprise class organizations and provides many reasons to choose it over competing offerings. In combination with other existing Verizon offerings, such as the Verizon anti-DDoS, threat management, and managed security services, Verizon is able to offer a web site security portfolio that few others can deliver. To date, Akamai not had much in the way of cloud-based competitors since Qualys's cloud-based WAF is focused just on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) EC2 or VMware's (NYSE:VMW) vCenter. And the other cloud-based WAFs such as Incapsula and Cloudflare are focused almost entirely on the SMB marketplace. Verizon's WAF is specifically targeting the same enterprise class customers Akamai is, so we'll have to keep an eye on what kind of traction Verizon can get with their offering and if Verizon has any impact on driving down pricing for these services industry wide.Disclosure: None."
2397725,67895,2014-08-07T16:37:08-04:00,Cloud-based internet content and delivery infrastructure services are expecting strong growth.Consistent investment continues to fuel future growth.Strong fundamentals indicate attractive valuation.,"Company ProfileAkamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKAM) is a leading provider of cloud-based internet content and delivery infrastructure. Its devotion to providing a near-instant web experience continues to fuel growth. Consistent capital spending signals management's desire to continue to deliver strong returns for investors beyond the next earnings release.Industry ConditionsThe Nasdaq has outperformed the major indices for a majority of the recovery (Exhibit 1). Indicated by its widening spread with the Dow, the market continues to value tech over traditional investments. This suggests an overall risk-on allocation strategy. However, recent global issues as well as modest earnings reports have sent the major indices significantly lower over the past few days. Additionally, it seems further declines are in store on a short-term horizon.Exhibit 1Source: Stock RoverThe Internet content and Information industry has displayed exceptional growth compared to the major indices and is expected to remain strong for the near future (Exhibit 2). However, it has recently experienced substantial volatility, generating significant investor concerns over future gains. Additionally, if a prolonged decline in economic growth were to occur, this sector would most likely see larger declines in sales and share value compared to other industries due to corporate infrastructure spending cuts and delays in technological improvements.Exhibit 2Source: Stock RoverAKAMRegarding AKAM specifically, it has consistently outperformed the major indices and straddles the two industries for which it is included, albeit with significantly more volatility (Exhibit 3 and 4).Exhibit 3Source: Stock RoverExhibit 4Source: Stock RoverOperating margins remain strong and near the upper end of the five-year range (Exhibit 5).Exhibit 5Source: Stock RoverWhile not entirely concerning at these levels, free cash flow in regards to sales continues to decline, indicating the current spending policy may not be sustainable (Exhibit 6 and 7). The company recently experienced an 18% decline in ROIC causing concerns over the effectiveness of current investment spending.Exhibit 6Source: Stock RoverExhibit 7Source: Stock RoverAKAM ValuationPrice to earnings remain relatively stable, just coming off the highs while Price to Sales is steadily climbing since the lows in 2011 (Exhibit 8 and 9). These indicate appropriate valuation based on historical multiples.Exhibit 8Source: Stock RoverExhibit 9Source: Stock RoverIndustry analysts have been increasing their opinions on the equity with 18 EPS upward revisions this year and 13 for next year with an average target price of $68.06.Our in-house comparable company valuation analysis puts the estimated equity value at 69.82 and our DCF valuation is $68.75 per share. Additionally in respect to its industry, AKAM is undervalued according to P/E by 16% and undervalued according to EV/EBITDA by 43%.Challenges and OpportunitiesAkamai continues to invest in research and development which has proven to return substantial value to shareholders. This is shown by a 27% annual growth rate in research spending and 40% annual growth in capital expenditures fueling 18% annual returns in share price over the past 10 years. However, the company's equity experienced substantial selling pressure after its most recent earnings release, signaling potential wavering in investor sentiment toward owning shares at current prices as well as raising questions as to how much benefit can be expected from each additional unit of investment. Moreover, as other companies reach for lofty margins in the industry, competition will increase substantially, threatening profit margins and growth opportunities.ConclusionAkamai Technologies, Inc. has a robust business model, solid fundamentals and compelling valuation metrics. Strong demand in cloud infrastructure solutions, security and a focus on mobile will be tailwinds for the company. Intense competition challenges future growth but is being met with effective investment spending. With a close eye on capital efficiency trends, buying shares within the $50-$60 range will position an investor for future growth benefits from strong investment spending and stable margins.Disclaimer: Michael Lee is an investment strategist at Long Street Capital Management, LLC (""LSCM"").

Akamai Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:AKAM) could be the best way for investors to profit from it.Never mind the explosive Heartbleed bug that recently wriggled its way through data centers everywhere the last few months, Intel's McAfee lab expects the number of global security breaches to accelerate much faster in 2014 than in the last two years.While having people's private information hacked is not something to feel good about, it definitely translates into big business for security technology companies.In a joint report from intelligence firm IDC and the National University of Singapore, businesses around the world are expected to spend around $500 billion to combat hackers in 2014.As we increasingly integrate our lives online, be it cloud computing or the Internet of Things, McAfee believes we're becoming more vulnerable to cyber threats as a result.Yet, at the core of these attacks lies a fundamental loophole that gets exploited time and time again.See, in order for viruses or malware to spread, there typically needs to be an action on the part of the potential victim to allow the attacks to happen.One of the simplest ways for hackers to unleash hell is using a tactic known as spear-phishing.I'm sure most of you come across them on a regular basis, often in the form of a harmless-looking email.These emails are usually designed in such a way that the template and layout appears to be something official from either your own company or a reputable organization, such as eBay or LinkedIn.The message would often ask that the recipient click on a link or reply back with some confidential information, such as usernames or passwords.If the recipient naively responds to the phishing email, only then will the cyber threat infiltrate and become a full-blown attack.Even as the debate continues between the supposed security strength of different computer platforms or smartphones, the reality is that computer systems themselves have little to do with how the cyber attacks are triggered.We humans are the true security loopholes.""It's not the vulnerability in the computer -- it's the vulnerability in the human that always gets targeted,"" explains Dmitri Alperovitch, CTO of cyber security firm CrowdStrike Inc.A primary target for spear-phishers tend to be personal assistants of company executives, according to Kevin Haley of Symantec Corp. (SYMC).Because of their highly integrated role inside companies, PAs are given unprecedented access into executives' calendars, contact lists, email accounts, and other confidential information.Even with all the money poured into online security solutions, it would all be for naught if one unsuspecting employee hit the reply button.According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, annual losses from cybercrime, intellectual-property theft from corporations, and other costs could run as high as $400 billion this year.IT solutions firm EMC Corp. (EMC) reported 450,000 known phishing attacks in 2013, and losses from them reached a record $5.9 billion.But seeing as cyber attacks will only get more sophisticated and happen more frequently in the future, one company at the forefront of online security could stand to profit immensely from the growing threat.Top Security Stock To BuyWith more and more companies now moving their computing operations into cloud and mobile platforms, Cambridge, CA-based Akamai Technologies is perfectly positioned to serve their security needs.A provider of cloud-based services for delivering, optimizing, and securing online content and business applications, the tech firm has seen huge growth through its Security division.CEO Tom Leighton says that cloud computing is more secure than the traditional model of hosting data in data centers. Cloud solution providers like Akamai can intercept potentially harmful traffic, then analyze and eliminate malicious content before it harms customers.Companies out there must've hung onto Leighton's every word over the past year, because in Q1 2014, AKAM generated $454 million in revenue, a 23% rise over Q1 2013.A great deal of the momentum was driven by its cloud computing security tools, which has helped to prevent data theft and reduce downtime.Resulting net income for the first quarter was $73 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, a 2% increase over first-quarter 2013's net income of $71 million, or $0.39 per diluted share.Adjusted EBITDA was $204 million in Q1, up from $166 million in the first quarter of 2013.Cash flow from Q1 2014 operations was $89 million, equating to 20% of revenue. At the end of the quarter, AKAM had $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents.On top of that, the company also initiated a stock buyback in Q1, where it spent $116 million to repurchase 2.0 million shares, which tightened the float to 179 million shares outstanding.As more businesses extend a white-knuckle grip to try and clamp down on Internet hijackings, investors in the cyber security industry will want to take a stand with AKAM.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Akamai will benefit from increasing volumes of Internet traffic, as the iPhone 6 and the latest version of iOS drives more upgrades and gaming downloads. Moreover, the newly launched Galaxy smartphones and other Android smartphones also will contribute to increasing Internet traffic. Akamai has strong earnings growth prospects, and it returns value to its shareholders by stock buybacks. Furthermore, according to my calculations the stock is undervalued.The CompanyAkamai Technologies provides cloud services for delivering, optimizing and securing online content and business applications in the United States and internationally. The company was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Valuation MetricsThe table below presents the valuation metrics of AKAM, the data were taken from Yahoo Finance and finviz.com.Akamai has mediocre valuation metrics - the forward P/E is at 22.08, the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is at 17.35, and the debt to equity is low at 0.21.Latest Quarter ResultsOn July 30, Akamai reported its second quarter 2014 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by $0.03 (5.50%) and beat estimates on revenues.Revenue for the second quarter of 2014 was $476 million, a 26% increase over second quarter 2013 revenue of $378 million. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2014 was $106 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, an increase from the prior quarter's non-GAAP net income of $105 million, and a 26% increase over second quarter 2013 non-GAAP net income of $84 million, or $0.46 per diluted share.In the report, Dr. Tom Leighton, Chief Executive Officer, said:Dividend and Share RepurchaseAkamai is not paying dividends, however it has a share buyback program.During the second quarter of 2014, under the share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors in October 2013, the company spent approximately $71 million to repurchase 1.3 million shares of its common stock, at an average price of $54.89 per share.

That indicates a short-term, mid-term and a long-term uptrend.Chart: TradeStation Group, Inc.The weekly MACD histogram, a particularly valuable indicator by technicians, is negative at -0.01 and ascending, which is a very bullish signal (a rising MACD histogram and crossing the zero line from below is considered an extremely bullish signal). The RSI oscillator is at 61.12, which does not indicate oversold or overbought conditions.Analyst OpinionMany analysts are covering the stock, and most of them recommend it. Among the twenty analysts, six rate it as a Strong Buy, nine rate it as a Buy, and five analysts rate it as a Hold.TipRanks is a website that ranks experts (analysts and bloggers) according to their performance. According to TipRanks, among the analysts covering AKAM stock there are only six analysts who have the four or five star rating, five of them recommend the stock, and one analyst rates it as a Hold.On July 29, Pacific Crest's analyst Chat Bartley reiterated an Outperform rating and $65 price target on the stock. He sees accelerating traffic lifting second-quarter results and providing fodder for a third-quarter guidance raise.Source: TipRanksIs Akamai's stock undervalued?Since there is no magic formula that will give us an absolute answer to this question, I have tried to reach a conclusion by comparing five relevant trailing twelve months valuation ratios to their eight-year averages, and calculating a target price in accordance to the eight-year averages. In addition, I looked for a comparison between Akamai's stock and its industry its sector and the S&P 500 for margins and return-on-capital parameters. All the data and the tables were taken from Portfolio123.The table below shows the trailing twelve month values of five valuation multiples, their eight-year average, and the target stock price according to the eight-year average, which calls for AKAM's stock price target of $71.97, a 17.7% above its last price of $61.17. Of course, no one guarantees that the stock will return to its historical valuation multiples' averages. However, the result demonstrates that, in accordance to its historical valuation ratios, AKAM's stock is undervalued.The tables below demonstrate that AKAM's margins and return-on-capital parameters have been much better than its industry median and its sector median. Also, according to that comparison, AKAM's stock seems to be undervalued.Major DevelopmentsAkamai has been able to show an earnings per share surprise in each one of the last four quarters, as shown in the table below.Data: Yahoo Finance - Analyst EstimatesIn my opinion, the fact that the company succeeds to beat analyst expectations quarter after quarter demonstrates the strength of its business, and there is a good chance that Akamai will continue to surprise by reporting better than estimated results also in the future.AKAM's stock has been doing well this year. Since the start of the year AKAM's stock has gained 29.7%, while the S&P 500 index has risen 7.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index has increased 9.0%. Moreover, since the beginning of 2012, AKAM's stock has gained 89.5%, while the S&P 500 index has increased 58.1% and the Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 74.7%. Nevertheless, considering its strong earnings growth prospects, AKAM's stock, in my opinion, still has room to move up.ConclusionIn my opinion, Akamai will benefit from increasing volumes of Internet traffic, as the iPhone 6 and the latest version of iOS drives more upgrades and gaming downloads. Moreover, the newly launched Galaxy smartphones and other Android smartphones also will contribute to increasing Internet traffic. Akamai has strong earnings growth prospects - its average annual earnings growth estimates for the next five years is very high at 15.6%. Furthermore, according to its historical valuation multiples the stock is undervalued. Akamai is generating strong cash flow, and it returns value to its shareholders by stock buyback. All these factors bring me to the conclusion that AKAM's stock is a smart long-term investment."
2176123,48501,2014-04-30T06:30:19-04:00,The increase in web traffic should drive strong first-quarter results.The intrinsic value estimate is $24 per share.Shares are in an intermediate bear market as part of primary bull market.,"Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKAM) improves the performance and security of the cloud. The company is scheduled to report first quarter results on May 1st. I'm forecasting revenue growth of 17.5% with stable profit margins. While my forecast is for revenues of $432M, the consensus street estimate is for revenues of $441M with my estimate being the lowest of the street's analysts. The vectors are the same but the magnitudes differ slightly.As web traffic grows, revenues from the Media Delivery Solutions and Performance and Security Solutions segments should increase. But based on the fundamentals of the firm, AKAM has limited ability to generate abnormal earnings. Near-term performance should be excellent, but I expect competition to adversely impact the company's results of operations.Based on the fundamentals of the firm, AKAM is worth about $24 per share. As of right now, no clear catalyst has emerged that would drive shares to the intrinsic value estimate.Recent DevelopmentsAnalyst's NoteAkamai Technologies, Inc., provides cloud services for delivering, optimizing and securing online content and business applications. The increasing reliance on the cloud is driving demand for the company's solutions, as companies invest in technologies that deliver a high-quality experience. But competition from do-it-yourself telecom service providers puts pressure on Akamai's profitability.First quarter revenues seem likely to be boosted by the winter Olympics, and the Super Bowl. Consequently, I'm modeling a faster y/y growth rate (17.5%) for the first quarter than I am for the full year (15%). The profitability margins are expected to remain in line with the prior year, as operating leverage is offset by competitive pressure. Lastly, diluted EPS is forecasted to increase 10%.In terms of asset composition, short-term assets have generally been declining as a percentage of total assets with relative declines in cash being a significant contributing factor. Management has been using cash to increase equity and other investments as well as on acquisitions accounted for using goodwill. Consequently, the success of Akamai is in part because of successful acquisitions. Additionally, the company could use a portion of the recent $690 million notes offering for a strategic acquisition during the coming months.In December 2013, Akamai announced an agreement to acquire Prolexic Technologies, Inc. with the intent of upgrading AKAM's portfolio of security solutions designed to defend an enterprise's Web and IP infrastructure against application-layer, network-layer, and data center attacks delivered via the Internet. Also, in March 2012, Akamai acquired Contendo with the goal of increasing the pace of innovation in the areas of site acceleration and mobile optimization. The major investments were in mobile and security, which are high-growth areas.The first quarter's forecasted net income implies a 3% return on equity, which is solid, in my opinion. The company definitely has the benefits of favorable market dynamics: Mobile, VOD, and security. While the rumors and speculation of an unfavorable competitive environment will likely continue, the strategic partnership with AT&T suggests the competitive environment may be more favorable than some believe.General RisksThis section does not discuss all risks related to an investment in Akamai.Portfolio & ValuationAKAM is in an intermediate bear market as part of a primary degree bull market. Simply stated, this is a dip-to-buy, as the shares trade near a minor support zone.Based on the fundamentals of the company, the shares are overvalued in the market. The valuation reflects what I consider to be a lack of a sustainable competitive advantage as demonstrated through the return generating ability of the operations.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2195333,23479,2014-05-06T16:30:16-04:00,,"Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) recently announced a strong set of Q1 results, beating the high end of its guidance on both revenues and earnings. The company generated revenues of $454 million in the first quarter, about 23% higher than the prior-year quarter when adjusted for the ADS divestment and the recent acquisition of Prolexic. Net income of $0.55 came in at about 4 cents higher than the top-end of guidance. The outperformance was driven by stronger-than-expected media traffic growth, driven by unplanned software downloads and gaming releases. The company also saw strong demand for its value-added services (VAS), especially in website security and app acceleration. The strong revenue growth, as well as efforts to drive network efficiency, helped Akamai post gross margins of 78%, up about 2 percentage points over the same period last year.However, the Prolexic acquisition is expected to be dilutive to margins in the near term, as the company ramps up investment in sales and marketing to drive long-term revenue growth. Although EBITDA margins in Q1 remained flat y-o-y at 45%, this was partly because the company shifted some of its planned hiring into the next quarter. With sales and other operating expenses set to ramp up over the course of the year, the company expects margins to sequentially decrease to the low 40% range in the near term. After the initial investment phase, Akamai should see its margins improve as additional sales representatives drive revenue growth in the future. Management maintained its long-term EBITDA margin guidance for the company at 40-45%. Our $57 price estimate for Akamai is about in line with the current market price. Strong Media PerformanceAkamai's first quarter saw strong revenue growth across business verticals as well as geographies, despite some macroeconomic concerns in Southern Europe and emerging markets. While online traffic continued to be strong, the strong outperformance was led by some unplanned software releases and gaming patches. The sequential growth was especially promising, given the strong holiday season last quarter and the headwinds from a recent pricing renegotiation with its largest media customer, which kicked into effect from January 1. We estimate that almost 80% of the company's value is driven by e-commerce and media traffic, which continues to surge as mobile devices proliferate and demand for social media, video streaming and online gaming grows at a frenetic pace. Akamai's media delivery business saw its revenues grow by 19% y-o-y and 4% sequentially.Additionally, user demand for high-quality content, driven by new formats such as 4K and ulta-HD, which require higher bit rates than normal, means that bandwidth requirements are likely to increase significantly in coming years. With adoption of 4G LTE rising in developed markets, and carriers in emerging markets looking to transition to the standard, mobile data usage is also set to surge. According to a recent Cisco VNI report, mobile data traffic grew 81% in 2013 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 60% over the next five years (Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, 2013-2018, Cisco, February 5th, 2014). Akamai, which delivers 15%-30% of all web traffic, stands to benefit hugely from this huge surge in online traffic.Near-Term Margin Pressure Offset By Product MixHowever, pure-play CDN is rapidly becoming commoditized, with increasing competition from rivals such as Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT), Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW), Edgecast, and more recently, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). This has heightened CDN pricing pressure in recent years. However, the fact that Akamai has been bolstering its performance and security value-added solutions through new service launches and acquisitions will help it grab a bigger wallet share of customers as well as mitigate the impact of CDN commoditization. These services, which have higher margins than content delivery, have grown to account for almost 60% of Akamai's revenues in recent quarters. Akamai's margins have also benefited from recent network investments, which have lowered bandwidth and co-location costs as well as increased efficiency in content delivery. As a result, Akamai's gross margins have recovered well from the lows of 2011, and we expect the recovery to continue in the near-term as VAS help offset most of the impact of the CDN pricing declines.Among the various value-added solutions that Akamai sells, security products are seeing the fastest growth. Last quarter, security revenues grew 26% over the same period last year and 3% sequentially. The company's recent acquisition of Prolexic should help bolster sales going forward, as it integrates the acquired technology into its flagship Kona Site Defender and leverages the combined user base to upsell solutions. Excluding Prolexic, Akamai had 867 customers using its security solutions with around 260 on Kona. Prolexic increases that user base by almost a half to 1,250. As part of the integration process, Akamai plans to combine Prolexic and Kona into a single product and extend Prolexic's managed security services to include Kona in the coming months.Disclosure: No positions."
2115053,23479,2014-03-28T14:32:02-04:00,,"Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) recently announced that it has forged a strategic alliance with Telefonica (NYSE:TEF) to deliver its suite of CDN services to the carrier's enterprise customers. The carrier's international arm, Telefonica Global Solutions, will bundle Akamai's CDN solutions with its own global IP network to sell a portfolio of CDN and telecom solutions to enterprises. [1] The companies will initially market these services in Spain and Latin America, where Telefonica has the strongest presence, before looking to expand globally from there. It is not clear whether Telefonica will only resell Akamai's services or license its CDN software to run on its network, considering that the carrier already has its own CDN network. But either way, the partnership should help Akamai gain deeper access to the carrier's networks in Spain and Latin America, improving its network efficiency and CDN quality of service (QoS) ahead of the upcoming FIFA World Cup and 2016 Olympic Games. Mitigates Carrier ThreatThe deal follows Akamai's similar agreements with AT&T (NYSE:T) and Orange in 2012, and the more recent acquisition of Edgecast by Verizon (NYSE:VZ). These recent carrier-CDN deals show a growing trend of carriers getting increasingly interested in controlling their own CDNs, as data traffic burgeons due to growing penetration of mobile devices and rising demand for high-quality online video. Historically this was not the case, with carriers generally OK with ceding some of their network control for third-party CDN benefits. Akamai's edge servers installed within an ISP's network helped operators reduce their bandwidth costs as content was cached at the edge and closest to the user, thereby reducing the need to retransmit data every time the user sent a request. Not only did this help enhance user experience but also avoided clogging networks and saved valuable bandwidth for the carriers. Akamai, in return, would get access to millions of subscribers and free network bandwidth.However, over time, carriers realized that since they own the network, they could develop CDNs of their own and monetize all of the huge video traffic that ply through their pipes. A number of carriers around the world have already started building out their own CDNs, including Verizon and AT&T. [2] AT&T in 2008 stopped reselling Akamai's CDN service and instead started building out its own CDN. Over time, it licensed Edgecast's software and also restarted its Akamai reselling partnership in a bid to bolster its CDN offerings. [3] Verizon, on the other hand, has gone the whole way, recently purchasing Edgecast to boost its existing CDN capabilities, potentially ending its reseller partnership with Akamai down the road.For a long time, Akamai resisted entering the operator CDN market as it would have made it easier for carriers to compete with Akamai for content providers. However, with ISPs increasingly getting serious about their CDN ambitions, Akamai found its value within the carrier networks diminishing. Moreover, smaller competitors such as Edgecast and Limelight were gaining traction with their licensed and managed CDN solutions. So it wouldn't have been long before Akamai found itself competing with the big telcos for market share with hardly any leverage on the carriers. The launch of Aura Network Solutions and the acquisition of Verivue in 2012 showed that Akamai identified the threat and has since been looking to turn potential rivals into partners. Verizon's buyout of Edgecast, a big competitor in the carrier CDN space, could help Akamai in this pursuit, since carriers may be reluctant to license or resell CDN services of a rival carrier.Gross Margin BenefitsHowever, more important than the direct revenues of a reselling or licensing partnership are the cost savings and Q0S benefits that Akamai could realize from having direct access to the carrier's network. Akamai has been driving efficiency through its network operations in recent quarters, making investments to lower bandwidth and co-location costs as well as increasing efficiency in content delivery. As a result, Akamai's gross margins have recovered well from the lows of 2011. Last quarter, Akamai saw a 3 percentage point improvement in its gross margins over the same period the prior year as a result of these initiatives. Going forward, we expect the recovery to continue as it realizes the margin benefits of its recent partnerships with AT&T, Orange and Telefonica, as well as more such deals in the future.Specifically, the Telefonica deal will help Akamai bolster its CDN services in emerging markets in Latin America, where the FIFA World Cup and Olympic Games will be held later this year and in 2016, respectively. Akamai has been at the forefront of the online content distribution of such high-profile global events, supporting NBC's online coverage of the Sochi Winter Olympics last month. NBC Olympics delivered almost 11 million hours of online video, around 80% of which was streamed live through its online portals. Overall, Sochi turned out to to be the most streamed Olympics ever, surpassing even the London Summer Olympics of 2012. [4] With demand for online video burgeoning, Akamai is pursuing network improvements through such carrier deals so as to be able to efficiently deliver high-volume video content in the coming years.Disclosure: No positions."
1993531,23625,2014-02-04T18:37:49-05:00,,"Akamai Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:AKAM) is set to report FQ4 2013 earnings before the market opens on Wednesday, February 5th. Akamai Technologies is an internet content delivery network (CDN) which deliveries between 15% and 20% of all traffic on the web. AKAM stock is trading down this week after it was reported that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been working on its own CDN, which is a measure that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) took last year. This quarter Wall Street is expecting Akamai's fourth quarter revenue to be down 6% compared to last year while revenue is expected to be up 12%. Despite the trimmed outlook from Wall Street, investors are expecting a great quarter from AKAM.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.(Click Here to see All Estimates for Akamai Technologies)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Akamai Technologies to report 51 cents EPS and $422.26M revenue while the current Estimize.com consensus from Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 55 cents EPS and $426.68M revenue. This quarter the buy-side as represented by the Estimize.com community is expecting Akamai Technologies to beat the Street's expectations on profit and revenue by a considerable margin.Over the previous six quarters the consesus from Estimize.com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Akamai Technologies' profit and revenue 4 times each. By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is up to 69.5% more accurate than Wall Street, but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market's actual expectations. It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus.The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case we are seeing a larger differential compared to recent quarters. The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize.com platform range from 52 cents to 57 cents EPS and $423.32M to $430.00M in revenues. This quarter we're seeing a smaller distribution of estimates compared to previous quarters.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A narrower distribution of estimates signals more agreement in the market, which could mean less volatility post earnings. If Akamai fails to live up to the lofty market expectations we could see the stock price pull back. Throughout the quarter the EPS consensus from both Wall Street and Estimize have remained perfectly flat. Wall Street lowered its revenue expectation from $424.85M to $422.26M while the Estimize.com revenue consensus increased from $425.77M to $426.68 going into the report. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and rising expectations going into the report are often a bullish indicator.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is RENS who projects 57 cents EPS and $430.00M in revenue. In the Winter 2014 season RENS is rated as the 495th best analyst and is ranked 21st overall among over 3,750 contributing analysts. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. In this case RENS is making a bullish call expecting Akamai Technologies to beat Wall Street's expectations on profit and revenue.Although Akamai Technologies is under pressure from increased competition, buy-side and independent analysts as well as investors are expecting a great quarter. Given the increasingly challenging environment, if Akamai fails to live up to the high expectations from the Estimize.com community we could see the stock tumble.Disclosure: None."
2087613,48501,2014-03-13T16:39:39-04:00,The increase in profitability was at least partly attributable to an accounting change.The fundamentals of the business suggest that shares are overvalued.The share price has seen a significant increase and a consolidation is becoming more likely.,"Akamai's (NASDAQ:AKAM) shares surged 21% following the announcement of fourth-quarter profits that rose over 18%, which means that I got the catalyst wrong but the vector right. At this point, the shares are overvalued based on the fundamentals of the company.The boost in profitability was partly attributable to an accounting change in which management extended the useful life of assets. Obviously, this is not a sustainable change in operating performance. Looking forward, I expect the profitability of the firm to revert back towards the pre-accounting change levels and to continue to deteriorate from there, as the company's premium pricing structure is challenged by competitive solutions.While the outlook for the firm's financial performance is positive, the intrinsic value per share of AKAM is in the mid-20s. This is based on the fundamentals of the firm. Management is investing in SG&A and spending relatively little on R&D, which means that the rate of reinvestment isn't as high as it would be for the typical growth firm. Consequently, the model of the estimated intrinsic value of the firm places the share price much lower than the growth reflective market price.Recent DevelopmentsBusiness SummaryAkamai Technologies, Inc., provides cloud services for delivering, optimizing and securing online content and business applications. The increasing reliance on the cloud is driving demand for the company's solutions, as companies invest in technologies that deliver a high-quality experience. But competition from do-it-yourself telecom service providers puts pressure on Akamai's profitability.Total revenue for 2013 increased 15% on strong demand for Media Delivery Solutions, and Performance and Security Solutions. The increase in total revenue was accompanied by an increase in gross profit, but a portion of the reduction in cost of revenue is attributable to an accounting change. Specifically, management increased the useful lives of assets thus decreasing the depreciation expense associated with those assets. In 2014, the forecast is for profitability to decline in line with its historic trend as personnel costs increase. Also, revenue is forecasted to increase 15% in 2014 and 12% in 2015 with a net income margin of about 16.5%.The cash flow from operations growth was subpar in 2013 as the depreciation and amortization non-cash expense declined. Cash provided by operations could increase more than revenues in 2014, because the impact from the accounting change will have subsided. Management is likely to continue to invest in capital expenditure to support the long-term growth of the organization. Also, the estimate is for 40% of free cash flow to equity to be returned to shareholders, but that estimate is relatively uncertain.The liquidity and solvency positions appear to be rock solid. While the equity multiplier is trending higher, there is ample room to utilize debt obligations. Liquidity has declined, but from an excessive level to a more than ample level. Consequently, there is adequate liquidity for returning capital to shareholders or for acquisitions.AKAM's quality of earnings was high during 2013. The estimate is that 2% of earnings resulted from accruals. Also, the company collected 98% of revenues in cash from its customers. Based on the cash component of earnings, earnings are forecasted to be persistent.The outlook for the next two years is positive. Demand for media, performance and security solutions should continue to drive revenue growth, albeit at a slower pace. Competitive pressures and personnel expenses should continue to weigh on profitability. Free cash flow to equity is expected to increase by 43% over the next two operating years. The fundamentals of the business are bullish.RisksThis section does not contain all risks related to an investment in AKAM.Portfolio & ValuationAKAM is in a bull market of primary and intermediate degree. Day traders would look to accumulate following minor bear markets. Swing traders would accumulate following a more substantial decline. Long-term investors would probably want to consider scaling back their position. Nonetheless, the market for AKAM shares remains bullish.The expected return for AKAM is relatively high. For a one-month holding period, the expected return is 2.5% with a standard deviation of 12.06%. The expected return for one quarter is 7.35%. A 30% annual expected rate of return is unsustainable. This high rate of return is why the valuations suggest that shares of AKAM are overvalued.Akamai is overvalued based on its forecasted fundamentals. At a share price of about $60, shares of the firm are trading well above the optimistic intrinsic value. There is an argument to be made for a higher intrinsic value based on the company's reinvestment rate, which would result in an intrinsic value of $75 per share. But I think the high SG&A expense replaces investment in R&D; thus, AKAM's fundamentals are close to their long-term sustainable levels. Profitability is unlikely to improve, but the growth rate is likely to slow, which the model incorporates.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1937461,24757,2014-01-09T15:07:00-05:00,,"There has been some concern about Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) because Verizon (NYSE:VZ) announced its intent to acquire Edgecast, an Akamai competitor in the Content Delivery Network (CDN), or Internet acceleration, space (See Verizon-Edgecast Deal Poses Pricing And Margins Threat To Akamai). Verizon was partly motivated by AT&T's (NYSE:T) deal to resell Akamai's content delivery services. In addition, Akamai has new partnerships with IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) that should ramp substantial revenue over time.There have been many threats to Akamai's CDN supremacy in the past, and to the extent they drove the stock price down, they just created buying opportunities for investors. Akamai's stock price has been quite volatile over the years, but post the bursting of the Internet stock bubble in 2000 the long-term trend has been up. In the last few years, services other than CDN, notably security for cloud services, have been the main source of revenue growth for Akamai.In early February Akamai should be releasing Q4 numbers. Guidance is for a typically up Q4 driven by holiday traffic. Revenue is expected between $412 and $430 million, up from $395.8 million in Q3 and $377.9 in Q4 2012. Non-GAAP EPS is expected between $0.49 and $0.53, likely up from $0.50 in Q3, but not up from EPS of $0.54 in Q4 2012.With non-GAAP EPS not growing substantially from Q4 2012 to Q4 2013, and despite revenue up 9% to 14% if within guidance, it is hard to argue that Akamai is a company seeing spectacular profit growth that would justify a high P/E ratio. However, the main reason EPS is growing less fast than revenue is increased levels of investment in R&D and sales for the non-CDN services. Akamai should resume EPS growth if those up-front investments pay off in substantial revenue increases in 2014 and beyond.In Q3 media delivery segment revenue was $189 million, showing a 15% y/y growth rate. CDN revenue is largely commoditized at this point. Prices fall steadily, but Internet traffic is still growing fast enough to more than offset pricing changes. Also, CDN customers are likely to become performance and security customers over time as well. Conversations with customers indicate vast quantities of high-quality video is poised to move online over the next few years, at much higher-resolution, high-bandwidth formats. The Fast TCP service was released to speed video delivery. So the CDN segment should continue to grow revenue while showing seasonal variability.Performance and security revenue was $174 million, up 19% y/y. Service and support revenue was $33 million, up 34% y/y. I think those growth rates show the investments are paying off. Kona Site Defender ended the quarter with about 180 customers, with 40 new in the quarter. Another service that is selling well to new customers is Aqua Ion, which helps customers deal with mobile transactions. Other advanced solutions offered by Akamai are IPv6 Adaption, Mobile Detect and Redirect, and Dynamic Site Accelerator.I believe Internet security is a strong growth area. The bad guys are out there, and they are clever, as the December Target (NYSE:TGT) fiasco showed, even if it did target terminals rather than servers. If you want to do business on the Internet you need strong security. Akamai is well positioned to serve a significant portion of the security market.Management at Akamai is taking the long view. In a response to Q3 margins, management indicated that, while efforts are made to keep margins up, if margins were better than reported they would spend more to drive future growth. That is what long-term investors want to hear from management: don't sacrifice the long run to appease short-term traders.I believe Akamai will continue to grow revenue and profits. There have been times in the past when I thought Akamai was undervalued and bought shares. Despite my generally long-term outlook, Akamai in the past sometimes became the playground for the momentum crowd, so I sold my stock when I thought it was clearly overvalued, and currently hold none. In the last 2 months of 2013 AKAM was relatively calm, trading in a range between $43.74 and $47.90. On January 7, AKAM closed at $46.68, giving it a market capitalization of $8.4 billion.Trailing GAAP EPS is $1.55 resulting in a P/E of 30.1, trailing non-GAAP EPS is $1.93, resulting in a P/E of 24.2. But consider too that the cash balance ended at $1.2 billion, with no debt.My reaction to this picture is that the current price is reasonable. Given history, I would be surprised if there is no more momentum-driven volatility for AKAM. Given my high opinion of Akamai's management and knowledge of technology trends, I think any long-term investor can be happy at the current price or lower. In other words, if you want Alpha buy on the dips, then hold through the short-term volatility and trust the trend will be higher as the years pass.The next catalyst for a price movement is likely to be Q4 results. Remember that Q4 is seasonally strong, so guidance for Q1 2014 will likely be sequentially down. For instance, Q1 2013 non-GAAP EPS was $0.43, quite a drop from $0.54 in Q4 2012.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

I think management can increase the capital distributions to shareholders.Cash flow from operations is trending higher. Free cash flow during the trailing twelve months was $356 million. FCF increased 15% during fiscal 2012 and 29% during fiscal 2011. In the next couple of years, Akamai could be returning $200M of capital to shareholders, annually.The growth rate has slowed recently. But over the past 3-years, revenues grew at an average rate of 16.9%, which is below the 10-year average of 25.2%. Akamai should be viewed as a growth company with adequate liquidity, and solid profitability. I expect Akamai to continue to return excess capital to shareholders in the coming years. Also, the organization is likely to generate a return on equity above my cost of equity during the next 52 weeks.RisksThis section does not discuss all risks related to an investment in Akamai.Valuation & Portfolio ManagementFrom a technical perspective, shares of Akamai are in an intermediate-term uptrend as part of a primary-degree uptrend. This follows an intermediate term decline. Simply put, the technicals are bullish.There are some diversification benefits to investing in Akamai. The correlation of Akamai and the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) since 2009 is 0.67. Since 2011, the correlation is 0.74, and since 2013, the correlation is 0.66. Akamai is strongly correlated with the S&P 500, but there are diversification benefits. Given the high correlations, I will assume that at the very least the relationship since 2009 is statistically significant.How much of the variation of the share price of Akamai is explained by the variation of the share price of the S&P 500. Since 2009, 45.6% of the variation is explained by the variation of the S&P 500. Since 2011, 54.7% of the variation is explained by the variation of the S&P 500, and 43.8% is explained by the variation of the S&P 500 since 2013. A substantial amount of the variation of the share price of Akamai is explained by the variation of the market; thus, forecasts for the market should be included in forecasts for Akamai.I utilize 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month share price forecasts. The forecasts are for share prices of $46.74, $47.85, and $50.07. The current share price is $48.58, which means that Akamai is trading above trend.How likely is Akamai to outperform the broader market? Using my proprietary model, I think it is somewhat likely that Akamai will outperform the broader market. I view the chance of outperformance as being about 60%.Given the fundamentals of the company, Akamai should trade at a premium to the market. Akamai trades at 3.4 times book value while the market trades at 2.6 times book value. Akamai is at worst fairly valued, but the share price can go higher as the financial performance provides a tailwind.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1879131,23469,2013-12-05T04:33:25-05:00,,"In today's Oxen Group recap, we will be looking at Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) in our daily deeper look as well as General Motors (NYSE:GM) in our company news section. GM had two interesting news stories break Wednesday with a major hedge fund noting shares could rise 40% or more, while the company sold a stake in Ally Financial. The Oxen Group covers both companies year round, and we want to update our current pricing to reflect recent occurrences. Additionally, as always, we will do our typical market overview, important news breakdown, and give our perspective on what's moving the market.Market OverviewThe markets moved lower on Wednesday, making it four down days in a row. It was a big day for economic data with ADP Employment Change, New Home Sales, ISM Services, and the Fed Beige Book all being released. ADP Employment came in better than expected at 215K versus expectations of 160K. October numbers were revised from 130K to 184K as well. The rise in employment at such a nice level is giving way to more speculation that the Fed will begin to taper in December, and a lot of market participants are selling on that speculation. Additionally, that speculation got help from New Home Sales, which came in better than expected for October at an annualized rate of 444K versus 420K estimates. Further, the Fed Beige Book showed a lot of strength in most regions of the country. All that left traders believing taper will occur and backing off the market.Deeper LookAkamai TechnologiesOverviewToday, we are taking a look at Akamai Technologies. Heading into today, we had a Sell-rating on AKAM with a price target of $34. We have not been bullish on AKAM due to the fact that we believe the company lacked a major economic moat, and they have trouble due to competition. Some of that started to play out in the company's latest quarter when the company's guidance came in a bit lightAfter updating our model, we now have a price target of $39 with Hold rating from Sell, and we will talk about the reasons for this change in the paragraphs to follow.Industry TrendsAkamai operates within the cloud services industry with a focus on security, media delivery solutions, website optimization, classic cloud/server storage, and network solutions. The cloud industry, as we all know, has been undergoing considerable expansion as more and more companies/businesses move services to the Internet and to mobile as well as optimize their business to compete with others.Additionally, the company is operating in many online retail fields with over 250 retailers that use Akamai for website experience that helps with spikes in traffic, improve performance, guarantees the site will not go down, and protects the buyers with security.Here are some general industry statistics important for Akamai:- The IDC believes that cloud network spending will increase 25% in 2014 and account for 89% of all IT spending growth.- The cloud could produce $100B in sales in 2014 as more data centers come online, as well as an increase in cloud infrastructure services.- According to some studies, 69% of businesses that have separate budgets for cloud computing believe that they will increase that budget.- Emerging markets are expected to account for $740B of IT spending in 2014- Online retail will continue to grow with another 10% jump in 2014 and potentially $250B in sales, making up 8% of the entire industry.Major CatalystThe key catalyst for Akamai right now is the company's economic moat or lack thereof in conjunction with their acquisitions this year. It is difficult to form any economic moats in the software industry. While the software is unique, there tends to be another company that has a very similar product. In every field, AKAM has a competitor; from security to enterprise products to mobile delivery. Yet, this year has been marked by a high number of acquisitions for the company. The company has made two key acquisitions in the past few months with Prolexic and Velocius Networks. Prolexic helps the company in the security area while Velocius works with cloud optimization. We have seen this pattern for AKAM since we started following them. They make smaller acquisitions to help fine tune their product line and continue to expand.That method has been with them since we started covering them as we wrote in our article back in March:The company's latest acquisitions continue this trend. We are definitely fond of the Prolexic one as it provides a much needed security boost, which the company has signaled as their top growth area moving forward. Prolexic will give AKAM new exposure to large enterprise customers given a stronger security feature. Wells Fargo predicted that the deal could help security grow $100M. That is a big boost to the company.What we are seeing is a company that is growing through smart acquisitions that can allow them to expand their wide offerings. Instead of being in just one aspect of the cloud, data optimization, and IT revolution, they have their hand in a lot of things. They are also doing these things quite well because they are complementing their products with adding companies that work specifically on one aspect of IT. It is a great way to build a business, and we see no reason for that to stop.Here is the company's CEO talking about acquisition:Overall, we believe that this industry is one that is now constantly shifting and is tough to create an economic moat (just look at F5 Networks). Luckily, AKAM has built a whole family of products with in-house R&D and strength through acquisitions. What we had originally seen as a potential weakness now looks like a strength as a lot of these deals have worked out well.Pricing/ValuationRight now, AKAM has a 21 future PE, 5.4 price/sales, and 31 price/FCF ratio. It is not a cheap stock, but it is also a growth name. We want to determine whether or not the stock now has value by pricing out the company's potential moving forward.Revenue - The company reduced Q4 2013 estimates, but they appear to be short-term issues with more volatile inputs around the holiday season as well as a large renegotiation the company is working on with one of its top clients. Still, the company is looking at around 14% growth this year. We would expect something similar again next year as the market continues to expand. From there 2015-2017 are the question marks. The question is what is next for the ""third platform"" of IT. Will these companies continue to expand at similar rates? We would expect some slowdown to occur in this period as a lot of companies will look to spend less on IT as there has been an IT spending frenzy over the past couple years. A low double-digit, high single-digit growth level should still be expected.Operating margins - The company has seen operating margins mostly between 23-26%, and this should stay relatively the same. The company has seen operating margins drop in big acquisition years, but we would guess 2014 would likely be moderate in this category. There is not a lot of reason to expect things to move well outside of this range moving forward.Capex - The company noted that 2013 capex will stay at around 16% of revenue, which is quite high. It has been up in this area and should stay there for 2014. Yet, we would likely begin to see this decline as the growth phase starts to dry up past 2014.When we use this information in a DCF analysis, we still get a $35 price tag for AKAM in our worst-case scenario. In our best-case scenario, we get $43, putting our price target at $39. That level is still below current valuations. One of the issues that we still see is that the company has a high WACC and even in a best-case scenario, the company is still pricing in a lot of future growth. For us, we would need to see reason to believe 14%+ growth can still happen past 2015, which we do not see at this point.Company NewsToday, in our company news section, we will be diving into General Motors. The company was busy on Wednesday with a number of new developments, and we want to take a look at some of them to see how they fit into our model. The company is Hold-rated by us, as we believe that it has made quite a move in the past year and is likely to be less exciting. The company, though, saw two big developments occur Wednesday one day after another auto sales report.The first big news was Hayman Capital noted that they had taken a stake in the stock, and they followed that up by noting the company had 40% upside in the next 12-18 months. The reason for this is that the company is undervalued in comparison to its industry and the US government is still the largest shareholder and puts a lot of selling pressure on the name. They specifically liked the risk/reward profile in the name. Let's take a look at the first part about it being cheaper than its competition. GM sits with a PE of 16.5, price/sales at 0.4, price/book at 1.9, and price/FCF at 95.3. Ford (NYSE:F), a favorite of ours, has a PE at 11.7, price/sales at 0.5, price/book at 3.2, and price/FCF at 35.3. Toyota (NYSE:TM) sits with a 14 PE, 0.8 price/sales, 1.5 price/book, and 44 price/FCF. It is not like GM is really all that much cheaper, and in fact is actually more expensive in many ways.As for the government, the government's stake in GM will be done in March, and the Treasury Department still has around 100M shares at the last announcement. The shares will all be sold by March. At that time, it is likely GM will reinstate a dividend and potentially do a share buyback. Yet, in our opinion, this knowledge is not unique. The government buyback has been known for some time, and the stock is up 50%+ in the past year. Bass and Hayman are not saying anything new, and the news is more a flash in the pan than anything sustainable in our opinion.The other major news was that the company has sold its remaining stake in Ally for $900M. This news is actually better because it means that the company gets one step away from the government once again, as they have a large stake in Ally as well. The $900M does bring nice cash infusion into the company, which is a benefit. FCF in the TTM has only been $563M. The $900M could be part of a potential dividend or reinvestment project post-government. Removing this also takes some of the black eye away from the company and helps their overall image. Additionally, it can help potentially pay off $31B in debt the company has.GM has some bright prospects moving into 2014 with the government off its back, but they are no brighter than the rest of the auto industry. Given that shares are actually a bit more expensive than Ford , we prefer the latter with all things equal. At these levels, we believe the Ally deal is decent news but Bass is stating what has been known for some time. What we need to see is margin expansion from this company, a dividend reinstated, and the debt burden pulled back. Those things would be true catalysts for more upside.Thursday's OutlookThursday could be a day for the market to break its losing streak. A late recovery on Wednesday to push almost green could set up for some follow through on Thursday. The key for the day will be GDP for Q3, initial jobless claims, and the continued conversation of whether to taper or not. GDP will obviously play a large role in this as it's expected to come in at 3.0% from the 2.8% prior estimate. Jobless claims have been dropping. The question for the market right now becomes when can good news be good news and not bad news because we lose the Fed. We may be a while off from that, and if news is good, we may taper off again on Thursday. We will see how these reports drive the S&P (NYSEARCA:SPY) and Dow Jones (NYSEARCA:DIA) on Thursday.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

Shares are now trading in my buy zone, but the actual top differs from my estimated top. So now I need to figure out how I should be thinking about shares of Akamai.AKAM data by YChartsTo do that, I will take a look at third quarter results, the forecast for the fourth quarter, my forecast for 2014, and the underlying fundamentals of the business. Additionally, I will value the common equity shares.The fundamentals of the business are bullish for the valuations. High level, I'm bullish on the companies that are the backbone off the Internet. I think that management is probably correct in their forecast for $5 billion of annual revenues by the end of the decade, which means that the valuations have a high teens financial performance tail wind.AKAM Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsI am bullish on Akamai, but I would like a larger margin of safety before I accumulate shares.Fundamental AnalysisI view Akamai as one of the companies that is the backbone of the Internet. I am bullish on the Media Delivery Solutions and Performance and Security Solutions segments. Additionally, I'm bullish on the company's new hybrid cloud optimization offerings.Some of the key drivers of the business are video delivery, software downloads, gaming and social media.In the third quarter, the financial performance was solid with revenues growing about 15% and operating income increasing 25% on a reduction in depreciation expenses and a tax credit, which may not be sustainable.Looking forward to the fourth quarter, I agree with management's guidance of high-mid single digits to mid-teens revenue growth. This is also my forecast for calendar 2014.Management is setting the goal of $5 billion of annual revenues by the end of the decade. Akamai is currently generating about $1.5 billion in annual revenues. I think management can reach that goal, which could have positive implications for the valuations.IBM (IBM) acting as a reseller of Akamai's security offering should boost revenues in calendar 2014.Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) partnership with Akamai allows the firms to offer branch offices an end-to-end performance improvement and optimization solution, which could be accretive to 2015 revenues.According to Tom Leighton, chief executive officer of Akamai, the company strengthened its advantage in the speed of content delivery over the leading competitor.I think that the increased size of the sales force as well as the partnerships with IBM and Cisco should drive strong operating results in fiscal 2014 and 2015 and act as a tailwind to the valuations.ValuationsTo value the common equity shares of Akamai, I will use the technicals, multiplier model and enterprise value to EBITDA ratio. Cisco is used as a comparison company because it is the closest comparable that I can think of for Akamai.So I think the $45.50 to $37.50 zone is the buy zone. Under my worst case scenario, the share price returns to the $20-25 range; in that scenario, given solid fundamentals, I would look to overweight Akamai. I do not view a bottom as being in place yet.AKAM data by YChartsCisco is trading at half the EV/EBITDA of Akamai, which could be explained by Akamai's higher operating income growth rate. In terms of profitability the companies' ROIC are similar, which means they should be trading at similar values. In terms of risk, Akamai should be trading at a lower valuation than Cisco, but the betas are similar. I think that this model suggests that Akamai is fairly valued relative to Cisco because its higher valuation is justified by its higher growth rate, and similar risk and profitability.Akamai is typically valued higher than the S&P 500, which is probably explained by the fundamentals of the business. Relative to its historic valuations, Akamai is modestly undervalued. I would like a larger margin of safety before I accumulate shares.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1724582,55232,2013-10-02T05:30:24-04:00,,"Rackspace Hosting, Inc. (NYSE:RAX) and Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKAM) are both successful firms operating IT services and security solutions in the cloud, providing computing power, front-end operations for corporate websites, and pure and hybridized cloud options for firms who want to take advantage of in-house IT and outsourced support and security for the same services.Companies in the CloudsRackspace Hosting, Inc. and its fanatics are emblematic of a committed corporate culture that continues to innovate, specifically when employing the resource known as open source encoding. To remain competitive against behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Rackspace created a large infrastructure of 98,884 servers to support cloud computing, and relied on open source development of code from firms who would then end up using Rackspace servers as a means to handle their increasing workloads. This model allows RAX to upsell and provide value added services AFTER the firm has adopted the RAX open source language OpenStack to operate their respective IT services.Lanham Napier and his crew have indicated with corporate guidance that they expect near term growth and net profit of 13% to be resurgent, but not immediately. This means the stock could run lower, into the $45 range. The longer term guidance RAX have provided indicates that they could see margins staying roughly flat, if not rising slightly again, and that the slowed pace of growth experienced in Q1 and Q2 of 2013 have been symptomatic of the infrastructure development and investment the organization has undertaken. The gamble might pay off, but for now its a questionable investment at these price levels, and could complete the chart below, approaching the valuation I have computed for the stock.The capable, yet less visible, Akamai, Inc., has been able to offer scalable benefits associated with offloading services from client infrastructures, allowing clients to have fewer hard assets in place while providing an ongoing revenue stream for Akamai. This translates into 125000+ servers operating dedicated, hybrid cloud and true cloud servers to provide IT and, increasingly, security services, in a vast array of companies across a widely diversified group of industries. Notable firms under the umbrella of the Akamai Intelligent Platform include BMW, AMD, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), NASA, The BBC, The NFL, The U.S. Department of Defense, Red Bull, IBM, Travelocity, The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Urban Outfitters (NASDAQ:URBN), and Yahoo.com (YHOO).These firms, well poised in their respective fields, seem to be capable of providing long term revenue streams for AKAM well into the foreseeable future, and are being joined regularly by new contracts from companies large and small alike. The security services that Akamai provides are one of their most lucrative revenue streams, comprising almost 50% of their total gross as they have handily overcome the lack of public awareness of this service. This appears to be a service, like most of their offerings, that is coupled an expansion of the global economy and a diffusion of internet access and cybersecurity, as the firm is seeing growth of 105% in China, and a robust 22% and 15% in Europe and N. America respectively. The revenue and profit growth of Akamai in the past quarter clearly indicates that the company has room to run in the remainder of the year.The Long and Short of Cloud CompaniesThe way to play the cloud this quarter: short Rackspace with a price target around $45, or buy Akamai on any significant pullback and any price below $52 as there are murky skies in Rackspace's future, and there appears to be a great chance of continuing sunshine, albeit with clouds, for Akamai.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in RAX over the next 72 hours.

1753242,48501,2013-10-18T05:45:33-04:00,,"Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM), Internet performance enhancement firm, is trading at a higher valuation since the last time I wrote about the company; since that time, new information is being factored into the valuation. In this report, I add to and update my previous analysis.There are several factors impacting the supply and demand for Akamai's solutions.On the demand side, the positives for Akamai are increasing website complexity, cloud computing, and Internet video; the negatives are mobile Internet usage and pricing pressure.It is not clear that Akamai has a competitive advantage in mobile Internet performance enhancement.On the supply side, Akamai faces competition from Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and the telecoms, who could provide alternatives.Right now, Akamai has a competitive advantage that is reflected in excellent financial performance and a premium valuation.Financial Performance & ValuationsFollowing the release of second quarter results, I updated my financial performance model and valuations.I'm tightening my fiscal 2013 revenue range to $1.55 to $1.62 billion with an operating margin in the 25.5% to 26.6% range and a net profit margin range of 16.9% to 18.9%.I expect revenue growth to continue to come from new customers and increasing sales to existing customers during the remainder of 2013.Lower bandwidth cost per unit is offsetting higher total bandwidth cost, which is increasing profitability; long term, this result should be transient.Longer term, I expect 2015 revenue of $1.725 billion, which would be a 7.88 CAGR from 2012.The market is pricing in a substantial amount of earnings growth into the share price of Akamai: Almost 60% of the share price is attributable to earnings growth. I view that as too high of a price for earnings growth.Relative to its five-year average multiplier model valuations, Akamai is overvalued: The intrinsic value using this model is $44.91, which means Akamai is 16% overvalued.On a time-series basis, Akamai is overvalued: The valuations are near a peak.Consequently, using all three valuation models, Akamai is overvalued, but at what level should I accumulate shares?Portfolio ManagementPreviously, I modeled a top at $48 per share with a buy zone at $36 to $41 per share but now, I'm modeling the share price topping at $57.50 and declining at least 15%, which could be a buying opportunity. Using this model, $43 to $49 per share would be the buy zone.The 52-week price target is below the current share price: The 52-week price target is $48.19; this means that Akamai's share price is well above trend.Since March 2009, the compound monthly growth rate is 1.8%, which is an excellent but unsustainable growth rate.The monthly return distribution shows favorable characteristics: the skewness is positive and the tails are not fat.In conclusion, from a portfolio management and valuation perspective, I'm not going to accumulate shares of Akamai at this level; I will use a substantial decline in the valuations to accumulate shares.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1567312,48501,2013-07-24T10:51:31-04:00,,"Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKAM) is a cyclical growth company that benefits from the low interest rate economic environment. But, the relative performance is mixed. Akamai outperformed the S&P 500 over 10 years, but underperformed over 3 years and outperformed over the past year; I can't draw any conclusions from the historic total return performance.In terms of the operating ratios, the asset utilization is generally improving. The company is liquid and solvent. There aren't any major legal cases pending. Also, the free cash flow and capital expenditure metrics are bullish for the valuations.From a business prospective, the business profile is bullish; the company should benefit from the increased use of the Internet. The investment activities are mainly aimed at increasing capacity and improving product offerings. Also, the forecasted return on equity is about 10%. And, the valuations are being boosted by strong historic growth and forecasted growth. Currently, Akamai is fairly valued, but I will accumulate shares in the $36 to $41 zone.RisksBusiness ProfileAkamai provides content delivery and cloud infrastructure services for accelerating and improving the delivery of content and applications over the Internet. Their solutions range from delivery of conventional content on websites, to tools that support the delivery and operation of cloud-based applications, to live and on-demand streaming video capabilities.The company offers five core solutions: Terra, Aqua, Sola, Kona, and Aura. The Terra solutions are designed to improve the operation of highly-dynamic applications used by enterprises to connect with employees, suppliers, and customers. Aqua solutions are designed to accelerate business-to-customer websites that integrate rich, collaborative content and applications into their online architecture. Akamai's Sola solutions are designed to enable enterprises to execute digital media and software distribution strategies by improving the end-user experience, boosting reliability and scalability and reducing the cost of Internet-related infrastructure. Kona is designed to provide superior cloud computing security, prevent data theft and downtime and mitigate distributed denial of service attacks by extending the security perimeter outside of the data center. Aura Network Solutions is a line of managed and licensed content delivery network [CDN] offerings designed specifically for network operators to build their own CDN capabilities.Akamai generates just under 30% of its revenues from outside of the U.S. Revenue from Europe is just under 20% of total revenues. The company derives those revenues from the world's leading corporations, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Audi, Dolce & Gabbana, EMC (EMC), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Akamai also derives a portion of its revenues from public sector customers. In recent years, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues.In terms of competition, the company doesn't mention any specific competitors in its annual report. Generally, Akamai competes with companies offering products and services that address Internet performance problems. Based on the evidence in the competition section of the annual report, Akamai competes with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), and Barracuda.In October 1998, Akamai entered into a license agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under which it was granted a royalty-free, worldwide right to use and sublicense the intellectual property of MIT under various patent applications and copyrights relating to Internet content delivery technology.Based on the pricing environment that Akamai's management cites, I believe Akamai is pursuing a low-cost strategy. In a low-cost strategy, companies strive to become low-cost producers and to gain market share by offering their products and services at lower prices than their competition while still making a profit margin sufficient to generate a superior rate of return based on the higher revenues achieved. Further, I believe Akamai is pursing a defensive and offensive low-cost strategy in order to protect and gain market share and increase returns.Companies seeking to follow low-cost strategies must control costs, operate efficiently and provide appropriate managerial incentives. Additionally, they must commit themselves to scrutinizing production systems and their labor force and to low-cost designs and product distribution. They must be able to invest in productivity-improving capital equipment and to finance that investment at a low cost of capital.That said, societal changes globally are making the Internet a larger part of our lives. As data transmission continues to increase, Akamai may play an increasingly important role. The number of network connected devices is expected to increase significantly in the coming years. For example, tooth brushes and coffee makers will probably be connected to the Internet within the next 10 years.Overall, the business profile is bullish for the valuations.Investing ActivitiesBesides the usual cash management investing activities, Akamai actively pursued an acquisition strategy and developed internal use software while increasing capacity.During 2012, the company recorded expenditure of $219.8 million for plant, property and equipment. Capitalization of internal-use software and cash paid for expenditure is reported as $336.7 million.During 2010, 2011, and 2012, the company substantially increased capacity and made acquisitions aimed at improving product offerings. The investing activities are bullish for the valuations.Consolidated Forecast and ValuationsAkamai's revenue is increasing in the low double digits. Revenue growth is partly attributable to acquisitions. Also, the firm has a solid operating margin and net income margin, both of which don't vary significantly.That said, I'm forecasting revenue to increase in 2013 in the 10% to 20% range. That means revenue should be in the $1.51 billion to $1.65 billion range. Operating income should be in the roughly $350 million to $430 million range, and net income should be in the roughly $225 million to $280 million range. I included a 10% percent revenue growth forecast because the company may not make as many, if any, major acquisitions in 2013.The company has solid margins and an excellent pace of revenue growth. The forecasted fundamentals are bullish for the valuations.The short term time series valuation suggest Akamai is fairly valued to modestly overvalued. Relative to the 5-year average valuations, Akamai is fairly valued, but Akamai is overvalued relative to the S&P 500. Thus, Akamai is fairly valued; paying 5.6 times sales, 3.3 times book and 34.5 times earnings for a growth company is fair.What price range would make Akamai undervalued?Share Price Forecast & Return on EquityThe share price topped at about $48; so, I will use the $48 level to model share price declines.Based on my model, I would get involved on the long side somewhere in the $41 to $36 range. In June, the $40 level acted as support.I forecast a 2013 return on equity of about 10%. That is above the firm's cost of equity. Thus, Akamai should create wealth for shareholders. The evidence suggest being bullish on Akamai.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

At the time I was long AKAM, but I sold out at $48.05 on May 16, 2013. I prefer to buy and hold, but I have been in and out of AKAM over the last decade because it is so volatile. This is no reflection on the company itself; it is a reflection on the poor judgment of market participants, both on the upside and the downside.Time for an update. Akamai reported strong revenue in the second quarter (Q2): revenue was $378.1 million, up 3% sequentially from $368.0 million and up 14% from $331.3 million in the year-earlier quarter. GAAP net income was $61.9 million, down 13% sequentially from $71.5 million, but up 40% from $44.2 million year-earlier. GAAP EPS (earnings per share) was $0.34, down 13% sequentially from $0.39, but up 42% from $0.24 year-earlier.On a non-GAAP basis Q2 net income was $84 million, resulting in EPS of $0.46. Those results reflected a 10% decrease sequentially from Q1 but a 25% increase from Q2 2012. Cash from operations was a significantly stronger $130 million.Both GAAP and non-GAAP net income and EPS included a $9 million (or $0.05 per share) benefit from a change in depreciation methodology.Operating expenses were up significantly year over year, cutting into earnings. This mainly reflects R&D and sales and marketing expenses for the newer service offerings for cloud computing and Internet security.Akamai has two major segments. Content acceleration, its traditional business, had revenue of $179 million, up 14% y/y. This segment is always in a struggle between ever decreasing prices per unit delivered and increasing units delivered, but tends to trend higher consistently y/y.The performance and security segment saw revenues of $157 million, increasing 7% sequentially and 19% y/y. Service and support segment revenue was $31 million, up 14% sequentially and 41% y/y.As I said in my last article, ""The amount of data being served will continue to increase, and Akamai essentially runs a private toll road system within the Internet for those who want the fast service that is essential to capturing customers and converting views to sales."" Akamai also has a unique ability to offer security and other cloud services that will cause revenue and profits to ramp for the foreseeable future. Resale of services through AT&T have begun, and that could drive significant revenue by the end of 2013.So the only real question for investors is price. I mainly write for long-term investors like myself, with a typical time horizon minimum of 2 years.On August 5, 2013 Akamai closed at $46.90. That is not much off a 52-week high of $48.47 back on May 16, but up 43% from the 52-week low of 32.64 on April 22, 2013. That shows you how volatile the stock is, but it is also notable that on June 21, 2013 you could buy AKAM for $40.46.There is no reason to expect less volatility. If the past is prelude, it pays to buy AKAM on the dips. Then you are relatively safe short-run but can be more certain to reap gains in the long run.At $46.45 Akamai's trailing P/E is 33.7, but it is notable that by GAAP or non-GAAP figures you can get very different P/Es.I believe that there is little long-term danger in buying at this price, and considerable long-term upside. You have to be able to stand the volatility or be willing to take your chances trading against it.I want to emphasize that the stock price volatility is not because Akamai's underlying model is particularly volatile. As far as I can tell, it is a historic legacy going all the way back to the 1999 Internet bubble. A lot of trading in and out of AKAM takes place. Nevertheless, the general trend since mid-2011 has been up, and that reflects the commercial success and increases in revenue and profits of this well-managed and well-situated company.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1710312,20411,2013-09-24T10:43:59-04:00,,"As more consumers continue to buy mobile devices, and more TV shows move to the Web, streaming video speed is becoming more valuable. Akamai Technologies, Inc. (AKAM) content delivery network streams online video to homes and mobile devices, handles e-commerce transactions for retailers, and speeds up the delivery of software and business applications over the Web. The stock is up over 53% in the last 5 months alone, as the company has been benefiting from the mobile device explosion. Should investors be buying or selling at these levels?The company has servers in more than 700 cities and 80 countries around the world, and Akamai delivers content to the 60 top e-commerce sites, all 30 top media sites, nine of the 10 top banks and other major portals, and accounts for an estimated 20% of all Web traffic. Many companies spend money on web acceleration and content delivery technologies to avoid lost sales and customers due to slow web pages. After the recent upgrade of the company's FastTCP network, indicator showed significant improvements in select customer and end user instances, ranging from 8% in Japan to 105% in China, with both North America and Europe seeing 15% to 22% increases. These increases not only improved download speeds for music/MP3s, games and videos, but also enhanced the quality of streaming video. This is very important to Akamai's customers who will pay to reduce the number of times a video stream pauses or stalls, as they work to increase viewer retention ratesHowever, Akamai's fastest growing division is its security solutions segment, which is generating nearly half of its total revenues. During Q4 2012, the segment saw five times growth on the prior year quarter, and subsequent first and second quarters delivered growth of 17% and 19% respectively. The company has been hiring sales staff to add new customers, which could take four or five quarters to get the full benefits of the sales force. In any case, the company has been keeping investors happy, as the stock is up over 160% over the last two years, and based on the Stock Traders Daily real-time live trading report, is currently near a test of long-term resistance as well.Akamai has been working on cybersecurity defenses for its platform for over a decade, long before attackers began making headlines by taking down websites for major banks and enterprises. Over the past year, the Kona Site Defender solution has proved to be successful against even the largest and most sophisticated attacks. The Kona Site Defender is unique because it can utilize a massive scale to identify and filter out attacks well before they reach the enterprise or cloud data center, without negatively affecting performance. This means that Akamai's defenses operate in an always-on mode, which is an important advantage over traditional security solutions, as many are turned on after the attack has begun because of performance issues, and those can often be too late.One problem for Akamai with its older CDN business is that prices have been falling, as much as 15% to 20% a year. The company will also have to compete with the likes of Limelight Networks, Inc. (LLNW) and Amazon.com, Inc.'s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services. So far, rising volume continues to offset the falling CDN prices, as mobile e-commerce, online video, downloaded games and data traffic soar over Akamai's CDN network. By expanding into cloud infrastructure, AKAM can target higher margins and big clients such as AT&T Inc. (T) for its AURA network solutions, as well as Apple Inc. (AAPL).Business has been good for Akamai and shareholders are holding significant profits right now. It is notable however, that Akamai's director Paul Sagan sold 50,000 shares of AKAM on the open market on Wednesday, September 18. The shares were sold at an average price of $52.03, for a total value of $2,601,500.00. So, even as its business continues to thrive, stock price matters, it mattered to him, and right now the stock is near a five year high, and close to a test of long-term resistance. If the stock tests resistance, and remains below resistance, as defined in our real time trading report, Stock Traders Daily expects lower levels and a test of support. That would make AKAM a sell/short at resistance, with risk controls defined as a break above resistance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: By Neal Rau for Stock Traders Daily and neither receives compensation from the publicly traded companies listed herein for writing this article."
1522822,20875,2013-06-26T15:11:31-04:00,,"Dynamic content delivery has been available for a number of years and beyond just basic caching functionality, solutions in the market now focus on route, connection and content optimization. As online commerce sites have grown more complex, they rely on every feature and function of a CDN to quickly and optimally serve users. More importantly, these sites have to cater to higher user expectations across an ever-changing set of devices.To date, Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) has pretty much dominated the content delivery market when it comes to offering Internet retailers a PCI compliant based platform that solves the specific challenges commerce companies face. But just like with video content delivery, a market that Akamai owned for years before Limelight (NASDAQ:LLNW), Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others stepped in and pushed pricing down in the market, EdgeCast is looking to do the same thing in the commerce market. EdgeCast is now out in the industry educating customers that in many cases, there is now a credible alternative to Akamai, that one vendor no longer owns that market and that retail customers should expect better features and pricing, as another vendor has finally stepped up with an alternative in this segment.EdgeCast's new solution, launched last month, which they call “Transact,” combines the concept of a purpose-built platform for commerce with PCI Compliance, front-end optimization, more efficient caching and what they say are faster SSL connections. Leveraging their existing Application Delivery Network, EdgeCast deployed an entirely new network dedicated to their commerce customers, in a more cost-effective manner, to deliver dynamic and static content globally and securely. EdgeCast also said it will match up their code freezes with the holiday online shopping season so customers can be guaranteed that EdgeCast will not make any code changes to its platform during the most critical time of the year.To help serve and accelerate commerce sites, a CDN must have a deployment to serve a global set of users, be highly available with excellent performance and be PCI compliant. The audience for sites has continued to change and many commerce websites now offer multiple languages, different domains based on country, international shipping and local currencies. With this diverse audience, sites must maintain availability and reliability through a CDN that can serve content and information as quickly as possible. This all has to be done in a secure and compliant environment. PCI (Payment Card Industry) Compliance is not just a nice-to-have it is a necessity. Without it, customer data such as credit card information is vulnerable.Above and beyond site acceleration there are a number of functions that commerce sites can leverage to improve performance and internal processes. Relying on a dedicated, purpose-built platform for commerce allows sites to confidently serve traffic without the burden of sharing a network with large social media sites, videos, downloads or other types of content. Additionally, code freezes to match up with holiday schedules allow sites to handle Black Friday, Cyber Monday and the rest of the shopping season without having to worry about downtime, code rollbacks or other circumstances. Newer functionality around secure connections called OCSP stapling allows for massive performance improvements for what is generally some of the most resource-intensive, yet the most important content. OCSP stapling involves improvements around the certificate revocation process and pushing that out to the edge and closer to end users results in faster performance of SSL requests. Additionally, allowing sites to make changes more quickly and efficiently with faster, near-instant purging and more reliable configuration changes permits for better management of internal processes and faster responses to user behavior.Leveraging their existing relationship with Google’s PageSpeed technology, EdgeCast allows customers to leverage Edge Optimizer – front-end optimization – at the edge in a highly scalable and flexible manner. EdgeCast was the first CDN to have FEO built-in at the edge and Edge Optimizer gives customers the ability to manage optimizations on an individual basis while still maintaining control over content. Their rules engine gives granular control over cache control settings, mobile device enablement, content protection and more. Customers can further control that content with nearly instant content purging using the new Piranha purge functionality and configuration changes generally take less than an hour to propagate.EdgeCast has also leveraged OCSP stapling in order to make SSL connections as fast as possible. By pushing part of the SSL process to the edge, end users will now have even faster performance for the most important content – shopping carts and checkout. This functionality allows EdgeCast to serve SSL much faster using DigiCert than other certificate authorities such as Comodo or CyberTrust. EdgeCast’s new purpose-built platform for ecommerce should help change the way people look at traditional CDN providers. Focusing on commerce with PCI Compliance, faster configuration changes and content purging, more efficient technologies and what they say are better SSL connections, should allow EdgeCast to provide retailers with a premium site acceleration service and show that there is now an alternative to Akamai.How quickly EdgeCast can make a dent in Akamai’s business I can’t say, it’s too early to know. But EdgeCast is on track to do more than $100M in total revenue this year, they have nearly 300 employees and they are getting to a size and scale where they are becoming a really big thorn in Akamai’s side. They already dominate the licensed/managed CDN market; a business Akamai is just now trying to get into and EdgeCast is one of the CDNs responsible for pushing down video CDN pricing in the market over the past two years. It’s not “doom and gloom” for Akamai, but to date, no one has really stepped up to pressure Akamai’s dominance in the Internet Retail market and clearly, that is about to change. The Commerce segment is a highly profitable core vertical for Akamai and one where they are totally dominant, so if EdgeCast can get traction in this segment, it can impact Akamai’s commerce business and is something that should be watched closely over the coming quarters.Updated: Looking at EdgeCast’s website and other public information, some of EdgeCast’s current commerce customers include: Etsy, Bluefly, Overstock, Pacific Sunware, Wet Seal, Garmin, Vegas.com, Magneto, B&H Photo, ZipRealty.com, Burlington Coat Factory, CheaperThanDirt.com, Cooking.com, One Kings Lane and Ideeli, amongst others."
1895771,23479,2013-12-12T14:59:44-05:00,,"Verizon’s (NYSE:VZ) recent decision to buy out Edgecast could potentially shake up the CDN (content delivery network) industry and increase competition for the market leader, Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM). After numerous rumors, Verizon confirmed in a press release Monday, December 9, that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire CDN start-up Edgecast for an undisclosed sum. [1] The deal, which is expected to close in early 2014, not only strengthens one of Akamai’s rivals, but also potentially ends Verizon’s reselling partnership with Akamai.The impact on Akamai may not be overnight given that the company is the biggest in the CDN market and has a very well-diversified customer base. But the loss of Verizon as a reseller for its enterprise CDN services is pretty much a given, once Edgecast’s CDN is able to adequately replace Akamai’s services. What is unclear (and will remain so until Verizon gives an official confirmation) is the timing of the expiry of the contract that Verizon has with Akamai and the value that it holds for Akamai in revenue terms. If we go by industry expert Dan Rayburn’s estimate of $75-100 million for this year, Akamai could be looking at a revenue loss of as much as 6% in the near term. [2] This assumes customers choose to switch from Akamai’s service to Verizon, which may well not happen. The key here is whether Verizon continues to resell Akamai’s enterprise services.Impact On Industry Pricing And MarginsMore than the immediate revenue hit, however, what is more concerning for Akamai is the growing trend of customers and partners looking to gain more control over their ecosystem by building their own CDNs. Earlier this year, we saw Netflix take its business away from Akamai by deciding to build a CDN of its own. Now, with Verizon’s Edgecast acquisition, it is becoming clearer that with rising video consumption, some customers and partners are seeing value in taking the content delivery part of their ecosystem in-house, to save on costs and have a greater control over the end-user experience. In order to retain customers, Akamai may have to make some concessions on pricing and take a hit on margins.Verizon’s backing will give Edgecast the scale to cut down on network costs and get aggressive on pricing, which might drive down the market price for video content delivery. It will take time and investment, though, as Edgecast (said to have revenues this year of ~$100 million) at present lacks scale. In the last couple of years, we have seen the CDN pricing decline stabilize, but if Verizon makes a strategic decision to get aggressive on pricing, Akamai could face top line pressure as some of its old contracts come up for renewal in the coming years. Akamai has done well in recent years to counter the impact of CDN commoditization by increasing its focus on premium value-added services such as dynamic site acceleration (DSA), front-end optimization (FEO) and security solutions, which have grown in importance to account for almost 60% of its total revenues currently. However, Verizon’s reach and resources could give Edgecast’s fledgling PCI compliant value-added platform the required boost to emerge over time as a more formidable rival to Akamai in the VAS space and eventually pressurize its high-end margins.Threat To Akamai’s M&E businessAdditionally, Akamai could be threatened by Verizon’s aggressive posturing in the media and entertainment space, where Edgecast’s acquisition gives the carrier the final missing piece in the video platform it is putting together to attract studios and broadcasters. This is a market Akamai does not address. And Verizon is looking to build on its FiOS TV content relationships and the recent acquisition of Uplynk to create an online video streaming platform that allows broadcasters to control their ecosystem end-to-end – from content generation to distribution. Verizon hopes to achieve this by using Uplynk to streamline the process of encoding and uploading the live feed while Edgecast’s CDN seamlessly completes the last-mile task of delivering the video to the end user. This all-in-one service could be a better value proposition to broadcasters than the current Akamai model of forging together partnerships with third-parties such as Brightcove and iStreamPlanet to provide the rest of the streaming services. [2]On the brighter side for Akamai, the Verizon-Edgecast deal gives the CDN leader an opportunity to expand its reseller deals with carriers such as TELUS, Deutsche Telecom and Pacnet, that are currently partners with Edgecast but may be reluctant to resell a Verizon service going forward. Building better relationships with carriers may not prove to be a big revenue driver for Akamai but has a positive impact on costs and network performance, which could be key to Akamai’s margins as the business environment gets increasingly competitive in the coming years.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
1492672,46531,2013-06-10T18:45:22-04:00,,"Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) should be getting more attention. Not that many people have noticed that Akamai shares delivered an amazing 55.69% return in the past 12 months, doubling the size of its market capitalization. Even better, after making a comparison with other competitors -- specifically, Level 3 Communications (NASDAQ:LVLT), VeriSign (NASDAQ:VRSN), and Internap Network Services (NASDAQ:INAP) -- I found out that Akamai is the clear winner in terms of stock performance. How did they achieve this? And more importantly, will Akamai's stock continue outperforming every major stock index in the next months?In order to explain Akamai's success, it is better to start by describing the attractiveness of its business: content delivery networks. But what is so attractive about this?As Tom Friedman from the New York Times wisely noted, in the last decade we have moved from a connected world to a hyperconnected world. But not only the number of sites has grown exponentially, websites and mobile sites nowadays are much heavier than five or 10 years ago.Almost every page of most widely used services shows content from more than 10 servers: many APIs (from fonts to maps) come from Google server farms, ads usually have their own server, images may be hosted separately, social gadgets are also in different servers, etc. In theory, this causes the loading time to increase considerably. Yet in practice the loading time remains either constant or, in fact, is decreasing. This is mainly because Internet connections are getting faster, but at the same time, content delivery networks are playing a much more important role in minimizing loading times, especially nowadays.No serious webmaster can afford a major difference in loading time between its site and the competitors. There is an obsession with minimizing the loading time of your site, which is totally natural, as page loading time is a crucial part of any website's user experience, just like the beautifulness of the design or the efficiency of the algorithms behind the site. To mention a concrete example, according to a Forrester Consulting survey, already in 2009 online shoppers cited website as a crucial factor in their online store loyalty: 40% of them replied that they would wait no more than 3 seconds for a page to load before abandoning the site.The Akamai Intelligent PlatformIn order to minimize the loading time of their sites, webmasters (specifically, e-commerce, gaming and media companies) have to rely on content delivery networks (CDN). There are few other choices at the moment. And even if a new method for loading sites faster appears in the next years, they would continue relying partially on CDN: you have to use any available tool to make your site the fastest available option on the Internet. And one of the best tools available at the moment to achieve this is nothing else but the Akamai Intelligent Platform, Akamai's flagship product.The Akamai Intelligent platform is how Akamai provides cloud infrastructure services for accelerating and improving the delivery of content and applications to over one third of Fortune's Global 500 companies' sites: from cloud based applications, conventional content (heavy images) to live and on-demand streaming video capabilities and HTML5 based games. This platform comprises more than 95,000 servers located across nearly 1,000 networks in 70 countries worldwide and can deliver hundreds of billions of Internet interactions daily.It is also the best CDN available, although this can be hard to prove theoretically. But we better start with some intuitive facts: Akamai is a first mover, the company practically introduced the concept of CDNs more than a decade ago to help businesses overcome performance, reliability and scalability issues in their websites. Now, Akamai delivers about 15-20% of all web traffic worldwide and provides several types of commercial services, which go beyond simple content delivery: IP application acceleration, EdgeComputing, on-demand high-definition media, storage, analytics and authoritative DNS services, to mention some examples.How much does Akamai help a business website?Well, there is an Akamai study on an e-commerce website. Visitors were partitioned: half of them were directed to the site through Akamai while the other half were sent directly to the site's origin servers. Users on Akamai were 15% more likely to complete a purchase and 9% less likely to abandon the site after viewing just one page. How about B2B applications? An IDC survey in 2009 showed that customers using Akamai's acceleration services reported annual revenue increases of $200,000 to over $3M ""directly attributable to the improved performance and reliability of their applications.""But what makes Akamai so special? Is being the first mover a strong competitive advantage in the CDN Industry? What guarantees the investor has that a startup with some linked servers won't appear all of the sudden and start stealing market share in this promising market?Well, to begin with, the Akamai network is not just a bunch of well optimized servers located all over the world (which is already a very challenging task to achieve). Akamai's servers run very sophisticated algorithms (patents!) to enable the delivery of highly scalable distributed applications. It comprises many smaller delivery networks, and each of them has been optimized to address a particular type of content: some will address images, others will address dynamic applications, and so on.Let me explain you how Akamai works. Every time you type a URL of an Akamai customer into your browser, the domain name of the URL is translated by a mapping system into the IP address of an Akamai ""edge server."" Each Akamai edge server is part of an edge server platform -- thousands of servers located in thousands of locations all over the world. To respond your request, the platform will find the fastest currently available way: it may request content from an origin server, use a server located near you, judge the kind of content you are about to see and use it as a criteria to choose your server, give you entirely cached content (in case the site you are about to see is not dynamic), etc.To perform all these operations, Akamai uses an optimal communications and control system. And finally, they collect a lot of data using server logs, client logs (over 100 terabytes of logs per day) and network and server information, which can be used for monitoring, analytics, reporting and alerting. This whole system represents a ""state of the art"" network, following excellent design principles: reliability (every component is redundant, which is important as there can be a broken pipe or an error at any time), scalability (more than 95,000 machines and growing), limited human management necessity (less prone to human errors) and high-performance driven.How Safe Is the Business?First of all, we know that the number of Internet connections continues growing. Likewise, the growing demand for heavy content (from video streaming to highly dynamic cloud based sites) is also a fact. Now, unfortunately for many (but not for Akamai), the Internet is not a single entity, it is actually composed of thousands of different networks, each providing access to a tiny percentage of end users. The largest network has only 5% of Internet access traffic. Therefore, we have two realities coexisting at the same time: on one hand, global traffic is increasing massively. On the other hand, the Internet continues being composed of thousands of networks. This makes inter-network data communications an extremely important issue in the next years. Specifically, the following problems will continue increasing (identified by Nygren, Sitaraman and Sun) :Considering that the Akamai network is a tool specifically designed to address each of this issues in the best possible way, we can be sure that in the next years the demand for Akamai network will continue increasing.How about other CDNs similar to Akamai? Do they pose a risk?Well, we cannot deny the fact that more and more CDNs are appearing but it is difficult for them to overcome Akamai in terms of performance. First of all, under the current state of technology, the more servers you have in your network and the more locations you cover, the more efficient your CDN will be. And Akamai is already very big. Too big to be reached by a small startup. I also explained in the previous section what makes Akamai network so special.An interesting paper by Huang et al. (""Measuring and Evaluating Large-Scale CDNs"") compares the performance of Akamai and one of its competitors, Limelight, provided by Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW). The paper does an excellent job in comparing these two CDNs with regards to the numbers of their content servers, their internal DNS designs, the geographic location of their data centers and their DNS and content server delays. Limelight is probably the best choice for comparison, because it embraces a different philosophy for CDNs: the Akamai way is to ""enter deep into internet server providers (ISP),"" and the Limelight design ""brings ISPs to home.""So, which network is the best choice?The paper founds evidence that Akamai network is superior in most comparison criteria. Let's start with the downside: to compare CDN availability, the researchers monitored all the servers for more than two months back in 2008, by connecting to port 80 of each once every hour. If a server cannot be connected for two consecutive hours, it is treated as down. The paper found that more than 50% of Akamai servers are always available, and that 70% or more of Limelight servers are always available. This shows that Akamai network is more difficult to maintain.But this is not necessarily bad news. After all, Akamai has many more servers which are distributed in many remote locations. What is important is to measure and compare delay performance.The paper founds that there is a big gap in delay performance between Akamai and Limelight. In North America, the delay to Limelight servers was 18% more than Akamai servers. In Europe, Limelight's delay is over 33% more than Akamai and in Asia about 127% worse. This clearly shows Akamai's advantage in performance.Not surprisingly, Limelight's stock has also performed worse than Akamai Technologies. I compared the stock performance for the past five years between these two CDN stocks and I found out that Limelight had an overall negative return (-31.94%), while Akamai had an excellent positive return (+21.08%). This shows that the market is well aware of who is the best in terms of performance.10 Years of GrowthAkamai shows an excellent revenue growth record. Annual revenue in 2012 was up 19% from 2011. GAAP net income also increased 2%, to $204 million, or $1.12 per diluted share. In the latest earnings call (late April), Akamai confirmed that revenue growth remains solid. Revenue for the first quarter of 2013 was $368M, a 15% increase over first quarter 2012 revenue of $319M. Net income is also improving, a 5% increase over the prior quarter (to $71M from $68M).Variant ViewBy this time, you should have noticed that although revenue growth is spectacular for a company that is already 10 years in this business, profitability isn't. To show this better, take a look at the next image: although revenue grew 19% (2011-2012), net income only grew 2% in the same period.I am concerned about the disparity between revenue and net income growth. One way to understand this is that competition is increasing from telecom companies, who are adding CDNs to their baskets of products. In this sense, Akamai did an excellent job in keeping its margins and price premium for the past 2 years; however, increasing competition could put Akamai's price premium in danger for the next quarters and this risk should not be ignored.We can also try to understand this figure from a cost perspective. About half of Akamai's costs of goods sold are related to colocation and bandwidth fees. These fees are decreasing as a percentage of revenue, but the decreasing rate is not strong enough to have a significant impact on net income growth. This leads me to think that Akamai is reaching the bottom vertex of its long run average cost curve, as the benefits of economies of scale apparently are starting to fade away. The bottom line is that we cannot have diseconomies of scale here. Either costs continue decreasing or reach a level so low that they cannot decrease any more. Also keep in mind that Akamai already delivers 20% of all web traffic. As Akamai moves from 20% to 30% in the next years, we will see how strong their pricing power really is and how much economies of scale can help the company to reduce its cost base even after reaching such an enormous scale of operations.Balance SheetNothing to complaint about here. The company exited the latest quarter with more than $1B in cash and marketable securities, and no debt. Therefore, Akamai is prepared to invest or make acquisitions, if needed in the near future.ValuationI use Old School Value financial spreadsheet and a discounted cash flow valuation under the following assumptions: a 15% average revenue growth rate for the next 10 years, which is optimistic in the sense that I am assuming the company will be able to keep its current growth rate; a 9% WACC discount rate and a 3% terminal growth rate, I obtain a fair value of $52.32 per share, approximately 15% above the current stock price.RisksReferencesFinal RemarksDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in AKAM over the next 72 hours.

Tensions among investors and market volatility are high as we weigh the effects of QE tapering amidst a world with struggling economies.Stocks that have global discretionary exposure or unjustifiably high valuations have gotten hit the hardest over the last month or so. If economies do weaken and consumers slow their spending habits once again, there are a few areas that could still see strong growth. In fact, today’s bull of the day might actually benefit from consumers staying home, surfing the web or engaging in more online content.Think about them as a quasi-defensive growth company; sure they have competition, but they are one of the best at what they do and it seems that investors may be gearing up for the company to make another leg higher as short interest dropped dramatically as of late.The most recent short interest data has been released by the Nasdaq for the 05/31/2013 settlement date, showed a 6,608,451 share decrease in total short interest from 10,971,242 or 37.59% since 05/15/2013. This shift happened even as the stock price skyrocketed.Who are they?Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM)is more than just a “cloud” company; the company provides the leading cloud platform for helping enterprises provide secure, high-performing user experiences on any device, anywhere. The proliferation of mobile devices from the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), HTC (OTC:HTCCY), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and more all will add to the need for Akamai’s services. If you've ever shopped online, downloaded music, watched a web video or connected to work remotely, you've probably used Akamai's cloud platform. The company’s promise is to ensure the best online experience on any device, anywhere.Akamai delivers roughly 20% of ALL web traffic globally.Akamai helps enterprises accelerate innovation in the hyper-connected world by removing the complexities of technology and handling all the “leg work” in getting content from the company to the consumer and beyond.Their “Intelligent Platform” reaches globally and delivers locally, providing customers with unmatched reliability, security and visibility into their online business. This platform comprises more than 95,000 servers located across nearly 1,000 networks in 70 countries worldwide and delivers hundreds of billions of internet interactions daily.The company also tracks and defends against “attack traffic” on the internet, helping us all get the safest bandwidth possible. Global internet traffic is not only growing in raw content and users, but the speed at which we access that content is also rising rapidly.Recent ResultsMost Zack’s Rank #1 stocks have recently experience very positive analyst momentum and Akamai is no exception. After the company delivered a 24% beat last quarter (42cents versus the Zacks Consensus for 34 cents), there have been a slew of positive analyst revisions. The Zacks Consensus for the current and next quarters as well as FY2013 and FY 2014 are all higher than they were just 2 months ago, with none moving their estimates lower.Akamai is expected to report Q2 results on July 24th and given their Zacks Rank coupled with an earnings ESP of 8.11% in the current quarter, there is a very good chance they will beat the current Zacks Consensus for 37 cents. ESPs are also positive for the future, which is a good sign for guidance.AKAM has beat the Zacks Consensus earnings estimates 4 periods in a row, exceeding expectations by an average of 13.7%.The ChartsSince gapping almost 17% above the 200 day moving average on their last earnings report, the stock added another 15%, making a new 52 week high of 48.47 over the last month.Recently, shares have come down to their post gap price around the $42.50 level, which is just above the 50 day moving average of $42.34.Shares are in an odd area here; I’d like to see them trading above the $43.07 area, which coincides with a key Fibonacci level. If the stock breaks down here along with the broad market, look for strong support around $39.50 and even more at the 200 day moving average of $37.81.The reality is that the intermediate bullish trend is intact, and a buy around these levels wouldn’t be catastrophic, but Akamai’s forward P/E of 26.5 may put it on the temporary chopping block if the broad market corrects.Look for an initial upside target of $47.25, with another 5% breakout if shares eclipse the 52 week high.Akamai is my favorite pick in the cloud space at the moment; Rackspace (RAX), a Zacks Rank #5 Strong Sell, doesn’t look nearly as attractive and trades at double the multiple and while Hewlett-Packard (HPQ) (Zacks Rank #3 Hold) is trying to move into the space, they may have a long road ahead and are much less agile and “plugged in” than Akamai.

1372871,25120,2013-04-25T16:35:52-04:00,,"Shares of Akamai Technologies (AKAM) are trading with gains of more than 20% in Thursday's trading session. The provider of content delivery and cloud infrastructure services for content and applications on the internet reported a strong set of first-quarter results for the new year.First-Quarter ResultsAkamai Technologies generated first-quarter revenue of $368 million, up 15% on the year. Adjusting for the divestiture of its former Advertising Decision Solutions business unit, revenues were up by some 18%. Revenues came in ahead of consensus estimates of $357.7 million.Non-GAAP income came in at $93 million, or $0.51 per share. This is up 43% on the year before, when non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $0.36 pr share. Non-GAAP earnings comfortably beat consensus estimates of $0.46 per share.Comforting to investors is the fact that the gap between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings is shrinking as the pace of stock-based compensation growth is slowing down. GAAP net income came in at $71 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, which is up 65% on the year.Akamai used some of its large cash balances to repurchase its own shares. During the first quarter, Akamai repurchased 1.1 million shares for approximately $40 million. Under its current share repurchase program being authorized, the company may repurchase another $119 million of its own shares.Looking into the second quarterFor the current second quarter, Akamai expects to generate revenues between $368 and $378 million, up 1.4% on the first quarter, and up 12.6% on the year before. The revenue guidance comfortably beat consensus estimates of $363 million.Adjusted earnings are expected to come in between $0.44 and $0.46 per share. Analysts were looking for guidance for earnings of $0.44 per share.ValuationAkamai Technologies ended its first quarter with roughly $1.08 billion in cash, equivalents and marketable securities. The company operates without any debt outstanding for a strong net cash position.For the full year of 2012, Akamai generated revenues of $1.37 billion on which the firm net earned $204 million. Extrapolating the strong first-quarter results, and Akamai is on track to generate annual revenues of approximately $1.6 billion, on which it could earn roughly $300 million.Factoring in a 20% jump in the share price and the market is valuing the company at $7.7 billion. Excluding the net cash position of the firm values operating assets of Akamai around $6.6 billion. This values the operating assets of Akamai at around 4.1 times annual revenues and 22 times annual earnings.Despite the strong financial position of the firm, Akamai does not currently pay out a dividend.Some Historical PerspectiveLong-term holders of the stock have seen great returns, accompanied by even greater volatility. Shares have almost twenty-folded over the past decade as they rose from levels at $2 in 2003 to peak around $55 in 2007. Shares fell back towards $12 during the crisis to recover to $50 in 2010 again. After a sharp pullback towards $20 in 2011, shares have roughly doubled again, currently exchanging hands around $44 per share.The long-term rise in the share price has been supported by ever-growing operations. Between 2009 and 2012, Akamai managed to report a cumulative revenue growth of approximately 60%, to almost $1.4 billion. Earnings rose by a ""mere"" 40% over the same time period to just over $200 million in 2012.Investment ThesisAkamai's strong performance has been driven by a continued surge in internet traffic, geared towards social media, gaming and downloading. The company has currently placed over 132,000 servers across the globe. Akamai benefits handsomely as consumers see increasingly more content on Facebook (FB), download apps from Apple (AAPL) or watch shows on Netflix (NFLX).Akamai already indicated halfway through the quarter that it would end some of its media contracts as they were not adding too much value. Despite the wind-downs, performance in the media division was solid as traffic growth more than offset the impact of cancellations.Akamai is in a good spot right now. It is growing rapidly across a diverse range of businesses. The firm has targeted cloud, mobile, video and security as future growth areas, giving it a strong and diversified base to grow its revenues.I can only applaud Akamai for its impressive quarter. Revenues are growing across the board, and growth is of a high quality as it has been driven by all businesses and geographical regions. After years of sub-optimal earnings growth, margin expansion is finally materializing again, resulting in speculator short-term earnings growth.That being said, Thursday's 20% jump make shares a little bit expensive at 22 times 2013's estimated earnings, after backing out the net cash position of the firm. Although this advice comes a little too late, I would be a buyer on significant dips.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1375741,35521,2013-04-26T10:48:47-04:00,,"Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKAM) provides content delivery and cloud infrastructure services for the delivery of content and applications over the Internet. Many companies spend money on web acceleration and content delivery technologies, such as the services provided by market leader Akamai, to avoid lost sales and customers due to slow web pages. Despite the controversial guidance earlier from the management, Akamai delivers with solid numbers.Surprising Home RunAkamai reported Q1 revenue of $368M, 15% increase from the year-earlier quarter, beating analysts' estimate of $357.7M. The management forecasts revenue of $368M to $378M in Q2 compared with a $363M analyst estimate. Q1 profit, including an 8-cent tax benefit, rose to 51 cents a share from 36 cents a year earlier, topping the average estimate of 46 cents, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. AKAM also forecasts Q2 profit excluding some items of 44 cents to 46 cents, compared with a 44 cents estimate.New Solution Categories BreakdownMedia delivery revenue was $181M for Q1, up 17% over Q1, 2012 and 4% sequentially. Medial delivery is the main driver for Q1's revenue beat. Performance and security solutions generated revenue of $157M, up 17% over Q1, 2012 but declined 4% sequentially due to normal holiday seasonality. For service and support, the revenue was $27M, up 35% over Q1, 2012 and up 3% sequentially, due to strong traction in service attachment rates to core media, performance and security offerings.Expanding MarginsMargins had expanded consecutively for 4 quarters due to continued execution on managing cost of goods sold. Cash gross margin was 76%, up 1 point from the prior quarter and up 3 points from the same period last year. On the other hand, GAAP gross margin, which includes both depreciation and stock-based compensation, was 67% for Q1, up 4 points sequentially and up 6 points from Q1, 2012.Strong Cash Position and BuybackCash from operations for Q1 was $103M. AKAM had over $1B in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of Q1. CapEx was in line with the management's guidance range. $40M was spent on share repurchase to buy back 1.1M shares at an average price of just under $37 for Q1.Analysts' Calls and EstimatesOn April 25, 2013, Canaccord Genuity raised estimates and its price target on buy-rated AKAM to $46 (from $45), following strong Q1 and outlook. Canaccord Genuity analyst Greg Miller said,On the same day, FBR Capital reiterated the market perform rating for AKAM and increased its target price to $40 (from $36). J.P. Morgan also upgraded AKAM to overweight from neutral.Analysts, on average, are estimating an EPS of $1.89 with revenue of $1.51B for 2013, which is 9.90% higher than 2012. For 2014, analyst are projecting an EPS of $2.16 with revenue of $1.71B, which is 13.50% higher than 2013.Fundamentally, AKAM has higher operating margins and net margins compared with the industry average (industry of software application). AKAM also has a higher venue growth (3-year average) of 16.9 comparing to the average of 6.4. AKAM has a very healthy balance sheet with solid cash position and zero total debt. From the valuation perspective, AKAM remains undervalued with P/E of 37.88 as compared with the industry average of 49.50.Technically, the MACD (12, 26, 9) indicator is showing a bullish trend. The momentum indicator, RSI (14), is picking up and indicating a strong buying momentum at 78.32, where above 70 is considered as overbought. With 17.71% gain in the last trading day, AKAM is now trading above its 50-day MA of $5.80 and 200-day MA of $7.02, as seen from the chart below.Source: StockCharts.comHow to InvestBy expanding into cloud infrastructure, AKAM is targeting higher margins. The outlook for AKAM remains bright as it continues to execute and innovate, serving large clients, such as AT&T (NYSE:T) for its AURA network solutions, as well as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and News Corp (NASDAQ:NWS) for its content delivery platform. AKAM continues to be a solid investment target with its in-demand products/services, high margins, and solid balance sheet.Note: Investors and traders are recommended to do their own due diligence and research before making any trading/investing decisions.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in AKAM over the next 72 hours.

1382561,23479,2013-04-29T17:50:19-04:00,,"Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) reported a very strong set of Q1 2013 numbers on April  24, beating its own guidance on both revenues and margins. Revenues for  the quarter came in at $368 million, an 18% jump over the prior-year  quarter when adjusted for the recently completed divestment of ADS  (advertising decision solutions).While revenues grew strongly across verticals, the guidance beat came  mostly on strong traffic growth in the media division. Gross and EBITDA  margins were also better than expected. Gross margins improved  sequentially for the fourth consecutive quarter as the company drove  efficiency in the delivery of Internet content and value-added services  grew in strength, while EBITDA margins -- adjusted for one-time non-cash  items -- came in at 45%, a couple of percentage points better than the  high end of its guidance.The company also continued to generate strong cash flows. Cash  generation from operations rose to $103 million, about 28% of its  revenues for the quarter. As a result of the surprise earnings beat and  strong overall performance, Akamai's shares rose by almost 20% in  trading Thursday. With the long-term growth trends of cloud computing,  mobility and online video remain intact, we have revised our $41.50 price estimate for Akamai, almost in line with the current market price.Demand for Online Video Continues to GrowRevenue-wise, almost all of Akamai's verticals -- Media and  Entertainment, Commerce, High-Tech and Public sector -- grew strongly.  Most of Akamai's value (>70%), however, comes from the former two  verticals, both of which are driven by strong online traffic growth and  demand for online video. Internet traffic continues to surge, as social  media, software downloads and online gaming grow at a frenetic pace. An  increasing number of users are also accessing videos and other content  from mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. As a result, mobile  data traffic is growing exponentially by almost 70% every year and is  expected to grow thirteen-fold in the next five years, according to a new  Cisco VNI report. Akamai, which delivers 15%-30% of all web traffic,  stands to benefit hugely from this surge in online traffic.It is worthy of note here that halfway through the March quarter, Akamai had indicated that it would be winding down some media contracts that were not adding too much value. The wind-downs, however, had little  impact on results, which continued to remain solid aided by another  strong quarter of strong online traffic growth. Akamai said that the  traffic levels accelerated toward the end of the quarter, which should  have a positive impact on Q2 results as well.Growing Importance of Value-Added ServicesThe growth in online media streaming could have depressed margins due  to the higher costs of delivery for large video files and software, but  Akamai's recent investments in its network have led to greater  efficiency in content delivery. This helped gross margins improve by  more than four percentage points over the same period last year.What has also contributed to the gross margin improvement in recent  times has been the increased adoption of value-added services.  Value-added services (VAS) -- such as dynamic site acceleration (DSA),  application acceleration, front-end optimization (FEO), etc. -- have higher  margins than basic content delivery, which has been commoditized by the  entry of many players in the industry. It is therefore a welcome sign  that these services have grown in strength to account for almost 60% of  total revenues in 2012. As can be seen below, Akamai's margins recovered  in 2012 from the lows of the previous year, and we expect the recovery  to continue in the coming years as CDN prices stabilize and VAS supports  margins.In this regard, the acquisitions of Cotendo, Blaze, and other VAS  providers will serve to bolster gross margins going forward. These  acquisitions will not only reduce CDN pricing pressures, but also allow  Akamai to strengthen its value added portfolio and help it gain share  within the broader CDN market. Having a strong value-added service  portfolio to augment its core CDN business will enable it to grab more  wallet share of its customers as it upsells some of its other products.  This may boost its average revenue per customer as well (see also: ""Akamai's Cotendo Deal Would Add Margin Upside And Growth To Current $35 Value"").Disclosure: No positions."
1362951,24706,2013-04-23T15:13:14-04:00,,"By Todd McDonald, AnalystOverviewAkamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) is slated to report 1Q 2013 earnings after the close of trading on Wednesday, April 24. Results are typically available just after 4:01 p.m. EST. A conference call will follow at 4:30 p.m. EST. Akamai is a leading provider of enterprise cloud infrastructure services for storing and delivering content through the internet.Outliers & StrategyRecent NewsTechnical ReviewAkamai has been a substantial underperformer in 2013, declining about 16% YTD. If earnings results disappoint, look for major support near $33, an important, longer-term level that was just successfully held. If results surprise to the upside, look for initial resistance at the 200-day SMA near $37, followed by the beginning of February's gap near $41. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummaryAkamai has had a tough year thus far, thanks in part to a disappointing earnings release last quarter and a need for the company to significantly increase capital expenditures to remain competitive in the cloud computing industry. At current levels, it seems as though much of the bear-case is priced in. Therefore, even a marginally positive report should be enough to propel Akamai shares higher.Disclaimer: By using this report, you acknowledge that Selerity, Inc. is in no way liable for losses or gains arising out of commentary, analysis, and or data in this report.

Akamai offers application and cloud performance services, solutions for digital media and software distribution and storage, Website optimization services, network operator solutions, online advertising-related services and other specialized Internet-based offerings. While slow web pages lead to lost sales and lost customers, many companies spend money on web acceleration and content delivery technologies, especially those of market leader Akamai.Recent HighlightsQ4, 2012 earnings: On February 6, 2013, AKAM reported lower-than-expected Q4 revenue and guided to higher spending on higher sales staff. AKAM reported EPS of $0.54 per share, which was above analysts' estimate of $0.50 per share. The EPS was up 20% from $0.45 earned in the year-ago quarter and surged 25.6% sequentially, which was well above management's guided range of $0.48-$0.52 per share. The significant improvement in EPS was primarily driven by strong revenues and operating margin growth, as reported by Zacks. Q4 sales rose 17% to $378 million, below analysts' expectation of $381.3 million. However, revenue from CDN services to media and entertainment companies rose 15% to $158 million, as it was boosted by online video growth.Margins: According to Zacks' report, adjusted EBITA margin increased 20 bps year-over-year and 50 bps sequentially to 45.8%. Operating margin expanded 80 bps from the year-ago quarter and surged 210 bps sequentially to 25.3%. The strong growth was driven by higher gross margin base and lower-than-expected increase in operating expenses. Net income margin also increased 50 bps on a year-over-year basis and jumped significantly from 15.6% posted in the previous quarter to 19.8%. The margins are expected to improve as the company plans to phase out ""uneconomical"" contracts in Q1. Further, the company is expected to reduce depreciation expense going forward as Akamai continues to manage its server networks in an efficient way. However, there will be margin pressure in the near term as noted by Gray Powell, an analyst at Wells Fargo & Co. in New York.Outlook: AKAM forecasts the Q1 sales forecast of $0.50-$0.52 with revenue of $352M-$362M. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had previously forecast Akamai to earn $0.47 a share on $370.1 million in sales for the quarter. Akamai sold its advertising business in December, 2012, which could contribute to lower revenue forecast. The full earnings call transcript for AKAM's management discussion for Q4, 2012 results can be accessed here at Seeking Alpha.Strong demand: The strong demand for cloud infrastructure solutions, security, mobile products and online video will continue to drive top-line growth for AKAM. Akamai has been chosen by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and News Corp. (NASDAQ:NWS) due to its edge to provide high-quality service at a much lower rate. eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) has also selected AKAM to provide the web application services.Concerns/Analysts' CallsOn February 7, 2013, AKAM was downgraded by Jefferies from Buy to Hold with a price target of $40.00 (from $44.00) following Q4 results and outlook.

1156621,23469,2013-02-05T08:14:35-05:00,,"Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) has many secular winds at its back for growth, which include the migration to mobile devices and cloud computing. Yet, there are risks to the AKAM story. These risks along with a limit to catalysts for positive change in share price make the company's valuation seem lofty. The stock trades at approximately 22x forward earnings, well above the threshold of 15 we use to judge value and overvaluation. According to proprietary research done by The Oxen Group, AKAM is a HOLD with an implied value of roughly $34.00.This target is below current prices and given some of the outlined risks AKAM could fall; however AKAM is not a short. The fundamental drivers and secular trends that make AKAM a strong company should keep stocks fairly strong. The company is simply a more prudent investment at lower prices - a HOLDProfileA portion of AKAM's business involves online shopping. AKAM provides a network (or a platform) that allows for timely transactions and quick fulfillment. This real-time data expedites the shopping process given its efficient network. AKAM sells the online Internet retailing space for nearly all the top e-commerce websites. While on the topic of website data, AKAM also helps businesses track content and data real time for web users. AKAM is a stealth way to play the online shopping revolution…a massive secular trend. Another secular trend that AKAM directly benefits from is the mobile device wave.Work and play is exponentially gravitating more and more to mobile devices. This includes smart phones and tablets among others. AKAM helps enterprises reach their customers, partners, and employees on these devices in addition to regular personal computers. The need to properly manage this massive embracement from the public is playing into the hands of AKAM seamlessly. Streaming data and content is normally very cumbersome for networks and stressful for mobile devices, but AKAM is looking to relieve that problem with its superior technology.ValuationCloud companies tend to trade at a higher multiple than traditional tech. The recently released SKYY ETF (SKYY), which tracks the cloud computing industry, holds companies with on average a PE ratio at 33. AKAM trades at a discount to this average, but it lags some of the leaders in other important areas. Further, the entire sector as a whole has priced in significant future growth in a crowded space.Outside the SKYY ETF, AKAM's peer group makes the company look just about average, adding to the hold thesis. The median forward PE of SKYY holdings is 20.1x. AKAM is about 22x making it a tad rich. Under the net margins category, AKAM is just between the average and the median (16.9% and 12.4% respectively) at 14%. It is also interesting that AKAM's return on equity (ROE) is below the average range of the S&P 500 (10%-15%) at 9.3%. In the category of bottom line EPS performance, AKAM has had the tendency to beat Wall Street expectations. Over the last six observations (quarters), AKAM has posted positive EPS results over the street's expectations. The average beat is 6.6% over the same sample. Overall, valuation for the company does seem quite rich. Yet, with all growth stocks, we ask the question of whether this future growth can be sustained or does it come into question.CatalystWhat will keep AKAM moving forward? Thomson Leighton is a potential catalyst in either direction. He started 2013 as the new CEO and President of AKAM. Dr. Leighton is extremely qualified. Dr. Leighton was a co-founder of AKAM and has served as Akamai's Chief Scientist director since August 1998. Dr. Leighton has also been a professor of Mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology since 1982. New management always poses a threat to an established norm, good or bad. Shares are not a buy or sell off this news, but longs should keep an eye on their shares because a CEO change can create new opportunities as well as hurt future customers.Additionally, what we look at for AKAM is will the company continue to grow at strong rates or will it be limited. We worry it will be limited. The problem for AKAM is that while the pie is very big in the cloud area it is getting cut by too many. The company appears better than most in that it has found stability in the growth of mobile and online shopping, but at the same time, the technology creates no economic moat.Economic MoatLarge companies often acquire tomorrow's growth stories and value opportunities. These small firms that are purchased are intended to preserve and grow the core business. FastSoft, Blaze, and Cotendo were recently purchased by AKAM and looking into what these firms do can give investors a clue into what AKAM plans to do in the future. How does the company stack up against its competition though?AKAM's main competition is Rackspace (NYSE:RAX), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Digital River (NASDAQ:DRIV-OLD). All three companies work in the cloud services area with DRIV perhaps being one of the closest competitors with its online store application software. RAX and IBM provide significant cloud services, but in the end, what creates a moat for any of these companies. IBM has some moat due to its scale, long-standing business relationships, and solid hardware infrastructure. At the same time, in cloud technology, its all about execution. Looking at the four, one of the best ways to see moat is Return on Assets and margins. Let's compare the four. AKAM's operating margin is 22%, ROA is 8%, and ROE is 9%. IBM has an operating margin at 19%, ROA at 15%, and ROE at over 70%. Right away, we can see the moat that IBM has from its great execution. RAX has 13% OM, 9% ROA, and 15% ROE. Finally, DRIV has an OM at 4%, ROA at 1%, and ROE at 1%. AKAM is one of the market leaders in its space, but with such strong competition and the company showing no strength in key ROE/ROA metrics, we see little moat.FastSoft was purchased with a goal of complementing Akamai's cloud infrastructure solutions with technology for optimizing the throughput of video and other digital content across IP networks. AKAM's buy-out of Blaze achieved the goal of complementing Akamai's site acceleration solutions with technology designed to optimize the speed at which a web pages are rendered. Akamai acquired Cotendo to push the pace of innovation in the areas of cloud and mobile optimization. These are all clues into what AKAM wants to preserve in the technology sector from competition. One could argue that AKAM is now growing inorganically, or by acquisition, but as long as AKAM puts up impressive returns on assets (in the neighborhood of 60%) AKAM will be in great shape. The M&A team has historically done a good job performance wise, this increases AKAM's barriers to entry and protects its precious gross margins.While these acquisitions do give the company some economic moat, they do not create any type of technology or long-standing relationship that gives the company enough competitive advantage. The one moat the company does have is high switching costs for any company that has developed a mobile system with AKAM. Acquisitions create better scale in many cases, but if ROA suffers as a result, we will know that they did not create a moat. Rather, they were acquisitions to keep pace. That is similar to what Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) did over the past ten years.Revenue and EPS OutlookAKAM specifically outlines in its SEC documents that it relies on the rate of traffic growth in its video and software download solutions for revenue growth. Additionally, AKAM has historically experienced seasonal variations of higher revenues in the fourth quarter of the year and lower revenues during the summer months. This is mainly a function of e-commerce services by retail customers…revenue trends are also important to identify.In our scenario, a conservative look implies slowing operating income growth going out to 2015; 14% average growth with 2015 slowing to just under 9%. Growth naturally slows in the product cycle…especially in the technology sector. Should AKAM expand out to other more attractive areas of business, estimates would have to be adjusted. The $7B company says even in its SEC documents that it only operates in one segment…away from the sector's norm.Price Target AnalysisThe following price target was configured through a 5-year projected discounted cash flow analysis. The model projects operating income, taxes, depreciation, capital expenditures, and changes in working capital. Using that information, we can project what the company is worth. We can then use that projection and compare it to current pricesHere is how to calculate price targets using discounted cash flow analysis:(all figures in millions)Step 1.Project operating income, taxes, depreciation, capex, and working capital for five years. Calculate cash flow available by taking operating income - taxes + depreciation - capital expenditures - working capital.Step 2.Calculate present value of available cash flow (PV factor of WACC * available cash flow). You can calculate WACC, but we have given this number to you. The PV factor of WACC is calculated by taking 1 / [(1 + WACC)^# of FY years away from current]. For example, 2016 would be 1 / [(1 + WACC)^4 (2016-2012).WACC for AKAM: 8.08%* For 2016, we are going to calculate a residual calculation, as we believe that the market tends to value companies with around a five-year projection of where business will be. This is the common projection for discounted cash flow analyses.Step 3.For the fifth year, we calculate a residual calculation. This number is calculated by taking the fifth year available cash flow and dividing by the cap rate, which is calculated by taking WACC and subtracting out residual growth rate. Residual growth rate is typically between 2-6%. 4% is average growth for industry. Companies with high levels of growth have higher residual growth, while companies with lower growth levels have lower residual growth. This is why higher growth companies tend to have higher PE ratios. We will give you cap rate.Cap Rate for AKAM: 3.58%Step 4.Calculate Equity Value - add PV of residual value, available cash flow PVs, current cash, and subtract debt:We have added in current cash/cash equivalents as of the latest fiscal quarter along with debt levels.Step 5.Divide equity value by shares outstanding:In the end, we have found that AKAM is worth around $34, which we believe accurately reflects the company's five-year projections.The VariantAKAM stated in its latest annual report that it believes the cost of revenues will continue to increase. It also expects to deploy more servers and to deliver more traffic on its networks, which could result in higher expenses associated with the increased traffic and co-location fees. Such costs are likely to be partially offset by lower bandwidth costs per unit and recent reports indicate that AKAM has cut costs in other places. Continued efforts like this could increase net income and EPS, leading to the stock moving upward without a pullback. The flip-side to this is a prolonged sell-off. AKAM recently made a low of $20.00 in late 2011; such a decline would scare most away.Bottom LineAKAM has many things going for it, but without very strong continued growth and an increased moat, the stock is not exciting at these multiples. Major items of interest include gross margins and secular trends. Cloud and tech stocks are very risky and given the historic volatility of shares, accumulating AKAM on a pullback is a better idea than buying near highs given the fundamental picture.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The Oxen Group is a team of analysts.

1267181,24757,2013-03-12T15:05:31-04:00,,"Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) was one of the survivors of the original Internet bubble, and for  years was characterized by the volatility of its stock price.  Specializing in Internet content acceleration, over the years it became  the IBM (NYSE:IBM) of this field. Money was being made, and so there was intense  competition, and shorts sometimes heralded the fall of Akamai. AKAM  always stayed a footstep or two in front of its competition. More  importantly, it branched out.Content acceleration has always been important to AKAM, but for years it  has been adding other services to its repertoire. Content acceleration  is a volume-driven, price-sensitive business, with a record of constant  declining year-over-year prices, much like mass-market semiconductors. Akamai's new  services -- notably Internet security -- are also competitive, but have  offered much better profit margins that should hold up at least in the  near term.So why is AKAM priced today around $34.71, well off its 52-week high of  $42.52 on Jan. 1 and well above its 52-week low of $24.90 on June 5,  2012? In the past, AKAM was a playground for momentum players; it was a  relatively small company, and you might see P/E ratios swing wildly  between, say, 20 and 60. Lately the stock is behaving more like IBM, more  stable, with a much smaller but still impressive market cap of $6.2  billion.  At the price quoted above the P/E is 31.1 trailing, which is  higher than most tech stocks at the moment. But that's easily justified by a  history of growth and the outlook for 2013.For the latest reported quarter, Q4 2012 ending Dec. 31, revenue was  $377.9 million, up 9% sequentially from $345.3 million and up 17% from  $323.7 million in the year-earlier quarter. GAAP net income was $68.3  million, up 42% sequentially from $48.2 million and up 14% from $60.1  million a year earlier.Akamai just re-issued guidance for Q1, which this late in the quarter  should be pretty reliable. Revenue is expected between $352 and $362  million. On a sequential basis that may seem disappointing, but keep in  mind that Akamai gets a yearly Q4 bump from the increase in e-commerce  in the quarter. Compared to year-earlier revenue of $319.4 million, we  get an annual growth rate of 10% at the low end and 13% at the high end.The dynamics of the business appear to be favoring Akamai. Cloud  infrastructure revenue, rather than content acceleration, was 60% of  total revenue in Q4. The security component of that was up 5x from the  previous year. A major rival, AT&T (NYSE:T), has thrown in the towel and is  becoming a reseller of Akamai services, which should add substantially  to revenue in the second half.Even the underlying trend for the content acceleration business shows no  sign of ebbing. Akamai was  founded in 1998. It is just 15 years old. People in that age bracket are in an always-connected culture dominated  by video and cloud services that often require data packets to be sent  from a vast assortment of geographically diverse server farms. The  amount of data being served will continue to increase, and Akamai  essentially runs a private toll road system within the Internet for  those who want the fast service that is essential to capturing customers  and converting views to sales.I like Akamai at this price. I expect it will blow through its current  52-week high  some time this year, as revenue and profits from the  relatively new cloud security business and other new value-added cloud  services ramp.Disclaimer: I am long AKAM. I will not trade the stock for one week following the publication of this article."
1163511,42041,2013-02-07T07:56:35-05:00,,"Shares of Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) will be in the spotlight today after the Internet content delivery company forecasted current quarter revenue below analysts' expectations as the company plans to wind down some media contracts. Revenue was lighter than expectations and growth decelerated quite a bit in the fourth quarter.The company reported fourth-quarter sales of $378 million that were below $381 million predicted by analysts on average. Also for the first quarter, the company forecasted revenue of between $352 to $362 million, well short of the $371 million estimate.The company's shares fell more than 15% in after-hours trading.The results marked the first quarterly earnings report for Tom Leighton, a company co-founder who took the CEO job in January.Akamai, whose competitors include Level 3 Communications (NASDAQ:LVLT) and Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW), helps companies, government agencies and other enterprises increase revenue and reduce costs by improving the performance, reliability and security of their internet-facing operations. The company's servers across the world carry content for clients ranging from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). Akamai media clients include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Sony BMG, News Corp (NASDAQ:NWS), Nintendo (OTCPK:NTDOY) and NBC.Fourth quarter revenue missed expectations as the holiday selling season was down from the 2011 level. The results also showed signs of softening demand for Akamai's services, which help customers speed up their online offerings. Online activity also showed significant weakness from 2011.Revenues for the first quarter will be even lower because of the deceleration in the media business and the higher expense growth related to the investment in sales force and research & development. Going forward, the company sees foreign exchange headwinds and tougher year-over-year comparisons, given it had the acquisition of Cotendo in 2012.CFO Jim Benson had his own excuse for the disappointing revenue forecast:Source: Earnings Call Transcript @ Seeking AlphaThough the company said it expects AT&T to become a very significant channel partner going into 2014, CFO during the call made it very clear that first half of the year will be nothing but an investment phase.AT&T (NYSE:T) agreed to partner with Akamai on content delivery network (CDN) services in December, and transfer its existing CDN operations, customers and services to Akamai's platform. Our friend here at SeekingAlpha gave an excellent review of the deal, and why Akamai might have paid too much.Akamai also said it has expanded its share repurchase authorization to an additional $150 million over the next 12 months, mostly to offset dilution from equity compensation programs. The company purchased 4.4 million of its shares last year, for ~$140 million, and had 178 million shares outstanding at year's end. In Q4, the company bought back 800,000 shares for $30 million.I believe investors should now re-evaluate their stance on the company after this dismal revenue forecast. Net income can be manipulated and sometimes get significantly affected by the non-cash charges and share buyback tactics, but a sluggish revenue growth projection by Akamai is certainly an ominous sign of the troublesome times ahead.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1056451,20875,2012-12-11T04:03:27-05:00,,"The media is spending a lot of time regurgitating the Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) and AT&T (NYSE:T) press release, but from what I've seen, none are digging under the surface to see what's really going on. Some like the WSJ even said that as a result of the new deal, AT&T and Akamai will now ""end competition"" amongst each other, which is laughable. Anyone who follows the CDN space, which clearly the WSJ doesn't, knows that AT&T was never competing with Akamai or anyone else for that matter, when it came to its failed CDN business. The simple fact that the WSJ and other sites don't even mention what AT&T or Akamai's CDN revenues are shows they really don't get the market. Others have made comments like, ""the deal eliminates AT&T as a rival,"" which is also not true. Based on numbers Akamai has given out in the past, and the AT&T numbers I know of, AT&T is doing around 1% of Akamai's CDN revenue. How is that a ""rival""?Reuters said that the AT&T deal, ""follows Akamai's similar agreement with France Telecom's Orange last month,"" which is not accurate. Akamai's deal with AT&T is not a licensed CDN deal. It's a straight reseller deal. Akamai's announcement with Orange is for a licensed CDN deal where Orange licenses Akamai's software to run on the Orange network. AT&T is not deploying any software from Akamai on their network, so the two deals are not at all alike, something that Akamai confirmed with me on a call with them Monday morning.I've also seen a couple of telco bloggers say this deal isn't good for EdgeCast, which isn't the case at all. While none would go on the record for this piece regarding numbers, I talk often with executives at all three companies and one critical fact that's missing from every story so far is that Akamai committed $100M to AT&T to secure a resale deal. That might seem smart on the surface but if you know the space well, you know that it's just not a scalable strategy. It doesn't surprise me that this deal would be applauded by shareholders but most don't have any insight into AT&T's CDN business and to date, I have never seen a single report that even says what AT&T's CDN revenue is, aside from the number they used from my blog, which was $10M last year and less than $20M this year.While EdgeCast is nowhere near the size of Akamai, I expect they will do about $75M in 2012. EdgeCast is years ahead of Akamai in the carrier space and have vastly more white-label resellers overall. By my last count I think it is more than 60, including telcos like DT, and large web hosts such as Softlayer. EdgeCast earned millions from AT&T in licensing fees (my sources estimate the amount at $25-50 million) and they will continue to do so for some time. Meanwhile, Akamai is spending $100M partly to try to stop their momentum and also get access to AT&T's network. Sure, that's a much cheaper way to buy into the telco space than acquiring EdgeCast would be, but it's a staggering price to pay to pick up a reseller. Committing eight and nine figure sums to resellers is simply not a repeatable model, especially since EdgeCast already has deep relationships with many of the largest resellers.Yet many are suggesting that what Akamai is doing with AT&T is a blueprint for what they will do with other carriers when it's not. Akamai only has a few hundred million in cash, so they definitely can't afford to buy their way into all these resellers and operators, especially for a service like CDN, which has low margins. And most telcos and carriers have been actively building out their own CDNs, or using licensed and managed CDN products, which is a business Akamai has only just entered, years behind others. Most telcos, carriers and MSO don't want to simply resell services, but rather have more control over them since they own the network.Some have suggested to me that once Akamai's LCDN product is out of beta, AT&T could buy out their EdgeCast contract and replace EdgeCast's LCDN solution with Akamai's, but that's not likely. I've also heard some say that Akamai bought Verivue to try to get an LCDN product to market faster so they could try and get it into AT&T and push out EdgeCast, but that's not happening. Remember that Juniper (NYSE:JNPR) spent $100M buying Ankeena just to please AT&T and then AT&T didn't end up going with them. Akamai's deal with AT&T is not around LCDN and won't be any time soon.So, what will be left when the dust settles? There will be AT&T's wholesale CDN platform, with hundreds of servers running EdgeCast software and delivering paid customer traffic for massive brands that AT&T services today on their CDN. None of these big brand customers that I speak with are interested in having their production traffic moved off a stable platform and onto a new one. So AT&T is at risk of churning the CDN business they do have if they try to force their customers onto a third-party platform they don't operate.As for the growing federated traffic being sent to AT&T by EdgeCast and Pacnet, clearly that cannot migrate to Akamai's platform under the newly announced deal since this is not a licensed CDN (LCDN) agreement with AT&T and right now, Akamai has no LCDN product outside of what's currently in beta. So AT&T can either keep their wholesale platform up, or go back on their commitments to the global carrier community (via OCX, etc.) to promote CDN Federation.There will also be the interesting drama of AT&T trying to figure out how to resell Akamai services to AT&T enterprise customers, a large number of which are already Akamai customers. One final fact is that the CDN that AT&T launched (at the cost of well over $100M) before they signed with EdgeCast is still running. Now they are going to add an Akamai CDN to this mix, which means running three separate CDNs until they shut down their own and migrate over to Akamai. That's a lot to ask for a company that has never shown any expertise with their CDN business or strategy.As I wrote last year, the way AT&T could get serious about CDN would be to acquire a CDN operator, but they don't seem interested in doing this. One could suggest they don't want to acquire low-margin CDN products, but they also had the right of first refusal to acquire Cotendo, who had high-margin value add services, and they passed on that before Akamai acquired them, even though AT&T told me that Cotendo's services were very important to the company with, ""40-60% of all new customers in their sales pipeline"" needing such a solution. So AT&T is not really serious about this business if all they want to do is resell it. Some would suggest the opposite by saying that AT&T can now rely on Akamai to help them do it right, but if AT&T could not sell a simple CDN service that they owned, how are they going to resell CDN services they no longer control? It's asking a lot from AT&T.I've also seen some that suggest the CDN business with AT&T isn't really important as it's all the ""value added services"" that AT&T will resell that will bring Akamai revenue. While that's a nice idea, it's not the majority of what AT&T will be reselling. Akamai confirmed with me Monday that AT&T will sell CDN including their media services, software downloads, small object delivery and DSA. But that's a far cry from the complex, customized, high-margin services Akamai offers that require a lot of professional services. That's not something AT&T will be able to sell at scale.The real benefit to Akamai is not what AT&T might be able to resell, it's the fact that Akamai now gets to place their servers inside AT&T at the regional level. Akamai confirmed for me that before this deal, they didn't have any of their servers directly within AT&T's network and had to peer with them instead. So from a QoS and capacity standpoint, this deal is good news for Akamai and AT&T customers, but Akamai isn't saying how much additional capacity it gives them or the difference in QoS. But at the cost of $100M, Akamai paid a lot of money to get inside AT&T's network, with the hope that AT&T can also bring them a lot of reseller revenue.Another thing to watch from this deal is Akamai's costs. While Akamai talks a lot about how many servers they have and how they are at the ""edge,"" which is a vague term, the deal with AT&T shows that Akamai never actually had servers within AT&T's network. Now they are spending a lot of money to get that access and this might open them up to other telcos who now see that Akamai is willing to write big checks to get inside telco networks. It will be interesting to see if other telcos now ask Akamai for a large sum to have access inside their network as well. If that happens, and Akamai needs to have more than just peering access, then this could get expensive for Akamai in the long term. While I don't know if this will happen, it's reasonable to think it could, considering Akamai's deal with AT&T is public for all the other telcos to see.AT&T has simply never been able to get their CDN act together and now they are going to try another approach, by reselling Akamai, and change their strategy once again. Time will tell, but in two years we could be looking back on this recent agreement between Akamai and AT&T and realize that Akamai picked up the tab for the most expensive deployment inside a carrier in history.Disclosure: None"

Its acquisition  of Verivue, a video-switching and delivery platform provider, signals a  new path for continued growth in the segment.Even though Akamai has been developing a licensed software solution  for the service-provider market, the acquisition of Verivue's technology  (and engineering staff) helps get Akamai further along by virtue of  having already been deployed in the field with companies like Cox  Communications in the U.S. and some smaller ISPs in the Asia-Pacific  region.Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Six-year-old Verivue has 60  employees and raised quite a bit of venture capital. Five venture firms  and three strategic investors together funneled $85 million into Verivue.  Investors include Accel Partners, Matrix Partners, and Comcast, among  others.The acquisition comes barely three weeks after Akamai reported its  best quarterly results ever, with its top line increasing 23%  year over year to reach $345 million. Revenue from the media and entertainment  segment grew fastest at 26%, driven in part by the Olympic games, when  broadcasters used Akamai’s HD network to deliver high-quality video at  scale."

1247421,20875,2013-03-05T11:04:07-05:00,,"Nine months ago, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) launched their new dynamic content delivery service in beta and two weeks ago, I posted details on how their product is coming along and outlined new features they have added since launch. Every since Amazon announced their new service, people keep asking me if Amazon will disrupt Akamai's DSA business and drive pricing down in the market as a whole. While Amazon still has a long way to go before that has the possibility of happening, make no mistake, they are gunning for Akamai, even though they won't call out Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) by name.Today, Akamai is still the undisputed king of the dynamic site acceleration industry and to date, no one has even come close to taking a large percentage of their web optimization business or knocked them from the top spot. But over the past four or five years, market dynamics have changed. Companies no longer have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to enter this market, services are getting cheaper to deploy and scale and the old rules of how to build out web acceleration services has drastically changed. Cotendo proved this better than anyone else. In under three years, Cotendo was able to disrupt Akamai's dynamic site acceleration margins so much, Akamai was forced to acquired them, even though Cotendo wasn't doing that much in revenue and had only raised about $40M in funding.While Cotendo drove pricing down in the market and pressured Akamai, the one thing Cotendo didn't do was generate a lot of revenue. Services can only scale and grow so much when you have $40M in funding, but it was still enough to impact the market as a whole and get Akamai's attention. Cotendo's service didn't have the scale or functionality of Akamai's service, yet it was still able to be a disruptor. In Amazon case, they have the opportunity to not only impact Akamai's margins for their services, but also generate a lot of revenue on top of it. Amazon has more resources than Cotendo, more money, more R&D, more marketing reach, a well known brand and a built-in customer base that is projected by Analysts to do at least $2B in revenue this year from their web services division, AWS.That's not to say Amazon is ready to disrupt Akamai tomorrow, they won't. But don't be fooled by Amazon's approach, which may appear slow to some. Amazon has a very methodical way of rolling out products and services to the market and it typically takes them about 18-24 months before a product goes from beta to a full-fledged offering with a lot of the features and functionality of their competitors. Look at their CDN product, CloudFront, which went from a bare-bones beta product to one that could compete, by my estimate, for 75% of the commodity CDN market, in 18 months. CloudFront is estimated to have generated more than $100M in revenue last year and Amazon continues to build out additional services to support their CDN, announcing their video transcoding service last month.From purely a features standpoint, Akamai's dynamic content delivery service still trumps Amazon's, by a wide margin. But that's not going to last for too long and little by little, Amazon is already starting to close the gap. Amazon's working on rolling out a lot more functionality and while they will never be able to compete for 100% of Akamai's DSA business, they will continue to get stronger and go after more of the business that doesn't require a ton of professional services. Amazon will never compete for 100% of the market, but they don't need to. All they have to do is continue to roll out features, add an SLA, lower pricing and prove their dynamic content acceleration services performs well and can scale, with reliability. Of course building all of that out to scale doesn't happen overnight, but it's not as hard as some vendors make it out to be and Amazon has the resources to make it happen and more importantly, has multiple lines of businesses to generate revenue from. Amazon can be patient and grow the business over time.I don't expect Amazon to disrupt the market in the next one or two quarters, but come Q4 of this year and into Q1 of 2014, I expect we'll see signs that Amazon is starting to have a major impact on the dynamic content acceleration market and Akamai in particular. This is an interesting time for Akamai right now. For the first time in Akamai's history, that I can remember, they have a growing competitor they can't acquire. Akamai's competitive strategy has always been to simply acquire anyone who impacts their business and remove them from the market, but they can't do that with Amazon. And unlike two years ago when Cotendo was really the only competitor to Akamai for dynamic content acceleration services, Akamai now faces competition from more than just Amazon. Small startups like Yottaa want to be the next thorn in Akamai's side and more established players like EdgeCast and Level 3 are making moves to get into the market, or expand their focus.The good news from all of this is that customers will have more options in the market for dynamic content acceleration services, at different price points, in different regions of the world, for small and large deployments. As a result, these services will become mainstream, demand will increase and prices will decline. Customers will become educated as to the business benefits and learn there is more than one way to deliver content on the web with scale and performance. For Akamai, this will cause a negative impact on their margins if Amazon can disrupt their business the way Cotendo did, but on a larger scale.Keep in mind though that as dynamic site acceleration pricing declines in the market, it won't be at the rate video content delivery pricing declined. Unlike delivering video on the web, performance measured in fractions of a second does matter when it comes to delivering dynamic content. For video, customers aren't willing to pay a premium to have their video start-up half a second faster on one CDN over another. Half a second does not impact a video based business. But half a second of performance difference in the dynamic site acceleration market can mean the loss of revenue for a customer. So the good news it that customers will be willing to pay for different levels of DSA performance, which will help to keep prices from falling as quickly as they did for video.Amazon does not charge any premium for dynamic content delivery, something Akamai has done for a long time. Amazon customers who have been previously reluctant to adopt dynamic content acceleration services due to the cost, will now be able to simply buy it as an add-on, without worrying about any type of premium pricing. It's hard to compare Akamai and Amazon's pricing side-by-side for dynamic content services, because there is still a wide gap in performance, and they both charge a bit differently, but it's a safe bet to say that Amazon's price is anywhere between 50-75% cheaper than Akamai's. That's a really big difference and will continue to be more of an apples-to-apples comparison, once Amazon's dynamic content delivery service becomes closer to Akamai's in functionality.The bottom line is that Amazon still has to prove themselves in the market. They are still the new kid on the block and Akamai has first mover status and a proven business, but Amazon has a lot more advantages in the long run. Akamai may be at the top right now, but Amazon's following their tried and true method of methodically rolling out more products and services. To think they won't be able to disrupt the market, at some point in the near future, which would impact Akamai, would be foolish. It will happen, the question is how quickly and to what degree.Disclosure: None"
828291,24757,2012-08-26T02:32:15-04:00,,"Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) has made and lost investors and speculators vast sums of money over the years, going back to the original Internet bubble of the late 1990s. Friday, the stock closed at $37.10, giving it a market capitalization near $6.58 billion. It had a trailing Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio just over 35 (per NASDAQ), considerably higher than most technology stocks currently. That indicates either that investors expect substantial profit growth in the future, or that speculators have bought into momentum and are ready to get out quickly if the momentum turns. Or both.Akamai's core technology accelerates the delivery of Web pages and media. This is critical to e-commerce sites, where people may go elsewhere or fail to make a purchase if a page downloads slowly. It is also crucial to video and audio playing without stuttering. Building on that, Akamai offers its enterprise partners other key Internet cloud technologies, notably security.Look at the quarter results and analyst conference of July 25 and you will see that Revenue was $331.3 million, up 4% sequentially from $319.4 million and up 20% from $277.0 million year-earlier. But GAAP net income was $44.2 million, down 8% from $47.9 million year-earlier. GAAP EPS (earnings per share) were $0.24, were down 4% from $0.25 year-earlier.So GAAP profits did not climb y/y the way you would expect a company with a P/E of 35. Akamai reported non-GAAP ""normalized net income"" of $78 million or $0.43 per share, up 3% sequentially and 23% y/y. EBITDA was $143 million, flat sequentially and up 13% from year-earlier. Cash flow from operations was $150 million. $67 million was spent in the quarter to repurchase stock. Capital expenditures were $56 million.Clearly Akamai bulls are looking at revenue growth and cash flow growth, rather than GAAP numbers. Akamai has a rather high non-cash stock-based compensation expense, $25.6 million in the quarter, and depreciation and amortization, $50.1 million in the quarter. That accounts for most of the difference between the grim GAAP profit lack of growth and the outstanding non-GAAP growth rates.Revenues and profits depend primarily on the dynamics between Internet data growth and drops in pricing. According the Akamai, pricing drops are not primarily due to competition, although Akamai has competitors who are forced to compete on price. Rather Akamai drops prices on a regular basis to encourage data growth. In the long run this helps its customers and yet grows Akamai profits. There is no sign that the amount of data sent over the Internet will stall anytime soon as the use of mobile devices and video expand. There is also an ongoing expansion of the customer base to lower-income users around the world.Guidance for Q3 is for increased income and a slight contraction in non-GAAP EPS. Internet traffic is seasonal, with lows during summers, but a lot of people used the Internet to watch the Olympics. The better guide to Akamai performance is growth over periods of a year or longer.For most investors AKAM has probably reached the point where the high P/E is getting hard to justify, given the other choices in the market. I originally bought AKAM during a slump when it was clearly undervalued, and because of its volatility I have traded in and out more than I like (I am a buy and hold guy). Given Internet trends, and Akamai's move into security and other cloud services, I think over the longer run Akamai will become considerably more profitable, but there is some P/E height at which I would dump the stock. Then again, if the P/E dropped below 25, I would be a buyer again.Since I've made a deal out of P/E ratios as buy and sell signals, I should note that you can get different P/Es by looking at GAAP vs. non-GAAP and different time spans. As a check, note the non-GAAP EPS for Q2 was $0.43. A year's EPS at that rate would be $1.72. Divide into $37.10 and you get a P/E of 21.6. Which is a much safer sounding number than NASDAQ's trailing P/E calculation of 35. On the other hand the GAAP current P/E would be $37.10 / 4 x $0.24, or 38.6, which sounds much more pricey. You might want to think deeply about Akamai's reasons for reporting non-GAAP numbers before you trade this stock.Disclaimer: I am long AKAM and won't trade in it for 5 days after this article is originally published."
879421,24805,2012-09-20T15:46:21-04:00,,"Since 25th July 2012, the stock price of Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKAM) has risen by 30.55%. If you are curious about what the reason might be, here's a hint: second quarter results FY2012 released on 25th of July!Revenue for the 2nd quarter of 2012 was $331 million, a 20% increase over 2nd quarter 2011 revenue of $277 million. Revenue growth is the signal of company expansion, which in turn leads to the maximization of shareholder's equity.GAAP net income for the 2nd quarter of 2012 was $44 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, an 8% decrease from second quarter 2011 GAAP net income of $48 million, or $0.25 per diluted share, and a 2% increase from first quarter 2012 GAAP net income of $43 million, or $0.24 per diluted share.The net income graph seems to be on an upward move as of yet, which can again be considered a positive signal.Perhaps, these are the reasons why the stock price of the company improved over 30% in the last 3 months, while Dow Jones Industrial Index fared with an increase of approximately 10%. Wait! Does 30% in the last 3 months seem high to you? How about 74.8% in the last one year? Check the image below:But the question is whether such a price rise is warranted or not? Do the 2nd quarter financial results really inspire us that much? I don't think so. Although the company shows potential for future growth, let's look at the less obvious yet worth considering factors.A dig deeper into the company financialsThe very first thing that caught my attention was the diminished operating income. Operating income in the 2nd quarter of 2012 fell to $67 million, compared to $71.6 million in the 1st quarter of 2012 and $73.23 million in the 2nd quarter of 2011. Should we be wary of the tanking operating income? Perhaps, no, and the reason is as follows.While the operating margin of Akamai Technologies still runs at 20.23%, two of its main competitors in the market, Microsoft and Digital River aren't doing that much better either. The last quarterly operating margin of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Digital River (NASDAQ:DRIV-OLD) are 1.06% and 1.09% respectively. In fact, two other companies, Brightcove Inc. and Limelight Networks are already running in the negative. Now, you have tanking operating margin on one end and ""comparatively"" higher operating results on the other. Akamai Technologies seem to be walking the thin line here.The sales and marketing costs have shot up to $75.88 million in the 2nd quarter of 2012, compared $67.3 million in the 1st quarter of 2012 and $52.84 million in the 2nd quarter of 2011. Perhaps, this is what works in the tech sector - brand popularity, which leads to new lead generation and customer loyalty. Market presence is what makes you stand out among the smaller players. With hundreds of new tech startups cropping up every day, somewhere in the whole wide world, you got to stay ahead with increasing marketing and acquisition costs. Gobble up the smaller fish and flaunt your size to the world - that's the motto!Following that motto, Akamai Technologies spent around $291 million in the 1st quarter of 2012. It acquired Cotendo Inc. in March 2012 to strengthen its presence in the content delivery market. Cotendo specializes in software and services that improve the delivery of content across the Web and on mobile-device networks.And this September, Akamai acquired FastSoft Inc. for an undisclosed cash amount. Needless to say, this will be reported in the 3rd quarter of 2012. The acquisition is expected to complement Akamai's cloud infrastructure solutions with technology for optimizing the throughput of video - and other digital content - across IP networks.Acquisitions lead to accumulated intangible assets and goodwill. Is this a good thing?Well, goodwill represents the amount that you pay as a premium over the book value of a company. Though goodwill falls under intangible assets, it is categorized as an unidentifiable asset, which makes it even harder to assess its value. In the balance sheet, the intangible assets including goodwill value increased to $793.7 million in the 2nd quarter of 2012 as opposed to $498.3 million six months back. I can only guess that the Cotendo acquisition might have led to the sudden rise in the intangible assets in this quarter. Did the acquisition warrant such high premium? Doubtful indeed!Okay, enough talk about the fundamentals of the company.Is the company overpriced?To start with, if we look at the price-to-book ratio of Akamai, standing at 3.21, in comparison to 2.83 for Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), 3.94 for Microsoft and 4.67 for Equinix Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX), we can say it is very much in line with the rest of the industry.But this metric is pretty vague to be honest. Sometimes, book value only signifies the tangible assets, but as is the case with the tech companies, the intangible assets make for the majority of the amount. So, leaving them out of the equation might not be a good option.As my Alpha friend, William Meyers, quoted in his article:Even the analysts' estimates show weaker growth expectations in the coming one or two years. The company is expected to grow at a rate of 11.50% next year, compared to the projected industry average of 24.8%. With the growth projection expected to go flatter in the coming few years, the stock price will probably tank down fast from where it has surged today in sudden excitement.To support my statement, let's look at the graph below (duration: last six months):If you look at the chart above, the RSI signal of over 60 shows that the stock is clearly overpriced at the moment. Even if the trading price has not reached its peak yet, weakening growth expectations make it hard to go nowhere but downward.Additionally, the presence of 'dojis' (a candlestick terminology) in the recent trading sessions clearly signifies lack of decision among the investors, which might be the first sign of an upcoming downward slide.Yet it must be noted that the Bollinger bands do tell a whole different story. The stock price graph continues to break the upper resistance again and again, and doesn't even touch the middle band in the recent times.And when we look at the MACD graphs, the downward slide of the MACD line, along with the regular bearish crossing over the signal line does indicate that a downward trend might be starting very soon.Alpha ConclusionEven if the price seems to be going down in the coming few weeks, I am supremely confident that Akamai, with its latest tech acquisitions and streamlining of the business model, will turn out to be a profitable survivor.And I might be there to catch the next uptrend.

1041041,28511,2012-12-03T09:45:55-05:00,,"Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) has decided to acquire Verivue for an undisclosed amount as it expands its cloud computing infrastructure solutions operations. Verivue is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) solutions provider with a strong client portfolio which includes Nokia Siemens and Ericsson. Akamai has been expanding its CDN operations through earlier acquisitions of Cotendo for $268 million in 2011 and FastSoft about earlier this fall. It competes directly in this sector with Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) and Level 3 Communications (NASDAQ:LVLT). Akamai's Cloud Infrastructure Solutions segment contributed 58% to its total Q3 total revenues of $345.3 million. Both content delivery and cloud infrastructure solutions increased by 22% and 23% Y0Y.Akamai has been facing intense competition in CDN services market which has put a downward pressure on prices. Although its quarterly operating income went up by 22.5% to $85.4 million operating margins have remained flat at 24.7%, implying a linear growth path. In our last look at Akamai, we noted the worry about margin erosion as competition in the CDN space was driving prices down. For Q3 Akamai saw net margins increase slightly over Q1 and Q2 , but they are still down drastically over previous years. Q4 will give us a better idea of whether this is the beginning of a trend or an anomaly.Meanwhile, like Akamai, Limelight also beat analysts' estimates by reporting a 6.3% increase in revenues to $45 million versus the expected $44.4 million but was hit hard by price competition. It failed to breakeven by reporting a net loss of $828 thousand, down from a profit of $5 million in the year-ago quarter. But, given Limelight's performance this past year it points to a turnaround, after booking more significant losses in the previous 3 quarters. The company however has taken the right step by focusing more on value-added-services operations that offers higher margin than CDN.Similarly, Level 3 has been able to reduce its losses by 24% YoY to $166 million as revenues grew by 71% to $1.59 billion. Recently, Serco Group plc chose Level 3 for providing network services.Cloud services market is exploding, ready to touch $177 billion in revenues in the next three years while total expenditure on public cloud services alone will touch $100 billion in the next four years. Moreover, this increase in demand is coming from all over the world. Akamai's North American revenues were up 23% but the international revenues have seen an even bigger rise, 30%. CEO Jeff Lunsford will be leaving his post from Jan-2013 while his company expects to earn up to $46.5 million revenues in Q4. But the move to the cloud has arrested their losses.The global economic slowdown has forced many organizations to shift towards cost effective internet channels. The demand for cloud infrastructure, CDN solutions, online videos and mobile is rising but so is the competition. Network giants Verizon (NYSE:VZ) and AT&T (NYSE:T) are now also working on their own CDN networks. Interestingly, both Verizon and AT&T have been operating in the CDN market for more than a couple of years now and so far, they haven't been a serious threat to Akamai or even Limelight and Level 3. A survey carried out earlier this year at a network summit suggested that out of 408 firms spending more than $100,000 on video delivery, none were using wither Verizon or AT&T while out of 306 firms spending less than $100,000 a year, just 13 were with either Verizon or AT&T.As evident from the table above, much bigger Akamai has clearly outperformed both Limelight and Level 3. The Cotendo acquisition and others have begun to impact Akamai's bottom line. We like these acquisitions as accretive and see the company as well-placed to continue delivering superior performance as the world transitions to the cloud.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

795851,24276,2012-08-09T17:19:16-04:00,,"Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) is out with another one of its regular reports on Internet speeds and it makes fascinating reading.First, because it's so positive. Broadband speeds are rising everywhere. The Internet market keeps growing upward and outward.Second, because of where it's best. Nations that want to be high tech hubs in the future, like Latvia and Malaysia, are making strategic investments in their infrastructure and getting some big speed increases. Average connection speeds in Malaysia, for instance, have nearly doubled over the last year, and speeds in Latvia have hit the global top 10.Third, and most important from an investor's perspective, is how these faster speeds are being achieved. Mainly it's by pursuing a strategy Akamai has pursued since its following, pushing the core closer to customers.Core Internet is a highly competitive market. There are a lot of suppliers, equipment keeps getting better as fiber networking becomes standard, and thus margins are always rather thin. You can see it in Akamai's own results, which are good but not outstanding. Quarterly revenue is up just 20% year-over-year, margins are steady but thinning in the range of 25%, and it's only when you step back to a year-by-year view that you start to see the growth. The balance sheet is attractive, with no debt and cash now equal to nearly five months of revenues.In the core, suppliers compete with both carriers and customers. Akamai helps companies mirror content in many places, making for shorter hops to customers. But this is how big cloud companies like Google cut their transmission costs as well. And carriers find this the right strategy for keeping up.Another important lesson, familiar to anyone who studies infrastructure or urban design, is that it costs less to build new than to rebuild over what's old. A lot less. It costs a lot less to build a network with fiber than to relay fiber over copper. It costs less to put new data centers close to customers than to build the intervening infrastructure.There's also good news for the U.S. in this report. While we don't have the fastest connection speeds, we're the second-leading source of traffic, connection speeds increased 29% here year-over-year, and peak traffic rates are up 39% over last year.The faster, bigger market defines the opportunity for all vendors of Internet content, from the giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) to the social networks like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to game companies like Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA). For all these companies, and more, it's not a question of whether growth is coming, but how much, and how much they can make from it.And this is the best news of all in this report. Things are looking so good in this space you have to wear shades.Disclosure: I am long GOOG."

The company is in the process of diversifying its business into these other areas besides its bread-and-butter content delivery business.Five years ago Akamai did not embed its technology into other company's products or embed other company's technology into its own, but the company is currently working closely with other companies to do just that. Examples of the companies Akamai is partnering with include telecommunications company Ericsson (ERIC), telecommunications company Qualcomm (QCOM) and wide area network company Riverbed Technologies (RVBD) discussed in this article.Akamai is working with Ericcson to introduce Ericcson's Smart Cloud Accelerator solution which embeds Akamai's technology in Ericcson's SSR 8000 routing gateways.The company also announced it is working with Qualcomm to optimize delivery to mobile devices using Qualcomm's Snapdragon chipset.Akamai noted in its Q2 2012 earnings call held on July 25, 2012, the company is selling product related to the Riverbed Technology partnership. Riverbed and Akamai have a partnership for delivering the Steelhead Cloud Accelerator which combines Akamai's public Internet optimization with Riverbed Technologies' wide area network optimization.In Q2, Akamai recorded record revenues of $331 million which represented 20% growth year-over-year and also grew earnings to $0.43 per share or 23% growth year-over-year. The company reported strong demand across key market segments, with sales of cloud infrastructure related products experiencing accelerated growth of 22% year-over-year.Akamai's international sales clocked in at 27% of total revenue and saw accelerated growth in all European and Asia-Pacific markets. The company noted caution in Southern Europe related to the sovereign debt crisis occurring in the region.The company noted its Contendo acquisition, which brought revenue and customers, is progressing as planned. Additionally, Akamai's Blaze acquisition, which in contrast did not bring revenue and a large customer base, is proceeding with the development of new products related to the acquired technology.Akamai announced seven new products in the first half of the year and expects to announce additional products in the second half of the year.The company forecast Q3 revenue of $332 million to $342 million for which the midpoint guidance represents 20% revenue growth year-over-year.After Akamai reported its strong Q2 results, its stock price took a significant jump in price as shown below: Akamai's stock price is currently trading around $35, which is below its $39 peak hit in February and April of 2012.In a series of articles, a Bull-Put credit spread has been considered for the company, as the market appeared to have underestimated the future potential for Akamai.The initial 2012 May 28/31 Bull-Put credit spread started getting into trouble, so it was rolled to a series of farther out-in-time bull-put credit spreads after which the aggregate potential return now stands at 17%. With the latest spike in Akamai's stock price, the current 2012 Nov 21/26 bull-put credit spread is significantly out-of-the-money, so an analysis for additional management of the position is in order.The 2012 Nov 21/26 Bull-Put credit spread can be exited for a net debit of $0.39 as illustrated by PowerOptions tools and shown below: Based on this, the current position can be exited and the aggregate profit realized would be about +8.5%. However, continued management for the position could be performed in order to increase the current 17% potential return even further.Analysis for rolling the position closer in time is first investigated, as shorter time frame options decay faster than farther out-in-time options. Analysis for rolling the position in to August options did not reveal any attractive positions, but an analysis for September option expiration revealed a possibility of rolling to the 2012 Sep 27/32 Bull-Put credit for a credit of $0.57 as shown below:The $0.57 net credit combined with the $0.39 net debit for closing the current position, results in a total net credit of $0.18 ($.57-$0.39) which increases the potential return about 3.5%.Based upon increasing the potential return by 3.5%, rolling the 2012 Nov 21/26 Bull-Put spread to a 2012 Sep 27/32 Bull-Put spread results in improving the aggregate potential return to 20.5%. The specific trade information for rolling is shown below:Roll Bull-Put Credit Spread TradeAlternatively, an investor not currently in the 2012 Nov 21/26 Bull-Put credit spread position can enter the 2012 Sep 27/32 Bull-Put spread which has a potential return of 12.9% (90.3% annualized) and a time frame for realizing the potential profit of 52 days. The details for entering the Bull-Put credit spread are shown below:Bull-Put Credit Spread TradeA profit/loss graph for one contract of the AKAM 2012 Sep 27/32 Bull-Put credit spread is shown below: For a stock price above the $32 strike price of the short put option at expiration, the position is fully profitable. For a stock price below the $27 strike price of the long put option at expiration, the position results in a total loss, however, the position should be rolled or exited prior to realizing a loss at expiration.A management point of $33.50 is set for the new Bull-Put credit spread. If the price of the stock drops below the $33.50 management point, the position should be managed for an exit or a roll.

The company is looking to beat analyst estimates for a 3rd quarter in a row. Expectations call for roughly 17.2% top-line revenue growth, a 41.4% EBITDA margin. Akamai is at a crossroad -- with the CEO having announced he will be departing once a successor is found -- and while the rate of growth in its cloud or Value Added Services business has slowed significantly. Jefferies says the core-CDN environment remains healthy. Eyes will be on Cloud Infrastructure.Jefferies is modeling Q2 Cloud Infrastructure revenue of $194M, which implies an acceleration in organic growth to 16% from 14% seen in Q1. The firm believes Kona security and Aqua mobile are areas gaining greater traction and should aid Cloud Infrastructure growth through the year in addition to the acquired Cotendo contribution. Jefferies is modeling Q2 EPS/revenue of 37c/$326M, respectively, and expect a relatively in-line quarter with potential for modest upside, while recent buyback activity could be 1c accretive. The firm says currency could negatively impact Q3 by about $6M-$7M, which they do not believe is fully captured in consensus and could bring modest downward revisions."

A bull-put credit spread may be entered by selling one put option and purchasing a second put option further out-of-the-money with the goal of the options expiring worthless and the initial net credit retained as a profit.As explained in the previous article, the selling and subsequent price drop for the company's stock related to uncertainty with respect to a new CEO was deemed overdone. In the article, a management point of $32.50 was suggested as a point for which the position should be closed or rolled. Since the price of Akamai's stock has breached the $32.50 management point and is currently trading around $32.30 ( shown below), management of the position will be examined.The initial 2012 May 28/31 bull-put spread was entered for a credit of $0.25. To close the position today would result in a loss, as the position can be closed for a net debit of $0.35 as calculated by PowerOptions' tools and shown below:(Click to enlarge)Closing the position would result in a loss of -$0.10 ($0.25-$0.35) per share.

The buyer of the put option pays the seller a premium for the right to sell the shares at an agreed-upon price. If the stock does not trade at or below the agreed-upon price (strike price), the seller gets to keep the premium.Benefits associated with selling putsSuggested Put Strategy for Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM):It has tried to break out past $30 three times in the last 30 days, and so far each attempt has failed. Thus, there is a decent chance it could test the $26 ranges again before trending higher. A good tradable bottom is usually established after a stock re tests its recent lows. A weekly close above 35 will turn the trend to bullish. We would wait until it trades down to the 27.00-27.50 ranges before putting this strategy to play. It traded today as low as 28.57, so 27.50 is not that far off.The Jan 2013 25 puts are trading in the $2.11-$218 ranges. If the stock pulls back to the stated ranges, these puts should trade in the $2.80-$3.10 ranges. For this example, we will assume we can sell the puts for $2.80. For each contract sold, $280 will be deposited into your account.If the stock trades below 25, the shares could be assigned to your account. Your final cost per share will be $22.20 per share. If the shares do not trade below the strike price, you get to walk away with a gain of 11.2%.Risk factorAs you were bullish when you put this strategy into play, you should actually be looking forward to getting into this stock at a lower price. The only risk factor is that you suddenly have change your mind. Maybe you are not as bullish as before, and, or you feel it could trade much lower than the strike price you sold the puts at. If this is the case, you can roll the put. You simply buy back the puts you sold and sell new out of the money puts. Essentially you are taking on the same risk that is associated with owning the shares. The only difference is that you have the chance to get in at a better price or at least get paid for trying. The premium from the put you sold also provides you with some downside protection.

Sagan indicated the time to transition to a new CEO is when a company is doing well, as is the case with Akamai, rather than the alternative. A graph of the stock price with the haircut is shown below:Click to enlarge images.The company is performing well, but the prospect of a new CEO has investors spooked. With Akamai's haircut, entering a bull-put credit spread will be considered. A bull-put credit spread may be entered by selling one put option and purchasing a second put option further out-of-the-money. The goal is for both options to expire worthless with the initial net credit taken for a profit.Looking at Akamai's stock price, the next support level appears to be around the $31 price range, so a bull-put credit spread will be sought with a short strike price equal to or less than $31.Using the PowerOptions Midpoint Spread Chain tool, the following table of potential bull-put credit spreads were found:The 2012 May 28/31 bull-put credit spread has a potential return of 9.1% (151% annualized) and the strike price of the short put option is 7.7% out-of-the-money. A profit/loss graph for one contract of the Akamai bull-put credit spread is shown below:The 2012 May 31 put option may be sold for $0.31 and the 2012 May 28 put option may be purchased for $0.06, resulting in a net credit of $0.25. A management point of $32.5 is set for this position. If the price of Akamai drops below $32.5, the position should be managed for a roll or an exit.Akamai is the leading company in the content delivery network. The performance Akamai provides to its corporate customers through web content optimization is similar to the overnight delivery FedEx (NYSE:FDX) revolutionized when its founder Fred Smith developed express package shipping through more efficient use of air routes. Anyone who has ever bought anything online from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), downloaded a song from iTunes, or even received upgrades to their computer's operating system from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has most likely used Akamai's content delivery network to connect more safely and efficiently. Akamai estimates that it routinely delivers between 15% and 30% of all traffic on the Internet, far exceeding the estimated 6.4% of web traffic flowing through Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) each day.Akamai optimizes content delivery for websites, mobile devices, cloud platforms, and dynamic streaming multimedia, to enhance the online presence of its client companies. While use of the Internet continues to expand at an overwhelming pace, the immense burdens imposed on service providers to maintain smooth data transfer are growing substantially, leading to slower access rates and greater security risks. Akamai provides services and products on a delivery platform that brings the content, media, and applications to the end-users of its corporate customers with high-performance results.By dispersing 1,400 data centers in 78 countries and roughly 650 cities around the world, Akamai has installed a sophisticated hardware infrastructure of more than 105,000 servers collocated in facilities with major service providers that form the backbone of the Internet such as Comcast , Verizon (NYSE:VZ), and Sprint (NYSE:S). This geographic distribution of the company's resources on approximately 900 networks allows Akamai to map the fastest and most efficient path for the massive packets of data to travel through the Internet by avoiding network congestion and lowering latency times. As a result, the end-user of a website belonging to one of Akamai's corporate customers is able to process transactions, download an application, or experience content without the long waiting times that can lead to dissatisfaction and loss of business. The company estimates its platform delivers around 25% of global web traffic, at a rate of over 4 terabits per second.Akamai features an impressive base of established customers, including Microsoft , ESPN (NYSE:DIS), Amazon, Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV), Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Travelocity (Privately Held), Fox Sports (NASDAQ:NWS), Yahoo (YHOO), Verizon Wireless , General Motors (NYSE:GM), and Audi. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) trusts Akamai to handle its iTunes online store for downloading music, multimedia, and applications. These large retailers, software vendors, media organizations, entertainment companies, communications providers, and manufacturing firms form a strong foundation and reputable client portfolio that diversifies the company's revenue stream and growth prospects.In the company's most recent Q1 2012 conference call conducted on April 25, 2012, the company reported quarterly revenue of $319 million, which was an increase of 16% over the same period in the previous year. Commerce was the fastest growing market segment with an increase of 21% over the same quarter a year ago. Total revenue declined 7% sequentially and North America revenue declined 2% attributed to normal seasonality. All geographies outside of North America had strong growth, except for Japan. In February, the company introduced the Kona Site Defender, a product developed for thwarting malicious activity.In the company's fourth quarter 2011 conference call conducted on February 8, 2012, the company reported year-over-year growth rates of 23% in its enterprise market, in which Akamai's team of professionals handle every aspect of an organization's online presence from consultation to technology integration. The company's commerce sector followed closely with 20% year-over-year growth, fueled by a strong holiday season for online shopping. Akamai's cloud computing services comprise 55% of its overall high-tech segment year-over-year growth of 9%. Cloud services grew 20% year over year across all market segments for the fourth quarter of 2011, and account for 58% of total revenue. This area of Akamai's business should benefit from its acquisition of Blaze, which provides dynamic site accelerator systems for cloud infrastructures.The high-tech market is one where Akamai services nine of the top ten anti-virus companies in North America, adding to its already impressive client list of industry leaders such as Microsoft, Apple, IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Adobe. The software-as-a-service providers are emerging as a customer opportunity that represents great synergies for Akamai's efficient content delivery platform. The company's media and entertainment segment grew 11% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2011, and is poised to build upon this rate with the rollout of the second generation of the Akamai HD Network and the recently announced partnership with online video platform Vimond Media Solutions.Akamai is fueling extraordinary growth in its web security product Kona, with the company reporting sales growth of 149% in the fourth quarter of 2011. The company's CEO Sagan identified security as the top concern for Chief Information Officers of companies doing business online, even outweighing website performance concerns. Another key area for Akamai is the tremendous growth in mobile networks, and the proliferation of devices such as smartphones and tablets that have web and video streaming capabilities. The primary challenge facing content providers is the estimated 9.3 second average waiting time to access a webpage over a 4G network. Akamai will be releasing a new product in 2012 called Mobile Accelerator that will reduce page load times. In the first quarter of 2012, Akamai finalized its purchase of Cotendo, which was a strong upstart competitor in the content delivery arena. Cotendo developed promising technology in its mobile acceleration suite, adding to Akamai's advantage in this burgeoning market.The Cotendo acquisition will also help alleviate pressure on its gross margins, which is the primary concern about Akamai's prospective challenges. Fierce competition from Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT), Edgecast, and Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) provoked aggressive pricing battles that lowered gross margins for the entire content delivery market. Acquiring Cotendo will serve to remove a competitor from the bidding for future customers, as well as migration of its clients such as AT&T (NYSE:T) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) into Akamai's customer base.The recent haircut in Akamai's stock price was an over reaction to the search for a new CEO. Further declines in Akamai's stock price are not expected, so the bull-put credit spread should perform well over the next few weeks.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Akamai is coming off better-than-expected Q4 earnings results, a new CFO back in February, and its March purchase of startup Cotendo. Guidance provided for Q1 is EPS of 36c-39c on revenue of $305M-$313M. The focus seems to be on the Contendo acquisition, acquired on March 6. Akamai hasn't provided financial details for Cotendo, however, analysts contend that the deal could lift guidance because the startup sold premium products. Buying Cotendo should also ease pricing pressure for some value-added content delivery services, analysts say. Some put Akamai's Q2 contribution from Cotendo at $7.5M-$10M.Pacific Crest analyst Chad Bartley expects Q2 revenue guidance of roughly $315M-$325M, which includes roughly $10M from Cotendo. Citigroup is looking for $312M in revenue, $135M in EBITDA, and 38c in normalized EPS, which is generally in-line with the Street and within the guidance range. Based on intra-quarter channel checks and their model sensitivity work, Citigroup views Street Q1 estimates as reasonable, with materially greater likelihood of upside than downside variance. Citigroup analyst Mark Mahaney ""remains concerned about an increasingly competitive environment, especially where larger, well-funded companies, like Amazon are gaining traction."" Akamai's main rivals have been Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) and Level 3 Communications (NASDAQ:LVLT). It's also seeing stiffer competition from Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Amazon Web Services and phone companies AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ)."
598381,25036,2012-05-17T15:35:54-04:00,,"In a series of articles related to Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) posted on April, 27, 2012, May 8, 2012 and May 14, 2012, a bull-put credit has been considered for the company. A bull-put credit spread may be entered by selling one put option and purchasing a second put option further out-of-the-money with the goal of the options expiring worthless and the initial net credit retained as a profit.What initially started as fear related to a coming change in CEO has now morphed into fear related to competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).In the most recent article, a management point of $29.25 was set for the 2012 Nov 25/28 bull-put credit spread which has been breached as shown below:(Click to enlarge)Since the management point has been breached, an investigation into exiting or rolling the position will be considered. Closing the current position will require a net debit of $1.24 as shown below:(Click to enlarge)Since the $1.24 is greater than the cumulative net credit of $0.54 that we have received so far, a loss of $0.70 per share will be realized which represents a loss of -23%. So, closing at this point doesn't look too attractive, so consideration for rolling will be considered.The current November spread is about six months out, which is about as far out as can typically be rolled for a net credit for the same amount of capital at risk. And, looking at rolling to January 2013, this can be observed, as the 2013 Jan 24/27 has bull-put credit spread has a net credit of $1.18 (shown below) which is less than the $1.24 debit required for exiting the position. A roll could be executed and the end results could be still be a positive return, but the return would be reduced.(Click to enlarge)At this point, increasing the amount of capital is considered which highlights the point that spread traders should always have some capital available to rescue a position or have a position or positions which can be closed in order to free up capital for rescuing a position.The current spread between the option is $3, so we will investigate increasing the spread to $5 which is an increase in the amount of capital by 67%. Looking at November with a $5 spread reveals the position can be rolled to a 2012 Nov 21/26 bull-put spread for a net credit of $1.53 as shown below:(Click to enlarge)The 2012 Nov 22/27 bull-put spread could also be rolled too, but since November expiration is so far out in time, the additional margin between the short strike and the stock price provided by the 2012 Nov 21/26 is preferable. Another reason for selecting the 2012 Nov 21/26 is the stock has previous support in the $26 range as shown in the chart at the top.Executing the roll provides a net credit of $0.29 ($1.53-$1.24) resulting in an aggregate potential return of 17% which is slightly less than the 19.6% potential return of the previous position. It's nice to roll for increased potential return, but sometimes it's better to get out of danger instead. Also, the reduction in potential return is OK as it provides additional margin between the short strike and the stock price, but doesn't increase the time required for the position.A new management point of $27 is set for the new position. If the price of the stock drops below $27, then the position should be managed for an exit or a roll.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

A bull-put credit spread may be entered by selling one put option and purchasing a second put option further out-of-the-money with the goal of the options expiring worthless and the initial net credit retained as a profit.The price of Akamai's stock has continued to fall (shown below), probably more a result of the overall market negativity than anything related to the company, such as the company seeking to find a new CEO, as noted in the previous articles.Since the price of Akamai's stock has breached the $32.20 management point mentioned in the previous article, management of the position for a close or an exit is in order. Probably should have rolled the position on Friday, but unfortunately had too many other things to do, happens sometimes. To exit the current 2012 Jun 27/30 bull-put credit spread requires a net debit of $0.96 (shown below) which would result in a pretty big loss, as we have only taken in a credit of $0.39 so far, so exiting does not seem like a good idea.The 2012 Jun 27/30 bull-put spread position could be rolled to a 2012 Aug 26/29 bull-put spread for a net credit of $0.13, but this position doesn't give much margin between the stock price and the $29 short put strike price. A roll to the 2012 Aug 25/28 is possible for a net debit of -$0.05, which has pretty nice margin, so this is an option, but reduces potential return.Looking at November, the 2012 Nov 25/28 can be rolled to for a net credit of $0.15 ($1.11-$0.96) which provides a nice margin but is pretty far out in time as shown below:The 2012 Nov 25/28 is not great, but will have to do. Should have rolled the position on Friday, always better to roll sooner than later. This roll increases the aggregate potential return including previous positions to 19.6%.A management point of $29.25 is set for the new position.

400261,20875,2012-02-29T06:03:03-05:00,,"Since last year,  Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) has been working on developing an operator based content  delivery product and yesterday, the company officially announced the  launch of their new managed CDN offering, which they have branded as  Aura Network Solutions. While the company was light on details on how it  works, what it costs and which customers they have signed up, they did  provide me with their thoughts on the market and some details on their  plans for a federated CDN model.Like many of the CDN vendors in this industry, most notably EdgeCast  and Limelight Networks, Akamai plans to have two operator CDN products,  one managed and one licensed. Today, Akamai is offering a managed CDN  offering only and next month, plans to have their licensed software  model in trials. One interesting piece of information the company  divulged is that when launched, their licensed CDN product will have transparent caching  functionality build in. That's an interesting development because  Akamai's platform would then offer all three services to an operator,  those being on-net services/software, off-net delivery and transparent  caching. (more on why that is important here)Akamai said they have 6-10 paying customers for the managed CDN  offering, with three of those customers being operators and three  more being government institutions. While Akamai has been deploying edge  boxes inside of private networks for years, the company said their  managed CDN technology is something completely different and has been  designed just for operators. Akamai was not able to mention any  customers by name, but said they expect to be able to give out more  details before too long. The company said they are in discussions with  most of the major operators, as well as some who are conducting trials,  but it's too early for me to know how far along they are until we start  hearing directly from customers.Akamai said that 100% of the technology for their managed and  licensed CDN products have been developed in-house and that they have  built a ""new"" software solution for carriers as well as a team of people  inside of Akamai to support them. What effect their managed and  licensed CDN products will have on their bulk delivery business is  unknown, but I could see many carriers competing with Akamai's CDN  business over time. The cost of the managed/licensed offerings might  offset that, but it's really too early to know since I don't yet have  details from any customers on what Akamai is charging for these new  products. The company also said they plan to offer a federated CDN  model, which they will call ""Akamai Instant Federation"", with all of  their managed and licensed CDN customers, but it's really too early to  know what that may look like.There is only so much myself or anyone else can write about Akamai's  new managed CDN offering because we don't just yet know how it works, if  it works, or what it truly looks like. But if Akamai does in fact  announce a bunch of operators as customers and those operators start  discussing details, we're going to have a pretty good idea what kind of  disruption they could have in the market. Naturally, their partnership  with Ericsson should help as Akamai also announced that Ericsson is  selling their Smart Cloud Acceleration solutions to mobile and operator  networks, which will be bundled with Akamai's CDN software.As I have written about before,  the greatest challenge that Akamai faces is in convincing  operators  that their intentions are pure, and that this is not  principally a  strategy to gain valuable real estate inside the ISP  network. Fifteen  or so years ago, Akamai sold web caching to ISPs, and  used that  position to gain an upper hand in the nascent world of CDN. As  the  value to the ISP began to shrink, network operators began to view   Akamai as someone who consumed massive amounts of bandwidth and got a   free ride.Now they have to convince the operators that this time is  different,  and that the offering is genuinely for licensing technology  to the ISP  to delivery video and other content. There certainly is a  growing  market for these services and software, but from many conversations that  I  have had, network operators are not yet convinced that Akamai is the   answer to their problems; both technically, but more important   strategically. But if Akamai can show the market that they have  customers for these services and be more transparent than they have been  in the past on how the technology works, they may change operator's  perception.Akamai wasn't able to share with me what the size of the market  opportunity for managed and licensed CDN services is today, or what it  may grow to, and I don't know the size of the market either. By my  estimates, it's well less than $100M this year, but it is expected to  grow pretty quickly over the next few years. At some point soon, I will  put out market sizing data for the licensed CDN market like I have done  for the video CDN and transparent caching markets.If you want to learn more about the managed and licensed CDN business  and hear directly from carriers and operators deploying these solutions  as well as transparent caching products, then check out the Content Delivery Summit,  taking place May 14th in NYC. We'll have carriers from all over the  world speaking as well as all the major vendors showcasing how their  solutions and services work.Disclosure: No position"

The consensus estimate is 40c for EPS and $311.26M for revenue, according to First Call. Akamai's positive earnings surprise for the past four quarters averages at a modest 3.6%. Guidance for Q4: revenues in the range of $303M-$315M, representing 6%-11% year-over-year growth. EPS is expected to be 37c-41c, including tax charges of $25M-$30M, based on a full-year GAAP tax rate of about 36%. Akamai expects gross margins ""flat to slightly higher"" than Q3’s 79.8%. Operating expenses are expected to increase approximately $10M year-over-year. The adjusted EBITDA margin is expected in the range of 43%-44%. Capex for Q4 is forecast at approximately $50M, and 16% of revenues for FY11. Citigroup is looking for $311M in revenue, $135M in EBITDA, and 40c in normalized EPS, which is generally in-line with consensus. Based on Citigroup's intra-quarter channel checks and its model sensitivity work, the firm views Street Q4 and Q1 estimates as reasonable. For Q4, Citigroup is expecting a modest deceleration in Akamai's reported revenue growth –- 9% year-over-year in Q4 vs. 11% year-over-year in Q3. Consensus for Q1: 39c on $304.82M in revenue. Consensus for FY12: $1.67 on $1.28B in revenue."

441381,20725,2012-03-19T02:43:18-04:00,,"Akamai's (NASDAQ:AKAM) stock has been on a roll as it has nearly doubled over the past 6 months. The valuation metrics are very mixed on the stock as one suggests that SNDK is undervalued and the other two suggest that it is overvalued. However, growth is only projected in the 12-13% range. In 2012, analysts expect the company to increase revenues by 13% and 12% in 2013. A stock with these kind of growth prospects does not deserve the rich multiples the market is giving AKAM. Therefore, I suggest that investors stay away from AKAM and look elsewhere in the tech space. Below is an in depth look at the valuation metrics.Valuation: Akamai's trailing 5 year valuation metrics suggest that the stock is undervalued as all of the metrics are below their respective 5 year averages. Akamai's current P/B ratio is 3.1 and it has averaged 3.3 over the past 5 years with a high of 6.9 and low of 1.6. Akamai's current P/S ratio is 5.7 and it has averaged 7 over the past 5 years with a high of 16.9 and low of 3.2. Akamai's current P/E ratio is 34.9 and it has averaged 37.4 over the past 2 years with a high of 61.8 and low of 19.1.Price Target: The consensus price target for the analysts who follow Akamai is $37. That is downside of 2% from today's stock price of $37.36 and suggests that the stock is overvalued at these levels. This also suggests that the stock has limited upside and should be avoided at its current stock price.Forward Valuation: Akamai is currently trading at about $37 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $1.85 next year, an earnings increase of 12% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 20.2. Taking a look at other tech companies will give us a better idea of the stock's relative valuation. Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is currently trading at about $60 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $3.35 next year, an earnings increase of 13% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 18. Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) is currently trading at about $34 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $2.66 next year, an earnings increase of 10% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 12.7. Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) is currently trading at about $41 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $2.41 next year, an earnings increase of 18% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 17. The mean forward P/E of Akamai's competitors is 15.9 which suggests that Akamai is overvalued relative to its publically traded competitors.Earnings Estimates: Akamai has beat EPS estimates 3 times in the past 4 quarters. The company's EPS figures have come in between 1 cent and 5 cents from consensus estimates or about 2.8% to 12.5% from analyst estimates. The company has reported earnings that have differed from analyst estimates by a fair margin which suggests that the stock may experience upside from earnings surprises.Price Action: Akamai is up 2.4% over the past year, underperforming the S&P 500, which is up 12.5%. Looking at the technicals, the stock is currently above its 50 day moving average, which sits at $34.89 and above its 200 day moving average, which sits at $28.47.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
315549,22762,2011-12-22T10:43:20-05:00,,"By Robin WautersAkamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) has indeed acquired Cotendo, one of its largest competitors, in a deal valuing the CDN and site acceleration services company at approximately $268 million.The confirmation comes nearly a month after Israeli business press reported that Akamai was mulling an acquisition of the website and mobile acceleration technology vendor for up to $350 million.Under the terms of the agreement, Akamai will acquire all of the outstanding equity of Cotendo in exchange for a net cash payment of $268 million, after accounting for expected purchase price adjustments, plus the assumption of outstanding unvested options to purchase Cotendo common stock. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2012.Says Paul Sagan, president and CEO of Akamai:Founded in 2008, Cotendo is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California, and employs roughly 100 people (of which half work out of its R&D facilities near Netanya, in Israel).Cotendo has raised over $36 million in funding from investors like Sequoia Capital, Benchmark Capital and Tenaya Capital.The company specializes in acceleration services for dynamic Web apps, static and dynamic web content, performance monitoring and automatic failover as well as real-time reporting and analytics.A few months ago, Cotendo raised $17 million in new funding from its previous backers, with Citrix Systems (NASDAQ:CTXS) and Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) stepping in as strategic investors as well. Other strategic partners include Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), AT&T (NYSE:T) and Sumitomo Corporation.Cotendo customers include Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), Vistaprint and Facebook. Notably, the company’s advisory board includes Jonathan Heiliger, currently VP of Technical Operations at Facebook.On an interesting sidenote: a year ago, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology joined Akamai in suing Cotendo over patent infringement (which in turn reminds me of Nuance’s recent acquisition of Vlingo, which also occurred after – years of – patent litigation between the two parties).Original post"
319725,20875,2012-01-15T09:57:14-05:00,,"About 45 days ago, I noticed Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) was being more competitive when  it came to pricing CDN deals and around that same time, Akamai's sales  reps were highlighting this pricing reduction in emails to potential  customers. One of the emails I received from an Akamai sales rep said, ""as  we are at the end of 2011, I wanted to keep you informed that we are  significantly reducing bandwidth costs to be at a competitive stance.""  Initially I thought this might be an end of the year thing as many CDN  vendors tend to lower pricing on selective deals in a bid to close as  much business as possible in December. But in this case, that doesn't  seem to be the case.In checking these latest pricing trends with Akamai, last month, the  company confirmed to me that they have lowered pricing, with the  reasoning behind it being that they have reduced their internal costs  and are passing those savings on to customers. While the company agreed  to provide me with more details on which costs have been lowered, to  date, I haven't received any of that info. It's possible that Akamai's  costs associated with their CDN services have gone down, but since the  company doesn't break out operating costs based on product, there's  really no way to know if that's the case. Clearly Akamai is looking to  try and gain more CDN market share and add more volume on their network  by offering lower pricing and it just may work.In a check with Akamai's competitors for CDN services, many of them  stated that they have seen Akamai be much more aggressive in the last 30  days. What percentage of Akamai's M&E revenue is directly  attributed to CDN services we don't know, but running a CDN is all about  the economics of scale. If Akamai can get enough new business on their  network fast enough and grow their traffic at a high enough rate, that  can offset the decline in margins that comes from lowering pricing. And  if any CDN can also lower their own delivery costs at the same time,  that only accelerates the CDN cycle of lower pricing and higher volume.  That's the underlying fundamentals of how a successful CDN operates but  we won't know for some time how this lower pricing strategy will impact  Akamai.Naturally, many are going to ask me by what percentage Akamai has  lowered their pricing. While I don't have an exact number, since  multiple deals I have seen vary in size and commitment levels, it's  enough of a decline in pricing to where Akamai is now pretty much at the  same price as Limelight, Level 3 and EdgeCast, for the right sized  deals. One of the last deals I saw, Akamai had quoted the customer $0.05  per GB for a monthly commit of 250TB a month. Previously, those sized  deals, amongst all the vendors, was averaging about $0.07 per GB.Akamai's year over year media and entertainment revenue declined or  stated flat for the first three quarters of 2011 and the company has  stated that the rate of volume growth on their network has slowed. So  it's not surprising that Akamai is now looking to try and win back some  wallet share with a lower CDN pricing strategy. This is the exact same  approach Akamai took in Q1 of 2010  and they did gain some share last time they got aggressive, but they  didn't grow traffic fast enough to make up for the pricing decline in  their M&E business. Whether or not they can be successful this time  around it's too early to know, but something to keep an eye on.I'll be doing my annual CDN pricing survey with customers next month,  which typically collects data from 500-800 CDN customers, so I'll have  more detailed pricing trends to share at the end of Q1.Disclaimer: I have never bought, sold or traded a single share of stock in any public company ever."

Total  revenue also managed to achieve the higher end of management’s guided  range of $273.0 million to $283.0 million.The better-than-expected result was primarily driven by continued solid  growth for value added solutions. Revenue from Akamai’s fastest-growing  Enterprise vertical grew 30.0% year over year to $39.0 million, as more  customers adopted cloud services for their businesses.Commerce increased 23.0% year over year to $61.4 million, driven by  strong demand for Dynamic Site Acceleration solutions (DSA) and security  solutions. The company signed approximately 100 DSA deals and more than  30 customers purchased Akamai’s security solutions during the quarter.Public sector climbed 5.0% year over year to $15.5 million and Media  & Entertainment jumped 5.0% to $117.7 million.

For fiscal 2011, capital expenditure is expected to be 16% of revenues.Our TakeWe believe that increased usage of cloud computing technology ensures  higher adoption of value-added solutions, which will drive strong  top-line growth going forward. Moreover, strong demand for security  products, aggressive share repurchase and strategic partnerships are  positives for the stock over the long term.However, weak traffic growth remains a concern, as Akamai continues to face intense pricing pressure from competitors like Level 3 Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:LVLT), Limelight Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:LLNW) and carriers such as AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) and Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), who are developing their own content delivery network.

The Street estimate is for Adjusted Earnings Per Share (EPS) (per our methodology) of $0.33 per share, near the high-end of the range at $0.34 (Source: Yahoo! Finance). Revenues are seen climbing 10.0% to $278.87 million. During its 2Q conference call last July, Akamai predicted normalized (adjusted) EPS of $0.31 to $0.34 on revenue of between $273 and $283 million. Note that the shares have sold off sharply in reaction to the prior three earnings releases. Last quarter, a slight miss on revenues sent the shares reeling in after-hours trading. But with the shares off more than 20% from the 2Q earnings release, the Street may be a bit more forgiving this time around. Expectations have also come down quite a bit, leaving the door open for a potential upside surprise. Following the recent pullback, Akamai has been the subject of frequent takeover chatter, with possible suitors including Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM). The company is also diversifying away from its content delivery network (CDN) business, seizing opportunities in cloud-computing and other growth area. Akamai is also seen benefiting from international expansion. Risks include recent pricing discounts and increasing competition from the likes of Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) and Level 3 Communications (NASDAQ:LVLT). Chart Review-Akamai is more than 23% off the 52-week low of $18.25 established back on October 4. The 20-Day SMA recently crossed back above the 50-Day SMA – a sign of improving momentum. -Near-term resistance is at $25, the lower end of the gap down following the prior earnings release.

Earlier, IBM (NYSE:IBM) and software-giant Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) acquired smaller cloud-based companies. Even this month,German-based SAP (NYSE:SAP) bought SuccessFactors for $3.2bn (link).Under the proposed deal Akamai will pay $268 million for the just three-year old privately held company. Its initial investors, including the famous Sequoia Technology Fund, which participated in initial financing rounds, stand to make good returns.Cotendo Only founded in 2008, Cotendo employs about 100 employees and is equally split between Israel and California. Cotendo offers integrated web and mobile services which are complementary to Akamai's existing platform assets to provide a complete solution for enterprises embracing cloud-based strategies in a rapid pace.Akamai Growing at double-digit rates Akamai has had a good run in the last five years. Revenues surpassed the annual $1 billion mark last year on which it made $170 million in profit with roughly 2,300 employees. It has no debt and could easily finance the acquisition with over $600 million in cash in the bank.Shares have been hammered this year, falling all the way from $50 at the start to lows of $20 in the autumn as profit margins were under pressure and the company was forced to issue a profit warning.Strategic Fit The acquisition makes perfect strategic sense. The deal valued at an estimated 6 times annual revenue implies a multiple which is in line with Akamai's own valuation.Investors are relieved that Akamai finally decided to acquire a rapidly growing competitor (Cotendo was already eating into Akamai's high margins this year). Investors are cheering today and pushed the market valuation up by $1 billion, a sign of relief when a business is acquiring a competitor for just a fraction of that amount.Investors acquiring Akamai's shares at these levels are betting that the acquisition will start to turn around the margin decline which hammered Akamai's stock this year.

298642,22145,2011-10-10T13:05:16-04:00,,"By Justin DoveAccording to Bloomberg research, Akamai (Nasdaq: AKAM) is the most talked-about takeover candidate since 2005. That takeover chatter was rekindled this week as shares hit a new 52-week low at $18.25 per share.Shares are currently trading in the low $20s, following a slight pop  based on the rumors. The stock has a 52-week high of $54.65, which was  hit in late 2010. Since then, the stock is on a steady decline. Market  value for Akamai plummeted to about $4 billion after reaching $9.9  billion last December.But Trefis.com claims the fair value of the stock is almost $31 per share. And the low valuation could be enticing to potential suitors.What is Akamai?Akamai is a company that speeds up internet content delivery.  According to its website, “Akamai routinely delivers between 15 and 30  percent of all web traffic, reaching more than four terabits per  second.”Its customers include Apple (Nasdaq: APPL), Netflix (Nasdaq: NFLX), NFL.com and MLB.com streaming videos and a who’s who list of websites and internet-related companies.The stock has likely tanked over the last 12 months because of  lowered expectation on company performance. After the second quarter,  analysts predicted an EPS of $1.57 for this year and $1.79 in 2012. The  expectations have now been lowered to $1.45 this year and $1.62 next  year.Akamai has also faced increasing pressure from competitors, having  renewed some of its content delivery contracts at lower prices. Late in  2010, the stock was trading with a P/E ratio in the 60s, however  currently the P/E of roughly 23 is very reasonable for an internet  technology company that should experience more growth.IBM and Verizon: Likely Takeover Candidates for Akamai Bloomberg claims IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Verizon (NYSE: VZ)  are the most likely takeover candidates. It also cites SunTrust  Robinson analyst Rodney Ratliff, who thinks the company might not accept  any offers under $40 per share.And although the stock suffered heavy losses, the company is still  experiencing success. Akamai is projected to post an increase in net  income for a fifth consecutive year at 13-percent growth over 2010.Even if Akamai isn’t taken over, its current price may represent a  nice entry point for investors that aren’t totally spooked by the crisis  in Europe.Disclosure: Investment U expressly forbids  its writers from having a financial interest in any security they  recommend to our subscribers. All employees and agents of Investment U  (and affiliated companies) must wait 24 hours after an initial trade  recommendation is published on online - or 72 hours after a direct mail  publication is sent - before acting on that recommendation."
299478,24802,2011-10-13T16:52:36-04:00,,"One of the fundamental rules in investing is that sometimes a company's stock price must drop significantly before it becomes a worthwhile investment opportunity. We have found such a company in Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM).Akamai is the world's leading CDN, or content delivery network, using its vast server farms all across the world to speed up the Internet worldwide. The issue with this business model is that Akamai is facing competition in the CDN space from the likes of Limelight (NASDAQ:LLNW) and Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT). But Akamai stock has fallen over 46% in the past year due to these concerns, and we think the worst case scenario is more than priced in.Click to enlarge  We bought Akamai recently because we believe that the stock has found a bottom, especially as investors price in these growth fears, which have not been as dire as the stock chart would suggest. Revenue at Akamai has grown at an average of 29.3% over the past five years, and the company is expected to post record GAAP EPS this quarter. But then, why has the stock tumbled so much?In short, Akamai committed the sin many high-multiple, high-growth stocks commit. Growth slowed down just a tad. The company missed analyst's expectations for revenue by $0.8 million in the last quarter, and as a result, the stock dropped over 13%. (click here)Going forward, we expect Akamai stock to outperform, for the following reasons.Note that we did not specify a buyout as a reason to invest in Akamai. We never buy a stock on the basis of its appeal as a takeover target. If it is rumored to be one, so much the better. But we think it is foolish to buy a stock solely based on takeover speculation. Akamai has had more takeover speculation surrounding it than any other company in the S&P 500. The latest rumor is that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is looking to buy the company. While it would certainly be nice to have a buyout, we think at this level Akamai can outperform going forward as a standalone company.We stress that Akamai at $24-$25 is a much different company than at $50. Expectations have come down dramatically, as has the P/E ratio. Akamai now has a P/E ratio of just over 23 and a forward P/E of about 14. Akamai trades at a price-to-book ratio of 2.5, a huge discount to the sector average. At levels of $50, Akamai's stock was pricing in far too rosy prospects. At $25, the stock is pricing in doom. The Reuters average price target is $31.39, representing upside of nearly 30% from current levels.The first half of this year was a record for Akamai in terms of revenue, cash flow and profits. The long-term trends supporting the business have not abated. Internet traffic is growing exponentially, as is enterprise cloud computing and e-commerce. Akamai stands to benefit from all these trends, which is why we have bought the stock at these levels. Akamai's stock is pricing in a disaster for the company, yet the company's financial results do not support this. Expectations have come down to realistic levels, and while Akamai does have competition, it will not decimate earnings. The value-added services segment is seeing strong growth, and will support the company going forward.We think Akamai is a long-term bet on the explosive growth of the Internet. Akamai continues to be a leader in the industry, and at this price, in our opinion, the stock is too cheap to pass up given the growth profile. Akamai means intelligent in Hawaiian, and to us, Akamai stock is a very Akamai investment.Disclosure: I am long AKAM."
296708,20875,2011-09-29T14:39:00-04:00,,"Over the course of the past ten years, Akamai has seen various competitors  come to the market, typically looking to compete on CDN services. Most  of these competitors didn't last long or in the case of someone like  Speedera, Akamai acquired them, thereby re-affirming their leadership  position in the industry. While Akamai's CDN business has taken a hit  over the last few years, revenue from their value add services business  has been growing and has really helped diversify the company's revenue.But over the past 3-4 quarters, Akamai's business is, for the first  time, being impacted on multiple levels. Their CDN business, value add  services business and their network technology is all feeling  competitive pressure and Akamai has been slow to react to changing  market dynamics. While it use to be easy for them to say that new  entrants were just competing on price, that's no longer the case.  Competitors are competing on performance and in many cases, winning  deals based on that alone. Content owners know that Akamai is not the  only option in the market and we've all learned that there is more than  one way to deliver content with great performance. Level 3 and Limelight  combined will have north of $200M in CDN revenue this year. Clearly,  Akamai's not the only game in town anymore and performance is about much  more than the number or servers a CDN has or what kind of network  architecture they have.While it's very clear to see the impact that Level 3, Limelight (and  soon Amazon and Verizon) are having on Akamai's CDN business, many have  felt that Akamai built a moat around their value add services business,  thereby keeping others from truly competing. What we have seen is that  Cotendo and others are in fact winning business from Akamai based on  performance and price for these services and this trend will only  continue. I've been hearing from a lot more customers lately who have  left Akamai for Cotendo for things like app acceleration or DSA and  these customers say that on average, Cotendo is 20% faster and 30%  cheaper than Akamai.Of course this is not always the case for every product and every  customer, but Cotendo is enough of a threat that Akamai feels the best  way to try and stop them is to sue them for patent infringement.  Akamai knows that Cotendo and others are only going to continue to put  the pressure on the value add services portion of their business and  drive the price for these services down over time. Based on Akamai's  recent earnings and guidance, we are already starting to see this  happen.While Akamai's CDN and value add services business is now under  attack, changes in the market also mean that Akamai's position inside  the last mile is also facing trouble. As more telcos, carriers, ISPs and  MSOs start to build and deploy their own CDNs, Akamai's value inside  many of these networks is diminishing. While Akamai won't come out and  say there is a problem, the whole reason Akamai is now trying to create a licensed CDN (LCDN) product is to try and stay inside the last mile and provide more value to the carriers.While it has been clear for some time that the CDN market is  evolving, Akamai has been very slow to respond to these market changes.  Two weeks ago, EdgeCast announced  that their carrier grade CDN solution, which has been on the market for  two years, has now been licensed by Pacnet, the tenth carrier to sign  up with EdgeCast. Meanwhile, Akamai does not have any carrier product  out in the market and is still searching for senior people to work in  the LCDN group. These open positions list job functions including, ""responsible  for defining strategy, target markets, product requirements,  pricing  and financial models, managing product launches, and providing   management updates on their product.""The future of the CDN business lies with the carriers and telcos and  while Akamai is still developing a carrier CDN solution in-house to  bring to market, with no ETA as to when it will be ready, Akamai  continues to get beaten by the smaller and more nimble EdgeCast, a  company that is doing only 5% of Akamai's total revenue. Why Akamai is  trying to build everything in-house I don't know, but if I was them, I  would acquire EdgeCast and then acquire a transparent caching provider,  ideally PeerApp, which would then give Akamai an instant carrier grade  CDN and transparent caching solution for telcos.Such a product would be a very strong offering in the market and with  Akamai's reach and marketing exposure, competitors would have a hard  time selling against it. Especially since Akamai could also offer  off-net CDN services in addition to the on-net software. Such a platform  would solve all three of the delivery needs for telcos, carriers and  ISPs. It would be a true carrier grade CDN and transparent caching  solution, all in one platform. And if anyone wonders if this is the way  the market is headed, last week, EdgeCast and PeerApp both announced  they were working to create one platform for both their services, based  on demand from their telco customers. The carrier market is telling the  market what they want in the way of solutions, but Akamai has yet to  deliver.With EdgeCast doing north of $50M in revenue this year, it would be a  simple acquisition for Akamai and one they could easily afford. Some  might say that Akamai has tried these types of acquisitions in the past  and not fared well, which is true. In 2006 Akamai spent $160M, or nine  times revenue to acquire Nine Systems and then stopping selling the  StreamOS platform about two years later. By all accounts, that  acquisition was a failure. But unlike Nine Systems which changed their  business model and focus quite a bit before they were acquired, EdgeCast  has been focused on the licensed carrier CDN model from day one. And  with ten telcos and carriers already relying on EdgeCast's technology  including AT&T, Telus, Deutsche Telekom, Global Crossing and Dogan Telecom,  you know it works and works well. Not to mention, EdgeCast has a nice  list of non-carrier customers including Yahoo!, ESPN, JetBlue,  Wordpress, LinkedIn, Kellogg's, IMAX and Lifetime Networks.Aside from getting beaten by EdgeCast on the carrier side, Akamai is  also getting beaten by Cotendo on the mobile acceleration front. While  Akamai announced in February a ""strategic alliance"" with Ericsson to  develop some kind of mobile acceleration product, to date, no real  details have been released of when the product will come out or what it  will look like. Akamai has a very generic and high-level marketing video  on their website, but there is no real product info. Meanwhile, Cotendo launched their mobile acceleration suite three months ago,  have given out very detailed information of how it works, and announced  customers who are already paying to use it. Once again, Akamai is  getting beaten by the little guy with a new product in the market.While competitors like EdgeCast and Cotendo are smaller than Akamai,  they are more nimble and have been faster at rolling out new products  and platforms. One of the things I have found very strange is that over  the past fifteen months, Akamai has been super slow in rolling out new  products and services. If you take a look  at all of their press releases over the past year and half, you'll find  very few announcements of new products and platforms. I find only three  releases talking to new services, which pertain to their Edge  Tokenization service, Electronic Software Delivery for Gaming and  Edgeview. While Akamai has announced a bunch of ""alliances"" (Brightcove,   Rackspace, IBM, Riverbed), these haven't been new products or  platforms. At Akamai's customer conference last year, Akamai said they  would soon have a new version of their DSA product on the market, but a  year later, I have yet to see them announce it.At a time when Akamai's business is clearly being impacted by  competitors, big and small, as well as fundamental changes taking place  in the market, Akamai's management has been very quiet. They aren't  saying what they are working on, what their product road map looks like  and haven't outlined what they plan to do to get their business growing  again. They aren't telling Wall Street any story, aren't opening up to  customers and are simply conducting business as usual. Why Akamai isn't  making key strategic acquisitions in the market I don't know, but unless  they make some serious changes in how they do business, Akamai's going  to continue to have tough times going forward.Simply put, Akamai needs to evolve. The market has changed and Akamai  is not changing with it. They need to change their message, they need  to open up to customers, they need to respond to RFPs faster and they  have to stop operating their business with the attitude that no one can  possibly compete with Akamai's network technology. I was hoping that  once Akamai felt that Cotendo might seriously compete with them, Akamai  would change their way of thinking and simply roll out a better platform  than Cotendo and compete on the merits of the product. Instead, they  fell back to their usual way of thinking and instead of innovating,  simply filed a  patent infringement suit against Cotendo.While I know Akamai won't agree with me, their arrogance is at the  heart of the problem. Even customers whom I speak to that like Akamai's  products and services, say the company is arrogant. And while I'm sure  some will want to argue with me on that point, people know it's true and  it can't be debated. To Akamai, they are never wrong, no one can do  what they do, everyone else's technology is outdated and no one can  truly compete with them. Until management changes the culture of the  company and changes their current message to the market, and by that I  mean customers and Wall Street, Akamai is going to have a had time  growing their business at the rate they use to.Disclosure: No positions."
287040,24279,2011-08-12T11:28:46-04:00,,"Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) went down in a blaze this past year falling from its 52- week high of $54.70 to its current price of $22. Investors seemed to have wised up to its lofty P/E Ratio of 63 back in late 2010, and have taken it down to a much more reasonable valuation at a price/earnings multiple of 15 based on Yahoo Finance consensus earnings estimates for 2011. Although Akamai appears to be trading at a discount, this once marquee security may not be ready for the scrap heap, but, also may not be suitable for conservative portfolios with the volatile markets trading in uncharted waters. Let's take a look under the hood and see what you think.Akamai distributes Internet content to desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones: ""...on its 90,000 servers which serve roughly 30% of all Web traffic at the edges of the Internet around the globe,"" according to J. Bosnia in a May 11, 2011, article Riverbed and Akamai Team for Hybrid Clouds in Investor's Business Daily. The company selectively collocates its servers in prime real estate locales around the global networks that make up the Internet. This enables Web content such as text, video, graphics and applications to load quicker with less latency.On July 27, the stock traded at $29.48, then Akamai reported an earnings miss and it ran off the rails closing at $23.84 the next day. As CEO Paul Sagan stated in the Q2 2011 Earnings Call Transcript: ""We've seen our top line growth slow down, driven primarily by the pricing and traffic dynamics in our media and software delivery business, and we've encountered a general slowdown in a few of the more mature markets outside of the U.S. where we operate due primarily to the tougher macro economic headwinds in those markets."" Translated into English, what CEO Sagan is saying is that the company had to reduce prices due to commoditization in the broadband delivery industry and European sales are slowing down due to sovereign debt problems.Sagan went on to say that prospects going forward still remain attractive and they are building the business around four main drivers: ""The first one of these is the emergence of cloud computing in the enterprise, followed by the need for better IT security. Then there's the dramatic increase of connected devices, a phenomenon that is driving new applications and new demand for rapid and reliable delivery of data, especially in mobile networks. And finally, more and more rich media, especially long form video, is being consumed online..."".Some of this online streaming demand is from customers such as MTV, Independent Film Channel, CBS Sports and the National Football League. Other clients include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), just to name a few, and, various government agencies like the U.S Air Force, the Defense Department and the Census Bureau. A very impressive customer base. However, there is competition from the likes of Limelight (NASDAQ:LLNW), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Level 3 Communications (NASDAQ:LVLT).To bolster its cloud computing presence, CEO Sagan discusses some of Akamai's initiatives in the 2011 Q1 Earnings Call Transcripts: ""This month, IBM announced its WebSphere Application Accelerator for Public Networks and Hybrid Networks. These products integrate Akamai's application acceleration capability with IBM's WebSphere technologies."" WebSphere is a brand of enterprise software products that has been available for over ten years in the sector of Application and Integration Middleware. Akamai has also partnered with Rackspace Hosting (NYSE:RAX) and Riverbed Technologies (NASDAQ:RVBD) to help take marketshare.In that same conference call, CEO Sagan goes on to say: ""In the area of Internet security, which is a top priority of CIOs everywhere, we announced our new suite of cloud defense solutions. The Akamai DDoS defense architecture is designed to help customers therefore monitor and mitigate the impact of distributed denial service of attacks. The distributed computing platform was designed to protect our customer sites from malicious threats by absorbing large-scale attacks at the edges of the Internet, not at the backdoor of a client's data center.""If you're trawling for equities in the cloud computing space, Akamai Technologies is a great organization to keep your eye on, but there's no immediate rush to jump into it post haste. After all, consensus earnings estimates as reported on Yahoo Finance are reported to be $1.45 for 2011 and only $1.63 for 2012. That's a nice gain, but nowhere near the projected 15% five-year CAGR or the heavy duty 36% it grew on an annual basis in the previous half decade. This decrease in business is one of the main reasons the stock got torpedoed and investors were left in the lurch.A p/e ratio of 15 and a five-year CAGR of 15% gives it a PEG ratio of one, which isn't very rich, but Akamai's strong suit isn't proprietary technology. Yes, it is making inroads into the cloud, but it is still primarily a content distribution company without a large moat around the business. Any entity with deep pockets can set up server farms. That's exactly what Amazon is doing right now. According to the analysts opinions on Yahoo Finance, six have it as a strong buy, four say it's a buy and thirteen want you to hold the security. I tend to take the more pessimistic side of the market these days and believe we are heading lower, so I am going to bite the bullet and wait and see if it goes lower.

282339,21445,2011-07-27T15:41:59-04:00,,"Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) is expected to report Q2 earnings after the market close on Wednesday, July 27, with a conference call scheduled for 4:30 pm ET. The consensus estimate is 36c for EPS and $277.98M for revenue, according to First Call. Many analysts lowered estimates and ratings on Akamai shares after its Q1 results back in April. The firms cited a slowdown in Media and Entertainment revenue growth. The company's publicly stated outlook for Q2 called for $270M-$280M in revenue and 34c-37c in EPS. SunTrust's Robinson Humphrey is forecasting Q2 results of $278.0M in revenue and 37c in normalized EPS, basically in-line with consensus. SunTrust's key focus will be the growth rate of the Enterprise industry segment, which it believes is a reasonably accurate gauge of the continued uptake of higher margin value added services. With the positive figures reported out of the wireless data segment, SunTrust expects a positive update on wireless demand, and would expect some indication of the progress of the Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) partnership. SunTrust believes that a re-acceleration of the volume-driven business in 2H11 is possible -- pulled through by increases in wireless demand and in overseas markets, quite possibly with the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) expansion into Latin America as one modest catalyst. The firm feels that Akamai's Q4 of 2010 re-price of its largest Media and Entertainment customers likely will keep upside to margins restrained, but it believes that the company's outlook and the Street mean are conservative enough to anticipate an in-line to slightly better quarterly print, in the upper half of guidance. On the call, investors/analyst will be closely watching for comments on what pricing pressures Akamai faces from competitors like Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW), InterNAP Network Services (NASDAQ:INAP) and Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT) for its content delivery network service. They will also look for any signs of a slowdown in customer additions as telecom providers like AT&T (NYSE:T) have started to venture into providing their own CDN services.

Akamai achieved  its top-line guidance of more than $1.0 billion in fiscal 2010.Revenues in the quarter escalated 19.5% year over year and 12.3%  sequentially to $284.7 million, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate  of $283.0 million. The year-over-year growth was attributed to strong  performance across all key verticals.Operating income on a non-GAAP basis was $76.6 million, up 15.4% year  over year versus $66.4 million in the prior-year quarter. Operating  margin declined 90 basis points (bps) to 26.9% in the quarter compared  with 27.8% in the prior-year quarter.We believe a significant increase in costs negatively affected margins  in the quarter. Total costs and operating expenses increased 20.6% year  over year to $212.3 million. As a percentage of revenue, total costs and  operating expenses increased 70 bps to 74.6% from 73.9% in the  comparable prior-year quarter.Current Quarter ExpectationsAkamai expects normal seasonality in the first quarter of 2011. Akamai  forecasts sequential decrease in revenue in the Commerce and Advertising  vertical for the first quarter of 2011. Akamai projects revenue in the  range of $265.0 million to $275.0 million, up 10.0% to 15.0% from the  first quarter of 2010. However, on a sequential basis, revenue is  expected to dip 5.2% in the quarter. The current Zacks Consensus  Estimate is pegged at $274.0 million, at the high end of the company’s  guided range.Akamai estimates earnings of 35 cents to 37 cents per share for the  first quarter of 2011. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged  at 27 cents for the first quarter.Akamai expects gross margin in the range of 80.0% to 81.0% for the  first quarter of 2011. Further, the company expects operating expense to  decline sequentially and adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the 45.0% to  46.0% range, roughly flat with the prior quarter.Akamai expects capital expenditure of $50.0 million for the first  quarter. On a long-term basis, the company expects capital expenditure  to be at the upper end or slightly above the long-term revenue model of  13% to 16%. Akamai continues to maintain its objective of more than  15.0% growth for fiscal 2011.Estimate Revision TrendOut of the eighteen analysts providing estimates for the upcoming  quarter, none made any changes in their estimates in the last thirty  days.Similarly, for fiscal 2011, none of the analysts covering the stock  revised their estimates in the last thirty days. Thus the EPS estimate  for fiscal 2011 remained at $1.20.ConclusionIncreased penetration in broadband and the momentum gained in online  media and entertainment fueled growth at Akamai and we believe this  trend will continue going forward.We believe that the growing popularity of   High Definition (NYSE:HD)  quality video over the Internet should help drive bandwidth requirements  going forward, thereby enhancing demand for Akamai’s services. We  expect HD video to emerge as a new growth driver for Akamai in the  coming years.Akamai’s broad services offerings and collaboration with large vendors such as Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), Hulu and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) to provide HD quality experience, will help the company capitalize on  the growth in HD content and media in the near term.Akamai is a leader in content delivery networks with over 60% market  share and currently delivers 15.0% to 30.0% of all Internet traffic  worldwide with the largest web content delivery and acceleration  platform in the world.However, the company is facing stiff competition and pricing pressure, as new competitors including AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) and Level 3 Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:LVLT) enter the market, joining traditional players like Limelight Networks Inc. (NASDAQ:LLNW) and Packeteer.We maintain our Neutral recommendation on a long-term basis (6-12  months). Currently, Akamai has a Zacks #3 Rank, which implies a Hold  rating on a short-term basis."
273756,20875,2011-06-07T15:05:52-04:00,,"Over the past few days, I've been getting a lot of emails  from individual Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) shareholders as well as some Wall Street money  managers, asking me what Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iCloud service might be worth to  Akamai, if Akamai is doing the delivery for the new streaming music  service. While I don't know if Akamai will be supporting the new iCloud  service, my initial guess is that it will be. It's already the  exclusive CDN for all of the iTunes content and, back in January, I  reported that Apple had renewed its contract with Akamai for  additional volume for new services.If Akamai is doing the delivery of content for the iCloud service,  that's good for the company, but the value of the delivery business  won't be big since as far as we know, iCloud will only be for music and  not for video. Trying to estimate the exact value of this new service to  Akamai or any other CDN is hard, since we don't have any historical  traffic data to go off of. Also, Apple's contract with Akamai is priced  based on per Mbps sustained, not per GB delivered, and all of Apple's  other traffic determines the final price per Mbps paid. But if we run  some calculations using per GB delivered pricing, we can get a rough  estimate of what the contract could be worth.Apple sells on average about 250M songs per month and that rate is  only growing. If we estimate that users will stream 100% of the number  of songs Apple sells per month, a three and a half minute song transfers  about 1MB, which would be 250,000 GB of transfer a month. If Apple was  paying a penny per GB delivered, the cost to Apple would only be $2,500 a  month.On the flip side, if users stream more music with iCloud than they  buy, which is highly possible, and did 4x what Apple sells each month,  then the delivery value for iCloud content would be worth $10,000 a  month to Akamai. Of course, these numbers don't take into account  additional services Akamai might be providing to Apple to support  iCloud -- for instance, security services or other solutions termed ""value  add"" by the company -- and the 250M stream numbers per month to start  could be low. We just don't know since we don't have historical data to  go from.But the bottom line is that the delivery of audio content from iCloud  is not worth that much to Akamai or any other CDN. The other services  around iCloud could be worth more, and if iCloud ends up supporting video  content down the road, then the value of the delivery business would be  much higher."

259566,23479,2011-03-22T14:45:53-04:00,,"Akamai’s (NASDAQ:AKAM) most important division is its media content delivery, constituting around 34% of its stock value by our estimates. The high value attributed to this division in our analysis comes from expectations of rapid growth in Akamai’s revenue per media customer. As a content delivery company providing web content to its customers, Akamai competes with other players like InterNAP Network Services (NASDAQ:INAP), Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) and Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT).Our price estimate for Akamai stands at $37.11, which is roughly in line with market price.Revenue per Media CustomerWe estimate that revenue per media customer for Akamai dropped between 2008 and 2009 (from about $420,000 to 399,000) before recovering to $445,000 in 2010 as the economy stabilized and the internet media space marched forward. We expect this rapid growth to continue and estimate that Akamai’s revenue per media customer could hit $850,000 by the end of our forecast period. The interactive chart below illustrates how changes to this metric could impact Akamai’s stock value.(Chart created by using Trefis' app)Online Media Consumption OutlookGrowth in online media consumption and a broader shift in video quality to HD are two key drivers that should propel growth in Akamai’s revenues. Video subscription services like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Hulu are growing their user base, a trend that magnifies growth in online media consumption.Facebook is also entering the fray, offering video rental and purchase through its platform. Netflix also recently finalized plans to offer original content through its online streaming service. While this move could disrupt the pay-TV industry, it points to upside for Akamai.Apart from paid services, free sites like YouTube are also seeing tremendous growth. We expect YouTube users to increase from 488 million globally in 2010 to around 800 million over our forecast period. We also expect page views per user on YouTube to grow from 97 per month to  slightly more than 144 per month during this same period.Mobile OpportunityOn top of this, Akamai can also gain from rapid growth in mobile data traffic. While this is still a relatively alien space for the company, Akamai is positioning itself to benefit from this growth through strategic initiatives like its partnership with Ericsson (see Mobile Traffic Explosion Creates Both Opportunity and Risk for Akamai). If Akamai can capitalize on the opportunities sparked by mobile web traffic growth, the company stands to see upside to its revenue per customer metrics.Disclosure: No positions"
299475,23899,2011-10-13T16:41:30-04:00,,"By David StermanWhile the market churns up and down, one stock is making a great upward move. And the rumor mill gets all the credit.Trading desks are abuzz with anticipation that IBM (NYSE:IBM), Verizon (NYSE:VZ) or one of their rivals will soon make a bid for Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM). That's fueled a 25% gain in just 10 days. By my math, this stock has another 25% to 40% upside, even if no deal ever actually takes place. The reasons that big tech firms may be lining up to join forces are the same ones that should make this an appealing investment for you. Simply put, Akamai is in the midst of a temporary slowdown before a resumption of growth. And boy it is profitable ...I most recently took a look at Akamai in early August after its stock slid to just $22. [Read the article here] The stock slumped even further after that -- into the upper teens -- before a recent rebound back to $23.(Click to enlarge)As I discussed two months ago, this is really two businesses. The first simply focuses on web servers that sit right in the closets of major Internet access providers around the world, providing low-margin services such as video streaming. It's a growing business in terms of volume, but price wars mean that year-over-year revenue comparisons are flat.The other part is where companies like IBM and Verizon are likely focusing -- value-added services (VAS). To stay above the commodity-end of the content delivery market, Akamai continues to roll out a broad suite of services, focused on security, traffic measurement, application performance, ad delivery and cloud computing.Akamai's comprehensive suite of offerings is helping the company land new clients at a rapid clip. It brought in 147 new customers in the second quarter, well above the 50 to 100 added in most quarters. And fully half of these new customers signed up for at least one VAS, according to the company. In the past, Akamai would have had to lure customers in with its low-margin web traffic delivery service and upsell the VAS later on.Make no mistake, companies such as Verizon and IBM appreciate that Akamai carries 20% of all global web traffic that is run on content delivery service (CDN) platforms. But what they'd really want is a piece of those higher-margin VASs. They've no doubt noted just how profitable these services are. ""AKAM generated $111 million in cash in Q2 equating to 40% of sales,"" note analysts at D.D. Davidson. Few companies can boast of 40% operating margins.Despite the cash-sapping effect of ongoing stock buybacks, Akamai continues to build its cash levels -- to a recent $1.28 billion (roughly $6.70 a share). And management appears committed to putting much of this cash back into the business to boost growth. For example, Akamai is now making a big push into international markets such as India, Brazil, Singapore, Taiwan, Japan and Hong Kong.Major tech firms are possibly circling around Akamai for a much more prosaic reason. The company already has deep ties with many of the leading website operators. Whether you looked at fantasy football scores on sportsline.com, bought a stock on E*Trade.com (NASDAQ:ETFC), streamed songs on Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iTunes or upgraded your computer's McAfee security software, you're actually dealing with an Akamai server.Right now, investors are wondering why the company's income statement appears to be losing steam. Sales are expected to grow just 12% this year to $1.14 billion, and earnings per share (EPS) should simply be flat compared with last year, at about $1.45. Chalk it up to ""macro-economic headwinds that are dampening Internet traffic growth and causing a slight stall in enterprise adoption of the company's value-added services, analysts at Dougherty & Co say. They noted a similar slowdown in 2008/2009, but state that the 147 new customers added in the second quarter are a harbinger of future business activity. ""Recent partnerships with Ericsson, Rackspace (NYSE:RAX) and Riverbed Technology (NASDAQ:RVBD) among others, also creates a foundation for re-acceleration of growth in 2012,"" they conclude.Dougherty, which carries a $36 price target on the stock, is more optimistic than others. Indeed, the consensus forecasts call for sales to grow just 11% in 2012 to $1.27 billion, while EPS is likely to grow at a similar pace to $1.62. Many analysts have concluded the recent slowdown in growth is here to stay and the company will be hard-pressed to grow faster. Then again, that's what the pack concluded after seeing a few weak quarters in 2008 and early 2009. This bearish view proved short-sighted: the stock eventually rose from around $15 in late 2008 to more than $50 in late 2010.Risks to Consider: Circle your calendar for Oct. 26. That's when Akamai is set to deliver third-quarter earnings. Recent earnings releases have proven disastrous for the stock: it has fallen at least 12% in the subsequent three days after the release on four of the last five occasions. With shares back closer to multi-year lows, and quarterly expectations fairly restrained, the chances of another post-quarter selloff are much less likely. Still, gains from the recent M&A chatter could evaporate if a deal hasn't materialized by then and investors see that Akamai's 2011 results remain a bit pressured. Buyout rumors often fail to materialize, so you need to assess a stock simply on its intrinsic value. On that basis, shares of Akamai appear too cheap, suffering from near-term headwinds, and they fail to reflect the long-term opportunity. If a buyer emerged, then that would simply be icing on the cake.With shares back down at depressed levels, strategic buyers such as Verizon and IBM may be looking to pounce before the stock makes a meaningful rebound. On a fundamental basis, it's not clear shares deserve back to that late 2010 peak of $50, but a move to the $30 to $35 range, representing 25% to 40% gains from current levels, looks to be in the cards -- with or without a strategic buyer.Disclosure: Neither D.

With the stock down 11% at 42.70 in Wednesday's after-hours trade, we're inclined to jump on that red ball express and go along for the ride.AKAM beat Q4 estimates but also issued Q1 guidance below Street expectations.AKAM saw moderate downside trading in the early after-hours, sitting near negative levels between 47.55 and 46.50. More aggressive selling hit the issue into the mid-session in the wake of the company's weak guidance, dropping the shares from 46.97 to an evening low of 42.25. It settled near 42.90 to 42.35 into the second-half of the night trade. A pre-market open Thursday may have potential in the 43 to 42.50 area. AKAM has recorded more aggressive next-day closing levels following 21 of its last 28 after-hours earnings events. In the near term, the stock is mixed, however, with two narrowing and two wider moves. Looking deeper into performance data, AKAM has reacted to evening reports with declines in 12 quarters, extending downside action the following day nine times, or 75% of the time. The longer-term widening trend in place, combined with some solid performance on the downside, would have us looking at a short play on AKAM Thursday. Shorts may want to target potential entry points in the 44 to 43 area as this range held as a top through the mid-session and early second-half of evening trade. More risk tolerant shorts may want to bring the entry down closer to 43 to 42.70 in anticipation of the stock starting the day closer to these levels and perhaps again dropping back into the mid- to lower-42s.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The stock had run up so quickly and yet the growth in earnings, revenue and free cash flow seemed to be faltering. The company's growth appeared to be decelerating. It hardly warranted such a lofty PE. Its stellar climb was undeserved. I initiated a short position.This week, Akamai fell back to Earth. The company guided down earnings and revenues below consensus estimates. Revenue was forecast between $265 million to $275 million, below even the lowest analyst estimate of $278 million (average consensus at $283 million). EPS forecast was 1 to 3 cents below consensus. Management blamed a return to ""more normal seasonality"" and ""a step down in revenue for Q1 due to normal renewal price adjustments.""So, will this be the new ""more normal"" AKAM we will see in the future, a vision of a sluggish future? A company that lowers its prices to keep its customers? A company at the mercy of the seasons? Investors shot the stock. It was a meteor crashing into the Pacific Ocean, plummeting 15%.During the conference call analysts appeared dumbfounded. They were taken aback by the weak guidance. Look at some of the questions:AKAM has indeed fallen. Investors and analysts may need to get used to AKAM's ""new normal.""

The contribution of the media content segment to Akamai’s overall business value is increasing, with 2010 showing an increasing customer base and a rebound in revenues (See Media Content Delivery Becomes Largest Value Driver for Akamai).Our price estimate for Akamai stands at $37.11 which is in line with market price.Akamai’s stock, which shot upward in 2010, has dropped a healthy share of this gain in 2011, falling from a peak of over $54 to below $37. It is interesting to see Akamai’s stock decline despite strong indications of a rise in digital media. Notably, Akamai’s recent drop puts its market imprice in line with what we believe to be the company’s intrinsic value ($37.11).(Chart created by using Trefis' app)Digital Media RisingIt is far from news that digital media is on the rise as more and more content shifts online. This includes entertainment content like video, audio and gaming as well as business content. Netflix is a prime example of the increasing digitization of entertainment content, as Netflix accounts for as much as 20% of the U.S. web traffic during peak hours – all thanks to the growing popularity of streaming. [1]The popularity of online games and e-commerce are other driving factors. This is a broad trend, with some of the more recent notable moves attributable to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook and News Corp (NASDAQ:NWS).Amazon is offering its Amazon Prime members free access to video streaming content, adding a new layer of demand to this market (see How Amazon Prime Video Streaming Can Compete with Netflix). Even Facebook has made moves to enter this arena. The social networking site is experimenting with Time Warner’s (NYSE:TWX) movies to allow users to rent or purchase content using Facebook Credits (see Credit Facebook for New Time Warner Content Offering).These developments are not just limited to video. News Corp recently announced a digital magazine specifically designed for the iPad, marking an important step in the digitization of traditional paper media (see News Corp Launches Digital Magazine, but Stock Still Depends on “Old Media”).This is all great for Akamai’s business, so what is happening to its stock?Competitive Pressure Weighing on AakamaiWe believe that Akamai’s previous stock price surge was driven more by excitement rather than fundamentals. We’ve previously posed the question – Is Akamai’s stock price justified? Now it seems that investors might be cautiously considering the force of heightened competition on Akamai’s valuation. A recent article noted:Surely, the climb to the top is tough. But holding off competitors is often a bigger challenge. Akamai’s competitors will likely use any and all tactics to grab a larger slice of the content delivery pie and ultimately develop more competitive value-added services as well.

Like it or not, people in the know (a.k.a. ""smart money"") generally have an information advantage. Where it crosses the line to insider trading is the gray area ... but let's be honest, every day in the options market, big outsized bets are made and this type of money is not thrown around on 50/50 coin flips.You do this long enough and you see those spikes in volume (in stock or call options) hours before a merger is announced, or vice-versa, ahead of bad news -- and the truth is pretty apparent. One could argue an entire SEC department should be investigating big option market bets (or stock volume surges ahead of news) to see why people are ""so confident"" in laying down so much money on a future event -- but let's not turn into dreamers.Even along more innocent lines, if you happen to be an investment bank that has hundreds of former employees working inside of the government, you have a massive information advantage over the masses in terms of legislation and future effects on companies. Gordon Gekko said it best:So as a small-time institutional or retail investor (or one not working inside one of our oligarchs/""smart money""), you are at a disadvantage. But this is where I believe technical analysis helps even the playing field.If you see a weak chart in a rampaging bull market, you need to be questioning things. Often. Does it always play out that bad chart = bad news event? No ... but the market is all about probabilities. If you can turn a speculation from 50/50 to 72/28, that's obviously a huge advantage.I bring this up today because of momo favorite Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM). This is the type of market that has run up almost everything, but especially the ""high growth"" momo names. But look at the chart of AKAM:[Click to enlarge]Warning signs all over the place. In a normal market, anything trading below the 50-day moving average would send a yellow flag up, but in a market as historically strong as this one -- up eight out of every 10 days -- a stock trading even below the 20-day has to have you wondering.Akamai was not only below the 20-day but also below the 50-day -- and not just for a few days, but for almost all of December and January (and February, MTD). If you never looked at a chart or practiced technical analysis, you'd just have been frustrated by a sideways stock in a market that melts up continuously. But by adding a very simple technical framework, you would at worst have been extremely cautious going into this earnings report (reducing your position) or, preferably, avoided it entirely.Again, is this approach foolproof? No. Sometimes a stock will surge on earnings despite a bad chart.

[1] The company will also be involved in authentication management for content providers looking to make content available on multiple devices. [2] As Akamai continues to push ahead, we take a look at the broad trends impacting the company's stock value. Akamai competes with other players like InterNAP Network Services (NASDAQ:INAP), Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) and Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT).Our price estimate for Akamai stands at $37.11, roughly in line with market price.Traction of Value Added ServicesAkamai's  value proposition has evolved beyond being the fastest content delivery  network. As competitors grow increasingly capable of fast content  delivery at similar prices, Akamai has positioned itself as a full  services provider, touting its ability to offer multiple value-added  services, such as the delivery of targeted advertising on behalf of its  customers. Value-added services now account for more than 50% of  Akamai's overall revenues and have higher gross margins compared to  basic content delivery.Media ExplosionMedia  content is rising at a significant pace as more video content moves  online and video quality increases (HD video). Key  services stimulating this trend include Netflix, Hulu and YouTube.  Although growing media demand is an opportunity, it is also a source of  gross margin pressure, since one of Akamai's largest costs is the cost  of bandwidth to deliver data.  Akamai passes on some of these costs to  customers in the form of a bandwidth usage-based pricing structure;  however, Akamai's pricing will be under pressure from volume discounts  and competition from other content delivery networks.Price CompetitionAkamai  has historically charged premium prices to its customers for fast and  secure delivery of their web content. However, the company is  becoming increasingly competitive on pricing, particularly on video content, in  an effort to attract more customers and traffic to its network. In  several deals, it has even outbid its competitors on price. This is  likely to win more customers for Akamai but may put pressure on margins.Mobile Web & Cloud ComputingMobile  internet traffic is likely to grow at a much faster pace compared to  traditional wire-line web traffic. Some of the steps taken in this direction by Akamai  include its acquisition of Velocitude and partnership with Ericsson.  However, it still remains a relatively alien space for Akamai. In addition to this, Akamai will look to take advantage of the trend towards cloud computing among enterprises.Notes:Disclosure: No position"
241171,23479,2010-12-10T11:41:46-05:00,,"Akamai’s  (NASDAQ:AKAM) real-time ad targeting solution could well be an  important growth driver in the future for the company given the growing  importance of behavioral targeting technology in the context of web  advertisement. Companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) currently use similar technologies to identify user  behavior and then offer suggestions or products that might interest  users.Most other web advertising primarily relies on context-based  advertising models. This is similar to what has been done for ages on  platforms like TV and print media. However the issue with contextual  advertising is that web publishers often sell out ad slots on their  popular pages while a majority of their site remains unused.Akamai’s real-time ad targeting service is a behavioral targeting  technique, which helps web publishers identify consumer’s interests and  intent by analyzing his or her actions across several websites. This is  an advantage over contextual advertising as it can help web publishers  better target consumers and monetize their under-sold web pages.Growth of Behavioral Targeting Based Web AdvertisementAccording to estimates from eMarketer, the behavioral-targeting based  online ad spending in the U.S. increased from about $350 million in  2006 to $1.1 billion in 2009. [1] This is now expected to expand rapidly amounting to $4.4 billion by 2012. [1]  In addition, the share of behavioral-targeting based ad spending in  total online ad spending will increase significantly over the course of  same period.This rapid growth will be driven by certain factors like increased  effectiveness of advanced targeting techniques, consumer sentiment  toward irrelevant ads, growing use of internet and increased  sophistication of online marketers. According to a recent poll conducted  by Deloitte and Harrison Group 66% of the U.S. internet users mentioned  that they would click on additional internet ads if they were better  targeted. [1] This indicates the potential that behavioral-targeting based advertisement model holds for the future.Akamai’s EdgeAkamai’s offering allows web publishers to analyze consumer’s actions quickly and comprehensively without being limited to a partial list of tagged pages for tracking. Unlike other ad targeting solutions, Akamai’s real-time ad targeting solution implementation is code free and pixel free which improves the performance.Additionally, Akamai has advantage of scale and reach. Akamai delivers content for 75% of the internet’s top advertisers, 9 of the 10 top online publisher sites and all of the top 5 ad networks. [1] Since the technique is not contextual and rather focused on behavior of individual user, it will help almost every type of website to sell ad slots. Thus Akamai has potential to increase number of customers as well as revenue per customer across different verticals by offering this service.Do you think that Akamai can compete against Google and Amazon in behavioral targeting technology and rapidly drive customer count and revenue?In these charts you can see how increase in revenue per customer and number of customers for e-commerce vertical, which is most important division for Akamai, can lift its price estimate.

Akamai makes  money delivering web content for its customers and by providing value  added service like dynamic site acceleration and advertising decision  solutions.  In this segment is competes with Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT), AT&T (NYSE:T) and Limelight (NASDAQ:LLNW).The company is witnessing growth across all of its business verticals  with the highest growth observed in the public sector.  While revenues  from the e-commerce and media verticals have registered growth of close  to 20% [1] in the first 9 months of 2010 compared to same period last year, the public sector has registered a growth of over 32% [1]. This has been driven by an increase in revenue per customer as well as increased customer count.While our price estimate of $31.11  is well below the market price, we believe there is upside to our  forecasts in light of the structural tailwinds in its core business.The majority of public sector business for Akamai comes from the US,  and within the US, from the federal sector. Akamai’s customers include  both G2C (government-to-consumer) agencies and military. However there  is still plenty of growth for the company when it comes to the state  sector. In its earnings transcript, Akamai noted that states have not  really invested in improving process efficiency and this could be a  future area of growth for Akamai’s web services [2].Despite growth in the public sector vertical, we estimate that public  sector (government & NGO) constitutes about only 4% to Akamai’s  stock. This is because it has a significantly fewer number of customers  when compared to other verticals like online shopping and media.We estimate that Akamai will have close to 100 public sector  customers by end of  2010, and we expect this figure to rise past 130 by  end of our forecast period.While the uptick in public sector growth is encouraging, we note that  there is limited upside.

We maintain our Trefis forecast price of $28.38.We believe that Akamai’s current market price may not reflect the fundamentals of the company. More specifically, we believe that high market price compared to our price estimate is essentially a result of the market’s high expectation of growth of e-commerce and media verticals.High market expectations from value added servicesWe estimate that Akamai’s online shopping (e-commerce) customer count will grow from little over 1,600 in 2009 to more than 2,300 by the end of our forecast period (estimated using Akamai’s Analyst Day Presentation available on its website). This reflects continuation of rapid growth being observed in the recent past.Moreover, we also expect revenue per online shopping customer to increase to $270,00 by end of our forecast period, compared to $170,000 in 2009.  We believe that Akamai’s success with value-added services in recent quarters, primarily in the online shopping segment (e-commerce), has generated tremendous expectations amongst investors and has played its part in propelling the stock. However, it must be noted with caution that value-added services are a very profitable business for Akamai and such profits will act as a strong incentive for competitors to develop their expertise in this field and challenge Akamai over time.High market expectations from online media The current Akamai price also reflects very high expectations of investors in the media business. With proliferation of online video, Akamai stands to gain from the trend. Growth of HD video will further expand Akamai’s revenue opportunities. However, we have already priced this expected high growth in our estimate and we believe that market expectations are inflated, driven by certain recent successes in the field of online media.These include record data streaming during the recent FIFA World Cup, Netflix’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) online content content acquisition spree, new online subscription and pay per view video platforms on Hulu and Youtube that are currently being tested, expansion of streaming into a host of mobile and stationary devices and emergence of tablet computers.

We expect Akamai’s capital expenditures (capex) to remain at around 23% of gross profits in 2010 and gradually decline to 18% over our forecast period. However, if the capex ratio remains around the current levels in light of mounting competition and margin pressure, there could be 5% downside to AKAM stock based on our estimates, as can be seen in the chart below.We currently have a Trefis price estimate of $31.11 for Akamai’s stock, about 33% below the current market price of $46.63.Competition and growing internet traffic demand higher capexThe two recent deals signed between AT&T- Cotendo and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) - Level 3 signal that competition is heating up for Akamai. In an earlier article, we wrote how AT&T’s presence in the enterprise market can challenge Akamai and that newer entrants such as Limelight Networks and Level 3 are targeting the booming area of online video. We also commented on how Netflix’s multi-year deal with Level 3 can impact Akamai’s pricing and revenue per customer.Akamai is spending heavily on servers primarily in anticipation of higher internet traffic due to increased media content on the internet, an expected rise in HD video leading to greater bandwidth needs and the growth in e-commerce. Though its capex ratio trended down from around 19% in 2006 to around 15% in 2009, it has recently started to rise again on these investmetnts.[1]The average forecast by the Trefis community predicts that Akamai’s capex ratio will decrease from about 24% in 2010 to about 20% by the end of the Trefis forecast period, compared to the Trefis estimate of a decrease from 23% to 18% during the same period.

I find this an interesting turn of events as in the past, Akamai tended not to sue any company until-- in my opinion-- they felt that company was starting to become competitive. Speedera was out in the market for a few years before Akamai sued them and Limelight (NASDAQ:LLNW) was operating for a couple years before Akamai went after them as well.Cotendo has been around for just under two years, but with their recent deal with AT&T (NYSE:T) and some of Cotendo's recent wins, Cotendo has the potential to become a real competitor to Akamai, directly or indirectly via someone like AT&T, over time. If Cotendo was just offering CDN services I don't think Akamai would have really cared, but the fact that Cotendo focuses on DSA and app acceleration, services where there is a lot of high-margin business at stake, I'm not surprised to see the suit.It's also interesting to see that one of the patents in question, 6,820,133, was acquired by Akamai in their acquisition of Netli and some of Cotendo's management team, including their VP of operations current CEO and Co-Founder, worked at Netli and Akamai in the past.With Cotendo being as small as they are, I don't see how they can afford to fight this suit by themselves over a long period of time simply due to the capital it requires. The two companies could very well settle this by Akamai buying Cotendo, which Akamai has a history of doing when it acquired Speedera and tried to buy Limelight during the trial. It's also possible that AT&T could step in and acquire Cotendo and then fight the Akamai suit, since AT&T would have the resources to do so. I contacted AT&T to see if they wanted to speak about the suit but they had ""no comment"" and I don't have any public response from Cotendo that I can share at this time.If Akamai acquired Cotendo, they would really lock down the app acceleration and DSA market by a very wide margin. But if AT&T is serious about getting into this space, you would think they would keep that from happening. This is going to be an interesting one to watch.

The  company’s stock price has increased significantly over the past nine months  given the success of its value-added services and overall solid revenue  growth.So how can Akamai justify its current market price on valuation? To  justify its stock price, Akamai must position itself to triple revenue  per customer figures for media and e-commerce (online shopping)  verticals by the end of our forecast period.Can Revenue per Customer for Prime Growth Engines Really Triple?Akamai’s prime growth engines, media and e-commerce together  constitute more than 60% of the company’s value by our estimates. Given  the explosion of media content over the internet and success of Akamai’s  value-added services, it is reasonable to assume that investors are  primarily placing their bets on these two categories. Assuming Akamai  continues to grab customers at our forecasted rate, the company would  need to triple revenue per customer for media and online shopping verticals by the end of our forecast period to lift our valuation to its current $48 stock price.Can this really happen? Below we explore this scenario.Drag the trend-lines in the charts below to see the affect of various revenue per customer scenarios on Akamai’s stock value.Explosive Web Traffic Growth – Supportive ArgumentCisco estimates that internet traffic will increase more than  four-fold by 2014, amounting to 64 exabytes per month. [1] The growth is likely to be fueled by increasing affordability of devices  like computers, proliferation of smartphones & tablets  that promote data usage as well as growth in cloud computing.According to Internet World Stats, the number  of global internet users grew by 13% in 2009 amounting to 1.7 billion.  [2] Additionally it is estimated that  the number of online videos viewed in 2009 increased by a whopping 120%  amounting to 300 billion. [3]One can argue that given the expected four-fold rise in web traffic from 2009 to 2014, it may not be totally unreasonable to think that Akamai could increase its revenue per customer by 3-fold even if one accounts for some pricing declines as a result of competition.But we have a few reservations regarding this scenario.Our ConcernsCan Akamai grab a steady share of the increasing web traffic or might this be directed somewhere else? We anticipate that Akamai’s revenue rise will not grow linearly alongside the expected increase in internet traffic. Akamai has diversified from being just a pure-play contend delivery network (CDN) vendor to a company that earns half its revenues from value-added services.If CDN revenues triple based on explosion in web traffic, can we expect value added services to keep pace?  Will they be able to increase linearly with web traffic too?

After seeing 3PAR (NYSE: PAR) jump from $10 to $30 a share and ArcSight (Nasdaq: ARST) zoom ahead from $25 to $43 in the last month, they are pushing up shares of any name they think might be the recipient of the next sweet buyout offer. And now investors have set their sights on Akamai Technologies (Nasdaq: AKAM), pushing its shares up from below $40 in late July to a recent $51. Trouble is, shares were likely overvalued before that surge began, and are now very overvalued when measured against the fundamentals. If a suitor doesn't emerge -- and it's not clear that one will -- then shares could give back all of the recent gains.  A CDN pioneer Akamai helps major web sites provide very fast response times to users located anywhere in the world. If you're downloading a popular video in Madrid, there's a decent chance that a local Akamai server is serving up that file, eliminating the need to transmit that content over long distances while the user sits and waits. And in recent years, the company has developed other software tools to help customers stay on the cutting edge with its Content Delivery Network (CDN).  As consumers looked to consume more media and entertainment online, demand for Akamai's services exploded, helping sales rise at an average of more than +30% per year from 2004 to 2008. But success -- and an increasingly large industry opportunity -- has a way of attracting new competition. And that began happening in recent years, which helps explain why growth cooled to less than +10% in 2009. Akamai's shares, which hit $50 in early 2007, fell below $15 in late 2008 as investors realized that the CDN industry had become crowded and very cost-competitive.   A 2010 and 2011 rebound Akamai is once again on the upswing as renewed industry growth, along with a push into ancillary services, is offsetting a steady decrease in CDN pricing. (These companies get paid monthly fees for providing CDN services, and contracts are usually renewed at ever-lower prices). The favorable industry trends are likely to push Akamai's sales up nearly +20% this year and another +15% in 2011.  But more headwinds loom. Companies such as Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN) are vowing to make a bigger push into the CDN business, and major telecom operators such as AT&T (NYSE: T) also realize that their networks are ideally suited to carry higher volumes of CDN traffic. As a rule of thumb in this industry, increased competition invariably leads to faster CDN pricing declines.  None of this suggests that Akamai is in real trouble. Demand for CDN services will keep growing, the company has a very strong balance sheet, and many of its customers are likely locked in for the long haul. But this is not a great long-term story from a revenue growth perspective, thanks to those ever-present price decreases.  Yet shares have zoomed ahead to levels that give the impression that Akamai is a young fast-growing upstart. Shares trade for more than 30 times next year's projected profits and close to 20 times EBITDA, on an enterprise value basis. The shares are currently trading just below $51 -- analysts at Maxim Group think fair value is closer to $35. Citigroup's analysts are slightly more bullish, assuming a $42 target price, noting that shares deserve to trade no higher than at 25 times next year's profits. Shares of Akamai took a big hit in 2008 as investors realized that this is becoming an increasingly crowded business with real price pressures, so potential buyers are unlikely to pay much of a premium after the recent run-up. It's not even clear that any potential acquirer could justify buying the company now and make the deal work from an EPS growth perspective. For that matter, who knows if Akamai is in play at all?   If you've been holding Akamai in your portfolio, this looks like a great time to exit that position. If no buyer emerges for the company in coming weeks and months, then shares are likely to move back toward those analyst price targets. Moreover, shares are so richly valued that they have created an excellent opportunity for shorts, which may see this stock move back below $40 as a deal fails to materialize. The main risk to the short thesis is an actual buyout, which again, appears unlikely.Original post"

Our analysis follows below.E-commerce Customer GrowthWe currently forecast that the  total number of Akamai’s online shopping customers will increase  from about 1600 in 2009 to about 2300 by the end of our forecast period.  This implies an average annual growth rate of close to 5.5%.However, Akamai’s share value could rise by an additional 5% if   e-commerce customer signups continue at their current rapid rate for a   few more years.You can modify the trend-line in the chart below to create your own  e-commerce customer estimate and see see how it impacts Akamai’s stock  price.Value-Added Services Akamai offers a number of value-added services for e-commerce  websites.

In this case AKAM fell about 9% early in after hours trading last night but rallied later in the evening to fall 5%.Looking at the chart, we see support right around where it closed the AH session at just under $42.

The firms Q2 revenue estimate is $245M, which is slightly above consensus. Wedbush's fully taxed pro foma EPS estimate is 34c in-line with consensus; however, the firm believes that upside to their fully taxed pro foma EPS and revenue estimate is likely. Management guided Q2 fully taxed pro forma EPS to 32c-34c on revenue of $236M-$246M. In the Media and Entertainment vertical, traffic growth is expected to offset price declines, which could drive upside to Wedbush's estimates. Based on Wedbush's June page view analysis, Q2 page views increased approximately 6% quarter-over-quarter, which is above their QoQ Commerce revenue growth estimate of approximately 4%.

(NASDAQ:AKAM) is helping online  social gaming companies such as PopCap Games, Perfect World and Mindjolt  to expand their scale and global reach and manage daily traffic around  releases and updates of new and existing games smoothly.   Online social gaming has gained tremendous popularity recently, thanks  to the massive success of social networking sites such as Facebook and  real-time simulation games. According to a survey carried out by  emerketer research, approximately 40 million internet users aged 18 to  64 played are found to be hooked to social games in the month of  February, 2010.   Social gaming market is well positioned for continued growth, primarily  due to its casual, social and interactive environment compared with the  more conventional platforms. Most of the online social gaming companies  are offering games on different mobile devices such as cell phones,  smartphones, iPod, iPhone and iPad and many more.   For a successful transition to this new format, the traditional gaming  companies’ have a wide array of requirements, which primarily focus on  availability, performance and support.  Akamai is successfully providing  optimal solutions to these companies. Therefore, partnership with  Akamai will be beneficial for these growing online gaming companies.   Being a multi-platform provider of casual video games, PopCap Games  faces considerable traffic regularly. PopCap’s  most successful game  Bejeweled has sold more than 50 million units and its monthly traffic  spiked up from 250 terabytes to 1.1 petabytes since the launch of the  game in Facebook. PopCap admitted that it relies heavily on Akamai  solutions to improve performance and successful download of their games.     With more than 20 million active members and more than 1,300 games  playable on different social networking sites, Mindjolt offers services  to worldwide developers and considers Akamai’s solutions to be extremely  helpful in reaching a large number of users.   Similarly, Perfect World Entertainment partnered with Akamai to launch  its flagship game Perfect World International in September 2008, and  used HTTP download solution for game delivery and images, streaming  solutions for game trailer delivery and online advertising. The company  also implemented Akamai’s Rich Media Accelerator to support its website  and online forums.   Akamai’s recent acquisition of Velocitude, a mobile services platform  that uses cloud computing, adds a new dimension to its plethora of  online solutions.   By using Velocitude’s mobile services platform, Akamai aims to improve  the quality of mobile content and applications, and provide superior  high definition (NYSE:HD) video and secure e-commerce to mobile devices.   Akamai faces stiff competition from large companies like Level 3  Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:LVLT) and Limelight Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:LLNW).   We have a neutral recommendation on the stock."

This represents nearly 40 million users based on eMarketer’s  estimates of 160 million total Internet users in the U.S.Social media networks such as Facebook and MySpace, which provides a  platform for people across the world to socialize, are gaining  tremendous popularity. Taking advantage of this shift, a number of  gaming companies are  developing social online games. Companies such as  Zygna (which offers popular games like Mafia Wars and Farmville on  Facebook) are leveraging social media platforms by offering a casual  environment for gaming.Online Gaming Developers Benefit from Akamai’s networkSeveral social gaming companies use Akamai’s network to deliver their  content. One is Mindjolt, a rapidly growing company in the social  gaming space that aims to become a leading platform for independent  developers to reach a wide audience. The company already offers more  than 1,300 games on social networks like Facebook, Mindjolt.com and  Myspace. Mindjolt uses Akamai’s network to reach its end users and to  maintain high performance and scalability.Similarly, PopCap and Perfect World Entertainment rely on Akamai’s  network to deliver their gaming content to users. Akamai handles close  to 1.1 petabytes of monthly traffic for PopCap, whose traffic has more  than quadrupled since the launch of its “Bejeweled” game on Facebook.Akamai Can Boost Software & Gaming Content Delivery  Revenues by Leveraging Growing Social Online Gaming SpaceWe predict that Akamai’s ability to handle massive online traffic  will help it leverage growing demand for social online gaming, gain new  customers, and improve its revenue per customer. We forecast that  Akamai’s  software and gaming client list will grow at an annualized rate of  3.5%, from just under 550 in 2009 to about 700 by the end of theTrefis  forecast period. An additional 2% increase in this growth would create  nearly 2% of upside to our price estimate of $27.37 for Akamai’s stock.In addition, we expect sustained growth in Akamai’s revenue  per software and gaming customer. We expect this figure to reach  $486,000 by the end of our forecast period, up from $320,000 today.

Terms of the deal were not announced but I would not  be surprised if Velocitude's business was valued at under $15M.While many seem quick to want to compare Akamai's acquisition of  Velocitude to Limelight's (NASDAQ:LLNW) acquisition of Kiptronic last year, they are two  completely different solutions. Kiptronic's platform is focused on  helping content owners in the media and entertainment vertical monetize  their video content by using, amongst other things, campaign managers and  ad servers. Velocitude's platform is focused on helping content owners  in the retail, government and enterprise sectors display and deliver  mobile video for commerce and marketing purposes, and is not used today  for delivering ads to mobile devices.Akamai clearly uses the word enterprise in the release, three times  in fact, and never once uses the phrase media and entertainment. So why  some posts are mentioning Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in their coverage of this news makes  no sense. If Akamai wins Netflix's business for delivering video to the  iPhone when it is released later this summer, that won't  be as a result of the Velocitude acquisition. One has nothing to do with  the other.Akamai's acquisition of Velocitude really comes as no surprise, since  the company continues to forge ahead in the enterprise space, developing  and deploying more and more services specifically targeted for  enterprise and retail customers. Akamai's focus has been, and will  continue to be, on the enterprise vertical. While they aren't giving  up on the media and entertainment space, or ceding ground in that market  just yet, enterprise services are clearly how Akamai plans to grow the  company moving forward. This is quite different from Limelight's focus,  which while still targeting customers in the enterprise and retail  verticals with a limited product set, their main focus is still  solutions for content owners in the media and entertainment verticals.I don't know what the size of the enterprise mobile video space is, or  what the market opportunity is projected to be, but I would expect that  we'll see Akamai give out some details on this segment of the market  sometime after their integration of Velocitude's platform is complete.Disclosure: No positions"

The company, which specializes in technology relating to streaming video but generally provides services that accelerate delivery of content and applications over the Internet, crushed earnings last week and shares surged as a result.The future seems pretty bright for AKAM, as HD video adoption has taken hold more rapidly than expected and streaming video is finally going mainstream. The company has also yet to see much benefit from foreign markets, which is likely to change in the coming quarters. I was particularly impressed by how well shares held up on Friday after gapping up hugely on Thursday.Friday’s relative strength tells us that institutions truly believe in the story behind AKAM and likely intend to hold onto the share they picked up on Thursday. (NOTE: Just as a reminder. Institutions make up around 75% of daily trading volume, so when they’re buying, you’re buying, because they’re the ones who are actually moving the market higher.)Still, due to the fact that the market is getting a little shaky, combined with AKAM’s huge up week, I would recommend waiting for a handle to develop on the two-year base you see above. The current buy-point sits at $41 on the nose ($0.10 above the high of the base).If AKAM happens to push right through $41 without developing any kind of handle, then I would wait for shares to come back and re-test the breakout. So, either way, the initial buy-point is $41. The variable here is whether shares (a) immediately begin forming a handle (which should last at least a couple weeks), allowing us to buy on a breakout through $41, or (b) breakout immediately, allowing us to open up a position on a pullback to $41. As you can see, there’s not much resistance all the way up into the $50’s, so this could potentially be a nice trade.Disclosure: No positions"
186639,20568,2010-02-04T10:05:40-05:00,,"Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) beat the Zacks Consensus expectation of $233.0 million in revenue and 35 cents in adjusted (normalized) earnings for the fourth quarter of 2009. The company reported $238.3 million in revenue and 46 cents a share in earnings.   Despite a difficult consumer spending environment, growth was observed in the in-digital media and e-commerce space, driven by holiday traffic and traction from high-margin value-added solutions, particularly, application performance solutions. Further, Akamai witnessed strength in software distribution and cloud computing initiatives and had a decent advertising revenue growth in the quarter.  Revenue  The Dec quarter was the largest revenue quarter in the company’s history and Akamai returned to double-digit top line growth in the quarter. Revenue of $238.3 million grew 15.4% from the previous quarter and 12.1% from the year-ago period. Revenue exceeded the company’s own guidance.   Revenue increased due to growth in all the verticals, particularly the e-commerce business which increased 21%, while revenue from the media and entertainment vertical grew 4% year over year, driven by healthy volume growth during the quarter. The high tech vertical also performed well, growing 13% on a year-over-year basis due to a higher volume of software downloads, as well as increased traction from application performance solutions. The public sector vertical grew 31% year over year in the quarter.   Revenue outside North America grew 3% from the prior-year quarter, while International revenue grew 26% year over year. Foreign exchange had a positive impact on the quarterly results.Revenue grew as an increased number of customers signed up for Akamai’s Web traffic services. New contract signings in the quarter were very encouraging and stood at over 200 this quarter. Customer churn was about 4.0% for the fourth quarter, resulting in 91 net new customers in the quarter to a record 3,122, a 9% increase year-over-year. ARPU (average per revenue per user) was $25,600 for the quarter, up 13% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year.  Operating Performance  Higher year-over-year revenue was offset by higher operating expenses in the quarter. Operating expenses increased 16.4% sequentially and 14.9% year over year in the quarter.   Excluding one-time charges, non-GAAP (normalized) earnings per share of 46 cents increased 21% from 38 cents in the previous quarter and 4.5% from 36 cents in the year-ago quarter. Earnings were 3 cents above the high-end of the guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was a record $111.6 million, up 11% from the same period last year and up 16% from the prior quarter.   Strong top-line growth enabled the company to maintain its cash gross margins of 82.0% for the tenth consecutive quarter.   Akamai’s balance sheet remained strong with $1.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, having generated $124.9 million cash from operations in the quarter, a record. Akamai repurchased 650,000 shares for $15 million in the quarter.   Akamai is facing growing competition and pricing pressure, as new competitors including AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) and Level 3 Communications (NASDAQ:LVLT) enter the market joining traditional players like Limelight Network (NASDAQ:LLNW).  Guidance and Estimates  Despite good fourth-quarter results, shares tumbled 4.87% after hours, primarily because of the company’s cautious revenue guidance for the upcoming quarter. First quarter revenue is expected in the $224.0 million to $233.0 million range, which represents a year-over-year growth of 6% to 11%, but a 4% decline from the fourth quarter at the midpoint. Currency headwinds are expected to have a $2 million negative impact on the first quarter revenue on a sequential basis. Management does not expect to deliver continued double digit top-line growth in 2010.   Normalized earnings per share are expected in the range of 30 cents to 32 cents in the quarter. GAAP gross margins are expected to decline by about a point from the fourth quarter level while cash gross margin is expected to remain flat. Adjusted EBITDA margins are expected to decline by about a point due to lower sequential revenues.   The current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for 28 cents per share in earnings for the first quarter. Recent revisions to the first quarter estimate have been in both directions. Of the 23 analysts covering the stock, 1 has raised while 2 have lowered their estimates in the last 30 days.   With respect to earnings surprises, Akamai recorded an average earnings surprise of 10.86% in the last four quarters (meaning that it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.86% over the year-ago period). The last quarter (third quarter 2009) is of special mention as the company recorded a 10.7% in earnings surprise.   But, in our view Akamai is not expected to repeat its history of positive surprises in the upcoming quarter. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first quarter 2010 is 28 cents with a negative surprise possibility of about 7.14%.   For full year 2010, the earnings estimate is $1.19 with a 10.92% potential negative downside. This is a 28.7% decline from $1.67 per share in earnings reported in 2009. We believe that the weak revenue guidance will call for further negative revisions over the next 30 days, resulting in downward price movement.   We have a Neutral recommendation on the stock."

Oppenheimer expects Akamai to report a relatively solid quarter with revenues of $229.2M, up 9% year-over-year, and normalized EPS of 30c, down 2% YoY. The firm believes that accelerating online video traffic trends coupled with a stabilizing pricing environment should boost results. Oppenheimer believes Akamai is positioned well longer-term given its differentiated value-added services and strong balance sheet.

The Internet acceleration company is trading at $43.86, just off the day's high of $44.08, the highest price for AKAM since July 2007. Shares have gained close to 200 percent from their 52-week low of July 2009.Not surprisingly, the options volume is in the calls, which are outpacing puts today by 4 to 1. The big trade of the day involved the August 43 and 46 calls.A trader bought 4,635 of the August 43 calls for $3.96 and, at the same time, sold an equal number of August 46 calls for $2.54.The volume was less than open interest at that lower strike, but this still looks like a bullish call spread with both positions newly opened. If that is the case, then the net debit was $1.42, which is the maximum risk if AKAM is below that $43 price at expiration. The spread can make a maximum gain of $1.58 if shares are above $46.This type of vertical spread is a relatively low-risk way of betting on further gains in the stock and may even be used as a stock replacement strategy. In other words, the trader is getting rid of long stock with the associated risk and replacing the upside exposure with this spread. Disclosure: No positions"

Yes, Akamai and all of the other CDNs are seeing more content owners use HD quality video, but it's not yet happening in large volumes or at mass scale to impact revenue.Based on a recent StreamingMedia.com survey we conducted in September and October, we asked content owners what bitrates they were encoding their content in. Of the 812 content owners who responded only 11.4% said they were encoding video for at least 2Mbps or more. Compare that to the same survey in 2008 when 8.9% of over 1,000 content owners said they were encoding over 2Mbps. That's not a lot of growth.Some might say that the M&E vertical probably has better adoption of HD video than, say, the enterprise or advertising market and they'd be right. But of the 812 content owners who took our survey, nearly 45% of them classified themselves as being in the M&E vertical. HD quality video will drive additional revenue and growth for the CDNs, but it won't be in the next few quarters.Disclosure: no positions"

Some of these deficiencies include:What seems broad to me is Akamai's assertion that all other systems reserve physical resources ahead of time. They are implying that no events based webcasting system on the market today can generate a live stream, or provision any audio resources on the fly, or what they call ""just-in-time"", when requested.The patent also mentions multiple times that the Akamai patent ""provides significant flexibility and reduced costs as compared to prior systems"", which sounds like marketing speak to me. They also say that, ""In addition, the system is able to handle large numbers of simultaneous events and massive total audience sizes."" Again, lots of marketing words, but no definition of what ""large numbers"", ""massive"" or how many ""simultaneous"" streams they are talking about.Clearly this patent is aimed at the business side of webcasting since typically, those are the events that have registration databases involved and audio conferencing bridges. Most of your one-off media and entertainment events, sports and concerts, don't involve that kind of functionality.I'm very curious to see if Akamai does anything with this patent and if they try to go out to the market to enforce it in any way. That may not be their intention, or they may view it as something they want to try and enforce, we just don't know. Since Akamai has a company policy of not commenting on anything patent related, I didn't ask them what they plan to do with it.Disclosure: No positions"

The short ratio, which is short interest for the month divided by average daily volume and represents the number of days it would take to cover, is 4.8%. This indicates it would take several days to buy back 25.19 million shares.The company has a good balance sheet, with positive cash flow and very little debt. The PE ratio is 12.77% with analyst’s estimates of 12% growth per annum over the next five years. Competition in the technology sector makes long term growth estimates less reliable then in most sectors but Akamai has a solid balance sheet and good prospects going forward.The stock has held up well since reporting earnings last week despite a faltering Nasdaq Composite Index and looks well positioned, fundamentally, for a ""squeeze.” The premise holds up on the technical side, as well, with price poised to breakout out of a classic “cup and handle” pattern on the weekly chart and through a long term downtrend line. The RSI is over 60 and the MacD is positive along with money flow. The 21 week and 43 week (200 dma) moving averages are in confluence which sometimes precedes a strong move. (See chart.)The one negative is the effect on “all boats” in the tidal movement of the overall market. The S&P 500 is in a “battle zone”  and if that tide falls then it is likely AKAM will, too.

And it looks like e-commerce and media are seeing better-than-expected demand from a year ago. The year-ago quarter is a low bar to hurdle, but it’s something.Akamai said that it expects fourth quarter to be $230 million to $235 million, up 8 percent to 11 percent from a year ago (statement). Earnings will be 42 cents to 43 cents a share excluding charges. The company previously projected fourth quarter revenue of $217 million to $224 million with earnings of 39 cents a share to 41 cents a share.Wall Street was expecting earnings of 40 cents a share on revenue of $221 million.

Guidance for Q3 EPS is 33c-36c on $195M-$203M in revenue. As a result of the lower guidance and company's aggressive pricing strategy, many firms had downgraded their ratings back on July 30. Kaufman Bros. Q3 estimates of $195.1M in revenue, $87.3M in EBITDA and 34c in EPS are below consensus and towards the lower-end of management's guidance. With approximately 28% of revenue being derived internationally, Kaufman believes the company could potentially see a $2.8M sequential benefit from a weakening dollar this quarter. Still, Kaufman believes Akamai's current repricing efforts are just beginning, will take several quarters to complete, and could provide unexpected volatility in results over the next few quarters. The recent rally in the shares is the combination of unfounded rumors that the company could be acquired by Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), which Kaufman finds unlikely, as well as the combination of relatively cheap valuation and lackluster estimates. Kaufman recommends investors remain on the sidelines heading into earnings. Citigroup's fundamental call for Q3 is negative as they are expecting a continued deceleration in Akamai’s revenue growth.

Akamai CFO JD Sherman said, ""The first two months of Q4 tracked above our expectations... We have been seeing stronger volume growth this quarter as compared to the same quarter last year in our commerce and media verticals, and we anticipate this trend will continue through the end of the year."" Shares of Akamai improved Monday after both Wedbush Morgan and Citigroup upgraded the shares to an Outperform rating on a sustainable margin structure over the next 12-24 months, and confidence in the company's 2010 and longer-term outlook. With the help of strong traffic levels in Q4 and an forex tailwind, Goldman expects the company to come at the high end of its guidance. The firms estimates are $234M and 44c. Goldman has modeled for a stable Q4 cash gross margin at 81.5%. The firms Q4 revenue estimate assumes 35 net new customers vs. 52 in September, and ARPC up 6% year-over-year to about $25,461. Goldman's Q4 revenue estimate assumes $11M of revenue from Acerno, acquired on November 3, 2008. Given the raised Q4 guidance and expectation for near normal seasonality, Goldman believes that competitive pressures in Akamai’s media and high tech verticals have subsided somewhat. Telco activity seems to have slowed for now. Goldman's industry conversations suggest that many telcos are keeping a close eye on the CDN market but that they may not consider it a top priority for entry in 2010. Goldman is modeling Q1 revenue and EPS of $231M and 27c, vs. consensus of $227.84M and 27c. Looking further out, Goldman says that a major tenet of their sell thesis is the belief that the industry remains vulnerable to pricing pressure longer term given limited differentiation and switching costs on core content delivery. This would triangulate to a low double-digit revenue growth and flat operating margins in 2010 for Akamai."

Results were weak with revenue below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $211.0 million while non-GAAP EPS exceeding the optimistic Zacks Estimate of $0.33.  The company reported revenue of $204.6 million, down 2.7% from the previous quarter but up 5.5% from the year-ago period. This was below the company’s guided range of $207.0 million to $213.0 million. Revenue fell due to aggressive pricing and seasonality in the Advertising business and the Media & Entertainment vertical.  Despite a difficult consumer spending environment, growth was observed in the e-commerce space, driven by traction from high-margin value-added solutions, particularly application performance solutions and dynamic site solutions.  Higher year-over-year revenue base was offset by higher operating expenses in the quarter. Excluding one-time charges, non-GAAP (normalized) EPS was $0.40, versus $0.43 in the previous quarter and $0.41 in the year-ago quarter. Normalized EPS came in at the low-end of the company’s guided range of $0.40 to $0.42.  Despite weak top line growth, the company maintained its cash gross margins of 81.0% for the eighth consecutive quarter. New contract signings in the quarter were very encouraging, particularly with the newer value-added solutions. Akamai’s gross adds – brand-new customers, were about 197 this quarter, with over half of the dollar value of these signing coming from value-added solutions. Customer churn was above 5.0% for the second quarter slightly higher than the 3% to 4% rate in the last few quarters.  Following disappointing second quarter results, Akamai forecasted dismal third quarter guidance. It expects sequential decline in third quarter sales that are substantially below Zacks estimates of $214.0 million. Third quarter revenue is expected in the $195.0 million to $203.0 million range, which represents 1.0% year-over-year growth but a 3% decline from the previous quarter – at the midpoint. Currency headwinds are expected to be moderate with a small positive sequential impact on revenue. Normalized earnings per share are expected in the range of $0.33 to $0.36, in line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.36.Although we believe the company is well-positioned in the longer term with increased bandwidth requirement, new offerings and value added services, slowing growth in media due to the lack of improved broadband deployment, macroeconomic factors, and growing competition will lead to declining top-line growth in 2009.Akamai’s balance sheet remained strong with $926.8 million in cash and marketable securities having generated record $105.2 million cash from operations in the quarter.

164012,21168,2009-09-30T06:14:21-04:00,,"Call it a trend – and not just a virtual one. Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) is the latest tech firm to join the effort to push desktop virtualization into the mainstream with the salient message of swift return on investment (ROI) and lower total costs for PC desktop delivery.  Akamai joins HP (NYSE:HPQ), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), VMware (NYSE:VMW), as well as Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS), Desktone and a host of others in the quest to advance the cause of desktop virtualization (aka VDI) in a sour economy. Better known for optimizing delivery of web content, video, dynamic transactions and enterprise applications online, Akamai just introduced a managed Internet service that optimizes the delivery of virtualized client applications and PC desktops.  Akamai isn’t starting from scratch. The company is leveraging core technology from its IP Application Accelerator solution to offer a new service that promises cost-efficiency, scalability and the global reach to deliver applications over virtual desktop infrastructure products offered by Citrix, Microsoft and VMware.   “We see the desktop virtualization market poised for significant growth and believe that our unique managed services model allows us to work with enterprises on large, global deployments of their virtual desktop infrastructure,” says Willie Tejada, vice president of Akamai’s Application and Site Acceleration group, in a release.  Since Akamai launched its IP Application Accelerator, Tejada reports good traction beyond browser-based applications. Now, he’s betting Akamai’s new customized offering will make room for the company to focus even more on virtualization. He’s also betting enterprise customers will appreciate the new pricing model. With IP Application Accelerator targeted for VDI, Akamai is rolling out concurrent user-based pricing and customized integrations through professional services to virtual desktops.  Significant growth  Tejada is right about one thing: the expected and significant growth of virtual desktop connected devices. Gartner predicts this sector will grow to about 66 million by the end of 2014. That translates to 15 percent of all traditional professional desktop PCs. With these numbers on hand, it’s clear that enterprises are rapidly adopting virtualization as a key component of cost-containment efforts.  I think we're facing an inflection point for desktop virtualization, fueled by the pending Windows 7 release, pent-up refresh demand on PCs generally, and the need for better security and compliance on desktops. Add to that economic drivers of reducing client support labor costs, energy use, and the need to upgrade hardware, and Gartner's numbers look conservative.  Device makers are hastening the move to VDI with thin clients (both PCs and notebooks) that add all the experience of the full PC but in the size of a ham sandwich and for only a few hundred dollars. Hold the mayo!  But there are yet challenges to guaranteeing the performance and scale of VDI across wide area networks. Akamai points out three in particular. First is the user’s proximity from a centralized virtualization environment. It has a direct impact on performance and availability. Second, virtual protocols consume large amounts of bandwidth. Third, there is traditionally a high cost, as well as uptime issues, associated with private-WAN connections in emerging territories where outsourcing and off-shoring are commonplace.Akamai is not only promising its service will overcome all those challenges, it’s also suggesting that working with its solution on the virtualization front may eliminate the need to build out or upgrade costly private networks limited by a preset reach and scale. How does Akamai do this? By allowing for highly scalable and secure virtual desktop deployments to anyone, anywhere, across an Internet-based platform spanning 70 countries.According to Akamai, its technology is designed to eliminate latency introduced by Internet routing, packet loss, and constrained throughput. The company also says that performance improvements can be realized through several techniques including dynamic mapping, route optimization, packet redundancy algorithms, and transport protocol optimization.As for Akamai’s IP Application Accelerator targeted for VDI, we’ll have to wait and see the case studies of customers relying on the new solution, but the promises are, well, promising. If you have a lot of PCs in calls centers or managing a lot of remote locations, give VDI a look. It's time has come from a technology, network performance, cost and long-term economics perspective.Disclosure: Akamai is a sponsor of BriefingsDirect podcasts."

Having traded above the 50 day MA for March through mid June, AKAM has since had two brief sorties below the 200DMA. The first drop to $15.86 in late July was due to Q2 miss and lowered guidance. Although the 50 dMA recently closed below the 200 dMA, it is turning up and the P&F remains in the uptrend which began a year ago. Technically AKAM has been performing strongly for the last two months, despite an onslaught of the negative articles from Dan Rayburn, the Akamai bear.At Friday's close of $20.31 AKAM is trading at a forward 2009 P/E of 12.77. That is low for a company with Akamai's growth potential. However, despite growing eps 72% per annum and revenue 37% for the last five years analysts see competition from Limelight (LLNW) and other CDNs slowing Akamai's growth considerably. Analysts forecast less than 12% growth in earnings per annum for the next five years, giving AKAM a PEG of 1.1.Akamai appears finally balanced over the short term. Good earnings and guidance should see prices in the mid twenties while a miss and lowered guidance would naturally see a tumble and indicate time to look for a better investment.

Four of ‘em Thursday for Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM), which last night missed Q2 estimates and offered a disappointing forecast.Katherine Egbert, Jefferies & Co.: Downgrades the stock from “Buy” to “Hold,” and cuts her price target from $25 to $20. Egbert writes Akamai has lost some of its luster of “infallibility” by increasingly chasing price discounts to hold onto business. That’s despite growth in high-def video serving, she observes. “It’s unclear where the price bottom is, and the last time this type of pricing reset occurred, the stock did not recover.” Akamai’s competitors among telecom carriers have a cost advantage in infrastructure over Akamai, she muses, even if they don’t have the company’s brand name and experience in CDN.Jonathan Rukhayver, ThinkEquity: Lowers his rating to “Accumulate” from “Buy” and lowers his price target to $25 from $20. The “near-term fundamentals remain uncertain” writes Rukhayver, given that Akamai last night said it had trouble gaining visibility into its customers rate of adoption of its services in the current economic downturn. Longer-term, Rukhayver belives the “content delivery network” market that Akamai dominates is a good one to be in.Richard Fetyko, Merriman, Curhan, Ford: Cut his rating from “Buy” to “Neutral,” writing that re-pricing of CDN contracts in the industry is likely to continue for another three quarters, partially offset by some pickup in volume of business. Where and when does “it get interesting again” for the stock? Fetyko opines either at $15 per share, or some time in the first half of next year. “From a fundamental perspective, we would revisit Akamai when we get a sense that re-pricing of contracts is wrapping up,” writes Fetyko, “and that Akamai’s new contracts are close to competitors’ prices and there is not another leg down; and/or when volume growth hits an acceleration inflection.”The fourth downgrade was from Piper Jaffray’s Michael Olson, cutting his rating from “Overweight” to “Neutral.”Akamai shares today closed down $3.89, or 19%, at $16.51 and are continuing to trend down in the after-market.Original post"

The firm's checks indicate only two large contract renewals in June, one in tech, one in media. Akamai doesn't have a history of reporting significant upside or downside to the guided revenue range, although Jefferies 9% revenue growth estimate for the year could prove conservative. Adjusted EBITDA should decline quarter-over-quarter. And, although management didn't specify the magnitude of the expected decline, Jefferies has modeled a 100bp decrease. Recall that management decreased spending significantly in Q1 as they navigated through a period of dense uncertainty. Jefferies expects net customer additions to be roughly flat quarter-over-quarter, with ARPU down modestly from $23.77 in Q1 to $23.57 in Q2. E-commerce is holding in well. The firm expects competition from smaller CDN's to dissipate since none of them make money and they are unlikely to survive the current downturn. However, competition from the larger telco's, particularly AT&T (NYSE:T) and Level 3 (NASDAQ:LVLT) is likely to continue, and pressure pricing. The firms' recent checks indicate that Akamai is the default CDN provider for e-commerce, which continues to grow nicely, even in the downturn. Wedbush believes the company could meet its pro forma EPS estimate of 40c, but believe the weakening commerce trends signal that even its Street low revenue estimate of $207M could be at risk."

Merriman believes Akamai expectations are low and sentiment is negative leaving room for upside. FBR continues to believe that Akamai's diverse suite of solutions has strongly positioned the company to capitalize on industry trends that are fueling content delivery network, or CDN, demand. But the tough IT spending environment is likely affecting adoption of the company’s services and further pressuring vanilla content delivery prices, which could result in higher-than-expected gross margin contraction. The firm remains cautious, and believes investors will largely focus on Q2 guidance, as the company enters the seasonally slower summer months, and any management commentary regarding the pricing environment and customer appetite to spend. Jefferies channel checks indicate that Akamai has likely signed a new $20M deal with Facebook. Further, the firm believes the patent decision on Friday in favor of Limelight Networks (NASDAQ:LLNW) probably doesn't change the competitive dynamics between the two companies. Bernstein indicated that Akamai could be a takeover candidate and that its 30,000 computer servers would give Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) an edge over other cloud-computing concerns down the road."

(NASDAQ:AKAM) CEO Paul Sagan might have signaled a shift in describing the company as a cloud computing provider, moving away from dreaded term ""CDN"" (content delivery network).According to the transcript of Wednesday's call you'll find only about 10 mentions of ""delivery"" or ""content delivery,"" some of which are tied to the description of what other competitors have to offer. But do a search for ""cloud"" or ""cloud computing"" and you'll see that Sagan mentioned those terms 14 times.
More important than the number of times those terms were used is how they were used. Over the call and in the question and answer section, Sagan pointed to the opportunity that the company sees in offering cloud services.
""As our clients evolve more and more to take advantage of cloud computing, we're continuing to invest in even more advanced solutions to help them realize the full potential of network computing over the Internet,"" Sagan said.
While acknowledging that cloud computing ""happens to be the phrase of the day that everyone wants to use,"" Sagan went on to justify how Akamai and its distributed architecture fit into the market for cloud services.
""It's really about network and distributed computing, and virtualizing infrastructure rather than dedicating a machine, or a license, or a person for each instance of an application or each end-users use of it,"" Sagan said.
It could be, in fact, that Akamai's always been a ""cloud computing"" provider. But now that the marketing jargon has become ""hot,"" they are looking to take advantage of that.
In fact, Sagan suggested that Akamai was offering ""cloud computing"" services long before they were hip. Referring to cloud computing as ""the idea of dynamic, adaptive computing capabilities,"" Sagan said, ""This is an idea that we've been talking about at Akamai since we started more than 10 years ago.""
Sagan went on to point to the company's edge computing and application acceleration offerings as examples of cloud services""
""We're already delivering on much of the promise of cloud computing with our edge computing offerings, which we introduced almost six years ago,"" Sagan said. ""This is where we host and deliver applications from the Akamai cloud. The tens of thousands of servers we control around the world and manage like one big resource on behalf of our clients.
""In addition, our Application Acceleration Solutions, which we began rolling out in 2005, are designed to offer a cloud-based solution to the majority of enterprises that want to maintain a centralized computing infrastructure and make their applications available to a globally-distributed user base.""
While much of the broader CDN market is focused on more commodotized bit delivery for media and entertainment customers, it will be interesting to see if Akamai's new cloud messaging starts to catch on.

113301,20875,2009-01-06T03:33:22-05:00,,"This morning, Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM), Ascent Media and Sofatronic announced the creating of a new integrated digital workflow and distribution solution for the production, hosting and delivery of BD Live functionality for Blu-ray Discs.The companies say the new service provides a more efficient and cost effective way for movie studios and content creators to harness the full power of BD Live’s Internet-enabled features, such as bonus content, online community, and interactive and e-commerce applications.While it's a smart idea for all three vendors to partner on the new service and lay the groundwork for the future, I wonder just how many of the over 1,200 Blu-ray movies offered today have BD Live functionality? And more importantly, how many studios moving forward are going to support the extra costs involved with providing additional content via the Internet? Ideally, this is where Akamai, Ascent Media and Sofatronic's solution would come in, reducing the cost and complexity of making this content available.But outside of fixing the workflow issue, there are two other problems that need to be resolved, the biggest of which is convincing consumers to purchase Blu-ray players. At the end of Q3 2008, the Blu-ray Disc Association said that ""more than 6.5 million Blu-ray capable players, including PS3, have been sold in the U.S. and more than 15 million units have been sold worldwide."" But what the Blu-ray Disc Association doesn't say is how many of those units are broadband enabled?Depending on which research report you want to believe, it is estimated that between 20-30 million Blu-ray units are expected to be sold in 2009, with the percentage of those capable of connecting to the Internet unknown. That being said, nearly every analyst report in the beginning of 2008 predicted 30 million units would be sold for 2008, and those estimates were high by at least 10 million. The bottom line is that broadband capable Blu-ray players need to get adopted first and movie studios need to make a commitment to BD Live functionality.In addition to the adoption problem, the other issue is whether consumers get any real benefit getting extra content from a BD Live enabled service as opposed to just including that extra content on the disc itself. Three months ago when the Iron Man disc came out, whoever was serving up the BD Live content had servers that could not handle the load, which prevented many customers from getting the extra content.And as pointed out in an article on CNET, the fact that most BD-Live features could easily be fit on a Blu-ray Disc, instead of having to download them from the Internet, makes you wonder if the BD Live feature is really worth it. It might just be too new for consumers to see what will be possible with BD Live, or it may just be an industry using a technology because it exists, even if the demand does not. For now, it sounds too early to know either way.Over the coming weeks I will be getting hands-on with an Internet enabled Blu-ray player and taking a look at the BD Live functionality and the Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) streaming service. I'll be posting a review of both shortly."

Kaufman Brothers is expecting revenues, adjusted EBITDA, and pro forma EPS of $195.2M, $90.1M, and 39c, respectively. The firm is essentially in-line with Street estimates. Kaufman expects the competitive environment to intensify in the coming months owing to the combination of slowing industry growth, slow economic growth and the proliferation of new competitors. Kaufman sees no fewer than 20 CDNs have received funding for expanding the business, including AT&T's (NYSE:T) $75M investment in its CDN operation -- all expanding the competitive landscape. With this background, Kaufman said it should not come as surprise that it sees downside risk to management's guidance for Q4. Kaufman's Q4 revenue, adjusted EBITDA and pro forma EPS estimates are $212.2M, $96.6M and 42c, respectively. The respective consensus figures are $211.9M, $98.2M and 43c. Against this backdrop, Kaufman continues to rate Akamai shares Hold, with a $25 target. As Kaufman does not believe the CDN market is large enough to sustain the over 20 competitors that currently exist, the firm would look for consolidation to occur, with Akamai likely to remain a key facilitator. Key areas to focus on: 1) commentary regarding Internet usage trends, volume growth, and the pricing environment for CDN services; 2) Impact of current macro economy on IT purchasing; 3) U.S. and International revenue growth trends; 4) Net customer additions and churn management; and 5) ARPU."

115952,20875,2009-01-22T12:16:48-05:00,,"Last night I had a long conversation with Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) about the inauguration webcast and got more details on the actual number of simultaneous streams they served and their methods and reasoning for capping customers on their network.Many who are writing about inauguration traffic numbers are quoting from the Akamai press release and implying that Akamai delivered, at peak, 7.7 million video streams of the inauguration, which is incorrect. That 7.7 million number is the total number of all audio and video streams for all of Akamai's 2,800 customers delivered on their network that day.Out of that 7.7 million number, Akamai said roughly half of that was just for the inauguration. That puts my earlier estimate of around 8 million simultaneous streams combined across the Akamai, Limelight and Highwinds CDN a little high, with the number being more around 7 million.Akamai also stated that they delivered the live webcast for ""twelve major broadcast customers"" although I can't say who all of those customers were since they don't have permission to use all of the customers' names. How much revenue they earned from the inauguration webcast amongst all of those customers is not being shared right now since Akamai is currently in a quiet period. But if someone asks them on their next earnings call about this, it sounds like they might make that number public. Needless to say, it's not a big number and anyone who knows the space well knows that being in the live events business means tons of work, lots of headaches and very little revenue. These one-off, large-scale webcasts are not moneymakers for the CDNs.Aside from the numbers, we also had a lengthy discussion about how and why Akamai caps customers and the business reasoning behind it. As much as some may want to think, there is no such thing as unlimited capacity on a day like the inauguration, even for Akamai. On the StreamingMedia.com discussion lists, there were some Akamai customers talking about how they had been capped by Akamai on the day of the webcast without asking to be. While some Akamai customers seemed upset by this practice, it's also important to realize that many customers did not provision properly for the event.Many customers also were not willing to pay Akamai to guarantee a certain level of service or capacity. A few of Akamai's largest customers were in fact willing to pay more and paid upfront to guarantee they would have the capacity they wanted. Even with that, those customers went way over what they were expecting in terms of traffic and had to be capped. One major customer provisioned for 30GB and peaked at 125GB and Akamai still delivered it. But at some point, they had to cap what they would deliver when the customer is 4x over their capacity planning.Akamai had to make a business decision to cap customers based on the fact that they have 2,800 other customers they have to keep up and running. Any other CDN would have made the same decision and when customers don't plan, or are not willing to pay to provision for a surge in traffic, no CDN can let that affect all of the other customers on their network. Imagine the impact to Akamai if they didn't cap any video customers on that day and as result, their e-commerce customers went down. Akamai has 83 of the top 100 e-commerce sites on their network and just think of the impact that would of had on the e-commerce industry if Akamai didn't take the necessary steps to keep video from taking down their network. This is simply the way CDNs have to operate on the rare occasions when something like the inauguration webcast happens.Akamai did say that moving forward, they should cap customers using a better method by using things like a waiting room as opposed to viewers getting an error. The waiting room is what was used by CNN and while I didn't like the experience, it makes more sense to me now knowing the reason behind it.But this also raises a very interesting scenario though since the inauguration webcast was a planned event. What happens if a major breaking news story happens and we see traffic like this again? In that case, CDNs would have to cap customers again since almost all customers do not pay any premium for what is essentially breaking news insurance, thereby guaranteeing them tons of excess capacity at a second's notice.While the content delivery market as a whole has historically used marketing phrases to imply that they have ""unlimited capacity"", that's simply not reality. This is the way the Internet works and it puts things into perspective when many want to say that the Internet will drive broadcast TV out of business, that HD quality video will be delivered to millions anytime soon or that online video will get the same sized audiences that TV broadcasts get.The Internet has major limitations for delivering video to large-scale audiences and while many want to complain about the problem being at the ISP end, or with the end users' broadband speed, the bottleneck is also on the CDNs' end."

Excluding items the company reported earnings of $76.5 million, or 41 cents a share, to match Wall Street estimates. Revenue for the quarter was $194 million, up 27 percent a year ago.But the big news was Akamai’s outlook (statement), which indicated that the company would land on the low end of its earnings and revenue target. The company said it expects 2008 revenue to be at the low end of its $785 million to $800 million range. Earnings will also fall at the low end or below the previous 2008 outlook calling for earnings of $1.63 a share to $1.69 a share. The third quarter will also be seasonally slow with revenue between $193 million or $198 million with earnings between 39 cents a share and 40 cents a share.CEO Paul Sagan cited a “challenging environment” in the company’s statement, but there are also worries about the amount of content that U.S. users can realistically consume. Sagan noted that Internet traffic wasn’t slowing, but growth rates are being affected by broadband speeds. Sagan’s message: Unless broadband speeds perk up the ability of consumers to watch content (the type that Akamai delivers) will see slower growth. Sagan would like to see the day where you can get high-def video over IP.Sagan said:Needless to say those comments didn’t go over too well as Akamai shares fell about 17 percent afterhours. Indeed, Akamai’s comments about U.S. broadband speeds are more worrisome than the economy. It’s safe to say that the economy will come back faster than broadband speeds jump in the U.S.Sagan added that Web content consumption isn’t falling off of a cliff, but there are slower broadband speeds in the U.S. that will hamper growth rates. Internationally, the broadband speed issue isn’t as much of a factor.That thread was notable since Sagan still has some economic issues to confront. Akamai’s tools speed up Web advertising and some verticals–automotive and media–are slowing spending.“The economic issue is in verticals we sell into where there is a strong slowdown. There’s not one single event there, but we’re conservative about the second half,” said Sagan."

71532,20875,2008-04-08T05:20:51-04:00,,"About two weeks ago, Akamai invited me to spend the day with them in
Cambridge to allow me to get an better insight into their business and
give me the opportunity to ask management and others more about the
market, pricing, application delivery and a host of various other
topics. They nicely gave me access to over a dozen individuals
including senior management in sales, marketing, engineering, product
development, investor relations and their CTO. 

While some of what we discussed was off the record, there is a lot
that I can talk about relating to some new product functionality, sales
and marketing topics and a lot about the market dynamics, trends and my
take on what the opportunity is for Akamai in the market. With so much
to cover in detail, I won't be able to cover it all in one post. I will
give a run down of the highlights here and then over the next two weeks
I will follow up with specific posts about their application delivery
product, their StreamOS content management system, customer service,
analytics, some details about the network and I will post their answers
to some of the questions that readers sent in. Akamai is nicely working
with me on the future posts to give me customer names, specific
examples of how they are using the services and examples we can see in
action. There will be more to come on that later this week.
After spending the day with Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM), there were a couple of really
key high-level feelings I walked away with. For starters, Akamai has a
very clear understanding of what customers want in the market across
all of their product lines. When I was getting new product demos and
talking about new functionality for their services, at no time was
Akamai guessing on what it thinks customers wanted. It was very clear
that the company spends a lot of time talking with its customers, getting
feedback, going through review sessions and finding out what it can
do to help their customers grow. For every new product or feature showed, the staff also included examples of real customers using the
service and talked about how it allowed the content owner to grow their
business or gave them more control applying business rules around their
content. Many companies I speak to in the CDN space talk about new
products and services they are working on but many times I get the
sense that they don't know exactly what their current customers future
needs are. While Akamai is clearly working on what customers need
today, announcements it will make throughout the year will showcase
that the company is also deploying products and services customers will need
two and three quarters from now. The biggest thing I saw from Akamai
was that it has a very clear understanding of the market it is in.Another key takeaway for me was that Akamai realizes that as the
leader in the space, it needs to do a better job of communication data
to Wall Street and to investors and needs to spend more time educating
customers. That being said, Akamai is not saying that it is now
going to provide every piece of data a financial analyst wants, but I
gave them some examples of how it could put out more specific data to
the market while at the same time protecting its customers, and the company is open to the idea. Akamai knows as the leader in the space it must
step forward and do a better job of showing the entire industry how
this market is growing.It understands that analysts are saying that they want to buy more
stock in the company but need more data to be able to do that and Akamai
said they would provide more breakout on its business at their next
analyst day. While I don't deal with Akamai on a day to day basis as it
pertains to their P&L, I do deal with many money managers daily and
hear the kinds of questions they want answered. I think that over time
you will see Akamai be more open to disclosing more data on their
business.Tied closely into the data discussions is the subject of Akamai's
pricing and the pricing trends in general which we covered in detail. I
gave Akamai my feedback on their pricing, what I am seeing in the
market and how it compares to other vendors specifically for video
delivery. This was an interesting discussion as I learned that in many
cases, Akamai may not be the right fit for customers who want
commoditized services. When I gave Akamai examples of deals I have seen
in the market and showed that its prices were two or three times higher
than competitors', it was not surprised. The company made clear that if a
customer does not care about being able to use multiple services, does
not care about good analytics (not just reporting), does not require a
good SLA, is not concerned with geographic reach etc... then that customer
is probably not a good fit for Akamai and they should go somewhere else
at a lower price. If there was one thing I walked away from after this meeting it is
that Akamai is laser focused on customers who have business problems,
need to apply their own business rules around their content, need very
detailed analytics, need geographic reach, need multiple services and
are trying to solve the entire ecosystem problem from creation to
distribution. While the company will gladly take customers who want the simple
task of pushing bits, that's not who it is going after. For the most
part, that is why the whole ""pricing war"" people talked about last year
was completely overrated. Yes, Akamai may have to compete harder on
price for those specific deals where the customer just wants to just
push a lot of bits. But for customers who are looking for much more
than that and also need additional services like application delivery,
pricing is not the problem. 
 While I have always covered content delivery for video very closely,
application delivery is now something that I am going to also focus on.
In my eyes, the biggest market opportunity for Akamai going forward is
its application delivery product. While it is a market that is just
starting out, I think that in two or three quarters it will become a
very big opportunity and I think it is the most under-estimated product
in Akamai's portfolio. I'll have more on that later in the week along
with details on Akamai's StreamOS product, the content management
system that was acquired in the Nine System acquisition. From the
product I saw in action, which Akamai has been working on for the past
year since the acquisition, and will have announcements about shortly,
I have not seen another CDN that has a solution that can do even 25% of
what StreamOS does. And as more content owners start to become more
sophisticated in regards to the kind of transcoding, tracking,
analyzing and monetizing they are going to need, StreamOS will quickly
become a revenue center for Akamai.Overall, I didn't see or hear anything from Akamai that gives me any
indication that it is currently losing market share. Yes, for video
delivery it has some competition in the market, but most of those
competitors are still very small and don't have a wide product
portfolio. And when it comes to doing more than just pushing video
bits, Akamai clearly has a handle on the market today and, more
importantly, the solutions that will be needed by these customers a few
quarters from now."

The consensus estimate is 37c for EPS and revenue $174.61M, according to First Call. Kaufman is expecting at least an in-line quarter, despite the slowdown in the economy. Their checks indicate that demand for Akamai's services remains strong. Furthermore, Kaufman believes Akamai's ecommerce segment tracked well in 4Q07, as the company announced a 37% year over year increase in traffic on ""Cyber Monday"" vs. a 19% increase in 2006. Stanford believes it's likely that Akamai will leave its guidance intact at a midpoint revenue growth expectation of 27.5%. Stanford says any significant upside to Q4 should lead to an increase in street consensus estimates going forward. Canaccord Adams expects Akamai to provide Q1 guidance in-line with their estimates of $180M/37c vs. consensus of $183M/38c, and update full-year guidance, which Akamai had provided as 25% to 30% revenue and EPS growth. AmTech appears the most bullish, expecting strong Q4 results, and for Akamai to reiterate 2008 guidance. They see a good probability that the stock will trade higher. Key issues for the conference call: An update on the intensifying competitive environment, possibly addressing recent speculation that Akamai may look to start its own ad serving system taking on Double Click, who is being acquired by Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and an update on their relationship with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)."

In after hours trading, Akamai shares went up $0.87, or 2.9%, to $30.60. I covered Akamai earlier as part of the Online Video Beneficiaries series, and have also interviewed its founder, Tom Leighton. Q4 revenue grew 46% y-o-y and 14% q-o-q to $183.2 million. GAAP net income went up 48% q-o-q to $35.9 million or $0.20 per diluted share. For full year, revenue grew 48% to $636.4 million. GAAP net income grew 76% to $101.0 million, or $0.56 per diluted share. GAAP gross margin was 74%, four points lower than 2006, but in line with its guidance. The number of long-term customers at the end of Q4 was up by 29 to a record 2,645, up 13% y-o-y. However, this is lower than its recent net add numbers, and due in part to churn related to completing the Nine Systems and Netli customer migration. Churn for the quarter was just over 4%. On the brighter side, the recurring revenue from these new customers was up by 30% y-o-y. During the fourth quarter, international sales accounted for 23% of total revenue, about the same as the last quarter. Resellers accounted for 16% of total revenue, two points lower than the third quarter. For 2008, Akamai raised its revenue guidance to between $800 million and $825 million, or 26% to 30% annual growth. It expects to see the downward trend in gross margins (due to pricing pressure from Level 3) to continue in 2008, but at a slower rate, that would be offset by EBITDA improvement. For the first quarter, it expects revenue in the range of $186 million to $190 million, or 34% to 37% y-o-y growth, and 2% to 4% sequential growth. Its stock is trading around $34 after hitting a 52-week low of $25.06 on January 22. Its market cap is around $5.6 billion. I own this stock, and will continue to say that Akamai is a great company, and as we continue to clog the internet with video and such, Akamai will continue to be a key piece of the technology puzzle to remove and/or prevent hotspots and congestion. In fact, as one of my readers pointed out, those same ISPs that are supposed to be competing with Akamai, use Akamai’s technology to get performance out of their own networks. The threat from the pricing pressue, in my opinion, is highly overblown.  )"

Not only did revenue increase 14% and profit 22% over last quarter (!), but gross margin even increased by 20 basis points. CEO Paul Sagan certainly had every right to brag that “the value of Akamai’s differentiated services is stronger than ever.”Sagan also reassured investors in this uneasy market climate, insisting that an economic slowdown may even help Akamai. Since companies save money by moving operations to the Internet, Akamai would benefit if the migration process picked up as businesses seek to cut costs in a tougher economic climate, he said.A large driver of Akamai’s growth is the downloading of video content. The company provides technology that allows companies and government agencies to deliver digital internet content, such as commercials and videos. Between the announcement by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) of a movie download service, the internet-only NBC soap opera “Coastal Dreams”, and the proliferation of forwarded video clips in my inbox, the growth of video is one trend you can count on.

You can also read my interview with its founder to see why I think guys like Howard Lindzon are rushing too soon in shorting Akamai. On October 24, 2007, Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKAM) reported its financial results for Q3 ending September 30, 2007. Its revenue was $161.2 million, up 6% q-o-q and 45% y-o-y. Its GAAP net income was $24.3 million, or $0.13 diluted EPS, up 12% q-o-q and 73% y-o-y, and its GAAP gross profit margin was 73%, which is about a point lower than Q2. Akamai added 61 customers in the quarter taking its customer count to 2,616. It will also be acting as the exclusive content distribution provider in the U.S. for Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) stores following its deal with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The deal allows iTunes users to download a wide range of Starbucks'' popular Hear Music titles. It is also launching a showcase portal for high definition videos from customers including the BBC, NBA, and MTV. Other exciting innovations include the launch of large file optimization and the introduction of its IP-based application accelerator. For Q4, Akamai expects revenue in the range of $172 to $176 million. Normalized diluted EPS is expected to be between $0.37 and $0.38. For the fiscal year 2007, it is on track to meet its revenue estimate of $625 and $629 million, and to deliver 46% to 47% annual growth. In 2008, it expects to achieve 25% to 30% growth in both revenue and normalized EPS. It looks like the company will achieve its 1-billion revenue goal well before the end of the decade. Its stock is trading around $35 after hitting a 52-week low of $27.75. Market cap is around $5.9 billion. I am standing by my recommendation that Akamai is a good company to hold on to for the long term. I own the stock myself, and have a lot of faith in the company’s ability to deliver innovative solutions to the networking problems in 2008 and beyond. With IPTV around the corner, the video delivery problem in particular is going to become acute, I believe that Akamai’s network traffic optimization algorithms are not only going to be handy, but perhaps, essential. The me-too’s just don’t have the level of technology to tackle this enormous routing/hotspot prevention algorithm challenge."

I first made AKAM a SmartGuyStocks pick in August, after the company reported stellar earnings yet got crushed due to unfavorable analyst comments. At that time, a variety of analysts bemoaned AKAM’s future, insisting that the days of fast growth and high profit margins were over due to major competition. Later that month, those analysts smiled with glee as competitor Limelight announced a new deal with Microsoft.But rather than signaling the end of AKAM’s growth run, these moments were actually great opportunities to gobble up shares on the cheap. Despite all the predictions of doom and gloom, CEO Paul Sagan stepped up to the podium last week and announced yet another brilliant quarter of explosive growth, high margins, and low churn. Said Sagan, “We were very pleased with our third quarter results and the demand we saw for our services, especially as we experienced increased momentum during September.” Not exactly music to the ears of naysayers.Yet some people just never learn. Several analysts came out again and reiterated their concerns about increased competition.

Akamai helps with the delivery of high-bandwidth content like streaming audio, video, and web-based applications around the globe through its network of 25,000 servers in 69 countries. Akamai says it delivers between 10-20% of all Web traffic. It's a volatile stock and the passion runs deep in both directions, but for tech investors with a high risk-tolerance, Akamai is a company worth knowing. Started less than a decade ago, Akamai now has revenue of more than half a billion dollars and its customer list features marquee names like Yahoo! (YHOO), Sony (NYSE:SNE), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), MTV Networks (NASDAQ:VIA), BestBuy.com (NYSE:BBY), FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and GM (NYSE:GM). The stock jumped 8% on Monday after the company announced a new managed service for enterprise applications called IP Application Accelerator. Even so, at $33.92 as of Monday's close the stock is well off its peak near $60 set in February. It's a heavily shorted stock (i.e., speculators betting the stock price will fall) with 10.67 million shares short as of September 14, or 6.7% of its float and 2.25 times average daily volume, according to the latest data from NASDAQ. That's up from 8.8 million (1.7 days to cover) in June. Akamai's services analyze and manage Web traffic, transmitting content from the server geographically closest to the end user. In addition to faster, more dependable delivery, Akamai provides security and administrative features that give its customers a better experience in using the Internet to reach its customers, business partners, and workforce. Streaming audio and video is clearly a hot spot these days. Akamai has delivered over a billion songs for its online music store vendors. E-commerce customers use Akamai to sell over $36 billion worth of retail merchandise and software. With an election year and the Olympic games on the near-term horizon, not to mention the proliferation of user-generated video content, demand for Akamai's services is sure to soar. But analysts are also looking for the enterprise application business to become a key source of recurring revenue, which is why Monday's new product introduction made such waves. Content isn't all that Akamai delivers. The company is expected to deliver 44% growth in Earnings Per Share this year on revenue growth of 46%. The analyst consensus is for EPS of $1.27 this year and $1.67 in 2008, tied to revenue estimates of $625 million and $809 million, respectively. Those are some amazing growth figures, so it's no wonder this stock attracts plenty of attention from investors and speculators. With the stock down sharply from its peak, AKAM now trades at a trailing P/E of 31 and a forward P/E of just 20.3 using 2008 estimates. The price/sales ratio of 9.8 is still pretty astronomical, yet a fraction of where it's been in the past two years. The balance sheet is in good shape with only 16% in debt. This is a company with a very bright future, and while it's tough to determine what a fair price is to own a piece, it sure seems worth pondering. Keep in mind this stock has a wild history, but it's the present and the future that has investors so excited. Akamai is scheduled to report third quarter earnings on October 24."

However, the market’s capricious whims have knocked down one of my favorite companies, Akamai (Nasdaq: AKAM), to relatively bargain levels. Two years ago, I bought into the company at 13 and sold at 17, only to kick myself as I watched it soar to near 60. Although I expect the short-term swings to continue, I believe that the market is offering us another chance to jump on Akamai for the long-term. Akamai provides a distributed computing platform for global internet content and application delivery. In other words, Akamai allows content providers like Apple and Yahoo! seamlessly and quickly to transmit audio, video and graphics to internet users around the world. It’s obvious to any person with a modicum of technological literacy (and you qualify by reading this right now) that internet content delivery is a HUGE secular growth trend. Maybe the biggest. To distribute more content, companies need increasingly to leverage content delivery networks [CDNs]. And as was stated in a recent Business 2.0 blog entry, Akamai is the Google of CDNs, controlling an estimated 54% of the market. Earlier this year, the company was named Business 2.0’s #1 fastest growing tech company. Recent earnings indicated that the hypergrowth is set to continue, as Akamai announced full-year guidance that represents 44% YoY revenue growth and a 45% jump in profits. In return for meeting expectations and reaffirming this impressive guidance, the market rewarded Akamai’s shares with a 30% haircut. Why? Minyanville has a great article breaking down Merrill Lynch’s (poor) reasons for issuing a dour view on the company following earnings. From what I can gather, the bottom line is that Wall Street is worried that others are catching on to Akamai’s game. Upstart competitors Limelight Networks, Internap, and EdgeCast have recently received glowing press and funding from big names. But I don’t look at the new entrants as a bad thing; it merely reinforces the fact that this is a remarkably high-growth industry. There will certainly be room for multiple players, but nobody has the experience or financial backing to go head-to-head with Akamai, the 800-pound gorilla. Akamai has spent hundreds of millions of dollars building out its world-class network and is currently engaged in a $60M capacity expansion. At its most basic, content distribution is about pure bandwidth power, and no competitors can come close to matching Akamai. Trading at a 2008 PE of 21 on estimated growth of over 30%, I believe that Akamai shares have become too attractive to pass up. Regardless of the short-term gyrations, I think 12-24 months from now, this will be one that we’ll be very glad we owned. Disclosure: SmartGuyAB is long AKAM"

The stock gapped higher Thursday morning, and remained up on very solid volume.    If you look at the above chart, you can see a large gap lower back in July, which was the last time the company reported earnings. This time around, I chose to sit on the sidelines until after the company reported earnings in order to avoid another big disappointment. But the earnings were solid, slightly beating estimates. And full-year guidance was bumped up a bit, and although it was not as high as previous quarters, revenue and earnings growth easilty topped +40%. Its free cash flow grew +56% yr/yr. And, gross margins remain above 80% (wow). The company remains a leader in the content delivery space, and its services will remain in high demand as more bandwidth-intensive applications migrate on the web (software downloads, video streaming, movie downloads, etc.). Current EPS estimates for 2008 are $1.66, which puts the stock at a P/E of 22x. That is cheap for a fast growing stock like AKAM, and I think the stock will continue to recover. For what its worth, here are some analyst price targets that I saw on Thursday: If I had to put a price target on it, I would say that the stock can likely get back to a multiple of 35x, which would put my in-line with the Citigroup analyst ($58). That's a lot of upside, although it will likely take time to get there. But I remain bullish on the market, and bullish on growth stocks in general (over value).

Gartner estimates that the market for application acceleration will
exceed $3 billion by 2010. There has been a meteoric rise of online
traffic with the online broadcast of live events and the popularity of
devices like iPods and iPhones and the resulting boom in downloading as
well as uploading of music and videos. A major beneficiary of this
surge in online traffic and multimedia activity that requires fast and
reliable transfers is Akamai.Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:

With the Internet playing a major role in everyday life and
applications, Akamai’s business is booming. Its annual sales in 2006
went up 51% to $428.7 million and have more than doubled over 2004. It
acquired one of its biggest competitors, Speedera in June, 2005. It
followed this up with Nine Systems in December 2006 to build out its
video serving capability. In March 2007, it acquired Netli to expand
its application acceleration technology as well as its presence in the
Software-As-A-Service (NASDAQ:SAAS) market. In April 2007, it bought Red
Swoosh to enhance its distributed Internet presence.Akamai
offers three core solutions: Digital Asset Solutions, Dynamic Site
Solutions and Application Performance Solutions. Its Digital Asset

business-to-consumer websites that integrate rich, collaborative

Q2 fiscal 2007, Akamai reported revenues of $152.7 million, up 52 %
year-over-year. GAAP net income was $21.6 million, or $0.12 per diluted
share, a 92 % year-over-year increase. Its customers under recurring
revenue contracts also increased from 2,060 in June 2006 to 2,555 in
June 2007. It is currently trading around $29 and hit a 52-week low of
$27.75 on 28 September. Earlier this year in February, its price went
up to $59.69.So why this kind of punishment for the stock?
Unrealistic expectations is one reason. Competitors creeping up is
cited as another. Akamai owns over 50% of the CDN market, which
continues to grow, and my general impression is that this is a GREAT
company, playing in a GREAT market, and the recent slaughtering creates
a very nice buying opportunity for investors. Just look at the

All of the sudden, the stock trades at only 23 times 2008 earnings. For a growth stock like AKAM, I think that is a bargain.

He also noted that gross margin guidance for 2007 was lowered to down 400 basis points year-over-year from down 300 points. He also notes that the company increased its cap ex estimate for the year, “suggesting greater than expected” need to spend on infrastructure to handle increased video and streaming from media and entertainment customers.

I sold a third of my position, but will keep the rest as it has gone from too expensive to too cheap rather quickly. Akamai’s having trouble gaining a significant number of new customers and will likely have to just squeeze more money out of old customers by offering them more services. 
My analysis on the digital online revolution and Akamai’s core position in it still holds, which is why I’m holding on. However, we’ll have to accept the fact that Akamai has grown up (it was added to the S&P 500) and gone from a super fast grower to… just a fast grower. 
I still believe Akamai can grow at over 25% a year, though that’s down from the 30%+ estimates of the past, which is why there was so much disappointment. At current valuations and assuming a 25% growth rate, I do not believe Akamai will go below $30. 
We’ll have to see where we are after we shake out all the momentum players that only play the super fast growers. Fil Zucchi over at Minyanville.com has a good analysis of Akamai’s current situation.

On April 25, Akamai reported first quarter earnings of $19.2 million, or 11 cents per diluted share, versus $11.5 million, or 7 cents a share, year-over-year. Revenue came in at $139.3 million, compared to $90.8 million in the first quarter last year. Excluding special items, net income was $50.7 million or 28 cents a diluted share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call had forecast earnings of 28 cents on revenue of $138.82 million. Shares of Akamai have climbed more than 300% since the beginning of 2005, and more than 5000% since its lows back in 2002. Having gotten used to Akamai beating earnings expectations quarter after quarter, investors rushed for the exits this time around when earnings were simply “in line.” Valuations were indeed stretched when momentum investors bid the forward P/E up to 34 as Akamai hit its high of $59.69. However, after pulling back about 30% since the earnings report, Akamai is too cheap with a PEG of just 1. If Akamai’s PEG falls much below 1, it will not only be a growth play but also a value play. As one of the few internet companies with a future of growth, including Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Akamai should not be trading at such low valuations. Even if investors’ fears of slowing growth does occur and Akamai cannot grow revenues over 30% a year, Akamai should still be able to do so in the high 20%’s. Meanwhile, older internet companies such as Amazon, with growth in the low 20%’s, have ridiculous valuations, with forward P/E of 54 and PEG of 2.86. When Akamai raised full-year guidance at the first telecon of the year, shares surged to its 52-week high. I believe if Akamai continues on that path by meeting or beating expectations in upcoming quarters, investors will regain confidence in this internet-backbone once again, with a target price of $68-$74. Background: FedEX of the Internet Akamai’s primary business is operating a CDN, or a Content Delivery Network. By giving their customers the scalability and reliability they need to deliver content over the web, Akamai is an integral part of the digital revolution occurring on the web. Countless corporations large and small use Akamai’s network to deliver various types of content ranging from video to advertisements or software downloads. For instance, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) put Akamai on the map when Apple chose Akamai’s services as the backbone for downloading songs and movies from iTunes possible. In fact, Apple generates virtually nothing from sales on iTunes. Rather, the $0.99 per song goes to credit card transactions, music labels, and Akamai. Other notable customers who depend greatly on Akamai are Yahoo (YHOO), Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE), Charles Schwab’s (NYSE:SCHW) and E*Trade’s (NASDAQ:ETFC) online trading, and FedEX’s (NYSE:FDX) package tracking. Akamai’s recent surge in business isn’t by accident but as part of the digital revolution. Just about everything nowadays, especially media, can be seen on the web, but corporations providing the content do not have the technical expertise nor the infrastructure to move entertainment and other things online. By outsourcing this task to Akamai, corporations have access to Akamai’s global network of more than 20,000 servers to store and distribute the content without having to actually build out a 20,000 server network in every major network around the globe. This is significant because often there are surges of web traffic such as the NCAA March Madness or 2006 winter Olympics which many people watched online. Such surge of web traffic requires massive web infrastructure of servers and routers to handle the traffic, but no company would want to build out such a network for just one event. It’s like building a 10 story department store just for the after thanksgiving sale- it is just not economically feasible. With Akamai, and especially with virtual machines on each server, Akamai allows all of its customers to store content on most or all of its 20,000 servers. Akamai’s advantage since the day the company began is its dynamic traffic management system, which monitors all traffic such that data travels along the shortest path to reach the web user in the shortest time. Moreover, Akamai’s monitoring system pools together as many servers as needed to handle surges of traffic such as March Madness so that such events can be experienced online without a glitch. Finally, Akamai stores a lot of content “on the edge,” or at servers closest to the web user. This way, the song, for instance, would reach a user in Singapore much faster than if the user had to get the song from Apple’s iTunes server in Cupertino, California. Although edge servers have already played a great part in speeding up the internet experience, edge servers should play a huge role in the sea change to put smart ads online. As more and more people spend more of their time online, advertisers have shifted much of their focus from traditional media such as newspapers and radio to the internet. Edge server technology allows for the targeting of specific ads to the right web users since ads targeted for a specific type of person must show up instantly within the webpage, requiring the ad to be pulled quickly from an edge server rather than from miles away. Acquisitions While Akamai has made a couple of interesting acquisitions recently, it does not worry me that Akamai’s internal growth is slowing and must grow by acquisitions. Technology is constantly in rapid change and tech companies must change accordingly or risk being outdated, like the NASDAQ highfliers in 2000 who aren’t around today. The Netli and NineSystems, and most recently RedSwoosh, are all accretive to earnings, but also allows Akamai to maintain its dominance in content delivery while removing possible competitors from the market. The Netli acquisition seems like a similar move to Google’s launch of Google Documents, allowing people to use programs such as Word or Excel online rather than on their PC. This may be the next shift in the internet revolution as applications are moved online so people can do their tasks regardless of which computer they use as long as they are connected to the internet. The RedSwoosh acquisition is just as exciting, paving the way for Akamai to take advantage of high definition video online for everything from TV shows to movie downloads. With consumers citing the lengthy download time as the biggest drawback for streaming movies from iTunes to watch instantly on TV, Akamai’s RedSwoosh would significantly increase the download time. RedSwoosh uses the same P2P technology that bitTorrent uses to take apart content such as movies, forward them in bits and pieces along the fastest route, and reassemble them for the end user. Thus, RedSwoosh would make Akamai’s services much more attractive to corporations, as larger files would be subject to longer download times. Crosswinds  With less than 50% of U.S. households having broadband internet, and the unstoppable trend of moving everything online, Akamai’s services should remain a crucial part of most corporations’ IT backbone. Although there are concern that broadband providers such as Level 3 Communications (NASDAQ:LVLT) are competitors to Akamai, Level 3 providing more broadband in the U.S. should only boost the internet’s usage and the demand for the high speed media distributed through Akamai’s network. Moreover, Akamai itself uses the internet to move content between servers; therefore, more broadband availability should lower the cost for Akamai to distribute content.

In addition, the Nine Systems acquisition contributed $900K in revenue that was not in firm's estimate. Net new customers increased by 203 (78 organic, 125 from Nine Systems) bringing total customers to 2,347, while churn was 3.5% in the quarter. For 1Q07 Akamai guided to revenue of $136-140mn and pro forma EPS of $0.28. This compares with the consensus estimates of $128.9mn and EPS of $0.27. Firm notes that their estimates (and most likely consensus) did not include roughly $4-5mn in contribution from Nine Systems and Netli (to close in March), which means core guidance exceeded their expectations by $2-5mn. For 2007, the company guided to revenue of $610-625mn (42-46% growth) and pro forma EPS of $1.26-1.30. Firm notes that previous guidance had not included the impact of the Nine Systems and Netli acquisitions, which closed 2006 at roughly a $15mn revenue run rate each. Assuming a full year of Nine Systems and nine months of Netli contribution and a growth rate of 35% for those businesses, we estimate increased guidance includes $35mn due to acquisitions and $15mn of additional growth. EPS guidance of 50% growth assumes that gross margins will decline by 3% due to higher network depreciation and volume discounts, while EBITDA margins will improve by 4% due operating efficiencies. Due to the solid execution and tremendous success of Akamai over the past two years, investor expectations remain high. TWP believes given the current valuation of AKAM shares, investors expect a solid beat and guidance raise every quarter over the near term. While they see some potential upside to the organic business, they think that in order to satisfy expectations for 2007 and 2008 the company will need to garner some upside from Nine Systems and Netli. AKAM trades at a premium valuation of 16.7x 2007E EV/sales, 51x 2007E FCF and 44.3x 2007E pro forma EPS. TWP therefore believes that, at current prices, the shares are fairly valued and maintains Market Weight rating on the stock. - Piper Jaffray says Akamai continues to experience robust growth across the board, driven by increased broadband adoption. Organic revenue growth was approximately 51% vs. approximately 47% last quarter. Firm expects strong macro trends to continue and Akamai now projects 42-46% (35-39% organic) growth in 2007 vs. 32-36% previously. Additionally, Akamai continues to experience solid operating leverage, with 42% EBITDA margins (vs. 37% in 4Q05). While they expect Akamai to continue to deliver strong results with upside, they believe shares at current levels are fairly valued. For 2007, the firm moves their ests from $575M in revenues and $1.21 in PF EPS to $627M and $1.30. 2008 estimates increase from $730M and $1.59 to $850M and $1.81.  Target is raised to $58 from $48. Maintains Market Perform. - Deutsche Bank notes they were again impressed with Akamai's results and outlook, which exceeded their expectations. Growth accelerated, with revenues up 52% (51% organically) over 4Q05. Firm would look to add to Akamai positions on any pullback as this is the single best fundamental growth story in their universe. Reiterates Buy and raising target to $64 from $59. Firm believes Fy07 guidance is conservative and the potential exists for upside as revenue growth appears to be accelerating. Notablecalls: Love this company as it stands right at the center of the bandwidth race. The stock traded as low as $54-$55 in after market action (closed at $56.95) but rebounded to around $55.80 later on. I think the shares will be weak today as the core growth should have been somewhat stronger in order to justify current valuation levels. But as I already mentioned, I continue to like the company and the stock, so there will likely be a bounce after the mo-mo sellers are done."
26443,20123,2007-02-08T07:31:40-05:00,,"OK, so that headline is a little bit facetious -- but you can't blame a guy for wondering. Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) bought their biggest competitor, Speedera, a couple years ago, and since then they've been on what I think is fair to call a ""strategic acquisition binge.""
First was the pickup of Nine Systems, which helped Akamai build out capability in video serving (though the big name here, YouTube, has gone with Akamai's upstart competitor Limelight).
And just this week, Akamai announced that it is picking up Netli, one of the companies I specifically mentioned as a competitive threat when I wrote about AKAM last fall. Netli's strength is in application serving, so this should help Akamai increase its presence in the ""software as service"" markets, providing reliable and fast access to the important web-based applications that are increasingly relied upon by corporations, even though AKAM doesn't expect much impact on the bottom line from Netli right away. (At least these two smallish acquisitions shouldn't cause the kind of headaches that Speedera did, with the weakened margins and short-term cost issues that deal brought to the table.)
So what's next? Kontiki has already been acquired by Verisign (NASDAQ:VRSN). Mirror Image Internet is probably too tiny and is already owned by Xcelera (and in a patent dispute with Speedera). Radiance Technologies seems to offer a similar product, but is so teensy (less than one hundredth of Akamai's sales) that I'm not sure what the point would be. Some other tiny software companies like Resonate are in this space, but I can't say I really understand what differentiates all of them.
It's hard to see how most of the download-speeding-software companies like Akimbo would offer anything that Akamai doesn't already provide, and upload-enablers like On2 likewise could possibly be useful, but as far as I can tell they're essentially providers of compression software and don't seem to offer anything compelling that Akamai doesn't already have. Little fish accelerator providers like Propel don't seem to be swimming in the same waters as Akamai, with their offerings for dial-up modem users.
I don't expect they'd significantly alter their strategy by acquiring one of the peer-to-peer enablers like Brilliant Digital Entertainment or BitTorrent, though BitTorrent is often mentioned as one of the biggest threats to Akamai's future. More mainstream data hosters like SAVVIS and physical server farm managers like Equinix aren't really in the same kind of high-margin optimization business as Akamai, nor is Network Appliance with its hardware offerings in this space. I guess they could always acquire a fiber network to build out their own physical capacity, such as Globix might provide, but owning underground cables doesn't really help provide Akamai with any new proprietary capabilities.
Really, I'm not aware of any other big competitors out there that Akamai might take over, aside from Limelight -- and perhaps that's the point. With a stratospheric evaluation that only looks reasonable if you foresee some serious growth ahead, Akamai really needs to keep a handle on their space and remain the dominant provider. Thanks to strong relationships with a wide swath of customers and ISPs, these strategic acquisitions that have strengthened their capabilities in the growth areas of internet video and application delivery, and a huge physical advantage with their international network of servers, I remain somewhat confident that they'll continue to deserve this valuation.
Especially if they run out of competitors.
Disclosure: I own shares of Akamai, and don't plan to buy or sell in the near future.

19564,20114,2006-10-31T10:21:27-05:00,,"Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) was an exception in my portfolio. I typically avoid high P/E high market cap companies, but Akamai had a unique and dominant position in the marketplace that I felt people overlooked. But I’ve synthetically hedged out Akamai holdings since September 22. Brightcove, a company I have written about, released their video content distribution platform today. It seemed necessary to footnote what I have written before and summarize why I’ve closed the door on Akamai. First and foremost: Everyone is talking about Akamai and how great they are (this is a great example, and is what catalyzed me to action). I rarely read articles or speak with anyone who has anything bad to say about Akamai. This indicates the market has built in perfect expectations to the price. Of greater concern is whether Akamai is a high margin service provider, or a low margin hosting service. Today, Akamai exists to outsource hosting for companies using their large, distributed datacenter. Whether it is Salesforce.com, NBC, Apple iTunes, etc. - Akamai sells a distributed hosting infrastructure that ultimately is application agnostic. Building and operating large data centers is a depreciating barrier to entry. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) has them. Yahoo (YHOO) has them. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is building them. My blog is hosted on one. They are not the unique resource they used to be. Therefore, Akamai’s hardware infrastructure is no longer a unique advantage. They do have a compelling advantage on the sales side, with a large direct salesforce and great connections into the big media companies. This advantage is eroding as well. The issue is that Akamai offers nothing but hosting. Companies like Microsoft, Google, and Yahoo can add value beyond hosting. These companies all have the infrastructure to not just host content, but also pair it with the appropriate advertising to extract revenue. From 'Stay Tuned for an Akamai-Google Clash': This was before Google bought YouTube. Google bought YouTube because they wanted to monetize the video content. Akamai provides an agnostic solution that requires the content owners to monetize the content. Extracting value from content is inherently a higher margin business than hosting it on a server. I believe that Google, Yahoo, Microsoft can better pair content and advertising for each individual viewer. NBC, CBS, ABC, etc. evolved in a world (broadcast TV) where 50mm people all view the same content and advertising. It is hard to imagine they will evolve better advertising systems than the ones already evolving within the search behemoths. The cost of hosting quality content that can generate revenue will be zero. Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, and others will line up for the chance to cache content for free in order to pair advertising with it (extracting a success based fee). Akamai has no means and has shown no interest beyond operating a very sophisticated hosting company (see 'Brightcove vs. Akamai' from Feb ‘06). This business model does not deserve a triple digit P/E. Hosting is a commodity. Akamai’s service is no different. The market will eventually price this in; next week, next month, or next year. I don’t want to be a stockholder when it does. I can calculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men. - Isaac Newton AKAM 1-yr chart:"
19397,20106,2006-10-27T10:30:15-04:00,,"Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) is a company that delivers video on demand better then any business on the internet. Their technology allows them to allocate their resources in such a way that they can send internet viewers to the servers located closest to them, which vastly speeds up the delivery of the rich media that we love and crave on the net. With 2006 having shaped up to be, the year of video on the net, Akamai has benefited not just from organic growth, but has consistently brought on new business partners as well. After reporting their 3rd quarter earnings, it’s clear that Akamai continues to demonstrate their leadership in this industry. In looking at their numbers, they earned revenue of $111 million, up 11% over just three months ago and up 47% compared to the same period last year. Their profits for the quarter amounted to almost $42 million in normalized net income, up over 17% from last quarter and an astonishing 90% increase over their normalized net earnings from a year ago. The company also increased guidance for the upcoming year during their conference call. By all accounts, Akamai had yet another tremendous quarter and management should be congratulated for executing and extending their leadership in the VOD space. Now normally, this type of wild growth would leave me frothing at the mouth with excitment. The VOD market is hot, young and Akamai is in an excellent position to lead the industry. Despite all of the possibilities however, these numbers aren’t the sweet spot that investors thought that they would be. Instead their most recent earnings report is likely to leave investors feeling very sour after many realize that much of Akamai’s potential growth has already been priced into the stock. If you ask the average investor what Akamai’s stock is worth, they will tell you it’s around $50 as of today’s close. While theoretically this is true, in reality Akamai stock is really worth $7.6 Billion dollars. Over the last year, I’ve talked to many Akamai investors and have asked how they rationalize such an amazing valuation and they always point to the earnings as their justification for paying this much for a stock that makes less then a half a billion dollars in revenue. Unfortunately for many investors though, they are in for a rude awakening tommorrow morning, when they realize for the first time that Akamai’s earnings, over the last year, have been artificially inflated by a special one time tax benefit from a year ago of $255 million. If you take into consideration this one time tax benefit, Akamai’s real net income was actually down 95% from a year ago. The reason why this is so important is because many companies trade based on a multiple of what their earnings are. More aggressive stocks deserve a higher multiple because theoretically, over time, the growth should cause earnings to catch up. More mature stocks will typically get a lower multiple because investors aren’t expecting the stock to maintain double digit growth rates. Based on the last 12 months worth of data before earnings, Akamai was trading at a P/E ratio of around 25. With the S&P trading around a multiple of 15, this isn’t an entirely unreasonable valuation for a stock like Akamai. In fact this is probably a low multiple for a stock delivering Akamai’s type of earnings growth. The problem is though, that with this latest earnings announcement, the one time tax benefit will now drop off and with the new earnings in place, investors who haven’t been doing their due diligence are about to learn that they really own a stock trading at a P/E multiple of 122. While the analysts and professional investors are fully aware of this one time tax benefit, the average investor certainly is not and at a P/E of 122, this valuation is more reminiscent of the internet bubble then a reflection of Akamai’s true growth potential. With Akamai’s one time tax benefit now apparent to all investors, I believe that we are about to see a massive deflating of the video on demand bubble that’s been building over the past year. To help put these numbers into perspective, lets assume that your daughter wants to open up a lemonade stand. Because you’ve agreed to subsidize the business by supplying the lemons and sugar, any revenue she takes in will be pure profit. What better profit margins could one ask for? Lets also assume that she hires her older brother to beat up competitors and create a monopoly, so that she can charge $2.50 per glass of lemonade. If she is able to sell 10 glasses a day for a full year, she would bring in around $8,200 in profits for the year. At a P/E multiple of 122, this would value her lemonade stand at $1 million dollars. Now I don’t know about you, but I’m not ready to pay a million dollars for a lemonade stand and investors shouldn’t be willing to pay that much for Akamai either. Of course Akamai’s business is a little more complicated then a lemonade stand, but a business should only be worth what it’s eventual exit strategy will be worth. The way I see it, a company can be acquired, they can issue a dividend and reward shareholders or they can buy back their own stock to enhance their value. While growth companies aren’t expected to do any of this, as the VOD industry eventually matures, Akamai will need to demonstrate shareholder value by utilizing one of these methods. In looking at their balance sheet, you can see that they have about $741 million in net assets. If you value the company on a book basis then, they closed today at about 10 times their book. Far too expensive for any business to seriously consider taking them over no matter how hot their technology is. With earnings now showing a multiple of 122, it would take years for Akamai to raise the cash necessary to buy back their business from shareholders. Considering that they earned just $65 million in profits over the last year, even at an aggressive growth rate, I don’t see this as a reality at these prices. Assuming that they eventually paid out $770 million a year as a dividend (this would be twice their revenue from the last 12 months) it would still only amount to a little over a 1% percent dividend based upon their current stock price. Growth investors will tell you that my numbers are too low and that I’m not taking into account their years of 50% + future growth, but the reality is that there is very little upside from $7.6 billion unless you are prepared to wait at least 5 - 10 years for what could still end up being a minimal return. I believe this to be far too much risk to assume for too little potential return. If Akamai was a small cap stock, today’s earnings would have been very exciting indeed, but with the stock flirting with a large cap valuation, I see little for investors to be cheering about. While I believe strongly that Akamai’s greatest growth years are ahead of them, I’ve yet to see a valuation model that supports a market cap of $7.63 billion dollars. With only $385 million in revenue and $63 million in earnings over the past year, Akamai’s market cap trades at a valuation that many companies who are already earning billions in revenue, still don’t even have. Saavy investors may have been aware of this tax issue for the last year, but many investors who have piled on over the last year will find this news very sour indeed. While I believe that when life gives you lemons, you should make lemonade, I believe even more in never paying $1 million dollars for the neighborhood lemonade stand. In looking at the role that Akamai plays in a portfolio, I think that investors would be wise to consider the risk that they may be over paying for unrealized potential.

Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) manages online traffic for 21 of the game's 35 advertisers. Clients include GoDaddy, Garmin (NASDAQ:GRMN), Budweiser (NYSE:BUD), and several auto manufacturers. Akamai's Ad-Web Traffic Metrics reported that during the game's halftime, those sites were seeing about 228,000 visits per minute. After an overnight pullback, traffic resumed at that rate by 9 a.m., which was 115% above normal. By noon, advertiser sites were getting 300 million visitors a minute, 85% greater than normal. ""Advertisers were seeing some great residual effects from their spots,"" said Jennifer Donovan, a spokeswoman for Akamai.    In contrast to last year, ""There were no clear winners in traffic,"" Donovan said. This could be because marketers, generally, are more savvy about promoting and using the Net for clients. ""The rise was across the board, indicating more advertisers did a better job of using the Internet to drive traffic. She cited GoDaddy for its spot which included a Web site URL in the lower right corner. ""They definitely saw some great spikes,"" she said.  Listen to Jennifer Donovan talk about strong gains in traffic to Super Bowl advertisers' Web sites."
23999,20307,2007-01-11T14:58:04-05:00,,"At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Monday, I sat down for a chat with Mike Afergan, the chief technology officer at Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM), a company which seems well-positioned to take advantage from the growth of both Internet video and online commerce. The company’s business at the surface seems complex. But the basis for owning the stock is clear: as rich media traffic on the Web increases, Akamai should benefit. “There are very exciting times for Akamai,” Afergan said in a conversation we started in an empty meeting room at the Las Vegas Convention Center, then relocated to the end of a nearby hallway after a security guard booted us from the room. Akamai isn’t the easiest company to figure out; basically, they provide ways to make delivery of digital content more reliable. As Afergan notes, delivery of online movies, music and games all depends on reliable download times; so do e-commerce sites. Akamai’s network consists of about 26,000 servers in 2,500 locations in 70 countries, running Linux and Windows servers on cheap servers. The general idea is that in order to ensure visitors to Web sits get a reliable experience, you would to get the content on the Web as close to them as possible. Bears on Akamai contend the services the company offer boil down to commodity-like Web-hosting and caching; Afergen takes issue with that view, asserting that the company deals with far more complex issues, like making sure the right advertising content is served on Web pages based on geography, or managing TV blackout rules for online distribution of sports content. Afergen says the primary competition Akamai faces comes from companies trying to manage their Web traffic in house. “Build versus buy is the number one source of competition,” he says. He also notes, though, that companies want more than simply hosting services. Akamai also provides companies guidance on how to build their sites - and their business models. “In some cases, we’re in there a year or two in advance of product launches,” he says. Afergen says the company also provides customers advice on scalability. And he says Akamai offers companies a “platform for experiment and innovation.” One example: allowing companies to experiment with different pricing plans depending on geographic market. Afergen says the company has plenty of room for growth. Indeed, he says Akamai’s growth is “really at the beginning…some aspects of the business are just beginning to start up.” He sees “huge growth potential,” for instance in managing delivery of online media and entertainment, in particular video and social networking sites. Afergen wouldn’t talk about the numbers much; the company has not yet reported fourth quarter results. But he did say that for online businesses, there is “more and more need to have scalable business logic, which is where we shine the most.” And he adds that it has been the company’s internal goal to reach annual revenue of $1 billion, a level which the company should hit by 2010 or maybe sooner. Meanwhile, Katherine Egbert, an analyst at Jefferies & Co., this morning asserted that there could be $2 million to $5 million of upside in Akamai’s fourth quarter results, driven in part by “a solid online retail season.” She adds that “Internet and TV convergence, and growth in gaming could push revenue guidance for 2007 to the high end of the 32%-36% range.” Egbert expects fourth quarter revenue of $122 million, with pro forma profits of 26 cents a share. She has a Buy rating on the stock, and a $60 price target. Today, Akamai is up 67 cents at $54.46. AKAM 1-yr chart:"
19060,20123,2006-10-24T16:30:11-04:00,,"As Google set a new all-time high Monday afternoon, my thoughts turned to one of the few companies in my portfolio that has significantly outperfomed Google: Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM), which will report earnings for the quarter on Thursday. (Coincidentally, I have advocated before that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) should buy Akamai. Instead they used part of their big pile of cash to pick up YouTube, which I think makes plenty of sense given the weakness of Google Video.) I don't have any idea whether AKAM or will meet or beat its numbers, though it's been folly to bet against them in the recent past. But I do know that the Street will be watching closely. Akamai is one of those extremely rapid growers that everyone seems simultaneously infatuated with and very nervous about. Back when I was downsizing my margin exposure in the light of usurious interest rates, I sold a small portion of my Akamai holdings . But regardless of how fast it has climbed, and the trough from which it ascended, I can't get over thinking that this company remains in the sweet spot as broadband internet interactivity and rich media continue to grow (and as performance since then has indicated, I shouldn't have sold any of my AKAM). For those unfamiliar with the company, Akamai essentially acts as a traffic manager and content server for the Internet. They place servers around the world, within ISPs in many places, that serve up software, images, video and other big files (as well as plain old interactive websites) in a way that is faster and much more reliable than a single centralized server solution. Tom Leighton, co-founder of Akamai, summarized the capacity of Akamai in their analyst meeting last month: Akamai essentially offers four things to its customers, whether they want to run a network for their affiliates and franchisees, sell direct to consumers, serve big media files, or sell software as either a download or a service: speed, reliability, analytics, and security. Mike Afergan, the Chief Technology Officer of Akamai, explains the basic premise of the company: For the end-user, that means when your computer goes out to your ISP's servers to look for the Ford website (just an example -- I don't know if Ford is a client), the Akamai server that's colocated with your ISP already has most of the site loaded and can quickly get any personalized information you need through essentially a pre-screened channel to the main Ford.com servers, and it also already has the Flash or Ajax program loaded on that local server that will allow you to customize and see your dream car online, so that big chunk of data gets to your computer much faster. This ensures that any necessary downloads go through quickly, and prevents the long lag times that we all know cause (increasingly impatient) Internet users to quickly give up and move on. There are a few concerns with Akamai, and they've come up again and again over the past year or so as the shares have hit nosebleed growth levels but still trade at discount PEG ratios. Many folks want an excuse to sell Akamai after this runup, and these are a few that I've heard: Akamai's history is probably working against them in the stock market -- I expect plenty of people are very afraid of (or angry at) Akamai after their share price reached $250 or so in the dot com boom then collapsed to under a dollar in what seemed like a heartbeat. But if you consider the lessons that climb and fall taught them, their relationships with the most important companies in software, retailing and web services, and the time they've had to build a technological and sales lead without appreciable competition in the marketplace, I'd be hard pressed to bet against AKAM even as I acknowledge the temptation to sell shares that have appreciated by more than 200%. Akamai's goal is to have a billion dollars in revenue by 2010 (about 3X last year's level), and to grow at at least 30% a year. I see no reason to doubt them at this point, given the recent growth rate of 40-50%, or to believe that a forward PE of 40 or so is anything but a reasonable price to pay for a company with such excellent growth and with profit margins that, while already high, may even increase as they continue to scale up the network and client base. AKAM 1-yr chart:"
26186,20364,2007-02-06T08:05:11-05:00,,"Interesting reaction today to an M&A deal by Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) and what it says about the evolving nature of the Internet. Akamai helps big Web sites serve up traffic and has been one of the darlings of the second Internet build-out, its shares up over 150% in the last 12 months.
Yesterday the shares rose as high as 5% at $58.45 as the company announced it would buy privately held Netli of Mountain View, California, for $178 million in stock. Like Akamai, Netli’s data centers around the world let companies position copies of their Web sites in regional hubs so as to mitigate the effect of network failures. Netli customers were able to keep Web sites alive back in December even though an earthquake off the coast of Taiwan cut off much of the nation’s network capacity, for example.
Akamai’s purchase, say analysts, is important because more and more serious business programs are going to be run off of a Web site — think Salesforce.com’s (NYSE:CRM) project management software — and Netli’s technology will let Akamai move from merely juicing up Web sites to providing reliable transport of those important business apps.


Bracelin means that Akamai could have sales of as much as $615 million this year, which would be up roughly 45% from the $425 million it probably made last year. Which makes Akamai a pretty pricey stock on a price-to-sales basis, with a market cap of $9 billion and sales of only half a billion. But I suppose if growth at the company is indeed poised to accelerate, that’s a premium some may find justifiable.

17054,20317,2006-09-18T06:35:05-04:00,,"I've been on the Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) bandwagon for longer than any other stock I've been involved in. I wish I could tell you that what attracted me to it back when it was a single-digit puppy was some Mensa-level financial analysis, but it was not. Looking at the landscape of technology, and the lack of competition in AKAM's niche, the stock simply seemed to make sense.  The puppy has now grown into a pure-bred champ. The fundamentals still seem intact; in fact, they may be getting even better. My concern is that everyone seems to be realizing this now. AKAM has set a pattern of beating estimates in the face of skeptical analysts. Now the analysts are beginning to get in front of the company, and the bar is being raised. For example, after having the company at a ""hold"" for $20+, Deutsche Bank's (NYSE:DB) analyst upgraded it to a ""buy"" last Thursday in what almost seemed like a bearish towel toss. With digital distribution of everything except solids now part of our daily lives, any investors who have not come around to the importance of AKAM to that process are late to the party, to say the least. AKAM will probably grow into a behemoth with time, but for my money, the current stock price already knows that. I have a large position in this stock, and it is time to cash in a good chunk of it. That way, if the stock pulls back, I'll have something to buy without much thought. AKAM 1-year chart:   Disclosure: Fil Zucchi may have positions in the securities mentioned in this article."
16952,20307,2006-09-15T05:07:45-04:00,,"Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) said at a meeting with analysts on Wednesday that the company in 2007 should be able to grow revenue at least 30% and profits at least 35%. It was the first analyst meeting the company has held in four years, and to read the response from the Street, it was worth the wait.



Deutsche Banks’ Todd Raker  raised his rating on the stock Buy from Hold, and increased his price target on the company to $55 from $33. “We have consistently viewed AKAM as the best fundamental growth company in our coverage universe, but we downgraded to hold earlier this year due to valuation,” he wrote. “In hindsight, we have significantly under-estimated the growth in ARPU (average revenue per user) and we are adjusting our financial model to reflect a more aggressive stance on ARPU…AKAM’s value proposition is growing stronger as broadband penetration continues to grow.”
Michael Turits, of Prudential Securities raised his 2007 revenue forecast for the company to $569 million, from $542 million, with profits increasing to 91 cents a share from 81 cents. For 2006, he’s now at 59 cents, up from 58 cents. He continues to rate the stock Overweight, and raised his price target to $51 from $40.



Katherine Egbert, of Jefferies, likewise increased her 2007 forecast; she now sees revenue at $543 million, up from $530 million; her profit forecast jump to $1.14 a share, from $1.10. she’s at 84 cents for 2006. (No, I can’t quite explain the wide gap between her numbers and Prudential’s numbers.) She raised her price target to $47, from $45.
I do have one nit to pick here, which is that Akamai issued that 2007 guidance - its first for next year - without issuing a press release or filing an 8-K. I tracked down a copy of a 50-page transcript of their meeting on a subscription site; the only way for the average investor to track down what they actually said, rather than relying on third-hand reports would be to listen to an entire day’s worth of presentations. Not exactly the user friendly approach, Akamai."
15935,20123,2006-08-26T01:57:24-04:00,,"Well, I have to say that this wave of selling I've gone through has been exhausting. If you didn't read any of my earlier posts, I've decided to change tacks and reduce my margin exposure significantly in the wake of what have become usurious interest rates, takin profits in some companies, cementing losses in others, and selling both whole and partial positions along the way. So far, this initiative has led to sales of all or part of my holdings in Formfactor (NASDAQ:FORM), Imax (NYSE:IMAX), Middleby (NASDAQ:MIDD), Rofin Sinar (NASDAQ:RSTI), and Lionsgate (LGF). Essentially, what I've philosophically determined is that if I'm going to borrow money to buy shares, it needs to be something I'm absolutely committed to, something that I think has a short term chance of significant returns (less than a year), and something that I'm willing to pay extra attention to. The flip side of that is that I need to focus a bit more on taking profits on stocks that I hold on margin and that have had significant (100%+) runups. I may prefer to hold many of these companies for the long term, and, in non-margin accounts, I often will. However, in my margin account I need to focus on taking profit when I can do so and pay off the margin loan I've taken out. Thus, I'm taking some profits in a company that I really like, but that has climbed about 170% for me in a year or so -- Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM). I'm not willing to sell all of my AKAM shares as I was with Formfactor, another tech company that has had a remarkable run -- I still think there's good visibility for a strong future for Akamai, but there are also certainly some significant risks, largely due to increasing competition in their space (from bitTorrent, Limewire, and possibly, in the future, Google ... among others) but also due to Akamai's stock market run. While it can be argued that the shares are priced fairly based on very high estimates for next year's earnings, this is a high PE company in a turbulent sector. Since I've borrowed money to buy this one, I need to sell a few shares and pay off that loan before I can feel comfortable holding on through the next couple years. I think delivering high bandwidth commercial content -- from software to multimedia files to services -- is a growth industry, and one that Akamai is poised to lead. I don't think that their competition will be a significant threat, as I believe the market is growing fast enough to let several growing companies fluorish, and no one has the customer base of Akamai ... but I'm not positive, and it's always possible that a better mousetrap will appear. And I also fear that any hiccups in their operations -- a missed quarter -- will cause a marked selloff in the shares. I'd rather sell this small portion (about a third of my holdings) on my own terms, at a fair price, than be forced to sell at a discount in the future. So my Akamai position has been reduced a bit, taking a profit of roughly 170% on the shares I've sold Wednesday. I will continue to hold the remainder of my position at an average cost of about $14.26. AKAM 1-yr chart:"
14361,20246,2006-07-26T10:30:36-04:00,,"Limelight Networks announced today that it had closed a $130mm equity financing from Goldman Sachs Capital Partners. Limelight is a five year old company that has become the leading Content Delivery Network for next-generation media companies seeking to serve primarily video content and music files.
The company serves customers in high growth industries like online video, internet pornography, and gambling, and counts the likes of YouTube, MySpace, Facebook, IFilm, FoxNews.com, and Xbox Live as customers. According to PaidContent.org, the company is on a $60mm annual run-rate having booked $14.5mm in revenue this past quarter with 40% sequential quarterly growth.
By comparison, Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) generated roughly $90mm in revenue last quarter on 10% sequential growth with an estimated 20% - 30% rumored to have come from serving media.
Limelight's strong growth in the face of competition from Akamai and other CDNs is an indication that it is offering digital media customers a video-optimized network and a set of services that are more relevant and price competitive.
As a VC, I've seen this first hand as a number of online video and gaming startups have chosen Limelight over Akamai and others for these reasons. There are certainly questions regarding how rapidly pricing pressure will erode the margins in this segment of the industry, but it's clear that Limelight represent a significant threat to Akamai, if not a likely acquisition opportunity.

Be advised that earnings estimates can change without notice and may have already changed prior to the preparation of this note. Conjecture: With all the options pricing in a big move and with this having been a high-flyer, you are more likely than not to see a decent price change up or down. The short interest actually looks fairly tame in the name with short interest ratio only showing 3.3%. Analyst Calls: Even though the street and momentum traders have been behind the stock and even with all the positive business trends, the analysts on the street have a more cautious outlook because the stock has reached and greatly exceeded many of the street targets. Chart: AKAM has been on a tear and is up almost 175% off last year's lows. If AKAM falls short or fails to offer much upside then something to note on its chart is this: AKAM could fall all the down to $30.25 or so and not do any significant damage to what has been its uptrend. If this gaps over that $35.00 mark into new territory then we are back into the old 2000 and 2001 levels from when the stock was worth a ""Bajillion-Zillion""....... Options: Options traders appear to be braced for a move of $2.75-$3.10 in either direction, and based on the chart information that doesn't seem out of whack."
7022,20114,2006-02-22T03:23:28-05:00,,"Brightcove is a middleman, providing a mechanism for video content owners like NBC, Reuters, etc. to syndicate their content. Brightcove inserts advertisements into the video stream and distributes the revenue from advertisers to content owners and syndicating websites. It’s like Google AdSense for Video. We’re investors in Akamai (AKAM) and I consider it a key holding. They own large servers in many peering locations across the net. Media companies contract with Akamai to cache their data at these remote sites- for example, Apple (AAPL) runs iTunes on the Akamai infrastructure. This caching distributes network load, provides scaling for peak usage periods, and prevents QoS problems to ensure the media viewer has a quality experience (funny how QoS is going mainstream as an acronym isn’t it?). Akamai has a large software and hardware infrastructure investment to enable this distributed hosting. It appears to us that Brightcove’s business model is just a subset of Akamai’s - they already act as a middleman between the media owner and the viewer. Brightcove has a really neat idea but does it have big barriers to entry? A Brightcove competitor is quoted in the WSJ article: He’s right - scale is important - you want to have lots of media customers and lots of viewers to provide advertisers with that one-stop shop. Last quarter, Akamai spent $23M in sales and marketing to media customers. They already do business with the folks who want to syndicate their media. Brightcove, according to the WSJ, has only two salespeople. Brightcove’s last funding round was just $16M. Which company do you think can scale media customers faster? Akamai already has a large physical infrastructure that is profitable, something that is a huge barrier to entry. They are missing the advertising component. The media to be syndicated is already on or could be easily added to their server infrastructure. They could put the same licensing interface together as Brightcove and run it on their mature caching platform to ensure viewers have a quality experience. Then they sell it to their existing customer base. It’s not rocket science. For that matter, Brightcove’s business model may be running on top of the Akamai infrastructure. Akamai won’t disclose customers, but it’s a safe guess. Brightcove (or one of its four competitors) is either a great acquisition target for Akamai, allowing them to leverage their existing infrastructure in a new way, or a company they could snuff out with a flick of their finger.

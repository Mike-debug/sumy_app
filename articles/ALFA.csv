There are two reasons why I believe investors should avoid this fund: Poor performance and high fees.Fund DescriptionBelow are some important details about the fund, including its costs, objectives and holdings.Total Expense Ratio: 0.95%Fund selection processAs the image below from the ALFA fact sheet shows, ALFA looks at the holdings of hedge funds that are reported quarterly and selects stocks that are ranked highly by the proprietary Clone score.[ALFA Fact Sheet]Variable Market HedgeWhat makes ALFA different from competing ETFs that also track hedge fund holdings is the fact that ALFA employs a variable market hedge. The market hedge is off when the S&P 500 is below its 200-day moving average at the end of the month. The hedge is on when the S&P 500 is below the 200 day moving at the end of the month.ALFA HoldingsPoor PerformanceThere are three ETFs in the category of ETFs that follow 13-F filers: ALFA, the Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSEARCA:GURU) and Direxion iBillionaire Index ETF (NYSEARCA:IBLN).ALFA vs. GURUALFA and GURU launched within a week of each other in 2012 and thus that is the first performance timeframe that I looked at. The table below shows that since inception GURU has returned 82.40% vs. 57.85% for ALFA. Even with a market hedge that is supposed to help mitigate losses, ALFA has consistently underperformed GURU, which has no hedge.[Dividend Channel]ALFA vs. IBLNThe next timeframe I looked at was to compare the performance of ALFA to IBLN since the inception for IBLN in August 2014. IBLN has had a total return of 12.74% since inception and ALFA over that same period has returned 0.41%. ALFA did outperform IBLN initially, however, IBLN surprisingly outperformed during a large correction.[Dividend Channel]Correction PerformanceThe unique thing about ALFA is its variable hedge, which is supposed to help it outperform during corrections. From the intermediate high on November 3rd 2015 to the lows on February 11th 2016, ALFA did outperform GURU; however, it still underperformed IBLN even though the ALFA hedge was on during part of this period.[Google Finance][ALFA Fact Sheet]Performance vs. Long/Short ETFBecause ALFA has the ability to become a long/short fund when the hedge is enabled I thought it was worth comparing ALFA to the largest long/short ETF, which is the First Trust Long/Short Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:FTLS). The first chart below looks at the same correction period performance as I looked at in the previous section. As you can see, FTLS outperformed ALFA by a little over 2.50% during this correction period. The second chart below shows that since the inception for FTLS, it has significantly outperformed ALFA evening though over that entire time period FTLS has been long & short, while ALFA has been 100% long the majority of the time. The table above shows that since September 2014, when FTLS was launched, the hedge for ALFA has been off for 24 of 29 months [82.76%].[Google Finance][Dividend Channel]High FeesALFA charges the highest price in the category and yet over its history as I showed above, it has consistently underperformed. Therefore, I do not believe that owning ALFA is worth the extra cost in comparison to competing ETFs. On a side note, since I compared ALFA to FTLS I should make sure to note that FTLS charges 1.47%, which is 0.52% above that of ALFA. However, FTLS since its inception has outperformed ALFA by nearly 27%, therefore, I believe FTLS is worth the extra cost.Closing ThoughtsIn closing, I believe investors should take into account the poor performance and high segment fees before considering ALFA. With the variable market hedge having only been triggered for five months in its history, as I showed above under the ""correction performance"" section, ALFA still underperformed a competing ETF that is pure long during that period.Disclaimer: See here."
3335215,30441,2015-07-17T17:20:45-04:00,ALFA is a dynamically managed ETF based on hedge fund replication.It embeds a timing rule to hedge its holdings in market-neutral mode.Investors can use the asymmetry in risk-reward offered by this rule.,"The AlphaClone Alternative Alpha ETF (BATS:ALFA) relies on the idea that a collective brain of famous fund managers should deliver a significant and steady return. ALFA selects fund managers based on their past performances after publication of their holdings. It uses a ""clone score"", described as below in the factsheet:In other words, past performances must be good, and also replicable. ALFA has diversification rules: the minimum number of holdings is 13, no single one can be more than 15% of NAV and the largest 5 holdings together cannot be more than 50%. When I write this, the largest holding is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) with 7.43%, the top 5 holdings represent 20.46%. ALFA takes only long positions on individual stocks, it doesn't follow short sales nor implements other strategies.The Global X Guru ETF (NYSEARCA:GURU) tracks another index based on a similar duplication model. The main reason why I prefer ALFA over GURU is a hedging rule putting the portfolio in market-neutral mode when the S&P 500 index falls below its 200-day simple moving average.The decision to enter, quit or maintain the hedge is made at the end of each month for the next full month. This blog post by Alphaclone's CEO explains the choice of an end-of-month timing to avoid whipsaws, with a study on past data since 1950.ALFA was launched on 5/31/2012 and the underlying index in October 2011, but the latter has been calculated starting in 2001. The next hypothetical equity curve shows that ALFA would have been in market-neutral mode during the worst periods of the 2 last recessions, after the flash-crash of 2010 and also the August 2011 correction (chart from solactive.com).Alphaclone index guidelines specifies that the market-neutral state is attained byNo mention is made of selling holdings, so we can suppose that the hedge is taken on margin. When the hedge is on, the ETF returns the alpha of a stock portfolio chosen by some of the best fund managers.ALFA is dynamically hedged smart money. It is possible to make it even safer by buying it at specific times. The risk is lower when the S&P 500 is below or close to its 200-day moving average. It is also lower at the end of the month, just before the hedging decision is made. If the benchmark falls or stays below the moving average, the drawdown is small (except in a flash crash scenario), and the ETF will be protected in market-neutral mode for the next month or more. If the trend is reverted, it may profit by the upside.When adding on an existing position, it is also possible to play on the quantity to control the new average buy price. For M shares at $P per share and N shares at $Q per share, the average price is (MP+NQ)/(M+N). The idea is to calculate N so that it stays below the 200-day moving average. Given the correlation (0.74) and beta (1.08), ALFA follows the market moves quite closely. Using its own 200-day moving average to evaluate the level where the hedge would be triggered is a reasonable rule-of-thumb. It also provides a safety margin when ALFA is in a better position than the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY) relative to the moving average, like recently.Of course, the price can fall lower before the end of the month. The next table gives an idea of the maximum drawdown before the hedge is activated when we are 1 day, 1 week or 1 month before the next hedging decision, with the confidence interval offered by 87 years of data. It shows the maximum losses of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSEARCA:DIA) and the S&P 500. Numbers can be multiplied by 1.1 to take the beta into account.When buying in the last week of the month, the maximum drawdown before activating the hedge should be no more than 25% with a good confidence interval. Once in market neutral, ALFA returns its stock portfolio's alpha whatever happens in the market until the next bullish trend. The long moving average and the monthly trigger are supposed to avoid whipsaws.Conclusion:Past data are not a guarantee for ALFA future returns, but the structure of its underlying index makes it a good buy-and-hold investment with a strong asymmetric bias. Its hedging rule reduces possible drawdowns, and also allows to build a position step by step with a better control of the value-at-risk."

3478456,66263,2015-08-31T10:46:47-04:00,"ALFA allows the retail investor to ""invest with the best"".ALFA has shown market-beating performances since inception, with superior upside and downside capture ratios, but also higher volatility.Barring a final-day rally, ALFA is about to go into market-neutral mode.","The AlphaClone Alternative Alpha ETF (BATS:ALFA) is an ETF that tracks the AlphaClone Hedge Fund Long/Short Index. This index contains U.S.-listed equity securities to which hedge funds and institutional investors have disclosed significant exposure. An interesting feature of the index is that it uses AlphaClone's proprietary ""Clone Score"" methodology to aggregate the ideas of hedge funds for which historically it has made the most sense to follow based on their disclosures. Additionally, index constituents are equal weighted but have an overlap bias (i.e., securities held by twice the number of managers have twice the weight).In a recent article entitled ""The AlphaClone Alternative Alpha ETF May Be The Safest Equity Ticker,"" Seeking Alpha author Fred Piard elegantly summarizes the methodology of ALFA as thus:Investing in ALFA therefore allows the retail investor to ""invest with the best"" (while avoiding 2 and 20 fee structure associated with investing in hedge funds). Only holdings from top managers are chosen for inclusion in the index - holdings from mediocre managers are not considered. ALFA was incepted in May 2012, and charges an expense ratio of 0.95%. Another hedge fund-duplicating ETF is the Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSEARCA:GURU).PerformanceThe following chart shows the total return performance of ALFA and the U.S. market (NYSEARCA:SPY) since inception of ALFA.ALFA Total Return Price data by YChartsWe can see from the chart above that ALFA has pretty much led SPY wire-to-wire since inception.However, the higher return of ALFA has been accompanied by higher volatility. The following chart shows the 3-year annualized standard deviation (volatility), return, Sharpe and Sortino ratios for ALFA and SPY (source: Morningstar).We can see from the above chart that ALFA has been about 30% more volatile than SPY over the past three years. This has led to ALFA's Sharpe ratio of 1.78 being lower than SPY's at 1.93. Interestingly, however, the Sortino ratio, which unlike Sharpe ratio only takes into account downside (and not upside) volatility, slightly favors ALFA at 4.36 vs. SPY at 4.26. This is consistent with ALFA's impressive upside and downside capture ratios over the past 1 and 3-year periods, as shown in the chart below (source: Morningstar).The chart above shows that over the past 3 years, ALFA has managed to return an extra 7% over the S&P 500 in positive months for the market, while decreasing 18% less than the S&P 500 in negative months for the market. Its 1-year upside and downside capture ratios are even more impressive, at 130% and 52% respectively. Obviously, SPY captures 100% of both the upside and downside of the S&P 500.Additionally, ALFA has had a 0.84 correlation with SPY since inception (source: InvestSpy).HoldingsThe higher volatility of ALFA compared to SPY may be partially attributed to the fact that ALFA's portfolio is quite concentrated, with the top 10 holdings accounting for 31.85% of assets, compared to only 17.03% for SPY. Moreover, ALFA currently holds only 73 stocks, compared to the 500 in the S&P 500.The following table shows the top 10 stocks held in ALFA and SPY.Besides AAPL, which constitutes 7.25% and 3.75% of ALFA and SPY, respectively, the two funds do not have any top-10 holdings in common.Hedging mechanismALFA has an interesting hedging mechanism, which when enforced shorts the S&P 500 in an amount equal to the value of the fund's long holdings. In other words, ALFA becomes market neutral when the hedge is activated. The trigger for the activation is simple - almost too simple, at first glance - it's when the S&P 500 falls below its 200-day simple moving average [SMA] at month's end.Why month's end, which seems like an arbitrary day to choose? Why not the 15th of each month, or the 19th? Surprisingly, choosing the end of each month as the trigger was more effective than the seemingly more logical ""5 consecutive days below 200 SMA"" rule on data from 1950 to 2014, presumably because the portfolio was hedged less in a long-term secular rising market.Which brings us to the main purpose of this post, which is to inform investors that, unless the S&P 500 gains in excess of 4.35% (from 1988.87 to 2075.41) on the last trading day of August, i.e. in one trading day's time, ALFA's hedging mechanism is about to be activated for the first time.Interestingly, this is not the first time that the S&P 500 has dipped below its 200 SMA since ALFA's inception. As can be seen from the chart below, this has happened at least twice since May 2012.But now let's take a closer look at each of those two instances. The first event took place in November 2012, around the time of the ""fiscal cliff"" negotiations.We can see from the above chart that the S&P 500 dipped below the 200 SMA in mid-November, but then recovered above the 200 SMA by month's end. Hence, ALFA's hedge was not activated.A similar phenomenon was observed in October 2014:TakeawayWhat does this mean for investors? If you already own ALFA, you have two basic choices (assuming that the S&P 500 does not rally 4.35% over the weekend).For investors who do not yet own ALFA and are considering whether or not to buy this fund, they should be aware that the ETF, if purchased in September, will be a market-neutral fund for at least that month, and then for every month after that until the S&P 500 breaks above its 200 SMA at month's end."
3604066,66263,2015-10-26T14:21:11-04:00,"ALFA's hedge was triggered for the first time at the start of last September.Unfortunately, ALFA's recent performance has been uninspiring.This analysis reveals two likely reasons for ALFA's underperformance since the hedge was activated.","In my Aug. 31, 2015 article entitled ""ALFA: A Market-Beating ETF About To Go Market-Neutral"" I reported that the AlphaClone Alternative Alpha ETF (BATS:ALFA) was about to go market-neutral for the first time since its inception due to the S&P 500 closing below its 200-day moving average at month-end. I also commented on the fact that ALFA has had significant wire-to-wire outperformance vis-a-vis the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY) since inception (see chart below), suggesting that investors in ALFA benefited from being able to ""invest with the best."" Recall that ALFA uses a proprietary ""Clone Score"" methodology in order to aggregate the ideas of hedge funds which have strong historical performance.Alas, ALFA can no longer lay claim to this achievement. Its total return performance since inception now trails SPY by some 15% (55% vs. 70%).ALFA Total Return Price data by YChartsZooming up to the time frame since the hedge was triggered at the start of September (it was actually activated at the market close on Sep. 2nd) reveals that most of the relative underperformance occurred over the last month.ALFA Total Return Price data by YChartsReconstructing ALFA's return without the hedgeRecall that when the hedge is triggered (caused by the S&P 500 closing below its 200-day moving average at month-end), ALFA shorts the S&P 500 in an amount equal to the notional value of its long holdings. In other words, ALFA becomes market-neutral.Obviously, given that SPY has (as of last week) reclaimed its 200-day moving average in a brief span of two months, the hedge appears to be ill-timed. Nevertheless, investors in ALFA must be prepared to accept the fact that this hedging strategy will likely underperform in whipsaw situations, such as what was observed over the past two months, as part of the cost of protecting oneself from the worst of bear markets.I wanted to see whether the severe underperformance of ALFA was due to the hedge being triggered, or something else. Therefore, I reconstructed the total return of ALFA since the start of September to visualize what the return profile of ALFA would have been if the hedge had not been activated.We can see from the chart above that had the hedge not been activated, the hypothetical 100% long ALFA (denoted ALFA-L in the graph above) would have returned -1.95% since Sep. 1st, compared to -8.14% for the actual ALFA. While this alleviates the underperformance a bit, it is still far below that of SPY at 8.69%. So what can the rest of ALFA's underperformance be attributed to?Hedge fund darlings craterIn my previous article, I compared the top 10 holdings of ALFA and SPY.How have the top 10 stocks of ALFA fared over the past two months? Answer: not pretty.AAPL Total Return Price data by YChartsAs can be seen from the graph above, only 2 of ALFA's top 10 holdings at the start of September, PCLN (+12.44%) and AAPL (+10.55%), have outperformed SPY. There are three massive losers: SKX (-30.5%), HZNP (-41.2%) and VRX (-48.2%). Assuming that the weightings of those three stocks did not change over this time period, they would have contributed a total of -6.24% to the total return of ALFA over this time period. That actually accounts for over half the entire difference between the hypothetical unhedged ALFA-L (-1.95%) and SPY (8.69%) during this time!Now, I am aware that ALFA's holdings are not static, and hence the above calculation is merely an estimate. Nevertheless, it is clear that ALFA has been hit by a ""doubly-whammy"" of an untimely hedge, plus the underperformance of hedge fund darlings such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals (see this comically-timed Forbes article ""Hedge Fund Superstars Stocking Up On Valeant Pharmaceuticals"" that was published the day before VRX's price came crashing down). This illustrates an important fact: even the best and brightest in the industry can sometimes get it (very) wrong.Due to ALFA's heavy concentration in tech and biotech, one might say that SPY is not an appropriate benchmark for ALFA. The following chart therefore also shows the total return of the PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF (NASDAQ:QQQ) and the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (NASDAQ:IBB) since the start of September, as well that of another hedge fund-following ETF, the Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSEARCA:GURU). Unfortunately, ALFA still lags the other four ETFs, although the hypothetical ALFA-L (-1.95%) would have outperformed IBB (-5.12%) and closely trail GURU (-0.37%).ALFA Total Return Price data by YChartsSummaryThe last two months has not been kind to ALFA holders. Not only was the timing of the hedge unfortunate, but a number of the fund's largest holdings have suffered tremendously, particularly VRX and HZNP, whose pricing practices have come under intense scrutiny. Will ALFA rebound in the future? I don't know. As of today, VRX and HZNP are still two of ALFA's top 10 holdings, at 3.30% and 2.00% weights, respectively, suggesting that ALFA's future performance may still be somewhat tethered to the fates of those two specialty pharmaceutical companies. Moreover, note that while ALFA is currently in market-neutral mode, this will change if the S&P 500 manages to remain above its 200-day moving average for one more week, as the end of the month is near."
3975964,66263,2016-05-18T09:16:31-04:00,"ALFA continues to disappoint in 2016.Poor stock selection hurt fund performance in the first few months of the year.The hedging strategy appears to have been hurt by market whipsaw, again.","IntroductionSince my first analysis of the AlphaClone Alternative Alpha ETF (NYSEARCA:ALFA) ""ALFA: A Market-Beating ETF About To Go Market-Neutral"" published Aug. 31, 2015, the ETF has done nothing but disappoint (writer's curse?). ALFA tracks an index of U.S. stocks owned by hedge funds and institutional investors, as selected using AlphaClone's proprietary ""Clone Score"" methodology, which ranks managers according to whether it would have been profitable to follow their disclosures in the past. Presumably, this allows investors to ""invest with the best"", and the fund outperformed the broader market over the first three years of inception (May 2012).The fund also employs a momentum-based hedging strategy. When the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) falls below its 200-day simple moving average [SMA] at month's end, ALFA will short the market in an amount equal to the notional value of the fund's long holdings. In other words, ALFA becomes market neutral when the hedge is activated. The hedge is removed when the S&P 500 closes above the 200 SMA at month end. Ostensibly, such a strategy is meant to protect investors from the worst of bear markets, by moving to a market neutral stance when the technical level is breached.Alas, this type of hedging strategy is susceptible to whipsaws, as we saw in the second half of 2015. As described in ""ALFA Underwhelms As Hedge Fund Darlings Crater Plus An Untimely Hedge"", ALFA's hedge was slightly beneficial in the first month in which it was activated (SPY: -2.64% in Sep. 2015), but was sadly misplaced in October when SPY roared back with a total return of +8.30%, recapturing the 200 SMA in the process.Where does ALFA stand now?In my last ALFA article in Oct. 2015, ALFA's performance since inception had trailed SPY by some 15%. Half a year later, that disparity has widened to 35%.ALFA Total Return Price data by YChartsWhat happened? Looking at the price action of SPY over the past six months, it seems that the hedge was possibly activated at the end of last year, due to index falling just barely below the 200 SMA. This would mean that for the first three months of the year, ALFA would have adopted a market neutral position.January underperformanceSomewhat strangely though, despite ALFA's hedge, its performance in Jan. 2016 was even worse than that of SPY. In January, SPY lost -4.98% in value, but ALFA declined by -7.20%. Perhaps the hedge was not activated after all, given how near the close price was to the 200 SMA?ALFA Total Return Price data by YChartsTo figure out whether or not ALFA was hedged in January, I plotted the daily price return percentages of ALFA vs. those of SPY for that month. As the graph below shows, the correlation was extremely weak (R^2 = 0.05). This suggests that ALFA was indeed hedged in January.Given that ALFA was hedged in January, its actual ""unhedged"" performance that month must have been even worse. Recall that SPY lost about -5% in January. Thus, the underlying holdings of ALFA actually declined by -12% that month!Looking back at the holdings of ALFA from my last article, one can begin to understand why. Late last year, the top five holdings of ALFA were Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Valeant Pharmaceuticals (VRX), Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ:CELG), Horizon Pharma (NASDAQ:HZNP) and Allergen (NYSE:AGN), which are all technology or biotechnology/pharmaceutical stocks. Plotting the year-to-date performance of ALFA with the PowerShares QQQ ETF (i.e. NASDAQ) (NASDAQ:QQQ) and the iShares NASDAQ Biotechnology Index (NASDAQ:IBB) reveals that both technology stocks and biotechnology stocks have lagged the broader market in the first few months of this year. Given ALFA's previous concentration in those two sectors, this could be another reason for the ETF's significant underperformance in 2016.ALFA Total Return Price data by YChartsLooking aheadSo far in 2016, ALFA has been a disappointment. Its hedging strategy protected it somewhat from the -4.98% decline of SPY in January, but also made it unable to participate in the market's 6.72% rally in March. Hence, ALFA appears to have been hurt by market whipsaw, again, in 2016.Given that the S&P 500 has now reclaimed its 200 SMA, ALFA is 100% long in the market. The top 10 holdings of ALFA are shown in the table below, as well as in chart form.We can see that currently, ALFA only holds a single biotechnology/pharmaceutical stock in its Top 10 holdings, a massive decrease from late last year where half of the Top 10 were in this sector. Probably, the underperformance of this sector in 2016 caused hedge funds and institutional managers to sell out of those stocks. Valeant, the second largest holding of ALFA late last year, is conspicuously absent from the current portfolio.Instead, hedge funds and institutional managers appear to have shifted into technology stocks, with ALFA having tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Alphabet as top holdings. If the tech sector is able to get out of its current slump, ALFA could yet shine."

This article looks into two ETFs that were designed almost at the same time and are based on hedge fund stock picks: the AlphaClone Alternative Alpha ETF (BATS:ALFA) and the Global X Guru ETF (NYSEARCA:GURU). Their business models rely on the idea that a ""collective brain"" of famous hedge fund managers should deliver a significant and steady alpha. Hedge Funds typically charge a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee. Investors are submitted to various constraints, among them a minimum capital and planned redemption dates. ALFA and GURU are charging under 1% in net annual expense ratios, and shares can be bought and sold by any investor on any trading day. It makes them attractive for people who are not eligible as hedge fund customers. Each of them is based on a different rule-based strategy defined as an underlying index. More information about the methodologies can be found here and here.The next table gives a summary of their profiles:GURU is more liquid, but ALFA trading volume is increasing and more than sufficient for individual investors. ALFA is more diversified with more total holdings, but more concentrated in its top holdings. ALFA may take a short position in a reference index when market-timing rules are triggered, whereas GURU is long only.The following chart shows a comparison of the products with S&P 500 SPY since June 2012.Chart courtesy: freestockcharts.comBoth products have outperformed the benchmark since their inception. GURU has been leading until 2015, then ALFA took an advantage. This gives no clue to claim that one is better than the other on the long term.VolatilityThe first reason I prefer ALFA over GURU is a lower risk on this 3-year period, in terms of volatility (standard deviation) and drawdown. The next table shows detailed statistics since 6/4/2012.Timed hedgingIf ALFA incurs a lower risk in a bull market, it should be even more lower on one or several full market cycles. GURU is a dynamically managed fund, but it is neither hedged, nor timed.The second reason why I prefer ALFA is its variable market exposure, described as below in the factsheet:In other words, ALFA has a timed hedge using one of the oldest and best known market-timing indicators: a 10-month moving average threshold (in fact a month has about 21 trading days on average). It might not be the most accurate timing indicator, but it is the only one for which I have found a backtest on more than a century. The next table is drawn from Mebane Faber's booklet 'A Quantitative Approach to Tactical Asset Allocation' (2013 version).Like most timing indicators, the point is not bringing better returns, but a protection against extreme volatility. In the 1929 crisis, some investors have probably needed to withdraw some capital in emergency. It would have been easier with a 50% drawdown than a 83% one.Dynamic clone scoreBoth GURU and ALFA apply criteria to select hedge funds. ALFA uses a ""clone score"", described as below in the factsheet:GURU's factsheet describes criteria as below:Without more information, the description of ALFA clone score looks more synthetic (unique quantitative indicator) and dynamic (updated periodically).Role of ALFA in my portfolioALFA has 4 holdings above 3% of its net asset value (04/24/2015):Both products look good, but they are not equivalent. GURU is a valuable holding for investors who have the time and skills to manage the risk by timing, hedging or rebalancing tactics. ALFA is a better ""buy-and-forget"" product with a simple and proven protection tactic embedded in the underlying index. I manage a main account based on quantitative strategies, with a core stock portfolio, which is in a large part secured by a market-neutral model. Besides this, I have a passive compartment designed to take care of itself on a long period, in case I am unable to trade for any reason. I have chosen ALFA over GURU as a component of this passive part of my holdings."

In this article we provide an assessment of the two longest running ETFs, the Global X Guru Index ETF (NYSEARCA:GURU) and the AlphaClone Alternative Alpha ETF (BATS:ALFA).GURU and ALFA At a GlanceDespite both being ""copy-cat"" funds, GURU and ALFA are actually two quite different propositions.Key FeaturesFrom an investment strategy perspective, the GURU is designed to be 100% long, while the ALFA has the flexibility to go short by 50% subject to market technicals. In other words, one is a long-only equity fund, while the other aims to mimic long/short equity hedge funds by altering its market exposure over time. Due to its hedging ability, the ALFA appears to charge more for this feature, with the expense ratio close to 1%.Portfolio CharacteristicsA key difference between the two ETFs is their stock weighting methodology. GURU weights its positions equally, and has fewer positions in total. The ALFA applies variable weighting, with higher weights assigned to higher conviction names based on a proprietary scoring methodology. It is more concentrated than GURU in the top holdings, but has a long tail of smaller positions. It is difficult to say which method is more effective, only time will tell.Both portfolios comprise mainly of U.S. stocks, which is intuitive as hedge funds do not disclose their overseas holdings in 13F filings - unless they are U.S.-listed securities, such as ADRs.In terms of portfolio churn, both ETF portfolios have fairly high turnover ratios. For GURU, this is at a staggering 128%. We believe a high turnover is only justified if it results in superior performance, otherwise it typically cranks up excessive trading costs and impacts long-term returns.Portfolio CompositionAccording to Morningstar classifications, both ETFs have a pronounced mid/small-cap bias, as evidenced by their high allocation to SMID cap stocks. The ALFA has a more aggressive tilt than the GURU. From a sector perspective, we would note the high allocation to the tech sector of both funds, although it is not too far from market index weights, as defined by the Russell 1000 Index.Performance BenchmarkAs both ETFs are essentially U.S. equity funds and exhibit a mid-cap orientation, we believe the Russell 1000 Index (""R1000"") is an appropriate performance yardstick. The Vanguard Russell 1000 ETF (NASDAQ:VONE) tracks this benchmark and charges a 0.12% fee.Quantitative Analysis - Last 31 Months (1 Jul 2012 - 31 Jan 2015)Below is a summary table of key MPT statistics for the past 31 months, based on monthly data.Investment ResultsBoth the GURU and ALFA have done well over the past 31 months (since common inception date), posting modest outperformance versus the Russell 1000 Index.RiskBoth ETFs have exhibited higher volatility than the R1000 (as measured by the standard deviation). At ~11%, this is some 30% higher than the market index. From a beta perspective (sensitivity to equity market movements), both are also higher, at 1.20 and 1.08 respectively.AlphaAlpha is a measure of manager skill on a risk-adjusted basis, in other words it reconciles return and volatility to provide an indication of stocking picking skill. After accounting for volatility, the GURU's alpha is negative, and the ALFA's is mildly positive. GURU's outperformance over the R1000 appears to have been achieved with higher risk. At 1.2 beta, it is akin to R1000 running on steroids, but less efficient. To illustrate this point, if we levered the R1000 to a similar level (beta of 1.2x), this would have yielded better returns at lower volatility.Tracking ErrorGURU and ALFA are both high tracking error products, meaning their performance pattern can diverge significantly from the R1000 from time to time (both positive and negative) -- and benchmark-aware investors should be prepared to stomach this performance divergence.Risk Adjusted ReturnsBoth ETFs have posted identical and good risk-adjusted returns in terms of Sharpe Ratio. However, the slightly levered R1000 once again leaves both ETFs in the dust.Taking It All TogetherDespite outperforming the R1000 Index in the past 31 months, the alpha of these ETFs are not significant (and negative for GURU), after taking into account their volatility.A Longer Term PerspectiveFor better understanding of the performance pattern of these ETFs, we can look at the indices that they track, which has been back-tested over longer periods. However, one must note that these are ""back-tests"" and must be treated with a degree of caution. After all, a back-tested index must demonstrate favorable results before a ETF provider is willing to wrap it into an investment product. We do not know how conservative the index producers have been with their assumptions, so we will look no further back than the past 60 months (or five years).60 Month Statistics (1 Feb 2010 - 31 Jan 2015)The longer term stats paint a similar picture.Guru IndexAlpha is again negative over the past five years. Its higher return is explained by higher beta. A similar version (1.1x) of the R1000 would have achieved higher returns at lower levels of volatility.AlphaClone IndexAlpha is high at 4.6. This number is a result of a) lower volatility than the R1000 and b) similar level of return. Its 60-month beta is 0.66, a third of the market index. This implies that its market hedge mechanism must have kicked in during this 60 month period, which has provided some protection in down months of the R1000.Despite the existence of alpha, we would note the following:A Closer Look at Alpha PatternsWe believe outperformance from stock selection comes in waves, and is not constant. There will be extended periods when a portfolio performs well, and extended periods less well due to the existence of style biases (i.e. growth, value, size effect etc). These biases can be in, or out of favor with the market from time to time. To assess alpha patterns we look at the rolling 2-year excess returns versus the R1000. Our assessment period is the last 60 months, as above.Interestingly, the Guru Index has been losing altitude of late, with its margin of outperformance vs. the R1000 dropping fast. This points to a deterioration in its stock selection -- possibly due to style biases, a decline in the performance of hedge funds they track, the efficacy of their cloning process, or a combination. Meanwhile, the AlphaClone Index has lagged the R1000 for years (on a rolling 2 year basis), before taking a positive turn in late 2013. This is most likely because the index has very much been long-only and not market hedged since then.Tracking QualityOne final factor to consider is the quality of index replication.The good news is that both ETFs appeared to have tracked their underlying indices well after fees in real life. The tracking error is marginally higher for the GURU in the past two calendar years, despite having a lower fee than the ALFA.Our VerdictOver the past 31 months, the GURU and ALFA ETFs have performed well in absolute terms, although if one takes a closer look, reveals a different story.For GURU, we are concerned of its high beta, high portfolio turnover, and stock selection efficacy which has been decreasing recently.For ALFA, we are not big fans of its higher fees and market hedge, which has not been tested in real life. As long-term equity investors interested in maximum capital appreciation, we do not believe that market timing adds value. This is confirmed by the ALFA's subpar returns to the R1000 over the period under review.Based on our analysis, we remain skeptical of both ETFs' alpha potential."
1907661,58921,2013-12-19T12:19:15-05:00,,"AlphaClone Alternative Alpha ETF (BATS:ALFA) is a significant holding for me and my clients. It is a hedge fund replication fund, but instead of replicating the betas of a broad hedge fund index (like QAI, another favorite of mine and one that I use as a benchmark), ALFA seeks to ""clone"" the alpha of the best hedge funds by identifying the stock positions held in common by ""established hedge funds."" Some of the hedge funds and managers mentioned in their literature include such luminaries as Bridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio), Renaissance Technologies (Jim Simons), Greenlight Capital (David Einhorn), Pershing Square (Bill Ackman), and Paulson & Co. (John Paulson).AlphaClone Founder and CEO Maz Jadallah developed the proprietary techniques used by the fund and the underlying index, the AlphaClone Hedge Fund Long/Short Index. Their raw database consists of the 13f filings that all large (over $100 million in assets) money managers are required to file with the SEC each quarter listing their long portfolio positions. AlphaClone's proprietary Clone Score rates the reward to cloning the manager's past 13f filings, and they focus on the top 300 hedge funds based upon this score. Subsequent performance of 13f holdings may be greatly affected by a manager's rate of turnover. Some, like Renaissance Technologies, have very high turnover, which limits the usefulness of 13f filings that have a delay of 45 days after quarter-end. However, Jadallah asserts that the average hedge fund has an average holding period of about one year, so even somewhat stale holdings information can potentially be quite valuable.ALFA holds up to 100 positions, and will partially hedge its stock market risk with a 50% hedge if the SPDR S&P 500 Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) is below is 200-day moving average. Most of the holdings are equally-weighted, but have an ""overlap bias"" meaning that a name held by twice the number of managers will have twice the weight. The index is adjusted quarterly, four days after the SEC 13f filing deadline. The 50% hedge is put on or taken off at calendar month-ends.Does ALFA have alpha? To determine whether an ETF has historically generated an alpha, or risk-adjusted return, I start by measuring the sensitivity of ALFA's return to four risk factors that capture much of the risk common to most ETFs:I use exponentially-weighted 36-month rolling multiple regressions to measure these risk factor sensitivities, or betas. ALFA started trading on May 30, 2012, but the underlying index goes back to February 29, 2000. I use the index returns to calculate risk factor sensitivities in order to take advantage of this longer history, since I know that as an index fund, ALFA's returns will be very close to its underlying benchmark index.As shown in the graph above, ALFA's equity beta (red) and 10-year bond beta (green) have both moved around quite a bit. No doubt much of the movement in the MKT sensitivity is due to putting on and taking off the 50% S&P 500 hedge, making this fund's equity beta difficult to forecast. The growing negative sensitivity to LTB prior to May 2013 no doubt indicates that many hedge fund managers correctly anticipated the market's fear of a Fed tapering of QE3 and consequent rise in interest rates. They took profits and pulled back after bonds got clobbered in May and June of this year.Since ALFA's May 30, 2012 inception, it has performed exceptionally well (see above graph). As expected, the fund (black) has honed very closely to its benchmark index (gray). Also as expected for an equity-oriented ETF, much of its return is explained by its MKT beta return (red). Using my 36-month regression methodology, the fund's MKT beta has averaged .57 since inception. To calculate the return from MKT beta, I multiply the previous month-end MKT beta times the monthly price return of the S&P 500. I use the same methodology for the other three risk factors. The residual return is the total return minus the return from the four risk factor betas.It is rare to find an ETF with ALFA's level of risk-adjusted, or residual, return (orange), which has been running at rate of over 10% per year in the 18 months since its inception. Granted that's a short time period, but still, that's a lot of alpha!However, the true MKT beta for this fund is very difficult to measure and forecast accurately because of the hedging technique used. To be conservative, in the graph above I adjusted the MKT beta to 1.00 and recalculated the residual return, shown at right. (This is almost certainly an over-correction.) Much more of the fund's total return is now explained by MKT beta (red), and much less residual return (orange) is left. At a beta of 1.00, the MKT line is the price return of the S&P 500. That is, we are subtracting 100% of the price return of the S&P 500 from the total return in our calculation of the residual return. However, even after this draconian adjustment, the residual return was still a very respectable 3.6% per year since inception.If we apply the same draconian adjustment to the underlying index (gray) since its inception (see graph above), however, the return to MKT beta (red) does not loom nearly as large over this longer time period, and the residual return (orange) comes through with very impressive power and persistence.The cumulative return of the index yields an annualized return of over 20% per year over the nearly 11 years of history available. A skeptic (like me) might assume that this is the result of data mining and back-fitting. Purveyors of new ETFs often seem to ""discover"" strategies with astounding historical back-tested performance, only to have their live performance fizzle out.However, ALFA's live results have actually been better than its pre-launch index history. In the year and a half since its May 30, 2012 inception, the fund has returned roughly 50%, or about 30% per year! As shown above, roughly half (using 36-month regression for MKT beta) to three-fourths (using a MKT beta of 1.00) was due just to a rising stock market. However, there was still a lot of alpha (residual return) left either way. And the last graph of the history of the underlying index for the strategy shows that most of the return has come from sources other than my four risk factors over the long-term.It sure looks like there is alpha here. What could I be missing? It could be that my risk factor sensitivities for ALFA are inaccurate. The most likely problem, if there is one, is with my estimate of MKT beta. We saw that raising the MKT beta from an average of 0.57 to 1.00 ate up quite a bit of the residual return. Perhaps the true underlying MKT beta of the holdings was higher than 1.00. I do not think that is likely but I can't prove it. A somewhat more likely scenario is that ALFA's holdings were highly sensitive to some other risk factors than my four, and that adding them to the risk model would explain some of the residual return. The suspects that come to mind are small cap, credit, or emerging market risk. I do not include these as risk factors in my model because 1) they are usually highly correlated to S&P 500 risk (causing statistical problems for my regressions) and 2) they are more expensive to hedge away than S&P 500 risk. But again, I can't prove that they wouldn't explain at least some of the return.Even so, given the level and persistence of the residual returns using my four risk factors, I am comfortable concluding that yes, there does seem to be alpha in ALFA.Disclosure: I am long ALFA.

2106373,30441,2014-03-24T18:07:28-04:00,ALFA and GURU are presented as cheap alternatives to hedge funds.ALFA has a better risk-adjusted performance since inception date.But in fact SPY was better in risk-adjusted performance than both ALFA and GURU.,"For a couple of years, strategy-based ETFs are flourishing. In a previous article, I have written about VQT and PHDG. This one looks into two ETFs that were designed almost at the same time and are based on hedge fund stock picks: the AlphaClone Alternative Alpha ETF (BATS:ALFA) and the Global X Guru ETF (NYSEARCA:GURU). Their business models rely on the idea that a ""collective brain"" of famous hedge fund managers should deliver a significant and steady alpha. Hedge Funds typically charge a 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee. Investors are submitted to various constraints, among them a minimum capital and planned redemption dates. ALFA and GURU are charging under 1% in net annual expense ratios, and shares can be bought and sold by any investor on any trading day. It makes them attractive for people who are not eligible as hedge fund customers. Each of them is based on a different rule-based strategy defined as an underlying index. More information about the methodologies can be found here and here.The first table gives a summary of ETFs profiles:GURU is more liquid, but ALFA trading volume is increasing and more than sufficient for individual investors. ALFA is more diversified with more total holdings, but more concentrated in its top holdings. Alpha may take a short position in a reference index when market-timing rules are triggered, whereas GURU is long only.The next chart compares ALFA and GURU between 6/4/2012 and 3/21/2014. SPY is given as a benchmark.Chart courtesy of Yahoo Finance.Both ETFs have outperformed the benchmark. Their returns are similar, with a slight advantage for GURU.The next table gives statistical data on the same period:ALFA and GURU provide a higher return at the price of a higher volatility. In fact, since their inception both have a lower risk-adjusted performance than SPY (Sharpe and Sortino ratios). The last row in the table shows that leveraging SPY by a 1.25 factor would have delivered a return close to GURU, a maximum drawdown close to ALFA, and a volatility lower than both. An annualized borrowing rate of 3% is taken into account in the calculation. In other words, for an investor with a margin account, SPY was the best of three. Moreover, using a leveraged S&P 500 ETF like SSO or UPRO with the appropriate weight makes margin unnecessary and borrowing rate pointless (read this article if you fear the decay of leveraged ETFs).Since their inception date, the main point of ALFA and GURU over the benchmark is to offer a leverage of 25% with a higher relative risk. ALFA has the additional advantage to embed a timed-hedging strategy, which could not be efficiently tested on the period. Investors with experience might prefer managing the hedging position themselves (click here to learn how).As a conclusion, the expense ratios of ALFA and GURU are cheap compared with hedge funds, but they are not when comparing their risk-adjusted performance with the benchmark. If I had to make a choice, I would prefer ALFA because it is less volatile.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

4038491,93706,2017-01-22T07:27:08-05:00,Hedge funds have delivered poor risk-adjusted returns in the last ten years.Hedge fund performance is overstated as a result of voluntary reporting.It is not feasible to identify good hedge fund managers in advance.,"A recent article in the Financial Analysts Journal (FAJ) argued that, despite recent setbacks, hedge funds offer diversification benefits to the investor. Its author based the conclusion on performance measures obtained from hedge fund indices. I differ with his methods and offer an alternative view.The FAJ Editor's Corner starts off in the right direction by trying to assess performance of hedge funds on a risk­-adjusted basis. The article points out that the Sharpe Ratio of aggregated hedge fund indices has been superior to the S&P 500 since January 2009.In my view, the Editor's Corner methodology was flawed for a couple of important reasons. It merely compared hedge fund performance to the S&P 500, hardly a comprehensive measure of investable assets. And, secondly, hedge fund indices themselves suffer from a significant self­-reporting bias that inflates the returns driving Sharpe ratios.Hedge funds theoretically have access to a wide range of financial products. Large cap US stocks such as those found in the S&P 500 are merely a fraction of their opportunity set. One would expect that managers deliver better and better performance (certainly not worse) as their range of options expands.With that in mind, I expanded the investable benchmark to include bonds. Nothing fancy --­ just used a balanced portfolio comprised of 60% of the S&P 500 and 40% of an aggregate bond index. The aggregate bond index is hardly a niche index intended to inflate benchmark returns. It includes about 80% of the US public debt market. This benchmark was a true investable portfolio as it was constructed from actual returns of a Spyder ETF (NYSEARCA:SPY) and Vanguard's Total Bond Index (MUTF:VBTLX).Two time frames were considered. The period cited by the FAJ author spanned January 2009 to the present. We used that, and also reviewed the trailing ten years back to November 2006. The latter time frame provides insight over a more diverse set of economic conditions.The Editor's Corner piece indicates that hedge fund composites produced Sharpe ratios that were more than 30% higher than the S&P 500 benchmark. As the tables above reveal, a small expansion of the benchmark opportunity set to include bonds changed the results. The balanced 60/40 portfolio produced a better Sharpe ratio over both periods examined.How reliable are those hedge fund index returns anyway? Unlike mutual funds, hedge funds report voluntarily. The hedge fund industry has a high churn rate, as the Editor's Corner itself notes:Hedge fund managers do not keep superior performance to themselves in the midst of a financial market collapse. A reasonable person would infer this missing return data contains sub-par performance.Academic researchers have more formally investigated the bias inherent in the voluntary nature of hedge fund reporting. For example, Aiken, Clifford, and Ellis found that the first unreported quarter performance of funds that de-list from databases is over 1.5% less than the last reported quarter. It's not the databases' fault -- they can't force managers to report bad news.The story doesn't stop there. A hedge fund index and a passively managed portfolio are not really comparable. Anyone can invest in the 60/40 passive portfolio used as the benchmark. They can just submit a couple of trade orders with their broker.However, there is no way to invest in a ""weighted composite index"" of hedge funds. Editor's Corner correctly points out that the volatility of a single hedge fund is higher than a composite of many funds. Aggregating hedge fund data offsets some idiosyncratic risk. A real world investor buying a single fund can expect to capture the return of the aggregate but will likely suffer greater volatility than expected.The Editor's Corner remedy for this statistical drag is to utilize funds of funds (FOFs) -- recommending positions in at least ten funds to capture the benefits of diversification within the space. The instinct may be right but the execution is thwarted by the high costs inherent in the FOF structure.The FOF has a general manager who serves a permanent ""consultant"" to the hedge fund portfolio. This general manager, for a generous fee of about 1.2%, will rotate the best individual hedge fund managers into the FOF portfolio to deliver the best results. The fee of the FOF manager is layered on top of the fixed and performance-based expenses of the underlying hedge funds.FOF expenses impose a big drag on returns. Nevertheless, their aggregated performance could serve as a proving ground for the strategy that Editor's Corner advocates. The good news is that both HFRI and another quality vendor, Barclayhedge, have been producing composites of FOF performance.We can use this data to obtain a track record of the FOF strategy. The performance of the two FOF indices is evaluated against the passive 60/40 portfolio and the CPI in the two tables below.It's not a big surprise. The extra layer of fees takes its toll in the long run. The house always wins. The investors are the losers. The Sharpe ratio of the balanced portfolio is significantly higher than either FOF composite. There are several useful takeaways from the data above. The FOFs are, as a group, less volatile than individual hedge funds. They deliver some diversification. However, it comes at a high cost. The FOF composites have average returns more than 1.0% lower than the HFRI aggregate of individual hedge funds.I included the CPI inflation rate as an additional measure of comparison. Over the past ten years, FOFs haven't even delivered returns to match the hurdle of historically low inflation. That should concern a prospective investor.Certainly the Great Recession depressed hedge fund returns along with other asset classes. But hedge funds should be able to draw the best opportunities from stocks and bonds. Stocks and bonds have done fine. A balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds outpaced inflation by 4.3% annually over the last ten years, amidst a devastating recession!The hedge fund universe has expanded dramatically since the 1990s. What was once a niche industry has ballooned to manage over $2.8 trillion. In my view, there are too many managers chasing too few investment ideas to generate real value.Even insiders are losing faith. Dan Loeb, founder of money manager Third Point LLC, opined that hedge funds are in the ""early innings"" of a washout after delivering ""catastrophic"" performance results. I wouldn't jump into a boat that is taking on water."
4009061,66263,2016-09-28T18:01:53-04:00,ALFA has been unhedged since April.Overweighting of technology stocks led to outperformance versus the broader market.Increased allocation to defensive stocks could indicate that successful fund managers are becoming more cautious.,"The AlphaClone Alternative Alpha ETF (BATS:ALFA), ALFA tracks an index of U.S. stocks owned by hedge funds and institutional investors, as selected using AlphaClone's proprietary ""Clone Score"" methodology, which ranks managers according to whether it would have been profitable to follow their disclosures in the past. Presumably, this allows investors to ""invest with the best"", and the fund outperformed the broader market over the first three years of inception (May 2012).In my most recent article on ALFA, ""The AlphaClone Alternative Alpha ETF Continues To Disappoint In 2016"", I noted that the whipsaw nature of the equity markets at the time had caused ALFA to suffer performance drag relative to its benchmarks. Recall that ALFA becomes market neutral when the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) falls below its 200-day simple moving average [SMA] at month's end. The hedge is removed when the S&P 500 recovers the 200 SMA, which is again checked at each month's end. This strategy can protect investors from the most severe of bear markets, by moving to a neutral stance when the technical level is breached.Unhedged since AprilAs can be seen from the chart below, SPY has regained its 200 SMA since the start of April and has not closed below this key level at month's end ever since. While Brexit fears did cause the index to close below the 200 SMA for a single day (Jun. 27), this did not occur at month's end and hence the hedge was not triggered. I consider this very fortunate for ALFA because had the market low occurred a mere three days later (Jun. 30), the hedge would have been activated and ALFA would have been completely unable to take advantage of the V-shaped recovery in the markets.The following table (from ALFA's factsheet) shows the months of time where ALFA was hedged (""ON"") or unhedged (""OFF"").Tech focus pays offIn my last article, I noted that ALFA (which reflects successful fund managers' holdings) had shifted out of biotechnology stocks such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:VRX), Celgene (NASDAQ:CELG) and Horizon Pharma (NASDAQ:HZNP), and into technology companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG). I concluded thusly:Indeed, that appears to be precisely what had occurred. Since my last article, ALFA has returned +8.51%, beating SPY (+6.28%) by over 2 percentage points. Of course, beating all comers is the Nasdaq-tracking PowerShares QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), at +12.52% return.ALFA Total Return Price data by YChartsLooking aheadSPY currently sits at $215.57, with the 200 SMA sitting only a short distance (-5.3%) below it at $204.13. As mentioned previously, a fall below the 200 SMA will activate the hedge, which if it were to take place would be the second time that ALFA becomes hedged this year.The current top 10 holdings of ALFA are shown in the table and chart below.The above list shows that ALFA is still quite tech-focused, with AMZN, MSFT and GOOG remaining as top holdings, although their allocations have been decreased from before. For instance, AMZN's current weighting is 5.21%, down from 9.20% in May, while MSFT has also dropped from 5.17% to 3.01%. AAPL has been completely dropped from the top 10. Given the stocks' strong performance in recent months (as shown below), reducing the allocation to tech companies could be a prudent decision by these fund managers.Somewhat surprisingly, we see that defensive stocks like JNJ and STZ (consumer staples), SPG (REITs) and T (utilities) have become popular among successful fund managers. Could this be a sign of defensive posturing for the months ahead?SummaryALFA has been unhedged since April of its year, and its performance over the last several months has slightly beat the market, which could be attributed to its overweighting of technology companies. The current iteration of ALFA shows an increased allocation to defensive stocks, which could suggest that fund managers are adopting a more cautious stance for the future. Will ALFA see brighter times ahead and recapture some of its luster?If you have enjoyed my article, please consider clicking the ""Follow"" button next to my name to be alerted to new content!

717251,25133,2012-07-12T09:40:21-04:00,,"Innovation remains a driving force in the ETF industry as the  lineup of tools continues to grow, allowing for mainstream investors to  easily access previously difficult-to-reach strategies and corners of  the global market. One of the more recent strides toward democratizing  the investment process comes in the form of the AlphaClone Alternative  Alpha ETF (BATS:ALFA).  This innovative fund brings together insights from hedge funds  and institutional investors in a product wrapper that makes it easy and  cost-efficient to invest alongside professional money managers. Mazin  Jadallah, founder and CEO of AlphaClone,  recently took time out of his schedule to discuss what makes the ALFA  ETF unique, the basics behind “cloning,” as well discussing how the  strategy might fit into investors’ portfolios.ETF Database (ETFdb): Explain the basic idea behind ALFA.Mazin Jadallah (NYSEARCA:MJ): It’s no secret that many of the  best investment ideas come from hedge funds and institutional  portfolios. Unfortunately most investors can’t conveniently access these  investments. AlphaClone’s mission is to empower investors by giving  them efficient access to the investment ideas of established  institutional investors and hedge funds. Our research and portfolio  construction approach, called “cloning”, allows any investor to gain  exposure to the alpha potential reflected in hedge fund and  institutional manager public disclosures. As the AlphaClone name  indicates, we seek to clone alpha through our proprietary process and  make it available to all types of investors.ETFdb: How might this strategy fit into a portfolio? Would you consider this as a core, or more tactical holding?MJ: For equity investors, we think ALFA offers more  considerable exposure to U.S. equities. On the “long” side it combines  up to 100 equities to which established hedge fund managers chosen by  AlphaClone have considerable exposure. On the “short” side the strategy  employs a dynamic hedge which can vary the strategy from being 100% long  during market run-ups to market hedged during protracted market  rundowns. In this way it seeks to align itself with a rising market  while still offering protection against multi-month corrections in the  market.For investors in hedge funds, ALFA is a way for them to achieve daily  liquidity in their alternatives portfolio without giving up the  potential to generate outperformance or alpha. Prior to ALFA, hedge fund  allocators have had to rely on either weekly or monthly liquidity  products or beta factor replication products.ETFdb: Why does it make sense to use the ETF wrapper for investors looking to purse this sort of strategy?MJ: We founded the company in 2008 as a research  firm and then in 2010 we began offering core investment strategies  inside separate accounts. Based on demand from our clients, we now are  expanding access to our research by giving investors the convenience,  liquidity and transparency that ETFs can deliver. The Alternative Alpha  Fund ETF seeks to track the AlphaClone’s Hedge Fund Long/Short Index  before fees and expenses and delivers our expertise at manager  selection, portfolio construction and risk-management in a tax-friendly  vehicle that is publicly traded.ETFdb: There are some out there who believe ETFs  have gone too far from their initial intention of offering broad-based  exposure to buy-and-hold investors. What’s your take on the innovation  in the ETF industry over the last several years?MJ: Innovation is key in any industry. If anything  we see a need to accelerate innovation in the investment industry.  Specifically, ETFs have been a boon for investors of all types. They  give investors and their advisors direct access to more and more finely  defined beta exposures on the one hand but also now offer access to  intelligent rules-based investment models like ours. The transparency,  low cost and accessibility of these products offer benefits that accrue  directly to the end investor. Going forward we hope to see continued  innovation around the ETF vehicle itself as well as in the types of  investment disciplines offered.Disclosure: No positions at time of writing.Disclaimer: ETF Database is not an  investment advisor, and any content published by ETF Database does not  constitute individual investment advice.

630601,23025,2012-06-01T07:45:51-04:00,,"Exchange-Traded Concepts,  the firm providing turnkey solutions to companies looking to make an  entrance into the ETF industry, announced this week the debut of a  unique product that will seek to clone strategies implemented by hedge  funds. The new AlphaClone Alternative Alpha Exchange-Traded Fund (BATS:ALFA)  will seek to replicate the AlphaClone Hedge Fund Long/Short Index, a  benchmark that is constructed based on publicly disclosed positions of  hedge funds and institutional investors.The underlying index includes holdings that are disclosed by managers  with the highest “clone score,” a metric that measures the efficacy of  following a manager based on their publicly disclosed holdings. Clone  scores incorporate monthly returns in excess of a broad market index, as  well as a fixed hurdle rate over time.ALFA will essentially try to mimic the holdings of top hedge fund  managers, which are regularly revealed through filings with the SEC.  Holdings will be equal-weighted, but it’s possible for securities to be  represented more than once if they are found in the portfolio of more  than one hedge fund manager.Global X had sketched out plans  for products implementing a generally similar approach earlier this  year; that issuer made an SEC filing detailing a proposed Top Hedge Fund  Equity Holdings ETF that would hold stocks that are found in the  portfolios of a select group of hedge funds. Global X also laid the  groundwork for a Top Value Guru Holdings ETF and Top Activist Investor  Holdings ETF.ALFA will also feature a dynamic hedging mechanism that allows the  fund to vary between 100% long and 50% long / 50% short the S&P 500.  That hedging will kick in based on certain NAV price targets based on  the underlying index [see the ALFA fact sheet].ALFA is now one of several ETFs available to U.S. investors that is  designed to mimic returns of hedge funds. But while the general  objectives of these products may appear similar from a high level, they  go about accomplishing their strategies in very different ways. Other  hedge fund ETFs include:ALFA charges an expense ratio of 0.95%. That’s at the high end of the range for the Hedge Fund ETFdb Category, which ranges from 0.45% to 0.95%.Disclosure: No positions at time of writing.Disclaimer: ETF Database is not an  investment advisor, and any content published by ETF Database does not  constitute individual investment advice.

628731,23444,2012-05-31T10:39:15-04:00,,"The AlphaClone Alternative Alpha ETF (BATS:ALFA), which began trading on  Thursday, will invest in disclosed equity positions held by established  hedge fund managers—the first ETF to do so.The new ETF “seeks to capture alpha from these managers’ long  positions while protecting against protracted market downturns through a  dynamic hedge mechanism.” Its strategy has been derived from the  research and hedge fund replication methodology developed by AlphaClone  and its founder and CEO Mazin Jadallah and is based on the passive,  risk-managed AlphaClone Hedge Fund Long/Short Index.The index directly selects its long positions from public disclosures  using a proprietary ranking system which measures the efficacy of  following managers based on their disclosures over a complete market  cycle (since 2000). The index also incorporates a rules-based hedge  mechanism that adjusts holdings between being long-only and  market-hedged based on certain technical price targets for a broad index  of U.S. equities.“AlphaClone offers our separate account clients strategies that  expertly combine long hedge fund equity positions with disciplined  downside protection,” says Jadallah, “With the introduction of ALFA,  investors around the world can now access our proven investment approach  in a transparent and easy to access vehicle that can help navigate  today’s challenging market environment.”The ETF is the first to result from AlphaClone’s partnership with the  International Securities Exchange, a leading U.S. options exchange. Exchange Traded Concepts serves as investment adviser to the new ETF.  Knight Clearing Services is the lead market maker."

These young ETFs are bucking the hedge fund industry's performance - by solidly outperforming the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY).(NYSEARCA:GURU) Global X Top Guru Holdings Index ETFThe Global X Top Guru Holdings Index ETF commenced trading on June 6, 2012 and tracks investment results before fees and expenses the snazzy named ""Top Guru Holdings Index"". This ETF seems to be catching on with investors as its market cap is already a respectable $205 million.Description of Index:Here's a description of the Top Guru Holdings Index from the folks at Global X:Performance and Fund Details:Year to date performance for the GURU ETF is a very healthy 37% versus 25% for the S&P 500. The expense ratio for this ETF is 0.75%, which is reasonable for strategy type ETFs. That fee is downright cheap when compared to the typical 2% management fee and a 20% performance fee for hedge funds. The holdings number about 53 stocks. Get GURU fact sheet here.The top five holdings for GURU as of 10/17/2013:Education Management Corp. (NASDAQ:EDMC)Pandora Media Inc. (NYSE:P)US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)Cumulus Media Inc. (NASDAQ:CMLS)Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (NYSE:PXD)(BATS:ALFA) AlphaClone Alternative Alpha ETFThe AlphaClone Alternative Alpha ETF commenced trading on May 30, 2012 and tracks before fees and expenses the AlphaClone Hedge Fund Long/Short Index. This young ETF is somewhat smaller with a market cap of only around $24 million so far. It has a similar strategy to GURU but also has a hedging feature when the market turns sour.Description of Index:Here's a summary description from AlphaClone Funds for the AlphaClone Hedge Fund Long/Short Index:From AlphaClone - more about the weightings and the hedging strategy below:- Index constituents are equal weighted but have an overlap bias (i.e., securities held by twice the number of managers have twice the weight).- the index can vary between being long only and market hedged (50% short exposure to the S&P 500 index using an inverse unleveraged ETF). The hedge is triggered on or off when the S&P 500 crosses its 200 day moving average at any month end.Performance and Fund Details:Year to date performance for the ALFA ETF is a respectable 29.8% versus 25% for the S&P 500. The expense ratio for this ETF is 0.95%. Pricey? Yes, but fairly typical for strategy and alternative ETFs; and as pointed out above - cheap in the context of hedge fund fees. The ALFA ETF holds about 83 stocks.The top five holdings for ALFA as of 10/17/2013:21st Century Fox Inc. (NASDAQ:FOXA)Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. (VRX)American International Group Inc. (NYSE:AIG)Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)Performance of GURU and ALFA versus S&P 500:(From June 2012 to Mid October 2013_Yahoo Finance)Summary and Opinion:Because many hedge funds are generally trailing the market this year (so far) many investors expect a rush by hedge funds to improve their year end metrics by goosing high beta momentum stocks to turbo-charge performance for the end of the year.Perhaps these ETF funds have enough recent replication in those names to power a portfolio to get more of that outperformance. Judging from some of these ETF holdings (such as EDMC up over 250% YTD and VRX up about 100% YTD) an investor may want to fasten his seat belt and be ready for some volatility. Hedge funds will likely ride some of these names further to a strong year end finish. Or, on the other hand, perhaps they will book those huge profits like Carl Icahn prudently did the other day with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).Either way, both GURU and ALFA will likely reflect much of those market momentum names. Note that with lightly traded funds one should always use limit orders.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

4348974,103480,2020-05-20T10:26:43-04:00,"Altair's revenue growth decelerated sharply in Q1 as expected, thanks to its disproportionate exposure to pandemic-impacted industries.Altair further expects deceleration to worsen in Q2, with revenues actually tilting into a single-digit decline.Though Altair maintained positive free cash flows, it has a thin ~$67 million net cash balance.For a company expecting little revenue growth and contracting profit margins, its ~5x forward revenue multiple is rich.","Altair (ALTR), the engineering and construction software company, is running into very threatening near-term headwinds. As a company that focuses primarily on industries that are the most impacted by the pandemic, Altair - previously growing its top line at a ~20% y/y rate - is looking at growth dipping negative as soon as next quarter.Shares are roughly flat since the company announced fiscal first-quarter earnings in early May - and considering how concerning Altair's fundamental headwinds are, I'm also surprised that Altair is down only ~7% for the year, better than ~10% for the S&P 500 and ~20% for the Russell 2000 index of small/mid-cap stocks.Data by YChartsIn my prior article on Altair, I laid out a bearish case for the company, without seeing any coronavirus-related impacts that we can now see in Altair's Q1 results, based on the following factors:Considering Altair's weak near-term trends and a limited visibility to recovery, its current valuation strikes me as overoptimistic. At current prices near $34, Altair carries a $2.53 billion market cap. Netting off the $247.1 million of cash and $181.2 million in debt on Altair's latest balance sheet (a $65.9 million net cash position) gets us to an enterprise value of $2.46 billion. Versus Altair's latest FY20 revenue guidance of $440-$460 million (representing a growth range of -4% y/y to +0% y/y), Altair's valuation sits at 5.5x EV/FY20 revenues.When we look at other companies that are trading at a ~5-6x forward revenue multiple, however, we find that most of these comps are growing at least in the ~10-20% y/y range - whereas Altair is projecting no growth at all.Data by YChartsFor a company that is expecting carnage in revenue growth, shrinking profitability margins, and heavy concentration to pandemic-impacted customers, I'd say Altair's valuation leaves no further room for upside. Continue to steer clear of this name.Now that we have the benefit of seeing exactly how the pandemic impacts Altair's results, let's dive into Altair's first-quarter results in greater detail. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. Altair 1Q20 resultsSource: Altair 1Q20 earnings releaseAltair's overall revenues grew only 3% y/y to $131.5 million, decelerating sharply from 20% y/y revenue growth in Q4. Meanwhile, Altair's core software license revenues were even weaker at 1% y/y growth to $77.5 million, decelerating twenty-six points versus 27% y/y growth in Q4.As I posited in my prior article on Altair, Altair has specific industry concentration risk that is impacting it far heavier than many other software companies. Almost every software company, on their earnings call this quarter, have specifically mentioned their exposure to coronavirus-impacted industries such as retail, travel/hospitality, manufacturing, and oil/gas. For most ""horizontal"" software companies that service a wide range of industries, this concentration tends to be around ~10-15%, which is approximately the composition of these industries within the S&P 500. As a software company that is focused on computer-aided engineering, however, Altair unsurprisingly has much greater exposure (50%!) to companies that have heavily slowed down their activity in the wake of the global lockdowns.Per CEO James Scapa's prepared remarks on the Q1 earnings call:The remarks above confirm the thesis that as these auto/aerospace companies slow down their usage of Altair products in the midst of stalled projects, their need to replenish Altair ""units"" will also decline (versus a pure SaaS company that collects subscription fees based on seats, regardless of usage). As sales cycles for software products lengthen, Altair additionally expects ""reductions in software-related services"" throughout the rest of the year alongside ""similar challenges for client engineering services.""Not adding any comfort is the fact that Altair's second-quarter guidance points to conditions worsening even further fall Altair. The company's software product revenue guidance of $76-$80 million represents a -5% to -10% y/y decline (up to eleven points for further deceleration); total revenues of $91-$96 million represents a -10% to -15% y/y decline. This, too, stands in stark contrast to many other software and technology companies that have announced they expected March to be the nadir of the pandemic, while April has recovered to pre-crisis levels (or even caught up with some portion of lost demand). Altair, by contrast, isn't offering us any timeline to recovery.Figure 2. Altair Q2 guidance updateSource: Altair 1Q20 earnings releaseWe note as well that Altair's first-quarter billings came in at -4% y/y. As most software investors know, billings represents the best forward-looking indicator of growth for a recurring revenue software company, and confirms the validity of Altair's Q2 guidance going to negative revenue growth.Altair's profitability isn't showing us any encouraging signals either. Normally we'd expect for a company that's seeing materially slower growth to make up for it with margin expansion, but for Altair, this isn't the case. Altair's Q1 adjusted EBITDA fell -10% y/y to $21.7 million, while adjusted EBITDA margins clocked in at 16.5%, 230bps worse than 18.8% in the year-ago quarter.Figure 3. Altair adjusted EBITDA trendsSource: Altair 1Q20 earnings releaseLike Altair's revenue guidance, the company expects adjusted EBITDA to soften even further throughout 2020. Its adjusted EBITDA guidance range for 2020 calls for just $30-$35 million in EBITDA for the year (versus a prior outlook of $49-$53 million), or 7.2% margin for the full year - which is 340bps worse than a 10.6% adjusted EBITDA margin in FY19.It's unclear why Altair should trade at 5.5x forward revenues when the company is pointing to negative growth in Q2 and flat revenues for the year, amid a sharp decline in adjusted EBITDA margins. Competing SaaS companies in the ~5-6x revenue multiple range (I particularly like New Relic in this space), meanwhile, are showing much stronger fundamentals, with many indicating that April/Q2 will be far better than Q1. We note as well that for Altair's biggest end-industries in aerospace and auto manufacturing, it may take years for demand to recover - hence, why shares of stocks like Ford (F) and Boeing (BA) are still down so sharply for the year amid the broad rebound in the market since March.Steer clear of Altair and invest elsewhere."
4370701,103480,2020-08-25T15:07:01-04:00,"Altair saw Q2 revenues decline for the first time in many quarters, owing to the impact from the coronavirus.
        Altair's reliance on manufacturing and construction companies makes it more cyclically exposed.
        The company recently overhauled its pricing model, applying its patented units-based licensing model to all of its products.
        Altair's valuation at ~6x forward revenues is rich for a company that is expecting little to no growth.","Considering its heavy exposure to some of the most cyclical stocks in the market that have been negatively impacted by the coronavirus, Altair (ALTR) has held up relatively well in the markets this year. Shares are up 13% year-to-date, doubling a ~6% rise in the S&P 500 (yet falling short of the gains most tech companies have achieved this year). Yet Altair's financials and its share price tell a different story: despite the upward drift in Altair's market value, its fundamentals have taken a decent hit from the impact of the virus. Investors who continue to view Altair as a value stock are ignoring the fact that Altair's return to normal could be delayed relative to other software companies, as well as the fact that as a ""legacy"" software vendor, Altair has very little underlying growth to boast of.I view Altair's most recent trends as a mixed bag. Clearly Altair's revenue decline in Q2 was unfavorable, but largely expected - and on the bright side, Altair has been able to hone in on improved profitability and cash flow with an especially robust boost in gross margins. Altair also had substantial updates to both its product and pricing model in Q2. The company released a big software update (which the CEO called the most significant in the company's history) that include, among many new features, intuitive workflows and specific functional solutions for engineers, designers, and other professionals. Altair has also decided to apply its unique units-based consumption model (in which customers essentially pay for ""credits"" that are then used to purchase specific units of usage for Altair software ) to all of the company's products starting in June. Here's how CEO James Scapa framed that change on the most recent Q2 earnings call:Yet despite these updates (which may prove accretive to growth in the long term, but in the near term as major infrastructure projects get put on hold, end-customer usage won't be increasing - as we saw in Q1), I believe Altair to be fully valued relative to its low growth potential. At current share prices near $42, the company has a market cap of $3.06 billion. After netting off the $250.5 million of cash and $183.4 million of debt on Altair's most recent balance sheet, its enterprise value is $2.99 billion.For FY21, Wall Street analysts are expecting $490.1 million of revenue (data from Yahoo Finance), or just 9% y/y growth over Altair's latest FY20 revenue guidance range of $443-$455 million (which, at -2% y/y vs. FY19, is already a low coronavirus-impacted compare). This puts Altair's valuation multiple at 6.1x EV/FY20 revenue - which is incredibly rich for company that is seeing little to no revenue growth.Other software companies that are expected to grow in the mid single digits/low teens, meanwhile, trade at ~4x forward revenue multiples. Considering the ~50% premium to peers that in some cases are growing even faster than Altair, in my view, there's already plenty of optimism baked into Altair's stock. Investors would be wise to continue staying on the sidelines here.Let's now review Altair's most recent quarterly results in greater detail. The Q2 earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. Altair 2Q20 resultsSource: Altair Q2 earnings releaseAltair's revenue sank -8% y/y to $81.8 million, decelerating sharply from last quarter's 3% y/y growth rate. However, we do note that this decay was largely expected as Altair had guided to a -10% y/y to a -15% y/y decline in Q2, and Wall Street consensus had been in between that range at -12% y/y (or $94.2 million). The reason Altair's revenue saw such a dramatic swing (versus milder declines at most other software companies) is because a lot of Altair's products are on a unit-based consumption model, which in June became applied to Altair's entire platform. This means that Altair recognizes billings and revenue as end-clients actually use Altair solutions alongside their projects. With so many heavy manufacturing/construction projects being scaled down or placed on hold due to the coronavirus, end-usage is naturally trending down in the near term. Here's how Howard Morof, Altair's CFO, characterized the demand environment in Q2 during the earnings call:CEO James Scapa also added a note that Altair continues to be ""concerned about the macroeconomy,"" but the bright spot is that Altair continues to engage in client/prospect discussions and that new customer acquisition is ""relatively strong."" Note, however, that this revenue decline won't have a near-term solution - Altair's Q3 guidance of $96-$100 million in total revenues points to -3% y/y decline, which is only slightly better than Q2.Counterbalancing some of this negative news on revenue are some encouraging data points on profitability. Altair managed to grow gross margins by 4 points in Q2, driven by better unit economics across all of Altair's revenue segments plus a richer mix shift into software product versus client engineering services, which are performed at only slightly above cost. Altair made further cost improvements on the operating expense side, thanks to the stoppage of travel and events for its sales teams. In spite of the revenue decline, Altair was able to slightly grow adjusted EBITDA at 11% y/y to $5.7 million, representing a 5.8% margin, 100bps bps richer than 4.8% in the year-ago quarter. Figure 2. Altair EBITDA trendsSource: Altair Q2 earnings releaseAltair's revenue decline and cautious guidance/commentary were not surprises. My issue with the company, however, is that it trades at a relatively rich ~6x forward revenue multiple despite very little growth expected this year and a muted single-digit growth recovery expected for next year. With few catalysts that can meaningful drive a multiples re-ration in this stock, I'd be careful buying at current levels."
4158193,103480,2018-03-22T05:22:47-04:00,"Altair grew revenues by 8% in Q4, its second quarter of posting single-digit growth since going public in November.
        The company's profitability metrics have also deteriorated as it has begun recognizing larger stock-based comp expenses.
        For such mediocre growth, shares look especially expensive at 5.4x forward revenues after Altair's most recent rally.
        The stock's lockup expiration on April 30 will be a major near-term headwind.","Newly minted public company Altair Engineering (ALTR), the three decades-old software company dedicated to computer-aided engineering applications, has just released fourth quarter results - its second earnings release since going public in early November. Like last quarter, Altair showed a modest beat to Wall Street expectations - but, cutting straight to the chase, I don't find anything particularly appealing about Altair despite its consecutive string of decent earnings beats. There can be no doubt, however, that public company life has been exceptionally kind to Altair. The stock is up 31% year to date, towering over the broader market in which most stocks (especially the usual tech heavyweights like Facebook (FB) are weighing down or flat). And against Altair's IPO price of $13, shares have more than doubled. Altair added another 2% in aftermarket gains after posting Q4 results. Let's do a quick check on valuation. At Altair's post-Q4 share price of $32, the company carries a market cap of $2.01 billion. Netting out its $39.2 million of cash and minuscule $0.4 million of debt (the company had used IPO proceeds to pay down its term debt), Altair now has an enterprise value of $1.97 billion.Here's a look as well at what Altair is guiding to for the current fiscal year, taken from the company's fourth quarter earnings release:Figure 1. Altair FY18 guidanceSource: Altair investor relationsTaking the midpoint of the company's FY18 guidance range of $364 million, we calculate that Altair is currently trading at a valuation of 5.42x EV/FY18 revenues.That's a bit rich for a ""legacy"" software company with only single-digit growth. We used to be able to say that one of Altair's merits was the fact that it generated GAAP net profits (a rarity in the software IPO space), but due to its heavier stock-based comp now that it's public, Altair has lost that distinction.Compare Altair's valuation against other single-digit growth software companies like Oracle (ORCL) and MicroStrategy (MSTR) and you'll see that there's not much room for upside in Altair's valuation. Note also that both of these companies do post positive net income.When we additionally consider the fact that Altair is coming up against its lockup expiration date on April 30 (as reported by NASDAQ), and the fact that the stock is up more than 2x its IPO price, we'll probably see some selling pressure as insiders line up to cash in their paper gains.All this foreshadows a bearish near-term future for Altair. If you've been holding shares and made gains since the IPO, now might be a good time to lock in profits. Insiders, once past the April 30 cutoff, are likely thinking the same thing.It would be one thing if Altair was beginning to turn into an exciting growth story, but unfortunately, the company's fourth quarter and full year results don't corroborate that narrative. While the company's product is certainly appealing and critical for engineers, it's already well-entrenched into its market and doesn't have a particularly strong case for double-digit growth. Let's turn to the company's most recent results:Figure 2. Altair Q4 and FY17 resultsSource: Altair investor relationsAltair grew total revenues by 8% y/y to $89.9 million in the fourth quarter, decelerating very slightly (40bps) from its growth rate in Q3. The company did beat analysts' expectations for $87.6 million (+6% y/y), but not by a wide enough margin to make it truly exciting. The company's software product revenues (which are the higher-margin and most important piece of the business), at least, grew 11% y/y. But still - against other recent IPOs that are growing in the 40 to 50% range, Altair looks like dead weight. Take Yext (YEXT) for example, another 2017 software IPO that I'm extremely bullish on, and a company that specializes in new and exciting location data software. The company grew at 35% y/y in its most recent quarter, but its recent slide has left shares trading at a paltry 4.5x forward revenues. I'd much rather load up on shares of Yext than pay a one-turn revenue multiple premium for a slow grower like Altair.One of Altair's most distinguishing features - its historically positive GAAP profitability - has also lost its luster as Altair transitioned into becoming a public company and began recognizing stock-based comp based on the value of its shares. As a result, all components of Altair's operating expenses - research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative - have all shot up. These expense categories increased by 34% y/y, 25% y/y, and 59% y/y respectively, all to support meager 8% revenue growth. As a result, Altair's operating income - once a positive $8.0 million in 4Q16 - has shrank to -$3.2 million. Ditto for the full year, where an operating profit of $15.4 million has been watered down into a loss of -$33.3 million. GAAP net income of -$60.3 million in the quarter also showed a remarkable drop from a profit of $5.9 million in 4Q16, despite the company's beat on EPS estimates ($0.18 achieved versus $0.06 consensus). Yes, it's true that the added stock comp expenses are ""accounting expenses"" and not true cash losses. But on the cash flow front, Altair has seen shrinkage as well. Figure 3. Altair FCF resultsSource: Altair investor relationsAltair's fourth quarter FCF stayed more or less flat at -$4.5 million, while for the full year, the company's positive FCF shrank -28% y/y to $8.6 million.The key takeaways for investors: whatever juice has been fueling Altair Engineering's year-to-date rally, I haven't been drinking from the same punch bowl. The company's quarterly results are okay, but not fantastic. With such anemic growth and diminishing profits and cash flows, there are much better tech IPOs to invest in - plenty of which, by the way, trade for valuations under Altair's 5.4x forward revenues. I'd be especially careful with this stock ahead of the April lockup expiration date. While lockup expirations are a ""normal"" part of a company's lifecycle, happening 6 months after the IPO on the spot, high-flyers that have seen recent gains tend to see a lot of volatility around the expiration date. With Altair's impressive gains, yet few fundamental bullish attributes, it doesn't seem to be a smart buy."
4221349,103480,2018-11-12T12:41:26-05:00,"Altair Engineering shares pulled back ~5% after reporting weak Q3 results that missed Wall Street's revenue expectations.Top-line growth slowed dramatically to 11% y/y, marking eight points of sequential deceleration and a disappointment after Altair raised its full-year growth outlook to 14% y/y.Altair is also spending a good chunk of its cash balance to acquire the struggling small-cap data software company Datawatch.Altair's 33% YTD rise has eclipsed many of its software peers, despite its legacy status and lack of growth.Altair also modestly reduced its revenue guidance for the full year by $1 million.","While Altair Engineering (ALTR) had duped investors for a while into thinking that it could become a growth stock again - or at least, produce revenue growth in the ~20% range - it became the victim of heightened expectations this quarter when Altair returned to posting weak 11% y/y growth. The company's image as a legacy provider of computer-aided engineering (CAE) software has returned with this quarter's results, sending shares down 5%:It's unclear, in my view, where Altair is headed. Its products are already deeply rooted into its addressable market (thanks to being in this market for more than 40 years), and its most recent move was to acquire an unrelated software company in Datawatch (DWCH) for about $176 million, which would essentially deplete the majority of Altair's cash balances.A quick valuation check on Altair - even after the recent pullback, Altair's stock is still up 33% on the year, which is far better than many other technology stocks whose corrections in the month of October have left them down for the year. At present, Altair has a market cap of $2.25 billion. After netting out $197.4 million of cash and $1 million of debt, we are left with an enterprise value of $2.05 billion.For the current year, Altair has guided to $287-$289 million in revenues, representing approximately 14% y/y growth. Note that this guidance range has been revised down by $1 million relative to last quarter, in which the company had guided to $288-$290 million:Figure 1. Altair 4Q18 and FY18 guidanceSource: Altair investor relationsLet's assume that next year, Altair achieves 12% y/y growth to $322.5 million in revenues. Considering that this quarter's growth slowed down to just 11% y/y growth, this is already optimistic. This assumption gives Altair a valuation of 6.4x EV/FY19 revenues - certainly not expensive, but probably not worth paying for a company with both limited top-line growth and unimpressive earnings.In my view, Altair has been the beneficiary of unjustified enthusiasm this year. With many other faster-growing SaaS stocks sliding into bargain territory, Altair's relative appeal as a value stock will fade. This is a stock to avoid.After forty years of being pinned to the same business, it's understandable why Altair made a play for Datawatch, which is a provider of data prep and analytics software that competes directly against the much better-known Alteryx (AYX).There are limited complementary links between the two platforms, however. Altair's press release announcing the acquisition (released just a few days before its third-quarter earnings) notes that ""there is strong opportunity to cross-sell Datawatch products into Altair’s primarily manufacturing customer base,"" but in my view, buying a second-rate platform like Datawatch doesn't exactly make it easy to sell.Datawatch, like Altair, is a low-growth stock. Revenue growth has trailed in the low teens and single digits this year, despite being at a very small scale - the company produces just over $10 million in quarterly revenues. Is it worth the 35% premium that Altair paid to acquire it? Altair offered $13.10 per share, or about $176 million in total cash consideration.An acquisition of this magnitude essentially consumes the remainder of Altair's cash balances. Here's a glance at the company's Q3 ending balance sheet, with just $197.4 million of cash:Figure 2. Altair 3Q18 balance sheetSource: Altair investor relationsAltair intends to finance the acquisition using a combination of cash and debt on its revolving line of credit, which carries a spread over LIBOR of 125 to 200bps, per management's remarks on a conference call highlighting the acquisition. The fact that Altair is depleting its net cash balance to essentially zero to acquire a second-rate software platform, in my view, greatly increases its risk.Here's a look at Altair's third quarter results:Figure 3. Altair 3Q18 resultsSource: Altair investor relationsRevenues trailed sluggishly this quarter, growing just 10.5% y/y to $93.9 million. Over the past two quarters, Altair had grown at 19% and 21% y/y in Q2 and Q1, respectively. It now seems that those two quarters were outliers, and Altair has returned to its pattern of low growth. Wall Street was looking for revenues of $72.9 million, or 12.5% y/y growth - marking a significant two-point miss this quarter.Perhaps even more disappointing than the total revenue deceleration, however, is that most of it is concentrated in software. Software product revenues grew just 13% y/y this quarter, decelerating nine points versus 21% y/y last quarter.The Datawatch acquisition will, of course, help with Altair's optical growth rates once it closes in the fourth quarter. Datawatch generated $11 million in revenues last quarter, so it can tack on about 12-13 points of growth alone. Altair investors should take care to strip out organic growth from total revenue growth going forward.On the bright side, Altair made some strides on the profitability front this quarter. Despite the slowdown in software product revenues, a greater mix of software versus services helped Altair improve its gross margins to 71%, up two points from 69% in the year-ago quarter.The company also showed impressive cost discipline in the quarter, reducing sales and marketing expenses by -14% y/y to $19.3 million, and general and administrative expenses by -41% y/y to $17.2 million. Overall operating income hit $9.0 million this quarter, representing a GAAP operating margin of 9.6% - a huge improvement over a loss of -24.6% in the year-ago quarter.The company's free cash flow, meanwhile, hit just under $1 million, a major improvement over cash burn of -$10.7 million in the year-ago quarter. Year-to-date, Altair has generated impressive FCF growth of nearly 3x, though the ~12% FCF margin still leaves a lot to be desired for a low-growth, older technology company that should be producing richer profits:Figure 4. Altair FCFSource: Altair investor relationsIn my view, Altair's stock price has reached a near-term plateau. The company has hit a wall on growth, and its answer is to consume the remainder of its net cash to acquire another low-growth software stock that plays second or third fiddle in its field.Amid a 6.4x forward revenue multiple, it's unclear why investors would opt to buy Altair when faster-growing technology leaders like Box (BOX) are trading at the same or cheaper valuations. The chart below showcases several SaaS stocks that are trading at cheaper valuations than Altair, yet growing substantially more:Investors should stay on the sidelines on Altair and opt for higher-quality names."
4209057,104099,2018-09-30T15:39:49-04:00,"There's much I like about Altair Engineering. The problem is that after a 113% run, the stock is trading at more than 200 times free cash flow.I think there's value here, but in my view, marginal buyers would be hurt by buying at these levels.For those who want to be long, but at less risk, I offer a call option that would give most of any upside at much less risk.","Over the past twelve months, the shares of Altair Engineering Inc. (ALTR) are up about 113%, and I think investors would do well to sell now before price and value inevitably collide. Unlike many of the technology companies I’ve reviewed lately, this company is actually profitable, and it seems that the more they sell, the greater is their free cash flow. This quality alone makes Altair strangely singular. My problem is with the valuation. At the moment, shares are priced at more than 200 times free cash flow, and no business is worth that price. In my view, the more you pay for a given stream of future cash flows, the lower will be your subsequent return, and for that reason I recommend eschewing this name until price and value intersect. All that said, I think investors get excited about names like this and they’re loathe to let a “winner” go. For those people I offer an alternative that I think is far less risky. I think people who are still long the stock can derive most of the benefits of stock ownership at far less risk with call options. I go through the specific strategy below.Altair Engineering is a company that develops engineering software that enables its customers to innovate across their entire life cycle (from concept design to in-service operation). The company has a host of high fidelity and high performance “physics solvers” that allows customers to visualize and optimize design in a host of environments (structures, motion, fluids, thermal management, electromagnetics etc.).The company’s computer aided engineering (CAE) suite is one of the most innovative offerings available in the market. In addition to offering the suite of software products, the company deepens its relationships with customers by offering both training and consulting services. The company’s recent financial performance is obvious testimony to the quality of and demand for its offerings.In many ways, the financial performance at Altair has been good enough in my estimation. For example, revenue has grown at a CAGR of about 4.3% since 2015, while gross profit has grown at a CAGR of about 5.2%, suggesting a certain level of scalability. Even more compelling is the fact that revenue has grown about 18% in the first six months of this year compared to last. Additionally, the company has turned from a loss in the first half of 2017 to a more normal profit in the first half of this year.Unfortunately, there are some problems that I can’t ignore here. Growth should lead to increased profitability, though it doesn’t seem to be doing much to move the profit needle in this case. While revenue has grown, R&D expenses, Sales and Marketing expenses, and “G&A” have grown at CAGRs of 14%, 8.2%, and 18%, respectively. This should stir a question in the minds of the bulls, namely, what will change in the future to make revenue grow at a faster rate than expenses of various types?Also problematic is the fact that shareholders have been diluted fairly substantially in my view, and marginal investors are buying a much smaller share of any future profitability. Specifically, share count has grown at a CAGR of 6.4% over the past 3 ½ years.This certainly isn’t the most egregiously bad financial performance I’ve reviewed over the past few months. It may be a worthwhile investment, if investors can purchase the shares at a reasonable price.Source: Company filingsI’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. A great company can be a terrible investment if you pay too much for future cash flows. Additionally, a slow growth business, or a turnaround, can be a great investment if you pay a good price. This determination generally comes down to some variation of a numerator of future cash flows, and the denominator that represents your capital outlay. The lower the denominator, the better, obviously. I employ a host of methods to determine whether the current price of a given share is “good” or “bad,” and I talk about two of these methods on this forum. The simplest of these to understand is the standard price to free cash flow formula, which obviously tracks the relationship between stock price and free cash that the underlying business throws off. In this regard, Altair is quite expensive in my view relative to both the overall market and to its own history.Source: GurufocusThis phenomenon is obviously a function of share price appreciation, given that free cash flow increases have largely been offset by dilution, making “per share” free cash flow approximately flat over the past few years. In my view, there’s no company that’s worth more than 200 times free cash flow, and on this basis alone, I’ll disqualify this company from consideration.These shares aren’t my cup of tea, obviously. That said, I understand that some investors prefer buying companies based on the anticipation of some future state where things will work out well. For those people, I recommend what I think is a far safer way to play this name.At the time of this writing (September 28), the shares are trading for $42.23 and the bid ask spread on the April calls with a strike price of $45 is $2.80 to $5.70. I’m going to assume that an investor is simply rushed for time and buys the above mentioned call at the asking price of $5.70. In that circumstance, they would have put up 13% of the capital that is used with share ownership, and enjoy most of the upside the stock might deliver over the next seven months. At the same time, they’ve reduced their risk by about 87%, having taken the lion’s share of capital “off the table.” I think this presents investors with a positive asymmetric payoff. If I’m wrong, and the shares continue to rally from here, investors enjoy most of that upside. If, as I suspect is likely, the valuation starts to weigh on the shares over the next six months, far less capital is exposed. So, I’m explicitly suggesting that investors sell their shares and, for every lot of shares they own, they replace it with the April call with a strike of $45. This strategy gives people most of the flavor of gains at far fewer calories of risk.I think Altria Engineering is an intriguing business with a potentially very profitable future. The problem is that I’m not the only one who feels that way, and the shares have been bid up to reflect that reality. At more than 200 times free cash flow, it could be said that the shares are priced for perfection, and if the company delivers anything less than perfect results, it will result in a fall in price. For that reason, I recommend avoiding this stock in favor of a host of other more profitable ones. For those who don’t want to abandon this party and see further upside in this stock, I recommend taking a much more defensive position at this point. Calls give you most of any upside, and will protect your capital against the downside that I believe is just over the horizon."

Within the small-cap space, however, several stocks have seen relatively smaller losses, despite huge risks emerging in their fundamentals.Altair Engineering (ALTR), in my view, falls into this bucket. It's true that Altair's nearly 40-year history (the company was founded in 1985) means that the company has seen several cycles and the market may be giving it credit for that, but I believe the coronavirus has heavily impacted the specific industries that make up Altair's biggest end-markets. In spite of this, shares are down only ~20% year-to-date, outperforming other small-cap stocks by a factor of 1.5x.Data byYChartsIn my view, Altair is a value trap at current levels. The stock has been buoyed by its recent trend of >20% y/y revenue growth, accelerating over the growth levels that Altair managed to achieve at the time of its IPO in 2017. However, that growth streak may come to an abrupt end once investors see quarterly results that are impacted by the coronavirus.For investors who are unfamiliar or need a refresher on Altair, the company's principal product is a software program called HyperWorks. It's one of the leading computer-aided engineering (NYSE:CAE) programs in the market, helping engineers and architects simulate their ideas before starting real-world builds. Aside from larger projects, Hyperworks is also capable of helping manufacturers and product designers test the physics of their products in a simulation environment as well.Figure 1. Altair HyperworksSource: Altair.comNaturally, a product like this lends itself specifically to a handful of industries. Altair's description of its customers, taken from its latest 10-K filing, notes that 50% of its billings comes from automotive and aerospace companies. Figure 2. Altair customer descriptionSource: Altair 10-KRecent headlines contain nothing but bad news for both of these sectors. Earlier this week, investors heard that Boeing (BA) received cancellations for roughly 150 jetliner orders. On the automobile side, another article describes U.S. vehicle production as having come to a ""screeching halt"", with the virus taking 93% of production offline. Needless to say, it's not exactly a convenient time to have half of your revenues exposed to these heavily impacted industries.Several other end-markets in Altair's portfolio are dealing with their own issues as well: the energy sector is dealing with record-low oil prices and are taking rigs and drilling wells offline to adjust to the lack of demand, while heavy equipment manufacturers like Caterpillar (CAT) have also slowed down their supply chain.Exiting Q4, Altair was growing software product revenues at an impressive 20% y/y growth rate (which, as previously mentioned, is substantially higher than the single-digit growth rates at which Altair was running during its 2017 IPO, and likely the biggest driver for Altair's share price growth over 2019). Altair has already taken a more moderate stance for growth in 2020, guiding in late February (before the full impacts of the coronavirus were truly felt) to $395-$399 million in software product revenues, representing 8-9% y/y growth.While the company is already baking in a slowdown for 2020, we now wonder if Altair has been conservative enough, given how its biggest end-markets are in disastrous straits with no current end in sight.Figure 3. Altair 2020 guidanceSource: Altair Q4 earnings releaseOf course, the weakness in Altair's end-markets raises an important question: what exactly is the impact to Altair and its billings?Many software companies face the prospect of a slowdown in billings, but not to the same extent as Altair - thanks to Altair's unique revenue model. Unlike many modern software companies, Altair isn't a pure subscription-based SaaS company, though in the past it's been able to retain licenses at a decent 88% rate. Typical SaaS companies will enjoy the ability of still collecting revenue even as their underlying customers' businesses go under, barring extraordinary circumstances. CAD software company Autodesk (ADSK), for example, is similarly positioned as Altair and many of its end-customers reside in the same troubled end-markets, but its recent decision to switch to a SaaS billings model will protect it from some of this cyclical downside.Altair two principal billings methods, as it describes in its 10-K:Figure 4. Altair license revenue modelSource: Altair 10-KThe more prominent of these billings model, however, is its patented units-based licensing model. Under this type of license, customers purchase a certain amount of units that they can share across their team. Customers spend their ""units"" by consuming a specific amount of usage on the Altair platform, and when they run low on units, they can re-load their license the same way a person might load up on a gift card.A simple visual of how this model works, taken from Altair's IPO documents, is shown below:Figure 5. Altair units-based licensing modelSource: Altair S-1Altair has credited this units-based model with providing its customers a flexible, low entry-barrier way of purchasing its software. But with usage expected to drop as Altair's clients halt production and delay projects, and in many cases lay off or furlough their own workers, Altair's customer base will likely end up sitting with a pile of unused credits - reducing their need to buy additional units from Altair in 2020. Unlike seat-based or time-based subscription software models, Altair's ability to retain and grow revenue depends on the volume of engagement its software gets with customers. So to the extent that customers are still ""subscribed"" to Altair's services, they won't actually end up buying more units (or more than a minimal amount of units) if they don't need more, unlike SaaS companies who simply charge for a full month's access without regard to usage. Altair faces the same problem that storage/memory, consumer products, and wholesale retail companies face - in order to sell in more units, customer inventory has to drain first.It's also worth pointing out that amid this expected revenue drop, Altair has a fairly thin liquidity position to support it. The company's most recent balance sheet holds $223.1 million in cash, alongside $178.2 million of debt - making for a net cash position of just $44.9 million, which is less than a quarter's worth of operating expenses.Figure 6. Altair balance sheetSource: Altair Q4 earnings releaseDespite my overall bearishness on Altair, I don't think Altair's liquidity picture is overall too concerning for three principal reasons:Figure 7. Altair debt repayment scheduleSource: Altair 10-KHowever, it remains to be seen if Altair can continue to keep up its positive FCF status with end-customer demand likely to dampen significantly this year. Its <$50 million net cash position for a company that has an annual total revenue run rate of ~$500 million is a bit tight for comfort.To me, the risk-reward profile in Altair isn't favorable. We're looking at massive uncertainty as to how the coronavirus will impact Altair's revenue (read-through from news reports on Altair's main end-markets suggest the impact will be severe), especially with a consumption-based model that puts Altair at a greater risk of loss than SaaS companies. Stay on the sidelines here until Altair's fundamental picture becomes more clear."
4174566,103480,2018-05-16T05:44:46-04:00,"Altair posted a surprise jump in revenues in Q1, growing 19% y/y after exiting the prior year with a single-digit growth rate.The strong upside to Wall Street's expectations helped to lift Altair's shares 7% in response to earnings.The growth was essentially all organic; though the company made two acquisitions in the quarter, the contribution to revenues was immaterial.Altair also signed a distribution partnership with GE for the latter's system modeling software, an agreement that can be highly accretive to revenues.Free cash flow and EBITDA margins also continued to shine in the quarter.","Altair Engineering (ALTR), the Michigan-based developer of computer-aided engineering software and one of the oldest software companies in existence, has surprised investors with strength in Q1 earnings that marked a rapid departure from the company's usual sleepy trajectory. After growing at just 8% in its prior quarter (Q4) and 6% for the entire year FY17, Altair jumped to 19% y/y growth in Q1, helped by strong billings activity by major clients overseas. I haven't always been the biggest fan of the company, but the bullish signals coming from Altair's Q1 results have caused me to shift my assessment.The market is taking note of Altair's accomplishments as well. Rallying in response to the Q1 results, Altair's shares jumped 7%, one of the company's best one-day performances to date:ALTR data by YChartsWe're now more than six months past Altair's IPO, which priced at $13 in late October. Altair's lockup expiration date came and passed on April 30, and surprisingly, the company emerged unscathed (a very rare occurrence for technology IPOs that have appreciated more than 2x from their IPO price) and is now racing toward all-time highs. One word of caution here: just because a flood of selling pressure hasn't hit Altair yet doesn't mean it won't come. With the lockup restrictions lifted, all of Altair's shares are available for sale, and it's more than likely that some insiders sitting on ~2.5x gains since the IPO will be wanting to cash out.The question for investors is: does Altair have more upside from here? It seems to me that if the company can continue its current growth streak, it certainly does have room to appreciate more. Altair is, essentially, a smaller and cheaper-valued version of Autodesk (ADSK) - a useful rough comparison, though not entirely accurate as Autodesk specializes in computer-aided design (CADs) software. Practical applications of Altair are generally more technical than Autodesk, though they both serve similar functions in the engineering and design process.A roundup on Altair's new, higher valuation: at its post-earnings price in the mid-$33 range, Altair carries a market cap of $2.11 billion. With $63 million of cash and $1 million of debt on its balance sheet, the company's enterprise value is $2.05 billion. Against the company's refreshed FY18 guidance of $369-$371 million in revenues (11-12% y/y growth range, and up from a prior midpoint guidance of $364 million or 9% growth), this represents an EV/FY18 revenue multiple of 5.5x. Figure 1. Altair FY18 and Q2 guidanceSource: Altair investor relationsCertainly, this is cheaper than most stocks in the software/SaaS sector, though Altair's growth deficiency certainly does justify the discounted multiple. But with Autodesk also seeing sluggish or negative growth in recent quarters (though this is due to its planned cloud transition, not due to a fundamental slowdown in end-customer demand), and with Autodesk trading at approximately 12x forward revenues (see below), there's a wide range of possibilities as to what Altair could be worth.ADSK EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsThis is especially true as Altair develops into a free cash flow story. FCF in Q1 grew a blistering 37% y/y to $25.0 million, up from 1Q17's FCF of $18.2 million. Now, we can't simply extrapolate that $25 million forward and say Altair is running at a $100 million FCF run rate, as the company generally accrues the majority of its FCF in Q1 (indeed, the other quarters tend to be negative). But with 37% growth in FCF outpacing Altair's revenue growth, the company is well on its way to having free cash flow support its ~$2 billion enterprise value - especially seeing as very few software companies have achieved FCF positive status.Let's take a look at Altair's full results for the first quarter:Figure 2. Altair Q1 resultsSource: Altair investor relationsAs previously mentioned, Altair grew revenues 19% y/y to $91.7 million, starkly beating analyst consensus of $86.9 million (+13% y/y) by six points - a huge beat for a company whose growth rate is this modest. Not to mention the fact that Altair saw a huge acceleration over the 8% growth rate at which it exited Q4. Also note that all of this growth can be considered organic - Altair's CEO mentioned on the earnings call that the company acquired two small companies, CANDI Controls and FluiDyna, in the quarter, but the associated revenue contributions were inconsequential.Software product revenues saw even stronger growth of 26% y/y in the quarter to $68.1 million, overtaking a larger portion (74%) of the company's revenue mix, versus 70% in 1Q17. The mix shift toward software is important as it carries the lion's share of the gross margin. Software services, client engineering services, and other revenues are essentially performed at cost. Due to the stronger mix of software revenues in the quarter, Altair's gross margin expanded 300 bps to 68.2% in the quarter, up from 65.2% in the year-ago period.Alongside cost efficiencies achieved on the general and administrative spending front, the upside growth and gross margin boost helped to boost Altair's operating margin to 4.6% in the quarter, up from -3% in 1Q17. A 4.6% operating margin might sound small, but in the context of the software industry where most companies of Altair's scale are running huge losses, a positive operating margin of any magnitude is already an accomplishment.Similarly, Altair turned a GAAP net loss of -$2.2 million in the year-ago quarter into a profit of $3.9 million this quarter. EPS of $0.08 in the quarter also showed huge upside to analysts' expectations of $0.03.Another useful nugget from the company's earnings call is the fact that Altair saw healthy expansion activity in the quarter and expects to continue that trend going forward. For an established software company like Altair, expansion bookings generate much of the revenue growth as well as margin potential versus new business. This quarter in particular, investors have zoomed in on revenue retention trends as Cloudera's (CLDR) warning on expansion bookings and associated soft guidance sent shares tumbling more than 40% in one day. Luckily for Altair investors, the signal on expansion opportunity from Altair's CEO, Jim Scapa, is quite the opposite:In the quarter, Altair also signed a significant distribution partnership with General Electric (GE), which covers a multi-year exclusive distribution agreement for GE's comprehensive system modeling software. With a well-known industrial brand like GE tying up with Altair, the company has a huge opportunity to chase more incremental revenues from a new suite of products.Relative to Altair's outperformance this quarter, the company's guidance range of 11-12% y/y growth for the year appears modest. There's definitely room for upside as Altair continues to rediscover a mid-teens growth rate after stagnating for much of 2017.Shares are probably a little too hot right now, coming off an explosive earnings quarter and with the risk of a recent lockup expiration still hanging over the stock. I'd wait for a pullback before entering a position in Altair, but the outlook for this company definitely looks much brighter than ever."
4115806,103480,2017-10-24T12:07:38-04:00,"Altair has released updated details for its upcoming ~$144 million offering, listing 12 million shares for sale at an initial range of $11-13.The Michigan-based software company is the developer behind HyperWorks, its flagship computer-aided engineering (CAE) program.The company is unique among software IPOs this year as it's a slow grower (revenues grew 4% y/y in the first half of 2017), but is profitable.Altair generated $10.2 million in GAAP net profit ($0.21 EPS) on $313.2 million of revenues in FY16.","The IPO bandwagon keeps rolling on as we head into the final months of 2017. I suspect there's an innate feeling among tech CEOs that the IPO window is open now for a limited time - with the NASDAQ soaring to new highs and institutional investors clamoring for new deals to sink their teeth into - before it shuts again, as it was for the majority of 2017. Nevertheless, the recent spate of September/October tech IPOs have performed decently well as investor appetite for IPOs remains strong.The latest to join the party is Altair (NASDAQ:ALTR), the Michigan-based computer-aided engineering (CAE) program founded in 1985 and best known for its flagship HyperWorks program. Many industry observers will undoubtedly draw parallels between Altair and Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), perhaps one of the best known companies in CAD (computer aided design). However, CAD differs somewhat from CAE - the primary purpose of CAD software is to design the product; the primary purpose of CAE is to test its engineering characteristics (will the materials hold up? how will they perform under stress?). Other well-known products in this sphere include MATLAB, which is heavily used in university engineering courses.Altair's financials revealed a bit of a surprise - its profile is very different from the cloud SaaS companies that went public recently, which are growing very quickly (>40%) and burning cash at huge rates. But then again, Altair is different in many regards from a traditional Silicon Valley startup - with its 1985 founding date, it's more than twice as old as other Silicon Valley companies; it's headquartered in Michigan, a state with very few prominent technology companies; and it's also not venture-funded.At the midpoint of its initial pricing range of $11-13 per share and using the undiluted 60.4 million post-IPO share count in its S-1 filing, Altair is seeking a valuation of about $725 million, significantly smaller than its ""unicorn"" cousins in Silicon Valley and only a ~2.1x multiple to its forward revenues. Even if this is no longer a growth company, is that valuation discount too large, and is this the deal of the century?More than likely, Altair will follow up with a hiked-up pricing range - as MongoDB (NASDAQ:MDB) did in the final days leading up to its IPO, moving up its range from $18-20 to $20-22 and ultimately pricing at $24. So, expect this $11-13 number to be a moving target. However, even if Altair notches up its pricing range to, say, $13-15, the company is still valued at a significant discount to software peers (even when accounting for its lack of a growth premium, the delta is still too wide), especially when it has earnings and cash flow support.IPO details are not yet final, as I think there's nearly zero chance Altair will end up pricing within its own stated range, so it's too early to declare a long/short verdict on this exciting new name. However, it's more than likely that this will be an IPO that can bear meaningful gains at the outset, so we'll highlight the key points of the Altair IPO and business and extract the need-to-knows for the upcoming offering.The company hasn't set a firm IPO date yet, but the NASDAQ IPO Calendar has an estimated IPO date of November 1.Altair is a company built around its flagship CAE offering, Altair HyperWorks. In Altair's own S-1 words, ""CAE software allows engineers to simulate, predict, and optimize how physical products will perform in the real world under a range of operating conditions.""Unlike 3D CAD programs like Autodesk's AutoCAD, HyperWorks is meant to assess performance of an engineering prototype post-design on a variety of engineering metrics and real-world stress tests. Given a set of constraints and targets, HyperWorks' complex algorithms (bundled in a self-described ""solver"") help engineers to finalize the components and properties that go into their end products.Engineering processes have long been reliant on software and optimization tools, and that trend has not slowed down as more and more tasks get turned over to computer-driven processes. Engineers manage enormous amounts of complexity - with multiple constraints, multiple targets, and multiple inputs - creating an impossible matrix of outcomes to optimize manually. University-level engineering courses already instill CAD and CAE software best-practices into its students, so by the time these new recruits join engineering orgs, they are already accustomed to working almost entirely on software.HyperWorks has a rich feature set, allowing for optimization of constrained problems (its core function), as well as advanced modeling and visualization features. The following infographic - taken from Altair's website - showcases how Daimler AG (OTCPK:DDAIF) used HyperWorks to optimize the windscreen antennas in its cars:Figure 1. Daimler case studyFor investors, the key piece to glean from charts like these is that engineering processes have become extraordinarily complex and involve many moving pieces, necessitating the aid of algorithmic solvers like HyperWorks. In use cases like these, HyperWorks can help vehicle engineers do weight testing, ""squeak & rattle analysis,"" fatigue assessment, and other functions.Aside from HyperWorks, Altair also has a few other niche offerings: solidThinking, a subset of HyperWorks primarily targeted toward SMB enterprises; Altair PBS Works, primarily marketed toward IT professionals and pharmaceutical scientists; and Carriots, a PaaS platform for IoT projects that lets users store and process data from various device inputs.Altair prides itself on a unique, patented subscription model which it calls ""unit-based."" Under this model, Altair charges customers based on the number of ""units"" they wish to purchase - this is generally understood to mean time/processing-power based units of software usage - that can then be used by any user within an organization, on virtually any product in the Altair suite.Put another way, Altair's subscription model is similar to purchasing tokens to use at an arcade. For a flat rate, anyone in your family can play any game in the arcade, limited to the amount of tokens you're holding. This model differs from traditional enterprise software licensing models. Under a traditional on-premise license model, corporate clients purchase unlimited, perpetual (never expires) usage for a certain amount of users, with maintenance and upgrades costing additional fees as time goes on. Under the newer SaaS-based subscription model, clients typically pay (on a monthly or annual basis) for a specific number of users or amount of processing power on an application.Under Altair's model, however, clients purchase units allocated to a pool from which any user can draw. This system is diagrammed below, taken from the company's S-1:Figure 2. Altair units-based subscription modelAltair believes this flexible units-based spend invites customers to purchase licenses at a low upfront cost (a similar argument to the cloud subscription model), as well as improve its retention rates. Altair discloses an 88% recurring software license rate.Altair's primary industry verticals are automotive, consumer goods/electronics, aerospace, rail, oil & gas, and heavy machinery.The company derives an even third of its revenue between the three key geographies: 34% of billings derived from the Americas, 33% from Asia, and 33% from Europe.Altair is on the larger side of the software IPO spectrum - which is to be expected, given the company is 30 years old and no longer a startup - but it's growing slower than the majority of its software peers.The company generated $313.2 million of revenue in FY16, up 6.5% y/y from FY15 revenues of $294.1 million. In the first half of 2017, it generated $158.5 million, up 4.1% from 1H16. See the company's revenue breakdown below:Figure 3. Altair revenue resultsThe company generates the bulk of its revenue from software licenses; however, it does generate a small portion (~15%) of its revenue from ""client engineering services,"" which are similar to long-term consulting projects with clients.Billings tracked ahead of revenue in all periods, indicating that the company is adding to its future revenue pipeline - a leading indicator of future growth. Billings new 10% y/y in 1H17 to $181.4 million, far ahead of revenue growth of 4%. When in doubt between revenue growth and billings numbers, it's usually the billings growth rate that gives the better measure of business health - as revenue only captures past performance, and billings encompasses future revenue to be recognized.Figure 4. Altair BillingsTurning to margins: like other software companies, Altair boasts a high gross margin (66.1% as of 1H17), which indicates high unit profitability of each underlying subscription and gives Altair the potential to scale out profitability as it grows - though as Altair's growth has leveled off, it's not likely to see the same level of operating margin increases as its higher growth peers.Still, however, Altair's positive operating of 5% in FY16 is a lot better than the majority of its SaaS peers that are still in the negative 20s and 30s. It's important to note, however, that the company swung to an operating loss in 1H17 of $9.1 million (versus a gain of $7.2 million in 1H16). The company swung to a GAAP net loss of $9.4 million as well in 1H17 versus a gain of $4.0 million in 1H16.The swing to a net loss in FY17 is largely due to Altair tacking on large stock-based comp expenses in 2017, leading up to the IPO. Stock-based comp increased by $13.9 million in 1H17, distributed evenly across the operating spend components of R&D, sales & marketing, and general & administrative, increasing each of those components as a percentage of Altair's revenue and driving down its operating margin. Netting out the increase in stock-based comp, Altair would have reported a gain.Altair's cash flow metrics strip out the effects of stock-based comp. While it's important from an accounting perspective to recognize cost associated with stock-based comp (as dilution is a real cost to shareholders), when analyzing the cash flow potential of the business, stock-based comp is meaningless as it has no bearing on the company's actual expenses.Altair's free cash flow grew 19% y/y in 1H17 to $21.8 million. This FCF figure is also higher than the $11.9 million Altair generated in the whole of FY16. On a trailing 12-month basis, Altair generated $15.4 million of free cash flow.While these are small numbers, it's important to realize that most of Altair's software IPO peers - such as Cloudera (NYSE:CLDR) and MongoDB are consuming gobs of cash at alarming rates. Given Altair has had a history of profitability, it has a decent amount of room to improve its cash flow growth.On a GAAP basis, it wouldn't be unlikely for Altair to return to net income profitability for FY17, as the company's business heavily leans on Q4 (December) for a huge revenue and profit growth.Altair's IPO documents call for a total offering of 8,065,004 shares at an initial range of $11-13, with 4,130,008 shares being new (dilutive) issuances and the remainder being existing stock tendered by current shareholders.Using Altair's undiluted post-IPO share count of 60,390,940 shares provided in the S-1 and an IPO pricing at $12 (the midpoint of the range) would imply a launching market cap of $724.7 million.The company will use its net proceeds from the offering (which it estimates to be $85.9 million) to pay down $71.1 million of debt, leaving its net cash intake at $14.8 million. Adding this to the company's existing cash balance of $17.4 million (as of its June 2017 balance sheet) and netting out its total post-IPO cash position yields an indicative enterprise valuation of $692.5 million.This would yield a revenue multiple of ~2.2x based on trailing 12 months revenues (extremely cheap relative to peers) and a ~45.0x FCF multiple, which is in line to slightly expensive relative to peers. Given the instability in Altair's FCF, however, the revenue valuation is probably the best to focus on - especially as revenue multiples are how the majority of Wall Street as well as investors view software company valuations.Also as a corollary - the company's FY16 EPS of $0.21 implies a P/E ratio of 57.1 - but with net income, as Altair's stock-based comp messes with the linearity of its earnings trends, the P/E ratio is probably not the best indicator of value.So, what do we have here? A software company that's showing slow growth like an industrial company, but is profitable? Certainly, Altair is a different animal from the SaaS companies we've seen go public this year - the typical Silicon Valley-backed software startups that are growing at insane rates, but losing equally mind-boggling amounts of cash. Cloudera, MongoDB, MuleSoft (NYSE:MULE), Alteryx (NYSE:AYX), and Appian (NASDAQ:APPN) all belong to this category.With Altair's profile vastly different from the software IPOs that preceded it, investors are sure to have their interest piqued, at the very least, by the novelty. In my view, the cheapness of the initial range of $11-13 is unlikely to last. The IPOs of recent months have almost all thrown out an initial range as a sort of ""teaser rate,"" with the final pricing landing higher.At $12, Altair looks cheap from a revenue basis and okay from a cash flow basis - though forward guidance from the company (probably not to be expected until its first earnings call) would be extremely helpful in charting out the company's growth and constructing more appropriate forward-looking multiples, instead of backward-looking valuations.Based on where valuation ultimately lands on the Altair IPO, I would consider a long position in the stock. It can expand its revenue multiple to at least 3x (this may sound like a small multiple expansion, but starting at a base of 2.2x, this implies nearly a 40% upside from a $12 stock price). I would be careful assigning premium multiples to this stock, however, given its lower growth profile and lack of major ""buzz"" around the company and its product that often adds fuel to the IPO narrative."

Altair is actually a fairly old technology company - it was founded in 1985 and was largely bootstrapped until it received a private equity injection in the early 2000s, and throughout its history Altair has primarily been known for its HyperWorks product, which allows engineers to simulate and optimize how physical parts will perform in a number of real-world scenarios - for example, how the brakes in a car will perform under certain road conditions at a certain speed. This is tangential, but not directly in-line with what Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK), its much larger cousin, is known for - Autodesk's AutoCAD products allow engineers to simulate designs of products.Altair went public at $13/share in the first week of November and was immediately successful, jumping to nearly $20 in its first day of trading. At $13/share, Altair seemed substantially undervalued - especially as it was trading at just over 2x EV/FTM revenues and actually posted GAAP profits, unlike most software companies. Since then, and post-earnings, Altair has risen even further to the $22 range:ALTR data by YChartsBased on the fact that shares are up ~70% since the IPO, the lockup expiration (on 4/30/2018) has yet to pass, and that Altair is growing only in the single digits, I believe it's time to take cash off the table in Altair. With no substantial impetus for growth, a further rise in price is unlikely - Altair's valuation can't get out of lockstep with its fundamentals, as there's no real buzz in the markets for this company. It's also important to note that optimism has turned rather sour on Autodesk after it announced the elimination of nearly 1,200 jobs (13% of its workforce). Due to the fact that Autodesk is Altair's closest proxy in the market, it's more than likely that fear for Autodesk could spill over to Altair.Let's dive into Altair's Q3 results. As shown in the chart below, Altair posted $84.9 million in Q3 revenues (+9% y/y), above analyst consensus of $83.1 million (+7% y/y). Year to date, Altair's revenues of $243.5 million have grown 6% y/y.Figure 1. Altair Q3 revenueSource: Altair earnings press releaseSoftware-only revenues - which the company is focusing on due to its higher margins - grew 13% y/y to $63.2 million, again outpacing YTD growth of 8%. Conversely, Altair is lessening its focus on engineering services revenues, which declined on a y/y basis - as these one-time consultative projects are done largely at cost, with an extremely low margin.Yes, it's true that Altair's revenues accelerated somewhat in Q3. The company probably got the added benefit of an IPO ramp that accelerated its profile among customers. But is there really a path forward for this company? Altair acquired a small design automation company called Runtime in the quarter, and although the purchase price is undisclosed, Altair's cash flow statement reveals that the purchase price is probably in the single-digit millions. Altair is only going after bite-sized, incremental technology improvements - this is a company that thinks small, not big. At its current growth rate, it's highly unlikely for Altair to scale anywhere close to even $500 million in revenues in the next 5 years. This is a company that needs to be investing more into sales and product development and expanding its addressable market - at the moment, it looks like a tired story.Turning to profitability - due to ramp-up in costs in its IPO year, Altair's earnings margins have deteriorated rapidly, sinking into GAAP net losses. Even when comparing adjusted earnings figures (which add back Altair's large increases in stock comp), Altair is still a much less profitable company this year - and it's Altair's ability to turn positive GAAP net profits that was part of its IPO allure.Altair swung to a GAAP net loss of -$29.6 million this quarter - not a huge loss for a software company, but still a significant change from a net profit of $0.3 million in 3Q16. Altair bulls might say it's more fair to compare the company's pro forma metrics - as the jump in non-cash stock comp expenses are what drove Altair to a GAAP net loss - but even in Altair's adjusted earnings figures, contraction is evident.As shown below in the below table, also taken from the company's earnings release, Altair's Adj. EBITDA contracted to $7.0 million in 3Q17, down from $7.3 million in 3Q16. This also represents an 8.3% Adj. EBITDA margin, versus 9.4% in the prior year's Q3.Figure 2. Altair Q3 Adj. EBITDAAltair's free cash flow - which also adjusts for non-cash expenses like adj. EBITDA - tells a similar story. Altair's free cash flow of -$10.6 million is a much wider loss than $0.7 million in the prior year; year to date, Altair has generated just about 2/3 of the free cash flow it generated in the prior period.Figure 3. Altair Q3 free cash flowTo sum it up neatly, what Altair has shown us in its first quarterly release is an unpleasant combination of low growth, contracting margins and earnings, and lower free cash flow. At the outset of its IPO, Altair's free cash flow and low valuation made it attractive despite its low growth - now, with its stock price higher and its cash flow lower, the company is fairly uninspiring.As shown in the chart below, at Altair's recent close at ~$22, the company carries an enterprise value of $1.31 billion, or a multiple of 3.74x EV/FTM revenues, using an 8% growth estimation on its revenues.Source: author-created chart; data from public filingsWhile this multiple is cheap in relation to software other IPOs, Altair - unlike its peers that went public in 2017 - lacks the high growth component that is critical to its success story. Now is probably a good time to cash in on gains, as the upcoming lockup period (as well as future disappointing quarters) will create selling pressure on the stock."
4200433,103480,2018-08-20T02:13:12-04:00,"Shares of Altair Engineering continued their massive rise after posting healthy beats to top and bottom line estimates in Q2.Revenue growth continued at its pace in the high teens, a refreshing result after much lower growth in FY17.The company also raised its full-year guidance outlook by $10 million, now implying 14% y/y growth.Despite recent strength, Altair shares have already appreciated more than 3x from their IPO price and are now trading at 7x EV/FY18 revenues.The valuation multiple is extremely rich for a slower-growing, ""legacy"" software company.","There were many who thought Altair Engineering's (ALTR) results last quarter were a fluke. How is it possible that a ""legacy"" software company, which is now more than 30 years old, can stoke almost 20% y/y revenue growth after growing in the mid-single digits for all of FY17? Shares of Altair jumped last quarter, but there was hesitation that the trend couldn't continue.Yet the company proved naysayers wrong in Q2, the results of which were released in mid-August. The company continued to grow at a high-teens growth rate, and is also continuing to drive impressive EBITDA and free cash flow growth. Recall that of recent IPOs, precious few are actually profitable - most are growing in the 30-40% range, but are showing operating margins in the -20% range or worse. Among recent software IPOs, Altair's financial profile is quite the opposite - lower growth, but much better profitability. Yet in recent quarters, Altair has also shown that it can grow in the respectable high teens while still maintaining strong margins. The IPO landscape this year has been littered with big-ticket, popular names like Dropbox (DBX), Spotify (SPOT), DocuSign (DOCU), and the like - but few would actually guess that of the IPOs that have gone public over the last twelve months, Altair is actually one of the best performers. Last October when Altair went public, it did so at a price of just $13 per share, where it hovered for a while before entering into a massive earnings-driven rally this year. Now, in the short space of under a year, shares of Altair have returned more than 3x to early investors:I remain skeptical, however, that Altair's rally can continue. While I'm impressed by the company's results and its ability to ""rediscover"" growth, I think ultimately Altair's rally will be capped by its valuation and a TAM that is more or less saturated. A quick check on Altair's valuation - at the current share price just above $40, Altair has a market cap of $2.81 billion, based on the most recent share count of 69.9 million (recall that Altair just successfully completed a secondary offering, refilling its coffers with cash). Netting out the $199.2 million of cash on its balance sheet and the small $1.1 million sliver of debt, Altair has an enterprise value of $2.61 billion.Along with Q2 results, Altair just recently refreshed its full-year guidance as well, bumping it up by $10 million at the midpoint and now implying 14% y/y revenue growth for the year:Figure 1. Altair guidanceSource: Altair investor relationsAt Altair's current valuation, the stock is trading at:The valuation metric that makes the most sense is probably the revenue multiple. As much as investors make a big deal out of Altair being one of the few profitable recent SaaS IPOs, Altair's profitability levels are still not sufficient to support a normalized valuation for the company. There's no doubt that earnings are growing much faster than the top line, but Altair is probably still a year or more away from being able to rely on earnings-based valuation multiples.The revenue multiple, however, isn't that appealing either. A 7x forward revenue multiple is a normal valuation for a stock growing at ~30% or more. And while it's true that Altair's profitability justifies some of that premium, I'm hesitant to believe that the company can meaningfully expand its valuation multiple in the near term. Revenue growth has already softened this quarter - from 19% y/y growth last quarter to 17% y/y growth this quarter - so if Altair's revenue decelerates back down into the low teens or single digits, there's a good chance investors will back down from Altair's full valuation. Here's a look at Altair's Q2 results:Figure 2. Altair Q2 earningsSource: Altair investor relationsThere are certainly a lot of things to like about Altair's second quarter. Revenues grew 19% y/y to $95.6 million, far surpassing Wall Street's expectations of $91.6 million (+12% y/y). Analysts on the Street were evidently also wary that last quarter's high growth was a fluke. Yes, Altair did decelerate 2 points from last quarter's growth, but the deceleration was far more modest than most had feared. It's also important to note that it's software revenues that drove a large part of the growth. Software revenues grew 22% y/y to $72.8 million, comprising 76% of the revenue mix. Howard Morof, Altair's CFO, noted that the ""revenue mix shift continues favorably in the current quarter,"" largely due to the growth in software. Software services, on the other hand, were much more flat. Given that software revenues (and not services) contribute the majority of the margin, this is a positive trend for Altair's margin. As such, gross margin ramped up to 69.2% in the quarter, up a strong 220bps from 67.0% in 2Q17.One potential red flag is on billings. Recall that for SaaS companies, billings represents deal activity that has been contracted but not yet recognized as revenues. Over time as these services are performed, the deferred revenue backlog will be recognized as revenues in the current quarter. Altair was only able to grow billings by 4% y/y in Q2 to $89.5 million, counterbalancing a strong Q1 (overall in the first half of FY18, billings grew 13% y/y). Whenever billings lags behind revenue growth, it's a fairly convincing leading indicator that revenue growth will soon decelerate as well.On the profitability side, however, Altair continued to shine. Especially impressive was the fact that Altair managed to pare down general and administrative expenses (the least productive component of operating spend), decreasing it by -18% y/y to $17.4 million. Most companies treat revenue growth as permission to grow corporate overhead, but Altair has instead reduced it. As a result, operating margin hit 2.3% this quarter, up from a loss of -8.8% in 2Q17 - a huge shift, larger than ten points. Adjusted EBITDA grew 76% y/y to $7.3 million, and pro forma EPS of $0.05 also beat Wall Street consensus of $0.04. On the free cash flow side, Altair continued to produce tremendous growth, with FCF in the quarter growing 65% y/y to $9.2 million:Figure 3. Altair FCFSource: Altair investor relationsDespite the strengths in Altair's most recent quarter, I believe much of the upside is already priced into Altair's stock price. Though the company's profitability and cash flows are impressive, neither is sufficient yet to support the company's $2.6 billion enterprise value. Nor does the company have too much leeway on the revenue side, with a ~7x forward revenue multiple appearing fully valued. With Altair stock already up more than 3x in less than a year from its IPO, it's probably best to stay on the sidelines and let this stock cool off."
4121020,103480,2017-11-06T07:00:00-05:00,"Altair, the computer-aided engineering software company, priced its IPO at $13/share, the top end of its initial range of $11-13.The company tendered 12 million shares (~20% of its total capitalization) and raised $156 million in gross proceeds.In its first week of trading, shares have rallied 46% to $19, indicating a market cap of $1.2 billion.Given the company's lack of top-line growth, Altair is probably fully valued and has limited upside.","Looking back at Altair's (NASDAQ:ALTR) recent IPO, the company probably did a lot better in its public debut than it could ever have expected. The company set its initial pricing at $11-13 a share and ended up pricing at the top end of its range, probably not expecting that shares would rally 41% on the first day of trading. Through its first week of trading, Altair has barreled toward the $20 mark and is up 46% overall.Photo from NASDAQRecall that Altair has only grown its top line by 4% in the first half of 2017. As it is a much older company than the majority of its Silicon Valley software peers (Altair was founded in 1985), its high-growth period has probably already sunsetted. It's a small mystery why investors, who usually chase hypergrowth, were so drawn to Altair's offering.It's true that Altair is (intermittently) profitable - it swung to a net loss in 2017, due to higher noncash charges for stock-based compensation, but will likely return to GAAP net profit in the quarters following the IPO. On a free cash flow basis, Altair generated $21.8 million of FCF in the first half of 2017. But absent strong top-line growth - and the potential it brings for massive profit expansion - modest amounts of profit alone aren't usually enough to muster such enthusiasm.It's time for a reality check on Altair. As I wrote in my initial article on the IPO, Altair should trade up as high as ~3x EV/FTM revenues, roughly where the company is now; based on Altair's November 3 closing price of $19.37, the company has a market cap of $1.2 billion and a valuation of 3.3x EV/FTM revenues. Without any strong indicators for future growth or concrete expansion drivers, Altair will find it challenging to exceed its current trading range. While the company's low-single-digit valuation makes it seem like one of the rare value plays in software, it's really a value trap.James Scapa, the company's CEO, said that Altair's primary addressable market for simulation software is growing 8% a year. As much as management might spin this number to make it seem exciting, single-digit growth for a software niche is nowhere near enough. The most successful software startups that achieve Wall Street's highest valuations are operating in software categories that, per Gartner estimates, are growing at an estimated CAGR of 15%, 20%, or more through 2020. Largely as a function of its industry, and partly as a function of the company's own age and saturation, Altair is a company that has reached maturity and doesn't have much upside left.Here's how the cards fell in the Altair offering:In terms of Altair's cap table: unlike most software IPOs, Altair isn't primarily owned by VCs; according to Crunchbase, the company has never taken traditional VC financing, with its only outside capital injection coming from private equity firm General Atlantic in 2004. The firm doesn't show up in Altair's list of major holders shown below (taken from the S-1 document); it has presumably cashed out:Figure 1. Altair major holdersJames Scapa, the company's CEO, owns 12% of Altair.Here's where Altair's valuation stands based on its closing price of $19.37 after its first week of trading:After netting out $17.4 million of cash and $145 million of estimated IPO proceeds, and adding $71.1 million in debt (which will be paid down with a portion of the IPO proceeds), Altair's enterprise value stands at $1.08 billion.Assuming the company grows its LTM revenues of $319 million at 4% (the growth rate Altair achieved in the first half of 2017), it will generate an estimated $332 million in forward revenues, implying an EV/FTM revenues multiple of 3.25x.This enterprise value also implies an EV/FCF multiple of 70x, based on Altair's LTM free cash flow of $15.4 million. This FCF multiple at face value is already high. Then we have to consider the fact that based on Altair's preliminary Q3 release included in its S-1, it expects its cumulative FCF for 3Q17 to be at most $11 million, down from cumulative FCF of $21.7 million through 2Q16. This implies negative free cash flow of $10.7 million in Q3. With cash flow trending negative as the company's spending ramps up post-IPO, its already-high EV/FCF multiple of 70x might be overstated.Figure 2. Altair FCF estimates for Q3There's just not much to like with Altair's IPO - to be blunt, it's a company with very little growth and extremely modest profitability. Its revenue multiple in the mid-3s might look initially appealing, especially as its close cousin Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), which develops computer-aided design (CAD) software, trades at 10x. But with its top line barely moving from 2016 to 2017, Altair is basically static; it's never going to be a home-run company.Hurricane season in the U.S. has lifted the stocks of physical infrastructure and building companies, lifting up the stocks of the software companies that provide their technology as well. Perhaps part of the lift Altair saw in its initial trading was due to the hurricane theme - clearly, a factor that isn't going to last forever.Prior to Altair's initial jump to the mid-$19s, I had believed that there would be a valuation threshold (in the $13-15 range) at which Altair might be a profitable long; at $20, Altair is probably reaching the outer bounds of its realistic valuation. Until the company's fundamental picture becomes more clear and until it posts earnings that show renewed growth initiatives in new products or increased go-to-market pushes (after all, the company raised substantial capital in its IPO and should use at least a portion of it on growth initiatives), I would steer clear."

4358729,20715,2020-07-15T22:59:39-04:00,"TD Ameritrade is set to report fiscal third quarter earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday.A wedge is forming on the weekly chart, but there is a lot of space between the two trend lines at this time.Sentiment toward the stock is extremely bearish at this time, and it has grown more pessimistic in recent months.","Online brokerage firms have been doing well as a group over the last few years, especially from a fundamental perspective. Three companies in the industry are set to report earnings next week, but I chose to focus on TD Ameritrade Holding (AMTD). TD will report fiscal third-quarter results after the closing bell on Tuesday. E*Trade Financial (ETFC) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) are both scheduled to report next week as well.Analysts expect TD Ameritrade to earn $0.82 per share for the quarter, and that is down from the $1.04 the company reported in fiscal Q3 2019. One interesting note about the estimate is that it has been ratcheted up considerably in the last 90 days. Three months ago, the consensus estimate was for EPS of $0.61, so the current estimate is 34.4% higher than it was. The revenue is expected to come in at $1.38 billion, and that is down 7.2% from the same period last year.Over the last three years, TD Ameritrade has averaged earnings growth of 38% per year, but earnings are expected to decline by 23% for 2020 as a whole. Second-quarter results showed an 8% decline in EPS compared to last year. Revenue has increased at a rate of 23% per year over the last three years, and it was up 2% in the second quarter. For the year, revenue is expected to decline by 10.3%.The company’s management efficiency measurements are pretty strong, with a return on equity of 27.6% and a profit margin of 50.8%. As for current valuations, the stock is trading with a trailing P/E of 10.55 and a forward P/E of 16.16 - very reasonable levels.From a personal perspective, I have an account with TD Ameritrade and I really like its Thinkorswim platform. But I am far more involved with the market than the average person. I have spoken to a number of friends lately that have gotten involved in the market in the last few months. On a broad level, that concerns me because most people that are just getting started don’t understand that stocks move in two directions - up and down. On a company-specific level, I am little concerned that big brokerages are going to lose clients to the likes of Robinhood and other trading platforms.Turning our attention to the technical analysis for TD Ameritrade, we see on the weekly chart how there is a downward-sloped trend line that connects the highs from December, February and June. On the other hand, an upwardly sloped trend line has recently formed that connects the lows from March and June.This pinching action could create a huge move in the stock eventually, but at this time, the two trend lines are pretty far apart. We could see the stock rally by 25% before it really has to deal with the downward sloped trend line. It would also have to break through its 52-week and 104-week moving averages to reach the trend line.Conversely, the stock has just reversed higher from the selloff in June, and it looks like the weekly stochastic indicators will make a bullish crossover either this week or next. This suggests that the short-term momentum is to the upside.If we step back a little, we see that the stock has been trending lower for over two years now, with the all-time high coming in just shy of $60 in June ’18. When the stock bottomed in March, it had dropped over 50% from that high.Looking at the three main sentiment indicators that I use, investor sentiment toward TD Ameritrade is rather bearish and appears to be getting more pessimistic. There are 16 analysts covering the stock at this time, with only three “Buy” ratings but 13 “Hold” ratings. That gives us a buy percentage of 18.8%, and that is extremely low for a stock with the fundamentals of TD. Not only is the buy percentage low, but it has gotten lower in the last few months, as two analysts moved their ratings down to “Hold” from “Buy”.The short interest ratio is currently at 3.79, and that is slightly higher than average. If we look back over the course of the first half of the year, the ratio has been all over the place. The ratio spiked to 6.91 at the end of May, and that happened because of both sides of the equation - short interest jumped and trading volume declined. If we go back to the first of the year, the short interest has nearly doubled, while the trading volume is up approximately 25%.The put/call ratio is at 0.90, and that is in the normal range when compared to other stocks, but it is considerably higher than the 0.55 reading on April 22 when the company reported second-quarter results. I was a little surprised at the low open interest on both the puts and the calls considering how actively traded the stock is. There are 9,036 puts open and 10,027 calls open at this time. That includes contracts all the way out to next February, and the open interest represents less than two million shares of stock. The average daily trading volume is almost 5 million shares.Overall, we see that all three sentiment indicators are more pessimistic than the average stock and all three seem to be moving toward a more bearish stance. From a contrarian perspective, this could be good news for shareholders as we head in to the earnings report. The more bearish investors and analysts are, the lower the expectations. If the company can report better-than-expected earnings, we could see the stock jump sharply.I am reluctant to issue a long-term bullish stance on TD Ameritrade, and that is mainly due to the technical analysis. The downward trend in the stock that has gone on for over two years now is a concern. However, the fundamentals are good, but not great. The sentiment is extremely bearish, and that is a plus, in my book.From a short-term perspective, because expectations seem to be so low, I can see the stock rallying after the earnings report. It could jump back up to the $47.50 level in the next few weeks, but then it is going to face several layers of resistance.I can see buying TD for the short term and then playing it carefully if the stock gets up to the various resistance points. If the stock moves lower, look for the $35-36 area to act as support. If that support breaks, the stock could move all the way back down to $27.50, so be careful."

Let's find out what is going on and why it is a sweet deal for TD investors.TD's latest earnings for Q3/2019 came in very strong despite missing EPS estimates by a whisker of a penny. Far more important though is the monstrous beat on the top line with revenue growth of 6.1% Y/Y easily beating consensus by C$710M, the biggest beat over the last 5 years.It also marked the third time in a row and overall that TD recorded above C$10B in quarterly revenue and is currently on track to hit the next milestone of C$11B in 2020. Disregarding the minuscule miss on the bottom line EPS growth was very strong as well, rising from C$1.66 in the prior year quarter to C$1.79 reflecting growth of 8% Y/Y.The strong result was driven by double-digit growth in its U.S. Retail Bank segment where net income rose 11% Y/Y which was in turn driven by a 21% Y/Y in adjusted earnings from its stake in TD Ameritrade. Given that this quarter did not factor in the impact of zero commissions, all major U.S. brokers announced during Q4 we cannot expect this trend to continue but more on that later.The Whole Banking division recorded one of its strongest quarters in recent history with net income hitting C$244M and rising 9% Y/Y and rising by around C$23M sequentially following higher revenue across the board.TD's biggest segment, the Canadian Retail division, posted a solid quarter with revenue climbing 6% Y/Y and net income rising by 3%. The reason that the top line growth did not fully trickle down to the bottom line is that TD's Canadian Retail division invested heavily intoSource: TD Bank Earnings Release Q3 2019Provisions for credit losses (PCL) have increased on a Y/Y basis by almost C$100M with the ratio expanding 3bps to 38 basis points mostly driven by Canadian Retail. Despite PCL increasing Y/Y, this is not alarming at this point given that the ratio has remained stable quarter over quarter reflecting similar creditworthiness metrics across TD's Canadian and U.S. consumer lending portfolios.Source: TD Bank Earnings Slides Q3/2019On top of that, there are also some positive factors impacting PCLs:Source: TD Bank Earnings Call Q3/2019Although PCLs can be seen as an early indicator to gauge credit risk across loan portfolios, especially in a late cycle, the moderate ups and downs in TD's PCL metrics currently do not hint at deteriorating credit quality. And even if default rates would rise, TD's supportive and healthy capital and liquidity metrics can safely mitigate that impact for a certain time.Source: TD Bank Earnings Slides Q3/2019Interactive Brokers (IBKR) rattled the U.S. broker sector when it unexpectedly announced a new zero-commission service, IBKR Lite on Sep 26, 2019. Only a few days later on Oct 1, 2019, Charles Schwab followed suit when it announced to cut trade commissions from $4.95 to zero starting Oct 7, 2019. The entire sector was shaken with double-digit declines across the board among E*Trade (ETFC), TD Ameritrade, Interactive Broker and Schwab itself.It was only a matter of time before TD Ameritrade as the main competitor to Schwab would follow and it only took one day for that to unravel. TD Ameritrade cut commissions from $6.95 to $0, effective the next day and with the broker sector now essentially being a $0 commission business this is great news for investors but not that positive news for the brokers themselves.In the case of TD Ameritrade, it says it will lose around $220-$240M in revenue per quarter (15%-16%) which is a big hole to fill providing at least near-term challenges. Management however is very confident that with price no longer being in the mix to differentiate the various offerings, that this should actually benefit the company:Source: TD Ameritrade Earnings Release Q3 2019Management of TD Ameritrade showed its confidence in that strategy by announcing a solid 3.3% dividend hike despite the near-term EPS headwinds.Initially, it was speculated that TD Bank may use that sharp drop in TD Ameritrade's stock price to purchase the online broker with analysts pointing out TD Ameritrade's near historic low P/E multiple of 9.8x to be very accretive for TD Bank. However, Charles Schwab was quicker and announced the $26B deal only a couple of days later but this is good news for TD investors nevertheless.Source: marketwatch.comTD Bank will own a 13.4% stake in Charles Schwab including the TD Ameritrade stake once the deal is closing with around 10% of voting power. This will add significant value to its current investment in TD Ameritrade.Source: TD Bank Press ReleaseThe transaction will create by far the largest online broker in the U.S. with up to 24M client accounts and $5T in client assets. It is expected to be modestly accretive for TD Bank once the integration is complete lifting EPS by $0.04 and $0.07 in the second and third year post-closing.Source: TD Bank Investor RelationsAssuming different multiples on the combined Schwab-TD Ameritrade online broker, it could add between $3.5B to $6.2B in value of TD's investment or up to 6% of TD's current market cap. At the same time, it will have minimal capital impact on TD itself.This consolidation in the industry was the natural logical next step after all the major brokers switched to zero commissions but it was certainly surprising how quick Charles Schwab was with announcing the deal.Consolidation in the industry was expected given that all the major brokers dropped trading commissions in recent months, leaving brokerages scrambling to find ways to maintain profits.Right now, the company boasts a 3.8% yield and has been growing its dividend by 11% annually over the last 25 years. The latest raise came in Q1 2019 and boosted the dividend by 10%. Backed by its predictable business model, the company is targeting a payout range between 40-50% as it currently has positioned itself at the lower end of that range with a current payout ratio in the low 40% range. So the bank is well-positioned for further dividend growth in the future especially once the announced TD Ameritrade acquisition by Charles Schwab is completed.TD Bank is a strong dividend growth company with a conservative payout ratio and strong organic growth which makes it a perfect fit for every long-term dividend growth portfolio.An investment into TD Bank represents a sweet deal for investors. Earnings and revenue are growing across all business segments demonstrating the strength of TD's diversified business model. The bank has a very strong footprint in the U.S. and will have a much bigger presence in the U.S. online broker sector once the Charles Schwab deal is closed pending regulatory approval.Now that pricing has been removed from the entire online broker sector, near-term EPS headwinds should soon evolve into bottom line EPS growth as the major differentiator in the sector has been eliminated. The combined Schwab-Ameritrade offering will boast 24M client accounts and should see organic growth accelerate which in turn is good news for TD investors as well since the bank will own 13.4% of the new Charles Schwab company post-closing.Combining TD Bank's strong organic growth with the expected accretive impact of the Charles Schwab deal will help fuel high single-digit dividend growth for many more years.Bottom line, it is simply a sweet deal for investors.If you like this content and want to read more about this and/or other dividend-related topics, please hit the ""Follow"" button on top of the screen and you will be notified of new releases."
4309305,69675,2019-11-26T16:17:25-05:00,"The merger between Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade, while being done at a large premium for the latter, is appealing for all parties involved.Significant synergies are projected to be generated by the firms, due in part to a renegotiated agreement between the entities and TD Bank.Shareholders should see this as an excellent step forward to the firms creating more value for them in the long run.","November 25th was a big day for shareholders in both Charles Schwab (SCHW) and TD Ameritrade (AMTD). News broke, following several days of rumors, that the two companies will merge in an all-stock transaction that will see TD Ameritrade essentially absorbed by its larger rival. This move was looked upon with extreme favor by market participants, which is unusual when a company is taken over. Generally speaking, one player (usually the acquirer) is punished for the premium being paid, but in this rare instance, we saw the market push both higher. This was due to significant projected synergies that, if they come to fruition, will create real upside for all parties involved.The transaction proposed by Charles Schwab and agreed to by TD Ameritrade is fairly straightforward. In short, Charles Schwab will absorb TD Ameritrade in an all-stock deal that initially valued the latter at $26 billion. Shareholders of TD Ameritrade will receive 1.0837 shares of Charles Schwab for each share of TD Ameritrade they currently own. At the time this deal was agreed upon, shares of TD Ameritrade were worth $48.13 apiece, while Charles Schwab was trading for $48.20.*Taken from Charles SchwabThis translates to a price per share of $52.23 for TD Ameritrade for a premium of 8.5%. Though this may not seem like much, it’s actually a premium of about 17% over what TD Ameritrade saw for its 30-day VWAP (volume weighted average price). In response to the move, shares of Charles Schwab jumped 2.3%, while TD Ameritrade jumped 7.6%. After this, there’s still a spread of 3.2% to be gained if Charles Schwab does not see its share price change moving forward. In all, this would translate to an effective buyout price on TD Ameritrade of $28.95 billion.Following the completion of the deal, shareholders in Charles Schwab will still own a bulk of the combined company. In all, they will control 69% of the business, while shareholders of TD Ameritrade will own the remaining 31%. The largest holder of TD Ameritrade happens to be TD Bank which, right now, owns 43% of the business. This will translate to TD Bank controlling 13% of the combined entity, while all other shareholders of TD Ameritrade will own the remaining 18%.The beauty of all-stock deals is that synergies are generally pretty easy to realize because there are no offsetting costs (other than integration expenses) that get added to the enterprise in question (like interest expense that is common with debt-fueled deals). Together, Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade have a lot to work with in order to create value. Charles Schwab, today, controls $3.8 trillion worth of assets, while TD Ameritrade controls another $1.3 trillion. Together, this comes out to $5.1 trillion in assets on their books. As the image below illustrates, this places it right behind the size of Vanguard, which was $5.7 trillion in assets under management, and still quite far behind the $7.8 trillion that Fidelity has on hand.*Taken from Charles SchwabThough the businesses are remarkably similar, they are also very different from one another. Despite the difference in asset size, TD Ameritrade has a history of working more with smaller clients who trade more actively. Every active trading day, its 12 million account users make 1.096 million trades. This compares to the 769 thousand trades made by the 12.1 million account holders under Charles Schwab. Relative to size, TD Ameritrade also engages more with RIAs (Registered Investment Advisors). According to the presentation released by Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade provides services to more than 7,000 RIAs. Charles Schwab, by comparison, is only marginally larger with over 7,500 RIAs under its belt.*Taken from Charles SchwabThe exposure to RIAs is one of multiple reasons provided by the management team at Charles Schwab behind the transaction. In addition, the company cited the investor education tools, as well as TD Ameritrade’s trading platform that is used by active traders, as reasons for its decision to absorb the company. These things, combined with the awesome scale both companies already command, will help to generate significant synergies over time.*Taken from Charles SchwabIn all, Charles Schwab believes that absorbing TD Ameritrade will allow it to realize tremendous proceeds over time. The company believes that by the end of the third year following closing, it can generate annual run-rate synergies of between $3.5 billion and $4 billion. To put this in perspective, these synergies represent about 60% to 65% of TD Ameritrade’s expense base, and it should easily offset the decision by both firms to no longer charge commissions on many of their trades.Of the synergies created, management expects that between $1.8 billion and $2 billion will be in the form of expense synergies. Though this may seem hard to imagine, the company is planning to reduce its workforce (Charles Schwab has 19,800 employees to TD Ameritrade’s 10,000) and to optimize its geographical footprint (fancy wording for cutting out duplicate offices). The company also expects some of these savings to relate to technology and marketing, likely optimizing the first across two companies and seeing a net reduction in the second compared to having two standalone companies.While expense-related synergies will be significant, the company also expects to see between $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion in annual run-rate synergies by the end of year three as well. This will come from the aforementioned disparities between the two firms and how management will try to optimize them across their combined user base. All of these synergies combined, though, will not be cheap. According to management, the firm will need to spend about $1.6 billion in integration costs over the next three years to make these costs fall permanently. Thankfully, though, the benefits will begin to accrue immediately. In the first full year following the combination of the firm, Charles Schwab expects for the cash EPS (earnings per share) of the firm to grow by the single digits in Year 1. By Year 3, cash EPS will have expanded by between 15% and 20%, while GAAP EPS will have grown by between 10% and 15%.Another reason for the time needed to realize these synergies relates to an agreement that is currently in place. Right now, TD Ameritrade sees a significant amount of its IDAs (Insured Deposit Accounts) go through a cash sweep (and some go through non-sweep deposit accounts) with TD Bank. The company pays to TD Bank a fee of 25 basis points (or 0.25%) on these deposits. As part of this merger, TD Bank has agreed (under a 10-year contract) to cut this fee to 0.15% starting in 2021, plus every year Charles Schwab will be able to reduce the amount held by TD Bank by $10 billion, subject to an annual minimum of $50 billion. This setup allows Charles Schwab to save money on its IDAs, plus it will result in the company being able to probably save even more by allocating those proceeds toward its own banks. No estimate has been provided as to how much of the synergies will come from this revised agreement, but it’s safe to say that it will be significant.Right now, investors in Charles Schwab and TD Ameritrade should be happy with the management teams of both firms. It is true that TD Ameritrade is being absorbed by Charles Schwab, so shareholders are losing control of the business, but even if half of the proposed synergies come to be realized, the benefit for all parties involved will be material. The market, judging by the share price movement of both entities, appears to agree with me, and I would be surprised if the market doesn’t continue to reward investors in both entities in the long run as a result."
4295610,101959,2019-10-08T13:50:21-04:00,"TD Ameritrade followed its peers in slashing trading fees to $0.This is a great move for investors.It remains to be seen how the move will work out for the companies in the space, but this looks like a good spot to start a position in AMTD.","Is there blood in the streets? It sure seems like it. TD Ameritrade (NYSE:AMTD) is 41% off of its highs, after a 26% drop in one day last week. Its closest competitors, Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) and E-Trade (NYSE:ETFC), didn't get off easy either, with 9% and 16% drops, respectively.What caused this massive loss in market cap? Although not the first brokerage to do so, Schwab announced last week that it would be slashing commissions to $0, which triggered both E-Trade and TD Ameritrade's moves to do the same in short order. This is a natural move in the drawn out price war that has seen commissions slashed massively over the last 20 years. In that time, TD Ameritrade has been a great stock to own.Let's take a look at TD Ameritrade's business, and see if the deep discount on shares represents an opportunity.Although I am an owner of TD Ameritrade shares (thankfully it's a small portion of my portfolio), I can honestly say I was happy to hear the news last week. I think we can all agree that this is good news on the whole for the investing public, and a reduction in the cost of investing for the average retail investor is something I will always be glad to see. Sometimes its worthwhile to look back on what investing used to look like, and these companies, TD Ameritrade, E-Trade, and Schwab as well as Vanguard have been a huge part of making investing cheaper and more inclusive over time.Following TD Ameritrade's announcement, it took an almost unprecedented nose dive (the worst in 20 years) taking the company's share price back to where it was in 2015. This wasn't without reason. The company actually has the worst exposure to cutting trading fees with ~15% of revenues, or $200-$240M per quarter likely lost moving forward. That makes the decision by Schwab to push forward a very strategic one, considering its exposure is only ~7%. E-Trade has ~11% exposure.Schwab's move to cut fees to $0 first may have been a strategic move against TD Ameritrade and E-Trade, but the thing to remember here is that this was ultimately inevitable. Companies like Robinhood and M1 Finance have already offered commission free investing for some time, and even larger companies like Merrill Edge have offered free trades. Schwab forced the industry's hand, overall, but it had to happen eventually. The reason that these companies exist has been to lower prices for investors, and this was the ultimate goal line that the price cuts inevitably led to.So, how do these companies make money without the trading revenue? I think of it in a similar fashion to insurance companies. Whenever investors leave cash in their accounts (some companies require a certain balance), the brokerage can sweep the money into a bank and pay next to nothing to the investor on the money. This money is then used in some higher yielding way to give the brokerage a spread. When TD Ameritrade has $1.3 trillion in assets, we are talking about a pretty sizeable amount of money.TD Ameritrade, specifically, makes about 50% of its revenue from this method, and its partnership with Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE:TD), which owns ~40% of the company, allows TD Ameritrade to generate interest revenue without having to hold significant capital against it. The other companies make their money similarly. Then, add in margin accounts, investment advice, etc. to round out the rest of the revenue profile across the companies.TD Ameritrade's position in the industry sets it apart. The company was ranked #1 online broker in Kiplinger's Personal Finance and maintains a leadership position with its massive $1.3T in client assets in 11 million funded accounts (smaller than Schwab). This scale allows the company to drive incrementally higher margins with the addition of more customers, and the company is focused on maintaining higher retention, specifically using machine learning and analytics to improve its customer service experience.As far as growth for the company, this has definitely crimped revenue growth over the near to medium term. However, these companies have become highly interest-rate sensitive, so this may be a low point for TD Ameritrade. As interest rates move up and the industry adjusts to the new low fee environment, it's very likely that better days are ahead. I see today as a good spot to buy AMTD on a very high level of skepticism.Looking forward, consolidation is something to keep an eye out for. TD Ameritrade is fresh off of its acquisition of Scottrade, and E-Trade recently acquired Options House. E-Trade could be considered an acquisition target, and there is even a possibility of TD Bank merging with TD Ameritrade (it already owns 40%). All of this is just conjecture, but the industry is ripe for consolidation as companies attempt to maximize their scale to drive cost advantages with $0 commissions.YChartsTD Ameritrade's position isn't bad, financially. The company carries ~2.5B on the books in long-term debt, and its free cash flow has been strong. The dividend is currently yielding a massive (for AMTD) 3.56%, with the company currently trading 42% off of its 52-week high. Management is actively cutting costs, shuttering 80 retail locations, bringing the total footprint down to 283 locations. However, 80% of the company's customers are still within 25 miles of a store.Looking at a short-term graph for the company, its selloff puts it firmly beneath its long-term trading averages, and its dividend yield is off the charts high compared to its average.Zooming out to a longer-term view of the company, its earnings growth has been nice and consistent over time, and the recent selloff is historically high, placing AMTD firmly in value territory.Based on a return to its average valuation, the company could yield an annualized 30% ROR over the next couple of years. However, with the news being so recent, and the company's earnings call on October 22nd, I expect to see estimates for the future shifting pretty substantially in the coming weeks. This would materially affect this value, but the point is made that the company's selloff was catastrophic.However, the company is not in a terrible position. It will maintain its leadership in the space. The slashing of trading fees was an inevitable move for the industry, and one that AMTD had to have known it was going to need to do eventually. With the company paying a 3.56% dividend, and its current position likely being nearly as bad as it will be for the company, I think now is a great time to start a position.If you liked this article and would like to read more like it, please click the ""Follow"" button next to my picture at the top and select Real-time alerts.Financial statistics were sourced from Morningstar, with the charts and tables created by the author, unless otherwise stated."
4298124,105417,2019-10-23T08:17:40-04:00,"Solid quarter results and guidance raise, though our 2020 estimates are even more aggressive.Market share struggle likely between key players in the trading industry as nearly all of them adopt zero commissions for retail trades.Net interest margin is on the rise for TD Ameritrade.","TD Ameritrade (AMTD) is an online broker platform that allows consumers to place electronic trades, focusing on a wide variety of products: from stocks, futures, EFS and options to mutual funds, cryptocurrency, and various fixed-income investments. In addition to making money on transaction fees, the company earns revenue on margin lending and cash management services.When it comes to valuing TD Ameritrade, the comps group can be tricky, since it could range from direct competitors (e.g., E-Trade Financial Corp. (ETFC)) to a wide (but still relevant) group of various financial services companies. We are taking a balanced approach, focusing on approximately 20 companies that derive revenue from electronic trading. This comps peer group yields a fairly conservative P/E estimate of ~12x on 2020 earnings. When we apply this estimate to our 2020 new EPS estimate of $4.12, post quarterly results (up from $4.04), we get a target price of $49 (up from $48).We have the following key, incremental takeaways from the quarterly results:Daily Trading Volume Remains Robust - Daily volume of 860,000 trades sets up the company well for Q4 and 2020 as a whole, despite the very important step of abandoning commissions earlier in October. We estimate that only a portion of the daily revenue will be affected by $0 commissions, while the total trading volume itself should rise even further in 2020, possibly by as much as 10-12% on an annual basis. We also note that $0 commissions will kick in late in 4Q (we are modeling November 15).A Likely Market Share War? - With Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade, Interactive Brokers (IBKR), E*Trade, and Fidelity all dropping trading commissions for retail customers, we expect a market share war in the near term, largely driven by incentives provided by each of these shops. At present, AMTD’s incentives are in the hundreds of dollars for each opened account, and we expect it to rise. At the same time, with commissions eliminated (note that AMTD was the second player to do this, after Schwab, on the same day!), we expect a less severe exodus from the company that we have seen in recent quarters. In particular, Interactive Brokers has been a formidable competitor, where average trading commissions were 600 bps lower than Ameritrade’s.See Guidance Raise as Conservative - Specifically, we see the upper bound of the revenue guidance raise as at least $100 million below Ameritrade’s potential. Recall, the company guided to $4.9-$5.3 billion in top line for the fiscal year 2020, whereas our estimates see a less severe impact from the zero commission fees, as the elasticity curve of new customers should meaningfully outweigh the losses in commission revenue. Given that the Street’s guidance was at the lower end for Ameritrade, the stock reacted quite positivelyNet Interest Margin on the Rise - With robust cost management continuing, particularly around new non-retail accounts, we are seeing approximately 3-4 bps of net interest margin sequential expansion every quarter, with 2.27% in 3Q. We are modeling 2.31% in 4Q and an average of 2.39% for 2020.Disappointment in CEO Departure - While this is somewhat old news, we continue to see the departure of Tim Hockey (announced in the summer) as a headwind for TD Ameritrade. Recall, Hockey spent less than three years on the job, and his departure was not so much performance-based as due to internal disagreements with the Board. We also see much of the current bottom line improvement as Hockey's achievement.It’s All About Fractional Shares? - We expected to hear more about fractional shares from management, since (once again, with Schwab’s lead) this is becoming a hot-button issue which could determine the winner in the market share game down the road. As we stated in the past, we expect all trading players to eventually adopt fractional shares, with pricing within 1-3 bps of each other.We see the following four core risks to our thesis.Macro risks. Should the recession unfold in the next 1-3 years, we should see meaningful decrease in trading volume from AMTD’s key partners.Cyber attacks are always key in the trading business, as disruptions happen, on average, every 45 days. AMTD and its competitors frequently discuss annual increases in their technology budgets as a way of boosting cybersecurity.Interest rate risk is vital, since the company invests in interest-earning assets.Default risk is a rare event but (particularly in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis) is a real possibility, even from a large institution. It is our understanding that even the regulatory controls currently in place, such as Dodd-Frank, are not enough to prevent it."
4308977,105417,2019-11-25T10:08:37-05:00,"Post Schwab's offer, we are downgrading AMTD shares from Buy to Neutral, as the company is now valued near our target price of $48.
        Strong bottom line considerations should compel Ameritrade to accept Schwab’s offer.
        There is not much room for negotiation, in our opinion, since Schwab can always reorient its M&A appetite toward E-Trade.","The news of Charles Schwab's offer for Ameritrade caught the industry off guard, although it is not entirely unexpected, given that Charles Schwab was first to introduce zero fees for retail transactions and Ameritrade was the second to follow suit. The offer to pay approximately $25 billion for Ameritrade signals that the trading business is going not only through pricing changes, but also through consolidation. Should the merger take place, the new entity would be composed of some $5.1 trillion in assets, with $3.8 billion coming from Schwab and $1.3 billion from Ameritrade.We can debate the merits of such a conglomerate separately, as well as whether regulators would approve such a move. In this article, however, we argue that Charles Schwab's offer for Ameritrade's business, which falls roughly in line with our target price of $49, suggests that Ameritrade is fairly valued. Below, we briefly discuss the company's business and our updated thoughts regarding the valuation, in addition to stating five core reasons for why such a transaction makes sense for Ameritrade.TD Ameritrade (AMTD) is an online broker platform that allows consumers to place electronic trades, focusing on a wide variety of products: from stocks, futures, EFS and options to mutual funds, cryptocurrency, and various fixed-income investments. In addition to making money on transaction fees, the company earns revenue on margin lending and cash management services.When it comes to valuing TD Ameritrade, the comps group can be tricky, since it could range from direct competitors (e.g., E-Trade Financial Corp. (ETFC)) to a wide (but still relevant) group of various financial services companies. We are taking a balanced approach, focusing on approximately 20 companies that derive revenue from electronic trading. This comps peer group yields a fairly conservative P/E estimate of ~12x on 2020 earnings, which is roughly in line with what Charles Schwab offered for the company. When we apply this multiple to our 2020 EPS estimate of $4.12, we get a target price of $49. Note that on November 22 AMTD shares closed around $48. We are, therefore, downgrading Ameritrade from Buy to Neutral.A Likely Market Share War that AMTD May Lose: - With Schwab (SCHW), TD Ameritrade, Interactive Brokers, E-Trade, and Fidelity all dropping trading commissions for retail customers, we expect a market share war in the near term, largely driven by incentives provided by each of these shops. With commissions for retail trades disappearing across the board, we now have a completely different landscape, where the market shall be once again divided between main trading shops. While we estimate that 65%-70% of customers will remain loyal, the remaining roughly third of total customers are up for grabs and their loyalties will largely be driven by marketing incentives. We believe that Charles Schwab is much better equipped to handle these bottom line pressures than Ameritrade.Brave New World Implies Non-Retail Strength: The new zero-commission structure puts companies that target ordinary customers, such as Ameritrade and E-Trade, at an immediate disadvantage. The focus is undoubtedly placed on small investment firms or separate managed accounts that require low commissions to do daily trading. Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, and Fidelity are much better equipped to handle those clients. Ameritrade is not.Net Interest Margin Barely Stabilized: In terms of margins, Ameritrade has been very conscious about robust cost management, particularly around new non-retail accounts. We estimate that the company can achieve 3-4 bps of net interest margin sequential expansion every quarter, with 2.27% coming in during 3Q and 2.39% during 2020. It took a long time for Ameritade to stabilize these margins and we believe that the new marketing war among major trading shops will quickly bring these margins down.Global Outreach: As Charles Schwab rolled out its zero commission proposition, it was cognizant that the competition simply doesn’t have the same international outreach. From the marketing perspective, Ameritrade stood to lose fairly quickly, a consideration that likely went in into Schwab’s calculation.E-Trade Competition: Given the speed with which Charles Schwab made an offer to Ameritrade (within mere weeks after the zero-fee announcement), we believe that Ameritrade doesn’t have much room or time for negotiation. There is a definite threat of Schwab withdrawing its offer and making a bid for E-Trade. Therefore, we believe that AMTD should act quickly on its end as well.We see the following four core risks to our thesis.Macro risks. Should the recession unfold in the next 1-3 years, we should see meaningful decrease in trading volume from AMTD’s key partners.Cyber attacks are always key in the trading business, as disruptions happen, on average, every 45 days. AMTD and its competitors frequently discuss annual increases in their technology budgets as a way of boosting cybersecurity.Interest rate risk is vital, since the company invests in interest-earning assets.Default risk is a rare event but (particularly in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis) is a real possibility, even from a large institution.

4294646,21428,2019-10-02T14:43:44-04:00,Long overdue.The cost of transactions for brokerage firms in the electronic age is decimal dust.The scores of upstarts offering 0% were beginning to take their toll on the best of the online brokers.Not any more!,"Yesterday, I sent my third quarter performance and risk analysis report to clients of our portfolio management firm. I said:This move to no-fee transactions was inevitable. The main players in the online brokerage business provide many services and a greater level of safety via insurance, the ability to negotiate superb fee income with money market funds, and indeed with all funds, and have forward-facing, well-trained customer service agents to assist if problems arise. Yet they were losing customers to all these newer firms that offered good-to-poor service, excellent-to-dreadful transaction capability and may have been selling their customers' data as a primary source of income.As I said in my client letter 12 hours ago, ""I expect to see TD, Fidelity et al respond soon."" I had no idea that it would take TD Ameritrade just 12 hours to do so. I can only imagine the senior executives and their staffs must have been huddled through the night, concluding by about 5 a.m. that they had no choice but to match Schwab's bold move. Fidelity and E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) dare not tarry in responding in kind. If they do, they will spend more time and money in their TOA Department than they might lose in commissions! (""TOA"" means Transfer of Account.) If they want to hold clients they will do the same.Will this impact their bottom line? Yes, but not that much. I cannot speak for E-Trade, but I have reviewed the P&Ls (income statements) for Schwab and TD Ameritrade and find that not only are commissions a small contributor to their bottom line, but that contribution continues to dwindle as a percent of total revenue.I'm taking this opportunity to purchase both Schwab and TD Ameritrade for our Investors Edge Growth & Value Portfolio, available to all our Marketplace subscribers. I'm nibbling at first because I don't know how long investors will overreact to this news. Certainly the next quarter's earnings will be off a bit. But both firms are solid citizens with exceptional cash flow. I believe the exodus of cash from the weaker firms will, over the next few months, more than compensate for the loss of commissions.In this business, today, float is everything!Good investing, Joe"
4295084,68315,2019-10-04T13:43:23-04:00,"TD Ameritrade has announced that its commissions would be cut, following Schwab's earlier announcement.The company will remain highly profitable, and its growth outlook might actually have improved.Short-term worries can create great buying opportunities for long-term oriented investors, and I believe that this is true right here.","Worries about declining commissions for online brokers have resulted in steep share price declines for TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and many of its peers. Commissions are not the only way for the company to earn money, though, and it seems likely that the company will remain highly profitable going forward. The very low valuation in combination with a high dividend yield makes TD Ameritrade look like the right pick for investors that seek exposure to the industry and that want to reap long-term gains from short-term worries.TD Ameritrade and its peers offer securities brokerage and related services to its customers, mostly via the internet, although the company also operates a couple of retail branches. TD Ameritrade is centered on providing these services to retail investors and retail traders.Due to declining costs for operating these brokerage platforms, combined with intense battles over market share, many of the companies that are active in this industry have engaged in price wars, which has resulted in steadily declining commissions for those that utilize these services. This is great for customers, at least at first sight, but pressures the operators of these brokerage platforms.A couple of days ago Schwab (SCHW), one of TD Ameritrade's peers, has announced that it would cut commissions to zero for US stocks, ETFs, and options trades. This has resulted in widespread share price declines in the industry; among others, TD Ameritrade saw its share price decline by 26% in one day. Short-term share price movements mostly are not a reason to buy per se, but this move was just the culmination of share price declines that started much earlier, as TD Ameritrade is now trading at 2-year lows:Data by YChartsA bit later, TD Ameritrade lowered its commissions on online exchange-listed stock, ETF (domestic and Canadian) to zero as well. This does not mean that the company's business will vanish:TD Ameritrade is one of the best rated online brokers in the US, see here and here, for example. Basically the only negative that reviewers have noted about TD Ameritrade is the above-average pricing, and yet TD Ameritrade attracted a large customer base. Going forward, with commissions being cut to zero, at least for some products, TD Ameritrade will be even more attractive to (potential) customers, which should result in two things: TD Ameritrade should be able to retain clients even better, and on top of that the company should be able to attract new customers, whose only reason not to be a customer in the past were TD Ameritrade's above-average commissions.Customers that faced the choice between no-cost Robinhood and costly TD Ameritrade chose the former in some cases, but now there isn't any good reason to choose Robinhood over TD Ameritrade and its high-quality trading tools and customer service (evidenced by the great reviews for TD Ameritrade). We can thus assume that the decision to cut commissions to zero for some products will hurt revenue generation from existing customers, but should lead to a surge of new customers that will partially offset the lower revenue generation from existing customers, through two ways. First, new customers will trade some products that still come with commissions (options, foreign ETFs, etc.), and on top of that, they will utilize other offerings that generate revenue for TD Ameritrade, such as interest on loans.TD Ameritrade has announced that the new measures are forecast to lower its revenues by ~15% going forward, all else equal. I believe that this will be partially offset by new business from new customers that will switch to TD Ameritrade from peers, especially from no-cost brokerages such as Robinhood. Robinhood alone has more than 4 million customers, and there are many more peers from which TD Ameritrade could capture business. If the company manages to attract 1 million new customers, which does not seem outlandish at all, I believe, its user count would rise by 9%, as TD Ameritrade serves 11 million customers right now. When we then assume that each new customer generates the same amount of revenue as existing customers, the total revenue impact on TD Ameritrade would not be as large as one would have guessed, as the company could retain 93% of its revenues [100% * 0.85 * 1.09 = 93%].Data by YChartsIf these calculations are roughly correct, TD Ameritrade's revenues would decline to a level of $5.3 billion, back to the level where they were mid-2018. A revenue setback back to where TD Ameritrade's top line stood one year ago is not a positive, but that does not seem like a disaster, either.In fiscal 2018, which ended on September 30, 2018, the company generated earnings per share of $3.34. Even when we cut an additional 10% from that for the next year, TD Ameritrade would still earn $3.00 over the coming four quarters, which would mean that shares are valued at 11.3 times earnings, based on a share price of $33.80. TD Ameritrade's dividend, at $1.20 a year, would still be covered easily if profits declined to $3 on a per-share level.Data by YChartsBefore this announcement by TD Ameritrade, analysts were forecasting close to $4 in earnings per share next year, and a long-term earnings per share growth rate of 9%. The $4 in EPS will not be hit, but one could argue that the long-term growth outlook is actually better, albeit from a lower level. The industry as a whole will continue to grow, and thanks to offering a combination of low costs, a strong platform, and superior customer service, TD Ameritrade has turned into a prime choice for everyone seeking an online broker. It is thus, I believe, not unreasonable to assume that TD Ameritrade will be able to grow its earnings per share by at least 9% a year in the long run, from a reduced level of $3 instead of $4 that analysts were forecasting earlier.TD Ameritrade's share price got devastated even more from an already rather low level following the announcement that commissions would be cut. The company will lose some revenues from existing customers, but I believe that this will be partially offset by business from new customers, for which TD Ameritrade has turned into a great online broker thanks to its commission cut. Profits during the coming year will likely be reduced, but should still cover the company's above average dividend yield of 3.5% easily.The long-term growth outlook remains positive, and I believe that it may have actually improved, as TD Ameritrade should be able to capture additional market share. All in all investors can buy shares of a company that is valued at roughly 11 times forward earnings (my estimate), with a 3.5% yield, and a strong offering in a growing industry, which should allow for ample growth in the coming years. Sometimes short term worries create strong buying opportunities for long-term oriented investors, and I believe that this is such a situation."
4274638,104579,2019-07-12T07:11:10-04:00,TD Ameritrade is growing its brokerage service organically and through acquisition.It offers a diverse revenue stream unlike some competitors.The company offers a modest but growing yield which is higher than competitors.The company benefits from scale and could eventually make another acquisition to become an industry behemoth.,"Source: Investing.comTD Ameritrade (AMTD) competes in the online investment brokerage space. TD Ameritrade offers attractive fundamentals and business prospects that we will review. The shares are only 10% off their 52-week lows and offer an enterprising long-term opportunity. As the Millennial generation matures and they enter their prospective careers, they will start to invest and look to place their funds with online brokers. The first place they turn to is online and that should help spur growth for years to come. The space should continue to benefit from growing assets and the hunger for a return on capital. While interest rates being lowered will be a headwind for the company, investors should remember that creates more demand for stocks and thus more trading and commissions.TD Ameritrade reported second quarter earnings that showed a beat on the bottom line and a slight miss on the top.Source: Seeking AlphaThe company reported $0.89 in GAAP earnings per share, up 85% year over year. The company recognized net income of $499 million, which is quite impressive considering revenue was only $1.45 billion. I like that margins are so high as it means the company can continue to drive any revenue gain into decent profits. The company also saw new client assets of approximately $20 billion, which represents an annualized growth rate of 7%. Impressive considering the intense competition from other brokers.Ultimately the company could have seen better results, but coming out of the December sell-off, many investors were wary and did less trading. Average client trades per day of approximately 860,000 was down 9% year over year but was against a record quarter for comparison. Moving forward the company should continue to see an increase in trade volume as assets increase.Looking at the balance sheet, we can see where the company stands financially. Source: 10-QCash stands at a respectable $2.674 billion at the end of the quarter, which is close to where it stood 6 months earlier. The company has been using cash to repurchase shares which is nice as the shares seem to trade at reasonable levels. In the second quarter, the company reduced shares outstanding by 6.5 million and has the ability to reduce shares by another 12 million. This means at the current rate, we could see a new authorization before the year is over. The company has increased its long-term debt, but it should be noted it did so with rates at lows and once accounting for cash stands with a net debt position of only $900 million. This is quite safe considering the cash flow the company has.Here we see an increase in shares outstanding. Most likely due to shares issued for the Scottrade acquisition in the amount of $1.7 billion. More information regarding the recent acquisition can be found here.Before the acquisition, AMTD was reducing its shares outstanding. Once the acquisition is integrated and synergies are realized, we should see the share repurchases resume.Below we can see the debt schedule and see that $500 million of this debt is due this year.Source: 10-QShould this be eliminated and not refinanced, the company will stand with a net debt position of $400 million. The newly issued debt is the variable rate debt due in two years and the 2024 notes at 3.75%. The company issued this debt for general corporate purposes according to the 10-Q.A big worry and reason the shares have seen a pullback of late is due to the fears of an interest rate cut.Source: 10-QThis should be a concern for investors as we can see the net interest revenue accounted for $362 million in the quarter.However, a quarter point decrease in the federal funds rate should take the company back to the same point it was at in September of 2018.Source: 10-QThis means presuming deposits don't grow, which I would fully expect to grow, the net interest margin should still produce over $300 million for the quarter in income. This is not a significant drop and can be made up for with an increase in deposits.While there are many companies competing in the same space, however, the percentage of revenue they drive from different segments differs. This can have quite the difference in future profitability, especially as interest rates rise.A quick look at the 10-K and we find the following information for TD Ameritrade. Source: TD Ameritrade 10-KThese numbers can be expected to change greatly with the integration of Scottrade. We also see a continuing rise in investment product fees. The continued growth in offerings will allow AMTD to diversify its revenue away from being solely commission based.This is important as the revenue produced off of transactions is not always stable. It depends on growing customer accounts, having attractive trading fees, and being able to count on trades being made. We see that since 2015, TD Ameritrade has been able to reduce this portion of its revenues by 5%, and with Scottrade I believe it may continue the trend.The company continues to reduce interest rate sensitive assets and increase fee-based assets which as we discussed earlier is an important trend.Source: Earnings PresentationThe company has highlighted all the reasons combining with Scottrade should lead it to become a more attractive place to use as a broker. Source: TD Ameritrade Investor Presentation Source: TD Ameritrade Investor PresentationFurthermore, we see the attractive fundamentals of the Scottrade acquisition. This will help to continue to grow the platform. Brokerages are generally a sticky product. I was a Scottrade customer for 11 years; I never wanted to switch brokers due to being comfortable with the platform. Plus the hassle of transferring assets was just one more thing holding me back. However, because of the acquisition, I became a TD Ameritrade customer, and I can say I do enjoy the platform. The point is, the acquisition gave them access to customers they may otherwise not have been able to gain organically. This also may be a reason why the company could use cheap asset prices to make another acquisition soon.In summary, TD Ameritrade is a more diversified brokerage. Its revenue is driven from a few categories and not overly dependent on one source. This likely will mean more stabilized revenues and profitability in the future. We also have seen an outperformance of a few key categories such as account growth and DARTs since their Scottrade acquisition. All positives moving forward.Let's take a look at their DCF valuation based on current estimated future growth.For TD Ameritrade:Source: Money ChimpWe use an estimated earnings growth rate of 7% for the next 5 years. This is probably a bit low but gives us safe room for upside. For the trailing 12 months, we saw earnings of $3.85. I also lowered the discount rate from a typical 11% to 10%, as I believe we may face a recession in the next few years; I do not expect the returns to be as great as we have experienced the last 5. With only 5% earnings growth in the following years, the DCF valuation is pegged at $88.14. This implies quite the upside from the current $50 per share.Currently, we see that TD Ameritrade is trading at an attractive discount to its DCF valuation. So let's look at the historical valuation. Here we can get an idea if the shares are under or overvalued compared to their own history.Source: MorningstarFrom what we can see, the shares currently trade below their average P/S, P/E, P/B and forward P/E for the last 5 years. This once again implies the shares are undervalued.One more thing we look at is customer reviews. This can have a strong effect when customers are choosing to switch brokers or open a new account.TD Ameritrade took note of its ratings in a variety of sources as seen below. Source: TD Ameritrade Investor PresentationHowever, Barron's does an annual review and found the following. Source: Barron'sWhat is interesting is that while TD Ameritrade fell behind in the survey to 3rd place, it is very evident that it beats in every category except one, costs. This means that if TD Ameritrade decided to reduce costs in the future, we could see it become the #1 rated broker across the board, and see a pickup in new account growth. We will continue to watch future reviews closely.The low cost model attracts more active traders as we can see below. Source: Barron'sInteractive Brokers (IBKR) generates its revenue off of more trades. It is not exactly what you would call a competitive advantage and is more or less a discounted service. It should again be noted that if trading activity were to decline, we would see a significant decline in revenue.For this reason, it shouldn't be hard for AMTD to improve its ratings, overtaking Interactive Brokers within the industry and become #1.Quickly taking a look at peers to see if TD Ameritrade offers more value we can see the following.Data by YChartsTD Ameritrade offers one of the lowest forward P/Es as well as the highest yield. This makes it quite compelling over peers.TD Ameritrade offers a compelling value when looking at its diversified revenue stream, PEG ratio, forward P/E, and its strong customer base. TD has a very strong balance sheet as well. I believe we will continue to see TD Ameritrade looking to diversify its offerings and bringing on small acquisitions. I also believe its parent company TD Bank (TD), will help cross-sell its customers to the broker, offering one more source of organic growth.The likelihood of rising rates will also further help TD Ameritrade as it gains interest on its huge cash base from customers. Due to the recent pullback in shares, I will be looking to start a position in AMTD in the coming weeks. I believe it will progress to close the value we found in the DCF, around $88 per share."
4308693,21485,2019-11-22T14:53:47-05:00,"Word has gotten out that the Charles Schwab Group is making a bid to acquire TD Ameritrade Holding Co. for around $25 billion and bring the two retail financial firms together.The success of the combination will rest on the scale that can be achieved by putting together two organizations that live and thrive off of financial information.More and more, the financial sector is moving into a future that will be based upon fewer and fewer organizations that are larger in asset size.","In a world of advancing information technology, scale is the name of the game.This is particularly the situation in the case of financial organizations.Finance is nothing more than information, nothing more than zeros and ones.Just the capability to build off of scale leads to a commercial banking system that is increasing in assets, but is shrinking in terms of the number of banks that are in the industry.But, the ability to increase scale can also result in firms combining attributes so as to create scale in different ways for different institutions, as can be observed in the Google/Citigroup connection.The latest addition to the list of changes coming to the financial world is that between Charles Schwab Corp. (NYSE:SCHW) and TD Ameritrade Holding Co. (NASDAQ:AMTD).The immediate benefit mentioned in the possible combination of the two largest retail brokerage and asset management firms would be the combining of the two back offices into one massive platform serving an estimated $5 trillion in assets.Some analysts estimate that Schwab could reduce operating expenses by 60% through such consolidating of overhead costs.The cost reduction here has major implications for an industry that charges fees that are zero or near-zero. Here we see how other fintech intrusions, like the stock-trading app Robinhood, have invaded the retail trading space.Because of such intrusions, it makes sense to boost scale and save costs to make up for surrendered revenues.Also, it should also be noted, as stated in the Financial Times:As I have noted many times in my posts, the growth of passive investing accelerated during the recovery from the Great Recession as the Federal Reserve underwrote the US stock market, and, over time, produced more and more new historical highs. The steady rise in stock prices served the passive investing industry well as value investing was not as productive in this kind of market.Before leaving this point, let me add that this scale can also provide further benefits as the retail trading business also provides leverage when selling order flow to wholesale brokers and when making shares available for borrowing.Then there is the banking side of the business.Telis Demos explains in the Wall Street Journal:But, Ms. Demos goes on:The Financial Times review of this combination reported that:The regulators still have something to say on the deal, if it really takes place, and it is expected that the combination will be given much serious scrutiny.This is the future, however. As I have argued over and over again, the essence of the “new” Modern Corporation is scale built upon intellectual capital. Information spreads and, although it may be slowed down here and there by governmental actions or societal constraints, it ultimately comes to dominate how the world advances.In the case of the Charles Schwab Group and the TD Ameritrade Holding Co., investors seem to appreciate this fact and are moving positively with the possibility the combination may become a reality."
4274261,101693,2019-07-10T10:21:56-04:00,"The rise of discount/free online brokerages has wholly disrupted traditional brokerages like AMTD.As a result, AMTD has focused on growing its asset-based revenues through M&A.This is why AMTD is a solid bet in the retail brokerage industry during a rising rate environment.However, if the Fed indeed starts cutting rates, then this can leave AMTD exposed to massive headwinds.My valuation of AMTD suggests that it's probably fairly valued as it is. Hence, I think there's little potential upside at these levels.","TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) has historically been a reliable retail broker for its clients. However, I think that the rise of discount/free electronic brokerages has completely disrupted AMTD's industry. Unfortunately, AMTD seems to be stuck in its ways and is now resorting to growing its accounts through M&A rather than a better value proposition. In my view, this will probably translate into sluggish growth going forward. Hence, I think there's little potential upside in AMTD at these levels.Source: AMTD's logoAMTD is a retail broker. Its revenues can be broken down into asset-based and transaction-based. AMTD offers financial products like stocks, exchange-traded funds, options, futures, forex, mutual funds, fixed income, margin lending, cash management services, and annuities. It's worth pointing out that AMTD's asset-based revenues represent roughly 62% of total sales, while the remaining 38% come from transactions (and other revenues). Moreover, AMTD typically benefits from higher 1) trade volumes, 2) volatility, 3) account balances, and 4) interest rates. In my view, these are the four critical variables for AMTD. This is why, during Q4 2018, AMTD's revenues increased due to higher trade volumes and a spike in the VIX (volatility).Naturally, brokers like AMTD can be considered good plays on market volatility. Often, investors flock to these types of stocks during periods of market uncertainty. However, the problem with this rationale for AMTD is that it doesn't seem to be an uncorrelated asset. Thus, if the market drops, AMTD will likely follow suit as well. This is unlike pure plays on market uncertainty like the Nasdaq (NDAQ) or the CME Group (CME). In fact, I think even Interactive Brokers (IBKR) can be an uncorrelated bet on market volatility.Source: Portfolio Visualizer. AMTD has the strongest correlation with the broader market among its peer groupAs you can see, AMTD's correlation matrix shows that it's collated with the rest of the market (as measured by the SPY). AMTD's correlation factor is 0.65, while IBKR and CME have correlation factors of 0.48 and 0.47, respectively. Uncorrelated stocks are typically attractive because they're not as exposed to systemic risks as other securities.The fact that AMTD trades alongside the rest of the market is very telling. After all, as previously mentioned, 62% of its total revenues are asset-based. This means that, while trading volume is essential, what really moves the needle for AMTD is interest rates. Since interest rates tend to correlate very tightly with equities, then it's evident why AMTD is also 65% correlated with the SPY.However, the problem with this is that AMTD, at this point, appears to be more like a bank than a broker. You see, AMTD's main competitors are E-Trade (ETFC), Charles Schwab (SCHW), and Interactive Brokers. In my view, AMTD does well when compared to ETFC or SCHW. However, if you analyze AMTD's value proposition against IBKR's, you'll quickly realize that the latter is superior in a few aspects. For example, AMTD has a competitive trading platform, but its execution, margin rates, and commissions are inferior to IBKR's.In my view, this is AMTD's biggest problem: it lacks a sustainable competitive advantage against discount/free online brokerages (like IBKR or Robinhood). Thus, AMTD will face difficulties when competing against them for new accounts. Unfortunately, I believe that AMTD is outclassed in some key areas, and I fear that this could translate into sluggish growth.Source: Investopedia. Discount brokerages like IBKR are significantly cheaper than AMTDNevertheless, it's worth pointing out that AMTD is already starting to offer some commission-free ETFs. So, it's possible that this will strengthen AMTD's value proposition for customers. Still, realize that AMTD does profit by selling its clients' order flow. So, it's not technically ""free"" because high-frequency traders make clients pay through unfavorable order execution. This is why I don't think that AMTD's commission-free ETFs are going to enhance its value proposition significantly either. After all, sophisticated investors probably understand the tradeoffs.Ultimately, AMTD's growth strategy seems to hinge on M&A. You see, AMTD itself acknowledged in its annual report that part of its business strategy is to capitalize on the ongoing consolidation of the US retail brokerage industry. It remains to be seen whether or not this will create a sustainable business moat for AMTD. However, I remain skeptical because simply acquiring similar competitors won't change the fact that AMTD is an expensive retail broker with an OK trading platform. AMTD can grow its accounts through M&A, but over the long term, I believe that only its value proposition will be able to sustain it.In any case, recently, an analyst from Deutsche Bank (DB) noted that there's a ""modest possibility"" of a merger between AMTD and ETFC. I think that this makes complete sense, given AMTD's position within its industry. After all, the resulting broker would be among the biggest in the industry and would benefit from a more significant number of accounts. Also, AMTD and ETFC have very similar brokerage operations, so I do think they'd be an excellent fit.Source: AMTD's 2018 10-K. The company appears to be focusing on growing its clients' account balances through M&A.However, this won't change the fact that AMTD seems to be doubling down on increasing accounts (to benefit from rates) while the Fed is signaling it'll cut rates in July (and maybe even September). Instead of doing this, I think AMTD should pivot towards becoming competitive on price.The reality is that AMTD's organic growth appears to be sluggish. After all, it's difficult for AMTD to grow its trading-based revenues if it's more expensive than its competition. For example, if you exclude the recent Scottrade acquisition, then AMTD's growth would have been closer to 6%. This is because before AMTD acquired Scottrade, it had a revenue CAGR of 5.58%. So, it's no surprise to see that AMTD is now resorting to M&A to fuel future growth. Thus, if AMTD's organic growth remains in the single digits going forward, then it's going to be challenging to justify a higher valuation. Hence, I think AMTD has limited potential upside at this point.First of all, AMTD has approximately $1.68 billion in FCF and contractual obligations of roughly $710 million. Also, AMTD's interest payments are approximately $120 million, while its debt-to-equity ratio is 0.42. So overall, I'd say that AMTD's liquidity is sound for the time being. In fact, AMTD has almost enough cash on hand to repay all of its debt if it needed to do so.Source: Seeking Alpha. AMTD's dividend yield is close to its 2016 highsFurthermore, AMTD's dividend yield of 2.39% is decent. The company's 4-year average dividend yield is 1.83%, so you could say that it's an attractive dividend yield in historical terms. In my view, AMTD's higher-than-average dividend yield is typically a good indicator of value. Still, the absolute dividend yield of 2.39% isn't going to attract dividend investors anytime soon.Now, let's look at AMTD's earnings power. For this, I decided to run a simple valuation model for AMTD as well. As you can see, my model suggests that AMTD's fair value is $55.28 per share. This valuation would suggest a very modest potential upside of 7.3%. Since every valuation model has a margin of error, I'd say that this approach also indicates that AMTD is reasonably valued.Thus, after looking at the company through different angles, I'd say that there's nothing that jumps out as a ""screaming"" buy. In my view, AMTD seems reasonably valued.Finally, I'd like to mention a few key risks that can play out for AMTD.The fact that AMTD is much more expensive than discount/free electronic brokerages is concerning. I'll concede that ATMD's commission-free ETF trading is a great incentive that could bring in new customers. Nevertheless, I still believe that AMTD needs to focus on improving its value proposition as a whole (i.e., becoming the best trading platform with better execution and lower fees), instead of focusing on M&A. The reality is that I don't see AMTD trying to go in that direction, so M&A is their next best alternative. I do agree that AMTD could benefit significantly from a merger with E-Trade. After all, the resulting company would enjoy the benefits of size and would be in a strong position to adapt to the industry's changing trends.Ultimately, I think that AMTD's M&A will probably work out over the short term. However, over the long run, I remain skeptical of AMTD's prospects due to its lack of pricing disadvantages. Hence, I think that any potential upside in AMTD will probably come from multiple expansion, rather than intrinsic business growth (unless interest rates suddenly shoot up).I prefer avoiding these types of investments because betting on multiple expansion when the market is at all-time highs seems risky. Still, I do believe that AMTD could be a solid investment in a rising interest rate environment. However, since rates are likely going to trend lower due to the Fed, I think they'll actually become a headwind in the near term. Thus, for all these reasons, AMTD is a pass for me.Thank you for reading, and good luck."

4207893,23998,2018-09-24T11:06:38-04:00,"John Dizard reported in the Financial Times over the weekend that a lawsuit against TD Ameritrade could have a huge impact on that company and other discount brokers.At stake is the practice of accepting money for order flow from high frequency traders: if TD Ameritrade loses it could be forced to disgorge years of revenues from it.For TD Ameritrade shareholders looking to limit their risk while staying long, I present a couple of ways of doing so.","Stephanie Quirk talks Tesla on TD Ameritrade's ""Fast Market"" (via TD).In Saturday's Financial Times, John Dizard reported on a decision in a case called Klein v. TD Ameritrade that could have serious consequences for TD Ameritrade (AMTD) and other brokerages that accept payment for order flow. Dizard's column is paywalled here, but I'll quote the relevant part below, and then show a couple of ways AMTD shareholders can stay long while limiting their downside risk.If you've ever wondered why discount brokerages such as TD Ameritrade and E-Trade can offer such cheap trading commissions, one reason is that they're getting paid for order flow by high-frequency trading firms (in TD Ameritrade's case, John Dizard points out, this amounted to $320 million in 2017). As Dizard notes in his column, if the HFTs (high-frequency traders) are making a profit from reselling these securities in the market, it stands to reason that this is at the expense of best execution for the discount brokers' retail investors. What's kept this going as long as it has, has been the assumption that impact to each retail investor was too small to complain about:Dizard writes that individual lawsuits about this have not been an ""economically significant"" threat. Until this month:This is something that should be of concern to investors in other companies getting paid for clients' order flow too, not just Ameritrade and E-Trade (ETFC). But let's look at a couple of ways AMTD shareholders can stay long while limiting their risk now.Let's assume, for these two examples, that you own 1,000 shares of AMTD and are willing to risk a 15% decline over the next several months, but not one larger than that. The screen captures below are via the Portfolio Armor iPhone app.Positive Cost, Uncapped UpsideAs of Friday's close, these were the optimal, or least expensive, puts to hedge 1,000 shares of AMTD against a >15% decline by mid-February.As you can see above, the cost here was $1,500, or 2.7% of position value (calculated conservatively, using the ask price of the puts).Negative Cost, Capped UpsideIf you were willing to cap your possible upside at 8%, this was the optimal collar to give you the same >15% downside protection over the same time frame.In this collar, the cost of the put leg is the same as in the previous hedge, $1,500, or 2.7% of position value. But that cost is more than offset by the income generated from selling the call leg: $1,600, or 2.88% of position value (calculated conservatively, using the bid price of the calls).So the net cost was negative, meaning you would have collected a net credit of $100, assuming you placed both trades at the worst ends of their respective spreads.There's a lot of non-actionable content in financial media, including the Financial Times - equivocations about the impact of interest rate changes, etc. John Dizard's column is an exception to that. Here he's warned you of a real risk facing AMTD and discount brokers. Consider the hedges above with that in mind."

4274885,102107,2019-07-15T07:30:00-04:00,"Value investing has continued to morph as the long bull market marches on.Our panel's views on the market and the way they are approaching all-time highs suggest value remains in the eye of the beholder.This is leading to finding value in some obvious places - large-cap tech, for example - but also further flung spots like foreign markets and, yes, financials.","By Daniel ShvartsmanThe first half of 2019 saw a lot of green in the markets, as broader indices recovered from the brief bear market in the second half of 2018 and returned to new heights. Despite that, the wall of worry continued to grow, even if the specific concerns changed. Instead of a rising rate environment, expectations have shifted to a possible rate cut even with good job numbers. Geopolitical flash points have (re-)emerged in Venezuela, Iran, and in the ongoing China-US trade conflict. European economic growth appears to be slowing, and nobody's quite sure where we are in the US cycle. Oh, and another presidential election cycle is beginning.So, what to make of this all? We decided to take the temperature of the markets with a midyear Marketplace Roundtable. We asked our Seeking Alpha Marketplace contributors - authors who run investing services and provide ideas and guidance to members about how to think about the markets or at least certain parts of it - to share their views on the current climate and how they're positioning as a result.Over 55 authors participated in our survey. We've grouped their responses into several categories, ranging from tech to commodities, biotech to dividends and income investing. We're going to share their responses in those grouped categories over the coming week or so. Each discussion will have two common questions about the market as a whole, two sector-specific questions, and a round of current favorite ideas. We hope you enjoy the discussion, and welcome you to join with comments on these issues or on any key points that didn't come up, or follow-up questions.Today's edition covers value investing, which remains as heterodox and diverse as ever in 2019. Here's our panel:Please check the end of article for disclosures - authors disclosed positions based on stocks they respectively discussed.Andres Cardenal: I would say that there are still plenty of uncertainty drivers in the market - economic growth is slowing down all over the world, tensions with China in areas such as IP will be a long-lasting discussion, and monetary policy is in a transition phase. This is actually a good thing, since negative sentiment keeps money on the sidelines and provides the fuel for rising prices. The time to sell is generally when most investors are optimistic and the consensus is bullish.Chris Lau: The market could conceivably rise another 25%. Even after the U.S. slapped punitive tariffs against China, raising prices for Americans, the Fed will still cut rates. On Jan. 1, 2019, markets thought rates would keep going up. Either way, keep your eyes on beaten down stocks on sale instead of guessing on the market's direction.Dining Stocks Online: Market sentiment has definitely rebounded completely from the fourth quarter of 2018. Most of the potential positives are now priced in, which limits further upside. Investors should be wary, as the risk/reward balance is no longer tilted in the direction of long-positioned investors.Fred Piard: At the end of June, the AAII sentiment was neutral with a bearish inclination. The short interest in stocks has been increasing in the second half of June. It seems the ""crowd"" and the ""smart money"" are still both in doubt.Michael Boyd: The flip-flop on the Federal Reserve has been the primary driver of stronger equity markets. There is no doubt in my mind that, if Jerome Powell had not capitulated on the rate hike schedule, we'd be materially lower than where we are now. The question that should be asked is ""Why has the Fed changed course?"" If you believe the private bank is truly data dependent, then the answer is a simple one: data has soured. We see that in ISM Manufacturing rolling over, we see that in unemployment figures. History repeats itself, and investors likely remember years ago when ""bad news is good news"" when it comes to Fed policy. At what point does bad news become actual bad news?Ruerd Heeg: I am surprised this fairy tale has not come to an end yet. Valuations in the US are now extremely high. I do not think that is sustainable. So, my market doubts have not been resolved yet. Moreover, compared to 5 years ago, there are fewer and fewer analysts telling us the market will go much higher. I expect some kind of unpredictable event causing US stocks to go down again.Fear & Greed Trader: Yes - in my view, the doubts were overstated.Trapping Value: The market is still climbing a wall of worry. We went in heavily short in May, but towards the end of May, something changed. We were seeing persistent negative sentiment and just no breakdown in the indices. We were seeing huge outflows from equities, and again, the indices held up far better than we thought. So, we made a tactical decision in our portfolios on May 23, to cover all short positions and go 100% long. We think there is more upside here as investors abandon 2% yielding Treasuries and return to equities.David Trainer: On the surface, the economy appears strong. However, when we dig below the surface, we find that corporate profits are not as healthy as reported. This finding increases market risk and does not appear to be factored into current prices. Specifically, when we analyzed fully-adjusted economic earnings, we found that after tax cuts were removed, economic earnings actually declined by 2% YoY. Only two sectors (Technology and Energy) managed to show any significant improvement in economic earnings (without tax cuts), even as eight of 11 sectors reported rising GAAP profits. This disconnect means that except for a few highly profitable firms, most stocks are at serious risk of major declines should the market’s mood turn sour.JD Henning: ""Doubt is the origin of wisdom"" ~ Augustine of Hippo. In the last 60 years, the S&P 500 has only ever exceeded 30% three times: 1975, 31.6%; 1995, 34%; and 1997, 31%. Currently, the S&P 500 is on a trajectory we have not seen since 1958 when the index gained over 38%. I submit that this incredible performance emerges in part from the highest levels of stock buybacks ever recorded, at a pace more than $18 billion ahead of 2018 when buybacks beat the previous record by an astounding $217.3 billion. As stock prices surge, more investment capital follows. ETF inflows in June surged to $63.8 billion, only slightly behind the all-time record January 2018 inflows. The divergence between earnings and high rates of return are growing. Be wise.WG Investment Research: Most investors that I have recently spoken to still doubt this market. They struggle to find attractive investments in today’s environment and they are concerned about the near-term prospects of the market, especially after factoring in the ongoing trade war and where they see us being in the economic cycle. Equities have been pretty resilient through the ups and downs that have been largely created by Washington (i.e., not just our president) but, in my opinion, there are real concerns that need to be considered even in what seems to be a promising backdrop. For example, I do not believe that the real possibility of an unresolved trade war with China is priced into the market.Value Digger: A strong non-farm payrolls report was one of the factors that gave a boost to the market lately because it showed that the economy remains resilient with companies confident enough to continue hiring. Additionally, the Fed will most likely cut rates this year, and I expect the U.S.-China trade war to come to an end in the second half of this year, which adds two more parameters to the bullish mix. Nevertheless, I believe that the market doubt is not resolved, so I continue to suggest a cautious approach due to some recent relatively weak macro developments such as PMI data, the inverted yield curve etc.Joseph L. Shaefer: I certainly hope not. Markets that climb a wall of worry create the best gains. The most dangerous time for stock markets is when there is no doubt; that means that most everyone has thrown caution to the winds and is now long the market. One reason for prudence remains. Yes, the market is up 25% from the lows for the first thus far in 2019; that is great. However, at the end of the first three quarters in 2018, it was up 8.0%, yet finished the year down 7.5% (plunging 14.3% in the 12 weeks ending December 31, 2018.) A longer memory than 6 months is essential for successful investment management. Fortune favors the prudent and watchful!Lejun James Shao: Buying on fear. The worst is over now. Based on data from FactSet that US corporate earnings growth will re-accelerate in the second half this year, I believe that S&P 500 will close 2019 at around 3,120-3,200 level.Andres Cardenal: Growth stocks and high quality stocks have done really well, while small caps and value stocks are underperforming. It will be interesting to watch relative performance, since market rotation can provide plenty of opportunities once a particular sector starts outperforming.Chris Lau: We thought the drug store, drug manufacturing, and biotechnology sector would recover by now. But the government's consideration for healthcare for all and demands for lower drug prices are hurting the sector. Look at UnitedHealth (UNH), Walgreens (WBA), and CVS Health (CVS).Dining Stocks Online: The pace of M&A activity in the restaurant sector continues, even accelerating as activists target poorly performing, cash flow generating chains. While sentiment is not overwhelmingly positive within the sector right now, we see activist activity as a potential catalyst when dealing with cheap stocks in the restaurant space.Fred Piard: A part of my portfolio is based on value-oriented quantitative models. My research in 2019 has not been about changing models but about risk management and testing new macro indicators. My subscribers have already access to them, and you can expect some research results in free-access articles.Michael Boyd: I think the rollover in China, whether you blame that on naturally tougher comps or trade concerns, has brought renewed skepticism on overseas-sourced revenue. Asian economies, in general, have not done well of late. I've avoided Asia for some time but am actually starting to get more interesting there today on a relative basis. Beijing has plenty of stimulus options on the table.Ruerd Heeg: Recently, several value investors mentioned differences in valuations between expensive growth stocks and value stocks have increased. I think that is true within the US but also between different geographic markets. This happened also just before the dotcom crash. If history repeats, now could be a good time to start value investing. Anyway, what I keep doing is researching the cheapest stocks, with several strategies based on quantitative rankings.Fear & Greed Trader: I remain focused on what is working - Tech, Consumer Discretionary, and now, look to Healthcare for opportunity.David Trainer: We’re always looking to exploit our analytical advantage to identify value and value traps. Traditional metrics such as P/E ratios, return on equity, debt-to-equity, and price-to-book are flawed. We focus on more comprehensively analyzing profits and valuation based on our proprietary footnotes analysis. Our measures of return on invested capital and price to economic book value give us an edge when it comes to finding good long and short ideas.JD Henning: The Fed has my attention while it is still aggressively engaged in quantitative tightening (QT) even as the markets are focused on an interest rate cut at the July 30 meeting. As the events last October showed, the market reacted very badly when the Fed first reached its monthly cap of $50 billion in asset unwinding and strained market liquidity through December. Now, $3.81 trillion remain on the Fed's balance sheet and the latest rolloff of treasuries and MBS of $34 billion in June demonstrate they are keeping their aggressive rolloff schedule through 2019. Just as the quantitative easing (QE) programs from 2008 to 2015 added trillions in financial liquidity to bolster markets, the current reduction of $687 billion from peak QE is likely to have either an inverse linear or a threshold breaking impact on the markets the further the balance sheet is reduced. Related to this, volatility in 2018 spiked under QT with 20 different days where the S&P 500 moved +/- more than 2% at a frequency double any prior year from 2012 under the low volatility QE program. Through 2019, we have only had 4 days of +/- 2% moves on the S&P 500 and, for now, remain well below the level last year since the QT program began in earnest. While the expected July rate cut may help fuel the record stock buyback binge with lower interest rates, the amount of liquidity the Fed continues to drain from their balance sheet may catch up to markets at a critical time. Watching how these forces affect the markets will be an important factor behind the market sustaining new highs.WG Investment Research: Investor sentiment. I have been positioning my portfolio(s) for a muted market for at least the last year, but it turns out that I have been early with my call (yes, wrong). It is, however, hard to deny the fact that the current bull market appears to long in the tooth, and, in my opinion, a broader market pullback is not only due but it is also necessary. The U.S. economy is solid, if you look past the noise being created by Washington, but I believe that a 5-10% correction would be healthy and would actually create some very attractive long-term buying opportunities. So, I am paying close attention to sentiment (for both the broader market and for the specific companies) when researching new positions. Moreover, I plan to stay defensive through 2019/2020.Value Digger: My research team and I focus on five sectors (i.e. industrial, consumer goods, healthcare, mining, energy) and therefore, it's not easy to briefly mention what has changed in these sectors in H1 2019 primarily because of two reasons. First, each sector is subject to its own characteristics, considerations and risks. Second, each sector is divided into sub-sectors with different parameters. For instance, the mining sector consists of a bunch of sub-sectors (i.e. gold/silver, base metals, lithium, cobalt etc.). However, all the aforementioned five sectors share one thing in common. They still host companies with a gross mismatch between what their stock trades for and what it's actually worth, which usually translates into excellent long and short ideas. When it comes to our long picks, we always want to buy a stock with a big margin of safety. The margin of safety is the difference between the intrinsic value of the stock and the price you pay for it. When it comes to our short ideas, we focus on highly leveraged names, bubbles and fad stocks.Joseph L. Shaefer: I have no single sector – nor even a single asset class. Academia has now proven what smart investors have known all along: “to every thing, there is a season.” Sometimes, real assets versus paper, sometimes bonds over stocks, sometimes one sector or industry over another. What has my attention is not researching positions but rather researching the broad market and its many sectors. Right now, I am moving more into income rather than “concept,” resistance to decline over the next hot thing, and companies that provide a compelling value no matter the zigs and zags of the market.Andres Cardenal: US stocks are relatively expensive in general, but there are plenty of attractive opportunities in technology, software, semiconductors, and genomics. In addition to this, international stocks are comparatively undervalued. In simple terms, I'm betting on technology, software, semis, genomics, and international stocks.Chris Lau: My DIY Value Investing model held 1/4 cash. We will enter positions in discounted sectors because rate cuts and ongoing hopes of some trade deal will drive stock valuations higher. This includes the healthcare sector, basic materials, and technology stocks left out of the rallyDining Stocks Online: We are positioned as we always are; focused on relatively cheap stocks with solid fundamentals and rather healthy balance sheet. That mix should work well over the long haul, regardless of near-term market dynamics.Fred Piard: I will take the market as it comes week by week and make decisions based on data. I plan to continue with my quantitative models in the dynamic part of my portfolio. In my long-term holdings (mostly real estate ETFs, dividend ETFs and precious metal funds), I may occasionally trade partial positions to improve my average cost. Most important: I keep some cash.Michael Boyd: After having been quite long off of January, I'm leaning more cash and on the short side than I have been in the past. The sectors that do well relatively if we are in fact late cycle (consumer staples, utilities), while they have underperformed in 2019, are still pretty crowded, in my opinion, and healthcare remains a tough sell, given the Democratic party planks heading into the election. I'd much rather be short select companies in select end markets rather than buy into overbought conditions.Ruerd Heeg: I invest in extremely cheap stocks based on a good mix of fundamental metrics and in somewhat less cheap and more trustworthy companies with better earnings quality and asset allocation. I keep doing this, because I do not think it pays off trying to time the market. There is one exception, however, which is my Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) short. This company is suffering from low margins, high losses, and a lack of cash. Therefore, I think we will see a much lower Tesla stock price within a year and probably already within a couple of months. By the way, that could cause many other stocks to go down as well.Fear & Greed Trader: Until the long-term bullish trend decidedly changes, I remain positioned with a bullish bias.Trapping Value: Everyone is on recession watch, and that is something we are not taking our eyes off. But the incoming data, including the cycle peak for new home sales, tells us that the recession is not coming till middle of 2020 at the earliest. We are biasing towards small caps which have lagged the rally and expect them to catch up.David Trainer: We see the potential for what we call the “Micro-Bubbles” to burst in the near future. The walls are closing in for high-flying stocks like Netflix (NFLX) and Tesla. These high-flying stocks have traded at valuations that are entirely untethered to their fundamentals. As management touts “disruption” and “innovation”, Netflix and Tesla burn billions of dollars a year with no end in sight. These firms’ lofty valuations are at greater risk of falling as more investors see through the rhetoric and heed fundamentals. We’re betting against these micro-bubble stocks and betting on the incumbents, like GM (GM) and Disney (DIS), who have solid cash flows and cheap valuations.JD Henning: Since the start in 2017, my momentum model has beaten the S&P 500 with over 32% average annual returns. Signals from the momentum gauges that I track daily also helped avoid the May decline and the prior October correction. I plan to continue to monitor market conditions for the best gains possible for as long as these record capital inflows and momentum conditions keep building. My multiple discriminant analysis approach identifies the strongest variables contributing to stock gains and guides the selections toward the most attractive sectors and industries on a weekly basis. Currently, fundamental variables are not as strong as other characteristics like money flow and net institutional buying. Reviewing the similarities with 2018 does have me cautious that the back half of the year could also reflect recurring seasonality patterns and an increased risk that the Fed is unable to sustain these such low levels of volatility while still aggressively unwinding the balance sheet. Coupled with the highest rate of return from the S&P 500 in 60 years, the likelihood of some profit taking and defensive posture is increasing for my positions in the back half of 2019. Until the signals change again, I remain fully invested since the momentum gauges moved back into positive levels in June.Value Digger: First, we will continue to play both sides of the market, long and short. Second, diversification is a key success factor, so we will continue to diversify our portfolio by picking long and short ideas from a variety of sectors. Currently, we focus on the industrial, consumer goods, healthcare, mining, and energy sectors. When it comes to our short ideas, we will continue to short highly leveraged and overhyped stocks from overhyped sectors (i.e. marijuana stocks). When it comes to our long ideas, one thing we did on Value Investor's Stock Club is to shine our flashlight in the dark corners of the market unearthing overlooked small caps with healthy balance sheets and strong catalysts. So, we will continue to do this in H2 2019 and 2020 because we believe that alpha is abundant in small caps, and investors can have the highest equal-weighted returns in the small caps space. This is how we discovered Flexible Solutions International Inc. (FSI) for our subscribers last January. FSI has risen about 250% since our bullish call and has been included in the Top 5 with the best-performing stocks in 2019.Joseph L. Shaefer: “Why” flows from the two questions above and “what” means positioning into corporate (not K1) energy infrastructure giants, favoring particularly those that also have renewables components; equity income funds, ETFs and closed-ends that provide both income and growth; neglected-in-this-rally real asset firms (like real estate and metals) that offer both yield and compelling value; and of course, the ever-present special situations that reward only those willing to do the deep research to discover.Andres Cardenal: In order to find value stocks nowadays, you need to be able to look beyond the traditional valuation ratios that put too much emphasis on current earnings. The company's true value will depend on the cash flows that it generates in the future, and growth is a key component of intrinsic value. Many high-quality growth stocks may appear expensive when looking at simplistic valuation ratios, but when you take a deeper look at the company and its potential, you find that there are plenty of opportunities hidden in plain sight among high-quality growth stocks.Chris Lau: Value investors are suffering the most as markets reward Netflix, Amazon.com (AMZN), and other high fliers. Exercise patience and buy stocks having a catalyst ahead. Eventually, the discount will shrink as the stock recovers. Value - Do you see any patterns as far as where attractive value stocks are popping up in the market as we hover around all-time highs?David Krejca: Although I am focusing on profitable and high-growing companies most of the time, recently, I was surprised by several less-known data analytics and software companies that have turned around their income statement from small losses into black figures. One of such companies is Alteryx (AYX), a data-analytics company providing solutions which simplify programming work.Dining Stocks Online: Consumer discretionary stocks seem to be a mixed bag. Within dining, high growth franchise business models are hot, whereas slower growth owned chains are out of favor. If your chain is located near shopping malls, that is a further complication. We believe there is a lot of value for companies that mint money and are exposed to these underpriced micro issues. In addition to PLAY, we also like chains like Cheesecake Factory (CAKE), which is suffering from mall exposure but is a brand that is likely to survive and thrive versus smaller, weaker competitors.Fred Piard: Based on my monthly dashboard of June, energy, communication services and biotechnology were slightly underpriced relative to their historical averages. I may have already published an update when you read this. It is a group picture. There may be underpriced and overpriced stocks in any industry.Michael Boyd: Value continues to underperform growth just as it has for several years now. The best performing sectors in the S&P 500 this year are Technology and Consumer Discretionary, the worst are Utilities and Healthcare. That's a pretty clear indicator of where we sit; the market is still ""risk on"" unless we are talking about a few select areas like automotive or housing. If you have been in 100% value stocks, odds are you have not kept up with the S&P 500.Ruerd Heeg: In the US, we hover around all-time highs, both in absolute terms and based on valuation. But many foreign stock markets are much cheaper. Apparently, nobody wants these stocks, so I invest in them. At the moment, I do not see patterns in these stocks, unlike a couple of years ago, for example, with Japanese construction companies and oil stocks. But patterns or not, with quantitative rankings I still find great stocks. So, unlike many other investors, I do not use patterns to find high returning stocks.Fear & Greed Trader: Contrary to the consensus view, I see plenty of value, the stocks I mention as favorites below are just a few.Trapping Value: Energy space is highly hated, and the Canadian energy space even more so. Most stocks here are at a third to a quarter of historic EV to EBITDA multiples. Energy weighting of S&P 500 is at an all-time low. We like this space, though it has not been an easy area to be long in. Some shipping stocks like Teekay Corporation (TK) and Golar LNG Ltd. (GLNG) are priced for an asteroid strike. We see a lot of 100% return potentials in both beaten down sectors.David Trainer: The Financials and Consumer Non-cyclicals sectors are currently two of our highest-rated sectors. Financials, specifically, have underperformed over the past five years, which means valuations are well below the overall market. It’s easy to find cheap stocks in this sector, but growth is more difficult to identify. We see opportunity in some regional banks that are priced for permanent profit decline despite a strong track record of recent growth. Our recent Long Idea on Lakeland Financial Corp. (LKFN) is a good example of this sort of opportunity.JD Henning: Value stocks are an important component of my portfolio selections to augment the momentum breakout stocks that are performing well under current market conditions. Since 2018, I have seen strong divergences between high returns and the positive fundamentals that are expected to produce those returns. In fact, as I detailed in a summary article of last year's market results, there was no statistical difference in end of year stock performance between (1) companies with sales and without sales, (2) companies with positive and negative net profits, (3) companies with EPS growth above the median and those below the median EPS growth.While value was undermined greatly last year due to the large market correction in Q4, the continuation of tightening policies from the Fed has affected some results into 2019. Distortions from stock buybacks, more dovish Fed policies, and tariff burdens on certain sectors more than others, all contribute to a mixed return picture on value stocks. Key algorithms like the Piotroski value and Graham enhancement are tested bi-monthly in value portfolios designed to identify areas of attractive value. Currently, in a sector analysis, the financial sector is showing the best correlation with fundamentals as 88% of all the stocks with positive earnings this year are net positive in price YTD. Industrial goods at 81% takes up a strong second place. At the opposite end of the spectrum are healthcare stocks, where only 58% of the net positive stocks year to date have positive earnings. Many factors are contributing to these divergences, and it may be that the healthcare sector is substantially undervalued with the other 42% positive earnings growth stocks ready to deliver strong gains. Technology is near healthcare in this divergence with only 62% of the net positive stocks YTD have positive earnings this year. A shift from momentum toward value may see more of these healthcare and technology stocks gaining in price with more consistency with their positive earnings growth.WG Investment Research: The attractively valued high dividend payers are finally starting to find their footing, especially ever since the Federal Reserve changed their stance on the prospects of an interest rate cut. AT&T is one name that sticks out. This telecom company has been dealing with several self-inflicted wounds, with the DirecTV acquisition being the biggest example, but the stock has performed well over the last few months. The above-average dividend that AT&T pays looks a lot more attractive now with rates hovering around 2%. This is just one example but, overall, I see investors seeking yield and the “safe” high dividend payers appear to be the direct beneficiaries.Value Digger: Value investing is by no means dead, although it's currently a bit out of fashion. Another thing we see is that value investing is not equally spread in all the sectors. I mean that long-term investors can currently find more attractive value stocks in the industrial and energy sectors than in the healthcare sector. We believe that this largely results from the fact that healthcare demand is fairly inelastic and patients are fairly insensitive to changes in healthcare prices.Joseph L. Shaefer: “Why” flows from the two questions above and “what” means positioning into corporate (not K1) energy infrastructure giants, favoring particularly those that also have renewables components; equity income funds, ETFs, and closed-ends that provide both income and growth; neglected-in-this-rally real asset firms (like real estate and metals) that offer both yield and compelling value; and of course, the ever-present special situations that reward only those willing to do the deep research to discover.Andres Cardenal: Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL) is a high quality business with rock-solid competitive strengths, strong revenue growth, and impressive profitability. The market is overreacting to regulatory risk, and the stock is trading at a forward adjusted PE ratio below 25. If we include the value of cash and the ""other bets"" segments, we could easily say that Alphabet is deeply undervalued at current prices, especially considering the quality of the company.Chris Lau: In technology, DocuSign (DOCU) recovered faster than I thought while StoneCo (STNE), a DIY member-driven mobile transactions play, continues to reward our members.Dining Stocks Online: We recently upgraded Dave & Buster's (PLAY) after the stock dropped materially after a slight earnings miss and guidance cut. The company has modest leverage, strong free cash flow, and a long runway of new location growth ahead. Trading at a discount to the sector, we like growth companies trading at value stock prices. We believe fair value is between $50 and $60 per share, versus the current price around $40 or so.Eric Nickolaison: From a risk adjusted return perspective, I like Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) (BRK.A) - the company that was created to compound at high rates through the use of low cost float. Size is a drag on future returns for BRK, but I believe investors are discounting it too much. The growing pot of deployable cash acts like a hedge against the future economic uncertainty that is vibrating in the market. With a collection of high quality companies and a sound balance sheet, it's akin to a AAA rated bond yielding 8-10%. A very attractive setup for where were at in today's environment.Fred Piard: There is no narrative behind my stock holdings, it's a filtering and ranking process combining several ratios. They may change next week. A few of my ETF holdings may be of interest for investors seeking foreign dividend stock exposure: EFAV (excludes the US and Canada), ENZL (New Zealand), EWA (Australia), EWD (Sweden), EWM (Malaysia). EFAV is my largest position among them. These ETFs have dividends in the 3-5% range.Michael Boyd: China Yuchai (CYD). The company has always been a favorite of mine and is primarily a diesel engine manufacturer in China. It trades at near net cash, less than the value of actual cash plus working capital, and has a great underlying business. I toured several of the manufacturing facilities in mainland China a couple of years ago. This isn't stolen American IP; the tech here is internally-developed products designed to meet new stricter Chinese emission standards. Buying the company today essentially gets you that business - which generates substantial profits - for free. Best of all, the company has a loose dividend policy and has paid out quite a bit in recent years. The annual dividend was recently declared and works out to better than 6% yield given current prices.Ruerd Heeg: A good foreign stock is Cabbeen Fashion, ticker 2030 in Hong Kong. This is a retail fashion chain and cheap based on EV/EBIT and Price/Tangible Book. Multi-year metrics suggest very good earnings and asset allocation quality. And, the business is growing. The company pays a nice dividend.Fear & Greed Trader: I have many names I view as favorites, and they share the same attribute - undervalued: Alibaba (BABA), Goldman Sachs (GS), SYNNEX (SNX), and United Rentals (URI).David Trainer: As noted in our answer to Question 3, Disney (DIS) is one of our top long ideas. Disney is the true content king, not just because it produces more hits than anyone else but also because it monetizes its content better than anyone else. The launch of Disney+ will further demonstrate the power of Disney’s content marketing and distribution. When we say “power”, we mean profits. Disney generated over $20 billion in free cash flow over the last 3 years. For comparison, Netflix lost over $10 billion over the same time frame. Despite Disney’s dominance in content creation, the market’s valuation currently implies that Netflix will surpass it as the most profitable content company in the world over the next decade. As it becomes clearer that Disney will win the content war (Netflix is already looking to cut back on content spending), we expect to see Netflix’s valuation decrease sharply, and much of that capital will continue to flow to Disney. We believe DIS will continue to outperform, and due to its cheap valuation, we see significant potential upside for Disney. If Disney can earn the same ROIC from the Fox acquisition as it has for the rest of its business (12%) and grow organic revenue by 6% compounded annually over the next decade, the stock is worth $189/share today, a 34% upside to the current stock price. Even this scenario might prove too pessimistic. After all, it only implies a 12% compounded annual NOPAT growth rate, which is below the company’s historical average. If Disney can grow NOPAT by 17% compounded annually over the next decade, equal to its historical growth rate, the stock has a fair value of $330/share today, a 135% upside to the current stock price.JD Henning: TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. (AMTD) is one of my current favorite picks among large cap, lower volatility selections. The financial sector is currently among one of the top momentum sectors based on a number of key characteristics including high net inflows. Consider:These conditions are ideal for the financial sector, and it seems clear that brokerage services will stay in high demand. Specific to TD Ameritrade, the company maintains low debt levels, high cash flows, great margins, and a surging EPS Q/Q of 86.8% combined to deliver excellent value. Further increasing share values is a management team that has reduced shares outstanding by more than 17 million from last year. In addition, TD Ameritrade is backing trading platform ErisX that just received licensing last week by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to offer digital asset futures contracts, i.e. cryptocurrency derivative trading. This very hot segment in the regulated derivatives market will be launched later this year and is sure to bring additional gains to the brokerage services and share price of AMTD.WG Investment Research: People that follow me on Seeking Alpha know how much I like Bank of America (BAC) at today’s price, so I will not bore everyone by restating the same thesis that I have spelled out several times over the last few months. Simply put, I believe that this bank is attractively valued and it has the potential to return a significant amount of capital to shareholders over the next 2-3 years. This bank is by far my favorite idea in the large-cap space.For the small-cap space, I believe that Teladoc (TDOC) is a true hidden gem. This telehealth company has been disrupting the way people consume healthcare, and I believe that there is no looking back. Teladoc is still early in its growth cycle and, in my opinion, over the next decade this company will either be: (1) acquired at a significantly higher market cap or (2) a $20B+ standalone company that is the market leader in the telehealth industry. In either case, shareholders will be happy about owning Teladoc at current levels.Value Digger: One of our current favorite ideas is going short on Wayfair (W). Specifically, we recently recommended our subscribers short W at $148 per share or higher. W's business model has a bunch of negatives, as presented in detail to our subscribers. Among others, W has an ugly mix of losses, negative adjusted EBITDA, cash burn, and shrinking margins, which can't be offset by its YoY revenue growth.Joseph L. Shaefer: Texas Pacific Land Trust (TPL). My thesis is that you buy value, not price, and TPL is heavy with poorly-reflected value that will only grow. To the issue of value vs. price: was Amazon (AMZN) “overpriced” at $1,000 per share? Was Berkshire Hathaway? In my opinion, the Permian Basin will be the most prolific energy play ever, in the best state and country in which to own energy assets, and with the highest probability of being able to turn those assets into earnings, revenue, and dividends.Lejun James Shao: I am still buying beaten down stocks for possible future multi-bagger return. Uxin Limited (NASDAQ:UXIN) is one of my top picks, IPO'd at $9.00 and now trading at the $2.00 level. China's second-hand car market is huge and is still in its early stage of development. The company is still struggling in search of a way, which can lead to its profitability. I will wait for this day to arrive.***Thanks to our panel for participating!

4060077,102028,2017-04-04T08:07:34-04:00,"Discount broker has strong historical top line and bottom line growth.Competition heats up among brokers as they continue to slash trading commission prices.Pending merger with rival Scottrade will be dilutive to EPS, but expected to generate long-term value.","1975 was a seminal year in the brokerage industry as the SEC eliminated fixed-price commissions. Many firms took advantage of the situation and established what became known as discount brokers. One such firm was First Omaha Securities, Inc., which has evolved over 35 years to become TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD). Today, TD Ameritrade is the 2nd largest online broker, with more than $750 billion in client assets and about 7 million brokerage accounts.AMTD clients trade on average about 450,000 shares each day. The company, which has grown through strategic acquisitions, announced last fall the acquisition of the privately owned broker, Scottrade Financial Services. The discount brokerage industry is highly competitive, with brokers continuing to cut trading commissions in order to attract more clients.This acquisition will remove a well-respected rival from the playing field, and increase the company's scale by adding 2 million new clients, 500 physical branches, $170 billion in assets under management and about 137,000 daily average revenue trades (DARTS). This analysis examines the operating history of AMTD, its current valuation, and whether this merger makes sense.AMTD has grown rapidly over the past decade. Total non-interest revenues have grown at a 14.7% CAGR since 2005, with most of that growth being generated by insured deposit account fees and investment product fees, which are basically cash management services and fees earned on mutual funds. Commissions and transaction fees still contribute the largest percentage of revenues, 42% in fiscal 2016, but that growth has tapered in recent years as commission prices have continued to decline.The company, though, has been very successful at increasing its client base to help offset the decline in commission rates. Net interest income (NII) has shown steady growth, although the continued low interest rate environment has kept any meaningful growth at bay. AMTD generated record net revenues of $3.3 billion in fiscal 2016, a 2.2% increase over 2015 results. Growth in commissions and transaction fees has slowed slightly. Overall, though, total net revenues have increased about 11% annually since 2005 and 3.7% annually over the past five years.AMTD Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsEven in the discount brokerage world, compensation and benefits represent the largest expense category. In 2016, compensation expense increased 4% to $839 million, which is 25.6% of net revenues. This is the second consecutive year in which the compensation expense ratio has increased, and it is the highest percentage of revenues since 2012. Additionally, it is the second consecutive year that compensation expense has outpaced revenue growth.Employee headcount increased 5.6% in 2016 to just over 6,000 employees, the most in its history. Clearly, if this trend continues, this will put a damper on future growth in income. The only other category to note here is advertising expense, which increased about 5% in fiscal 2016 due to the company's sponsorship of the Summer Olympics. It is expected that this expense should decrease to more normal levels over the course of the next several years.Total operating expenses increased 4.9% in the most recent year to just over $2 billion. The efficiency ratio, a measure of how well the company manages operating expenses, was 0.61 in 2016, the highest since 2012. Operating expenses have increased with sales, which is to be expected. Recently, however, expenses have outpaced the growth in revenues slightly. Investors should keep an eye on the company's expenses, particularly as the Scottrade acquisition is folded into AMTD.It should come as no surprise, then, with strong revenue growth and expense control that AMTD has generated solid bottom line numbers as well. Net income increased 3.6% in 2016 to a record $842 million, and diluted EPS increased 6% in 2016 to $1.58. The company has repurchased a modest amount of shares recently to boost its EPS growth. The buyback plan is on hold while the Scottrade merger is completed. Finally, the company does issue a dividend to shareholders. The dividend increased 13% in 2016 to $0.68 per share, and the current dividend yield is 1.85%.AMTD Net Income (Annual) data by YChartsThe company has a solid, healthy balance sheet with assets totaling $28.8 billion at the end of 2016. The largest component of assets is receivables from clients, which is primarily margin loans to securities brokerage accounts. The ability for the company to extend margin loans to its clients is critical in generating interest revenue. Receivables represented 41% of total assets at the end of 2016. Total assets have increased at an 11% clip annually over the past five years.On the liability side, payables to clients, or deposits, have increased significantly over the past five years to 66% of total assets. Total liabilities now represent about 82% of total assets, which is much higher than five or six years ago, but certainly less than before the financial crisis. Shareholders' equity now represents 17.5% of total assets, the lowest equity to asset ratio since 2007.The capital structure leverage ratio is 5.54, which is the highest it has been since the financial crisis. I do not see this as a problem at the moment. The company is far less leveraged than competitor Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), which has a capital structure leverage ratio of almost 16. It will be interesting to see how much the balance sheet structure changes following the acquisition of Scottrade.The stock has had some interesting activity lately. Coming from the depths of the financial crisis, when the stock price hit a low of less than $10 per share, the long-term returns are phenomenal. Investors who bought at the low of $9.71 in November 2009 would have seen returns of about 380%, far outpacing the S&P 500. The stock price hit an all-time high just two months ago, following the exuberant reaction to the U.S. election. However, since that time, it has fallen about 20% to a recent price of $38.65. At this level, the stock is trading in line with its average P/E ratio of about 23x LTM diluted EPS and a book value of 3.8x.AMTD data by YChartsNormally, I would say this is a decent buying opportunity, particularly since value is so hard to find in the current market. Compared to SCHW or the larger banks, AMTD is a downright steal at these levels. However, if you look at the chart of the recent stock price, it looks pretty ugly. The stock has had several terrible moves since October. The first move was following the Scottrade acquisition announcement, after which the stock was down about 10% ten trading days later.From that point to its all-time high of $46.86 in January, it raced to a 40% gain on the heels of the ""Trump trade."" The next major move downward was on February 2 after Schwab announced they were cutting their prices on trading commissions. And finally, the stock gapped down again on February 28 following the announcement that Fidelity was cutting their trading commissions to $4.95 per trade. This was then followed by the company's own announcement that it, too, was reducing commissions on clients' equity trades.The stock also had a major move down just last week on news that the President's healthcare reform bill was facing difficulty in Congress, thereby threatening the rest of the new President's legislative agenda, including tax reform and regulatory reform.That is four major, sudden moves downward in the past several months, during a continued, yet stretch bull market. The stock is now back to where it was before the Scottrade announcement. But the four significant drops in a short period of time illustrate the volatility of the stock and the market in general. The two drops in February in particular point to the concern that the commission price war will particularly impact AMTD since over 40% of the company's revenues are from trading commissions.AMTD data by YChartsWhile I generally prefer to stick to a company's fundamentals when making a decision on the stock, it is sometimes wise to look at the recent trading activity from the charts. And right now, investors are not particularly thrilled with the stock. It is trading well below its 50 and 100-day moving averages. The short-term trend is down, and the stock is well on its ways to testing support in the $33-34 per share.How should investors contemplate the Scottrade acquisition? It is an interesting acquisition in that there are two components. TD Ameritrade is acquiring Scottrade Financial Services, Inc. for a total purchase price of $4 billion. TD Bank is acquiring Scottrade Bank for $1.3 billion, so the net purchase price to TD Ameritrade is $2.7 billion, which will be a combination of cash and equity. The company is selling $400 million of new debt, combined with $900 million of existing cash to pay Scottrade $1.3 billion in cash.Additionally, the company is issuing 11 million shares to TD bank and 28 million shares to Scottrade shareholders for $1.4 billion in equity. About $385 million in existing Scottrade debt will be retired with cash acquired from Scottrade and cash from TD Ameritrade. Following the deal's closure, TD Bank will continue to own about 41% of AMTD, Scottrade shareholders will own about 5%, the former founder will own about 11% and the public float will be about 42%.TD Ameritrade shareholders can expect to get about 3 million funded accounts, $170 billion in client assets, $36 billion in client cash, $2.5 billion in margin balances and about 500 physical branches. After the combination, the new TD Ameritrade will have over 10 million accounts, almost $1 trillion in client assets and about 450 physical locations, after consolidation overlapping branch offices. Scottrade founder, Rodger Riney, will join TD Ameritrade's board. The deal is expected to close in late September, which is the end of the company's fiscal year.Company management believes the deal will be dilutive to earnings in Year 1 (fiscal year 2018) by 7%-12%, excluding restructuring charges of about $550 million. However, the deal should turn significantly accretive in Years 2 and 3 on a GAAP basis by about 12%-15%. Scottrade had pro-forma revenue in 2016 of just over $700 million, so the company is adding about 20% to revenues.There is a major tax benefit of about $50 million for the next 15 years, which has a present value of $545 million. Also, the company expects about $450 million of expense synergies, and additional $50 million to $100 million in additional opportunity in the first several years, with higher potential beyond year 3. I tend to discount the potential synergies because often times they are part of the deal's enthusiasm, or justification.I think this deal makes sense for TD Ameritrade and Scottrade. The industry was due for some consolidation, especially with the price war on commissions. As the 2nd largest discount broker, AMTD is in a tough spot to continue to challenge the larger SCHW for market share and client assets. This deal brings in a long-time competitor with a sizeable client base and many more physical locations, which should help AMTD gain client exposure.AMTD has the advantage of its unique relationship with TD Bank, which adds additional value to the deal. The net price paid is actually fairly cheap, about four times revenue, compared to AMTD itself, which is currently trading at about six times revenue. AMTD has a long history of integrating companies with success. There is no apparent reason to expect this integration to be any different.Investors initially balked at the deal, as the stock sold off about 10% in the days following the announcement. The stock went on a tear after that, only to sell off again following the multiple commission price cut stories. The trend is currently down, although I attribute that more to the recent commission cuts and the bad news about the President's legislative agenda than to the pending merger.The lower commissions will put a damper on future growth, but I am fairly confident that the Scottrade acquisition will help to offset those headwinds. Short of an all-out stock market crash, I would be very interested in this stock if it stabilized in the $30-$33 range."
4132321,55512,2017-12-17T00:38:14-05:00,"TD Ameritrade (AMTD) is a strong player in a relatively strong market.
        AMTD is working through the purchase of Scottrade; it's gained customers and marketshare.
        AMTD is showing signs of growth going forward along with other positive factors (e.g., low debt) although competition is fierce and it's slightly overvalued given history.
        But, the biggest news in the short term is that AMTD is allowing Bitcoin futures trading; this will attract new customers and potentially drive fees.","I wasn't paying close attention to TD Ameritrade (AMTD) until I found out that they were buying Scottrade. That transaction is now complete. Nothing will change right away but over time, the transition will eat Scottrade. We'll come back to AMTD in just a moment. First, are brokerages good businesses? The competition got me interested several years ago. For example, I knew that Charles Schwab (SCHW) was a reasonable business, although its P/E has mostly moved between 25-30 over the last 20 years. Plus, the SCHW dividend is low at just 0.6% and it was stagnant for many years, only recently starting to grow again. SCHW is good business, but not quite the right flavor for me. To the larger point, brokerages are ""capital light"" with solid growth, and generally low debt. In any event, with AMTD gobbling up Scottrade, I decided to dive into some of the key numbers. Here's a quick peek:Source: F.A.S.T.graphsFrom around 2002, give or take, AMTD has gained stability. Steady earnings growth from about $0.12 up through $1.75 in 2017. Growth was flat 2009 to 2012, in large part due to the Financial Crisis. But, over the last 20 years, earnings growth has been about 20%. 10 year growth has averaged about 12% but 5 year growth has averaged about 16-17%. In any event, from a growth point of view, AMTD is quite reasonable. Dividend growth has been strong overall; average over 20% per year. That said, growth has slowed. The 2017 dividend growth rate was about 6%. The payout ratio has grown from about 23% in 2012, to 34% in 2014, to 41% in 2017. Obviously, there's even more room to grow the payout, but it's moved higher and that'll slow the increases down. Source: F.A.S.T.graphs Analysts are bullish about AMTD. Even with P/E compression from about 28 right now down to 20-22, near historical norms, it's looking like 10-14% growth going forward. Also, analysts are more bullish than I am about dividend growth, pushing it to $0.96 in 2019 and $1.14 in 2020. If underlying growth can keep up, this is not out of reach. So, AMTD is a good business with a good track record. There's plenty to like, and there isn't major downside. With the addition of Scottrade, they're also gaining marketshare and new customers. As prices keep going down and competition increasing, this purchase strategically makes sense. Scottrade users do gain features and functions, with easier Forex and Futures trading - something we'll talk about shortly. Rodger Riney (CEO and Founder of Scottrade) is winning big on this. To this point, AMTD just priced out a secondary offering of 27,685,493 at $51.50 and TD Ameritrade is not selling any shares and will not receive any proceeds from the offering. It's for Rodger and his foundations. While I thought all of this Scottrade stuff was ""big news"" the truth is that this is the real shocker: TD Ameritrade is allowing Bitcoin futures trading.To add color:And this opens the doors for Bitcoin even more:Of course, this had an immediate impact. During the regular session on Friday the 15th, AMTD was up over 2% and up another 2.6% after hours. Back on December 7th, Barron's had this to say:Clearly, things have moved very quickly. AMTD passed this along:While we could get into the nuances of Bitcoin futures trading, and the related opportunities on all sides, what matters most is this:The actual volume of Bitcoin futures trading via AMTD is less important than the fact that they are early and in the game. They are positioning, and getting in the news, and that means new clients. They are meeting the demand in the market. Of course, if things go well, and trading ramps up, there is real money and real growth here. The ""Bitcoin Bonus"" for AMTD is very real. Given the Bitcoin mania AMTD is likely going to be a very strong short term play if you trade. It was a moderately good long term bet previously, although I didn't initially like the valuation. However, with the ""Bitcoin Bonus"" and true potential of Bitcoin trading via AMTD, I'm thinking this could be a very strong medium to long term investment from a business that's been around, eating up marketshare, and even pays a growing dividend.To put the pencil on this, it's not a screaming buy at $53. However, even if it drops to a P/E of around 22, in line with history, you're potentially looking at 12-14% YoY gains through 2020 when you include dividends. With the ""Bitcoin Bonus"" the P/E (due to growth and/or earnings) could help AMTD to maintain an elevated P/E of 25 to 30, or even 35. I'm very encouraged by this and will be watching very, very closely. Stay frosty!"

Fidelity and Schwab offer $4.95 trades and are nominally the cheapest.It's not enough to have low commissions, but you need to advertise against Fidelity, Schwab and others which are aggressively marketing their lower costs. Fidelity and Schwab routinely purchase full page ads in the Wall Street Journal as well as television advertising. TD will need to spend aggressively to compete in terms of marketing and advertising.Obviously, the new commission schedules hurts income, revenue, margins etc. But, it also substantially increases marketing costs at the same time.This is now a tough environment for a company looking for growth and trading at triple the price to earnings growth (p.e.g) of its competitor, Schwab.Switching costs:Analysts who defend the companies tend to rely on the argument that switching costs for the average client is large, i.e. it's simply a pain for the average client to deal with the paperwork, etc., and preferred clients are already receiving heavy trading discounts. For the most part, these are valid arguments. However, it still creates plenty of uncertainty for investors and cost pressures on the business.Valuation analysis:The shares currently trade at a significant premium to Schwab and as investors begin to re-evaluate the business and growth prospects, I see a contraction in the PEG to 2.At a growth rate of 7%, a P/E of 14 is more appropriate and a share price around $31, which also happens to be where major support for the shares lie (see technical analysis below).Free Trading:Brian Bedell, DB (via Barron's):It's important to note that this concept was being discussed in October before the commission wars even began.If Schwab or Fidelity were to offer ""free trading"" in an attempt to gain market share, I see TD Ameritrade shares immediately falling 17% and perhaps another 20% as uncertainty builds in the space.This would take the shares all the way to the $26 level. However, I see the possibility of free trading as only having a 15% probability of happening. It is a risk that investors need to be aware of, though.(chart: Marketsmith)Think or Swim business is also under pressure:The founders of the popular trading platform have now launched a new competitor called, TastyWorks, which offers the new technology, trading platform and reduced commissions. This is a threat to the most active and high margin option clients at TD Ameritrade. And unlike the retail clients, these clients have minimal switching costs and an instant cost benefit from moving to the platform being offered by the creators of the platform they have been using. (Think or Swim).It means more margin compression, higher capital expenses to improve the trading platform and/or create content as well as lower commissions to retain preferred clients.via Chicago TribuneLight trading environment: VolatilityAs most investors have seen, the start to the year has been incredibly slow for trading and volatility in general. It's easy to assume volatility will pick up along with trading revenues.However, it is possible that the increase in passive investing styles has changed the nature of the markets to dampen trading and volatility.VXX data by YChartsReal earnings vs. buybacks:As we can see below, the company has benefited by a lower share count to make earnings seem stronger than they really are. In this new cost-intensive environment, the company will have a harder time impressing investors.Technical Analysis:The stock is already beginning to break down:As we can see from the recent stock action, the bad news is giving investors reason to re-evaluate the business, growth prospects, and valuation. The stock has already entered a downtrend and crossed the 20-day and 50-day lines.It can find support, but that is all the way down to the $31 level.(Chart: marketsmith)Conclusion:Recent developments have increased the risk for the company.Investors need to reconsider the cost-pressures and competitive landscape the company now faces.After evaluating the potential impact on the business, a lower price to growth and price to earnings ratio leave the shares with significant room on the downside.Finally, the potential threat of commission wars escalating to a ""free trading"" environment is not a high probability event, but poses outsized risk to investors by at least 30%."
4248809,50452,2019-03-14T14:22:40-04:00,"TD Ameritrade is a financial securities broker and one of the prominent players in a profitable industry.The company exhibits great profitability, cash flow generation, and is financially strong on its balance sheet. The company also distributes cash to investors in the form of dividends and buybacks.The stock is significantly undervalued compared to its 10-year historical data. This provides a margin of safety for long-term investors.","Financial securities broker TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) is quickly becoming a strong dividend growth stock. The company has raised its dividend nine consecutive years. The dividend's strong growth rate caught our attention, but when you take a closer look, there is a lot to like. A growing and diverse revenue base, strong profit metrics, and a healthy balance sheet combine to offer investors a strong investment option that seems to fly a bit under the radar. When you consider the stock's attractive valuation, TD Ameritrade is an appealing total returns opportunity for long-term investors.TD Ameritrade is a holding company that brokers a variety of financial services, securities, and other products to investors/traders. The company has been operating since its founding in 1971. The company holds more than $1.2 trillion in total assets and generates more than $5 billion in annual revenues. The revenues stem from a cluster of different categories, including commissions and transaction fees on security trades, deposit fees on cash handling services, interest revenue on assets held, and fees from managed products such as mutual funds.Source: TD AmeritradeSource: YChartsTD Ameritrade has seen steady growth over the past decade, as the recovery of the financial markets has been a huge tailwind for the company. The company also gained a boost by acquiring rival Scottrade in 2017. Over the past decade, revenue has grown at a CAGR of 8.06%, and EPS at a CAGR of 6.89%.When we look at the operational metrics of a potential investment, we focus on a few specific metrics. We want a company that is consistently profitable, so we look at the operating margin. We look for strong cash flow generators, so we review the conversion rate of revenue into FCF. Lastly, we want a business that is well run, and not overly capital-intensive. Therefore, we look at the company's cash rate of return on invested capital (CROCI). Specifically, we have three benchmarks:The company's total operating expenses of $2.8 billion over the trailing 12-month period result in an operating margin of approximately 57%. It has been one year since the company's large acquisition of Scottrade, so these metrics need to be followed to establish a new trend of performance. If we look at FCF conversion, the rate is very strong at 31.43% - even if it has been a bit choppy over time. The CROCI is also solid, although this is another metric that needs to recalibrate following the Scottrade deal. Overall, TD Ameritrade is operating profitably and generating a ton of free cash flow.Source: YChartsNext, we look at the balance sheet. A company that holds assets and lends money must remain financially disciplined as liquidity is the ultimate priority.Source: YChartsThe company is in great shape here. Although TD Ameritrade has more than a billion in debt coming due in the next few years, it operates from a net positive cash position, so it can easily pay this down.Operating at a high margin, high cash flow level, TD Ameritrade is able to distribute cash to investors. This is what ultimately put TD Ameritrade on our radar for this review. The dividend has been raised each of the past nine years. The current payout of $1.20 per share (annual sum of quarterly dividends) yields 2.20% on the current stock price. Although it yields less than treasury notes, the upside is in how management has grown the payout. Although sporadic with some special dividends mixed in, the total payout has grown at a CAGR of 19.0% over the past five years. The dividend also consumes a very small portion of cash flow, just 10.78%. While the company will act conservatively to preserve liquidity, the dividend still has plenty of room to continue growing at a strong rate.Source: YChartsTD Ameritrade also has an established record of buying back stock. Several hundreds of millions are spent buying shares each year, and the share count has diminished over time. The company had to issue stock as part of the Scottrade deal, but they have already restarted the process of retiring stock.Source: YChartsThe company is growing organically and through acquisitions. We have already mentioned the company's deal to acquire Scottrade. The deal was worth $4 billion and closed near the tail end of 2017. With the company's balance sheet still in great shape, we could see a similar deal taking place in the future. It has already been rumored that TD Ameritrade may be interested if competitor E*TRADE (ETFC) is put up for sale.Organic growth has been solid as well since the merger. From Q1 2018 and forward, TD Ameritrade has grown new net client assets between 7% and 10% by the quarter. This figure doesn't include appreciation such as the inflation of a stock price, so this is impressive.Source: TD AmeritradeWhile this is great, investors need to note that we are in a stretched bull market. During markets like this, investing activity tends to increase. When the market turns lower, human psyche will pull assets out of the market and reduce trade frequency. We find that TD Ameritrade has the financial chops to navigate through a downturn, but such an event would certainly stifle the company's growth. The prospect of a recession also poses other systemic risks to TD Ameritrade. Similar to a bank, the company holds and lends money and other assets. The company must run itself conservatively to protect its liquidity. A downturn could stress TD Ameritrade in this regard. But, as we said, we find a recession as a growth headwind. The company is on a solid financial footing and would be able to navigate all but apocalyptic scenarios.The stock has drifted lower since last summer. Now trading at just under $55 per share, TD Ameritrade is at the midpoint of its 52-week range.Source: YChartsAnalysts are projecting TD Ameritrade to earn approximately $4.07 per share for FY2019. This places the stock at 13.75X full year earnings, a 29% discount to the stock's 10-year median. This perceived discount to TD Ameritrade's value is backed up by a couple of other metrics. The company's dividend yield of 2.20% is 52% higher than its 10-year median yield of 1.44%.Source: YChartsIn addition, the stock's yield on free cash flow is near its high point over the past decade. Considering all variables, we view that TD Ameritrade is currently trading at an attractive valuation. While the risk exists for recession-induced headwinds, the stock's discounted valuation provides a margin of safety for long-term investors. We like the stock's price up to approximately $64 per share where it begins to approach fair value.The need for brokers in the financial markets gives TD Ameritrade staying power as a prominent player within its industry. The company's scale only grew with the acquisition of Scottrade. We like the company's profitability, cash flow generation, strong balance sheet, and dividend growth as the foundation of a bull thesis. When you factor in valuation, we suspect that TD Ameritrade will be a profitable investment five years from now.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4037766,22148,2017-01-18T19:12:37-05:00,TD Ameritrade trades at all-time highs as expectations for more rate hikes are factored into the stock price.The Q4 results were again held back by weak net interest revenues.The stock valuation is now risky considering the expectation of multiple rate hikes that may not occur.,"About a year ago, my investment thesis on TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) was that the stock was worth buying on the dips. The eventual interest rate hikes would lead the stock to higher prices and reward shareholders.The stock has surged from those lows that eventually touched $25 and which now trade at $46. The equation is completely different this year with the market apparently already factoring in multiple rate hikes.The main reason that rates matter is that the brokerage firm obtains more revenues from rate sensitive assets than transactions. As well, TD Ameritrade has seen these assets surge 14% over the last year.The Q4 results showed the impact of the low rate environment, which existed the whole year. Q4 earnings were only up 5% to $0.41 while revenues hit a record despite only 6% growth.All of the asset measures were up double-digits from 2015 levels, led by a 15% increase in client assets to $797 billion. Net interest revenue for the quarter was $151 million and actually down from last year.The following slide shows that net interest revenue was the only revenue category that didn't grow over the last year. The lack of growth held back the overall growth rate.Source: TD Ameritrade Q416 earnings releaseThe investment thesis is well established that TD Ameritrade will see a big boost from rate increases. Analysts have 2018 EPS estimates now reaching $2.05, up from $1.72 this year.The P/E ratio is near the highs from the last few years suggesting some more upside in the stock, but likely not a lot.AMTD P/E Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsThe issue with chasing the stock above $50 is that the EPS growth is somewhat dependent on hitting the targeted rate hikes in 2017, which in the past few years haven't actually occurred. Any sign that rate hikes won't occur near the expected pace of three rate hikes in 2017 would send the stock back down to a level near the previous resistance ($37.50) and maybe even lower.The key investor takeaway is that the investment equation in TD Ameritrade is completely altered this month. The stock is dangerous to buy, with rate hikes built into the price, as compared to the last few years when TD Ameritrade could be had without any assumptions of rate hikes.The risk/reward doesn't favor piling into the stock now."
4162836,34821,2018-04-13T09:31:55-04:00,"Earnings exceeded estimates by 53% last quarter, the best record in two years.The current high level of volatility should mean greater commissions from increased trading levels.Over half the analysts following AMTD have raised their estimates in the last 30 days, but the composite estimate is 12% below what the company reported last quarter.","TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) announces earnings before the market opens on Tuesday, April 24, 2018.Let's take a look at how the company has performed in the recent past. Here are the numbers for AMTD for the last eight quarterly earnings announcements:AMTD has managed to exceed estimates for the past three quarters, but earlier results were less consistent. The best result occurred in the January 22, 2018 announcement when they exceeded estimates by 53%. Yet the stock fell 2% on the news, a good indication that expectations were running even higher than the published estimates. The stock had risen nearly 8% in the two weeks running up to the announcement day, making it the largest pre-announcement gain for the eight quarters and a strong indicator that expectations were running unusually high.The green numbers in the table are less than the price of the stock on the close of the day before the announcement. The pattern for AMTD is similar to what we see for most companies heading into earnings - the stock usually trades higher as hopes rise for a positive announcement. Short-term gains in the stock prior to the announcement are common. If you are interested in buying shares of AMTD, now might be an excellent time to do it. For seven of the last eight quarters, if you had bought the stock two weeks before the announcement day, you could have bought it for less money than it was trading for after the announcement. The only time this was not true was when results fell 9% below estimates and the stock fell 4% on the news. That was by far the worst performance compared to estimates for the two years and seems to be an atypical outlier. Even though the stock fell 2% after earnings last quarter, you still would have picked up the stock for less money had you bought it at any time in the two weeks prior to the announcement than after results were made public.Analysts seem to favor AMTD over its closest competitors in the discount brokerage industry, Interactive Brokers (NASDAQ:IBKR) and Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW):AMTD is ranked as either a strong buy or buy by 57% of the analysts, better than the 50% favoring SCHW and only 29% designating that honor for IBKR (and an equal number rate it as a strong sell). Two analysts have raised their ranking for AMTD in 2018, and a third initiated coverage with an Outperform ranking.Ten of the fifteen analysts who follow AMTD have raised their estimates for the current quarter over the last 30 days (while only one has lowered his estimate). Yet the composite estimate is only $.71 which is less than the $.80 that they reported last quarter. That doesn't make much sense to me. Volatility has soared in the first quarter of 2018. When volatility rises, investors typically make more trades, especially with options. If anything, AMTD should be reporting higher earnings when volatility is higher, and it certainly has been much higher in the first quarter of 2018 than it was in the last quarter of 2017 when they made $.80.AMTD crushed estimates in the January announcement (beating the expected number by 53%, by far the greatest report in the last two years). From my experience, when a company beats estimates by such a large number after several quarters of less spectacular results, if they had wanted to, they could have reported even greater numbers. Companies always have some discretion as to which quarter some expenses get charged against. When it looks like results are going to be far better than anyone expected, there is a good chance that they will push some revenue into the next quarter to give themselves a little cushion in case things are quite so good next time around. I have watched this phenomenon take place many times over my 40+ years of watching the market. I would be surprised if AMTD doesn't beat estimates by a fair amount this quarter.The technical indicators seem to support a bullish sentiment as well:AMTD has been held higher by a rising trendline that originates from a low posted in October. The most recent dip, in late March, saw buyer's stepping in from a confluence created by the rising trendline and a 61.8% Fibonacci retracement measured from lows printed in February to the recent high posted in late March. The stock has held above its 50-day moving average suggesting that bulls remain in control.The options are pricing in a 4.1% stock fluctuation after the announcement. This more than doubles the 1.75% fluctuation over the past eight quarters. For investors bullish on the company, this would seem to be a great time to write an out-of-the-money short-term call on the stock and enjoy some generous premium income as well as some price appreciation once the announcement is made.At Terry's Tips, we have developed what we call the Diagonal Condor Earnings Strategy as our preferred way to use options at earnings time. We particularly like situations where the options market has priced in a greater fluctuation than the stock usually changes after the announcement. You might check out the trades we suggest for AMTD here.To summarize our thinking, we believe that AMTD will move higher after the announcement. Recent analyst thinking is bullish, but not nearly as much as we feel the prospects deserve. There seems to be technical support for a higher stock price as well.Unless the stock rallies strongly between now and April 22 (an indication that expectations have grown unrealistically high), we expect to see a nice gain in the stock price after earnings are announced. Current estimates seem to be far less than warranted by the current high level of volatility and the recent earnings record for the company."

TD Ameritrade offers attractive fundamentals and business prospects that we will review. As the Millennial generation matures and they enter their prospective careers, they will start to invest. The first place they turn to is online and that should help spur growth for years to come. I believe in the future of this space and will be looking to see if it is worth making an investment in the stock.Below are TD Ameritrade's current fundamentals. This is based on closing prices on 6/28/2018.Source: Morningstar and Seeking AlphaWhat we can quickly take away is that TD Ameritrade has an attractive forward P/E, and PEG. While the debt to equity is also at a reasonable level, it is only this high due to its recent acquisition of Scottrade.So far it looks like TD Ameritrade currently trades at an attractive valuation. I also take a look at the 10-Q and 10-K to see if shares outstanding are being increased or reduced.Source: TD Ameritrade 10-QHere we see an increase in shares outstanding. Most likely due to shares issued for the Scottrade acquisition in the amount of $1.7 billion. More information regarding the recent acquisition can be found here.Before the acquisition, AMTD was reducing its shares outstanding. Once the acquisition is integrated and synergies are realized, we should see the share repurchases resume.Source: TD Ameritrade 10-KWhile there are many companies competing in the same space, however, the percentage of revenue they drive from different segments differs. This can have quite the difference in future profitability, especially as interest rates rise.A quick look at the 10-K and we find the following information for TD Ameritrade.Source: TD Ameritrade 10-KThese numbers can be expected to change greatly with the integration of Scottrade. However, from what we can see and I find most interesting is the rise in net interest revenue. Due to the rise in interest rates, AMTD will continue to profit off of cash balances in customers' accounts. We also see a continuing rise in investment product fees. The continued growth in offerings will allow AMTD to diversify its revenue away from being commission based.This is important as the revenue produced off of transactions is not always stable. It depends on growing customer accounts, having attractive trading fees, and being able to count on trades being made. We see that since 2015, TD Ameritrade has been able to reduce this portion of its revenues by 5%, and with Scottrade I believe it may continue the trend.We also see a large portion of TD Ameritrade's assets under management are institutional. This is important as the institutions are unlikely to pull cash out of accounts in the likes of a recession, where the retail investor may. A flight of capital is dangerous for the business models of both companies.Source: TD Ameritrade Investor PresentationSource: TD Ameritrade Investor PresentationFurthermore, we see the attractive fundamentals of the Scottrade acquisition. This will help to continue to grow the platform. Brokerages are generally a sticky product. I was a Scottrade customer for 11 years, I never wanted to switch brokers due to being comfortable with the platform. Plus the hassle of transferring assets was just one more thing holding me back. However, because of the acquisition I became a TD Ameritrade customer, and I can say I do enjoy the platform. The point is, the acquisition gave them access to customers they may otherwise not have been able to gain organically.As of May 2018 the monthly metrics found here, show 11.26 million funded accounts for TD Ameritrade.In summary, TD Ameritrade is a more diversified brokerage. Its revenue is driven from a few categories and not overly dependent on one source. This likely will mean more stabilized revenues and profitability in the future. We also have seen an outperformance of a few key categories such as account growth and DARTs since their Scottrade acquisition. All positives moving forward.Let's take a look at their DCF valuation based on current estimated future growth.For TD Ameritrade:Source: Money ChimpWe use an estimated earnings growth rate of 15% for the next 5 years. This is a bit high, but for the trailing 12 months, we saw earnings of $2.18. This compares to 2018 where we are actually expected to see earnings of $3.80 per share, representing 74% growth. So I adjusted the growth assumption upward for the next 5 years before decelerating it to a normalized 5%. I also lowered the discount rate from a typical 11%, as I believe we may face a recession in the next few years, I do not expect the returns to be as great as we have experienced the last 5.Currently, we see that TD Ameritrade is trading at an attractive discount to its DCF valuation.One more thing we look at is customer reviews. This can have a strong effect when customers are choosing to switch brokers or open a new account.TD Ameritrade took note of its ratings in a variety of sources as seen below.Source: TD Ameritrade Investor PresentationHowever, Barron's does an annual review and found the following.Source: Barron'sWhat is interesting is that while TD Ameritrade fell behind in the survey to 3rd place, it is very evident that it beats in every category except one, costs. This means that if TD Ameritrade decided to reduce costs in the future, we could see it become the #1 rated broker across the board, and see a pickup in new account growth. We will continue to watch future reviews closely.The low cost model attracts more active traders as we can see below.Source: Barron'sInteractive Brokers (IBKR) generates its revenue off of more trades. It is not exactly what you would call a competitive advantage and is more or less a discounted service. It should again be noted that if trading activity were to decline, we would see a significant decline in revenue.For this reason, it shouldn't be hard for AMTD to improve its ratings, overtaking Interactive Brokers within the industry and become #1.Quickly taking a look at the 52-week performance to see if either stock is offering an attractive entry point relative to its trading range.AMTD data by YChartsWith TD Ameritrade down 15% from its high but 31% above its low, it is certainly an attractive time to start a position. While the shares are not near the low, they don't deserve to be as the company is operating just fine.TD Ameritrade offers a compelling value when looking at its diversified revenue stream, PEG ratio, forward P/E, and its strong customer base. TD has a very strong balance sheet as well. I believe we will continue to see TD Ameritrade looking to diversify its offerings and bringing on small acquisitions. I also believe its parent company TD Bank (TD), will help cross-sell its customers to the broker, offering one more source of organic growth.The likelihood of rising rates will also further help TD Ameritrade as it gains interest on its huge cash base from customers. Due to the recent pullback in shares, I will be looking to start a position in AMTD in the coming weeks. I believe it will progress to close the value we found in the DCF, around $87 per share."
4014567,86896,2016-10-25T10:23:59-04:00,TD Ameritrade announced an acquisition of Scottrade Financial Services as well as its Q4 results today.The $4 billion acquisition will drastically increase the firm's customer base and pricing power in terms of competition.Strong forecasts for 2017 will need to be backed up with a good Q1 to make TD Ameritrade really exciting.,"TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) is looking to snatch up more market share in the online brokerage world by buying Scottrade Financial Services. The deal will reportedly make a firm worth $1 trillion and over 10 million clients. This merger is happening at a time when the brokerages have been having problems with trading volumes and competition from regular brokerages and (ughhh the robots are taking over) automated investment advisors. As an overall plan, AMTD wants to build a bigger base for profits from percentage of assets. As this whole thing goes down by September 2017, how has TD Ameritrade performed up to this point?The firm dropped the news of its acquisition on the same day it dished up its Q4 results. Net income in the 4th quarter was down 13% year over year at $0.35 a share on $185 million. That being said, AMTD had a banner 2016 as a whole. Net earnings were the highest ever for the firm at $1.58 per diluted share. Revenues also topped out at all-time highs of $3.3 billion for 2016. The five-year track record for the company has been reassuring. Sales and subsequent net incomes have increased year after year. The strongest point to be made about TD Ameritrade right now is the 16% growth in customer assets that now sit at $774 billion.If there is a complaint to be made, it lies with the balance sheet and shifty cash flow. The firm has not made large strides in increasing equity. This acquisition could be what's needed to break the trend of just under $5 billion in equity available to shareholders. With $8 billion in cash, the $4 billion purchase of Scottrade won't create a debt situation, nor strap them for cash. As the deal is operating in conjunction with TD Bank Group (NYSE:TD), Scottrade's banking operations will be sold limiting actual expenditures by TD Ameritrade to $2.7 billion (done with $1.4 billion in stock).Worth Buying?Sitting just off of 5-year highs, it's an iffy decision. With a lackluster Q4 and a merger in the works, there could be downside if costs are incurred beyond what is expected.(Nasdaq.com)I would imagine the stock will need to start out Q1 with an EPS that is clearly indicative of the company achieving its 2017 forecast of $1.50-$1.80 per share. Preferably leaning more towards the $1.80 end. The merger will definitely improve pricing competition with a much larger market share. TD Bank (I'll be writing about them next) also stands to gain from the banking purchases from Scottrade in the deal. Rising interest rates will make this an appealing addition to its assets. I'll definitely be watching this stock over the coming months."
3469386,89436,2015-08-26T15:53:26-04:00,Substantial Quarter-over-Quarter growth in assets.Average daily trading volume is up significantly.Increased market volatility can add upside due to increased trading commissions.,"Established in 1971, TD Ameritrade Holding (NASDAQ:AMTD) is a leading provider of discount brokerage services, with the vast majority of its services being conducted online. It's low-cost platform, including a small but growing number of brick-and-mortar branch locations has allowed the company to offer services that cater to both self-directed investors and institutional investors alike. I think AMTD's technology investments and their willingness to make synergistic acquisitions is allowing the company to create a sizable defensive moat leading to a significant competitive advantage relative to its peers. In an industry where growth is typically scaled on a per-client basis, AMTD's acquisition strategy has created the opportunity for AMTD to attract long-term investors with more diversified portfolios, opening the door for more stabilized asset-based revenue streams. In addition to building the foundation for those increased asset-based revenues, I believe recent market volatility along with the increased trading volume that it brings will be a net positive for AMTD. Overall I believe AMTD's growth in market share, along with growth in client assets will create positive tailwinds for AMTD moving forward.Client Assets Up along with Strong Performance from Retail and Institutional Segments:AMTD's efforts to further increase its spending on refining and integrating its acquisitions are yielding higher-quality new assets. AMTD continued to see strong improvements in both its institutional and retail segments with both businesses delivering year-over-year growth in net new assets for the eight consecutive quarter. As of the end of Q3'15, AMTD had $708 billion in client assets, with $161 billion of that in fee-based investment accounts, it added $11.7 billion in net new client assets in this quarter alone. With AMTD pursuing a strategy of stabilizing earnings through fee-based accounts, it is very encouraging to see positive growth like this quarter over quarter.Daily Trading Volumes are on the Rise:Much like an MLP that generates revenues through fees generated on volume, AMTD still generates a considerable amount of its revenues through commissions on trades. With the markets as volatile as ever, a business segment such as this that is usually the creator of erratic earnings could actually be the start for an upside surprise in earnings. AMTD reported an average 434,000 daily trades in its most recent quarter, a growth of 8% on a year-over-year basis with over 17% of that activity taking place on their mobile platform. AMTD's average commission declined by $0.53 resulting in approximately $14 million less in revenues but was offset by $25 million in incremental revenue due to an increase in the amount of trades per day. The variable commission amount charged on different accounts has a direct impact on earnings and is the driving force behind AMTD's strategic shift to increase asset-based feed revenues.Fastest Growing Segments with Long-Term Potential:AMTD reported an average balance of $155.7 billion for its Investment Products division, a 16% increase over last year. Revenues for this segment increased approximately 8% to $85 million, and accounted for roughly 11% of the company's net revenues year-to-date relative to 10% in the prior year's corresponding quarter. This segment is an important part of AMTD's strategic shift to increase asset-based revenues and it's encouraging to see slow but steady growth. With an increase in assets, AMTD is increasing the opportunity it has to generate more stabilized earnings, on an somewhat recurring-basis through mutual funds and it's proprietary programs such as Advisor Direct and Amerivest.Risks:This growth did not come cheap. AMTD's major expense line items consists of compensation, advertising and market development, and professional services. In Q3'15, the company incurred total operating expenses of $469 million dollars, an increase of about $22 million compared to this quarter last year. A major concern I can see with AMTD's strategy to continue what is essentially a land-grab for assets, would be the increased possibility to lose focus on cost management. The discount brokerage industry by nature is a highly competitive industry where expansion is usually achieved through massive marketing pushes, and any increase in advertising spend that doesn't yield a measurable ROI has the ability to significantly depress earnings and slow AMTD's overall expansion. On a positive note, expenses are down $38 million from the previous quarter as the company finished ramping up the heavy marketing push that was initiated in the first half of 2015. Management has addressed these concerns and remains committed to reducing costs, and has begun to tie headcount to growth initiatives in an effort to ensure that employee expenses should only rise as assets increase, ideally. Given this recent quarter's performance, AMTD seems to be executing on this strategy perfectly.Buybacks and Dividends:In addition to growing the business from an operating standpoint, management has done a fairly decent job of rewarding shareholders as well. AMTD has repurchased 125,000 shares of its common at an average price of $36.75 per share totaling $5 million. While no one can perfectly time the market, with the current share price around $31.46 I would obviously like to see management be a bit more tactical in it's share repurchases. While we wait for those share repurchases to have a larger effect on earnings, management has indicated its willingness to reward shareholders directly with a 25% increase in the dividend year-over-year to $0.15 per share, translating to an annualized yield of 1.7%.Valuation:I believe AMTD is currently undervalued on a forward earnings basis, with AMTD trading at 21x earnings relative to its peers trading at 25x. While AMTD has historically traded at a discount to its peers due to somewhat lower operating margins, I believe its shift to asset-based revenues along with its growth in assets, trading revenues, and growth in its investment products division should help increase that multiple more in line with its peers. On a trailing 12-month basis, AMTD is valued at a price-to-earnings ratio of 24x relative to the industry average of 40x. I have a price target of $40 dollars by the end of 2016 based on applying a forward P/E of 22.x to my FY 2016 EPS estimate of $1.80.Summary:Overall, I believe AMTD has identified and more importantly, is executing properly on its strategy to grow overall assets and begin shifting to a more management fee driven revenue streams. With the recent uptick in volatility along with the ongoing uncertainty in markets around the world, the potential for a positive earnings surprise due to an increase in commission-based trading fees is another benefit that can add upside potential to my $40 price target. Relative to its peers and its industry in general, I believe AMTD is a great investment at it's current price and could make for a positive addition to your portfolio going forward."
2324335,52262,2014-07-21T13:00:00-04:00,"Ameritrade shareholders are banking on the eventual return of more retail investors to the stock market.
        After several years of flat earnings, things seem to be looking up for the discount broker with new client assets flowing in.
        Commission revenues still have a lot of room to rise at the firm, and a calm macroeconomic environment for the next few years would help with that.","For better or for worse, concerns over new regulations on high-frequency trading are probably overdone, and investors in TD Ameritrade (NYSE:AMTD) can take solace in that fact. While Ameritrade and many of its fellow online brokerage peers have been affected by the torrent of negative news over the last few months related to high-speed trading, frankly investors have a long history in many different industries of getting worked up over the possibility of new regulations only to later discover that the regulations won't be nearly as onerous as feared. With that in mind, and given the high degree of probability that eventually individual investors will return to the stock market in large numbers, I think AMTD looks like an interesting opportunity for long-term investors on any sizeable pullback.TD Ameritrade's internet based discount brokerage services are built around helping individual investors (primarily active investors) and providing some services to institutional investors. Earnings at the firm are highly dependent on trading volumes and AMTD does face significant competition from the likes of Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) and Etrade (NASDAQ:ETFC), but I think there is room for all three firms to thrive over the next few years. The great recession was notable not only for its severity on both Main Street and Wall Street, but also for its duration. While equity values have risen dramatically over the last five years, they came off such a trough, that it took a long-time before stocks even reached new highs despite the fact that many companies are leaner, meaner, and more profitable than ever before.Given the duration and severity of the Recession it is little wonder then that individual investors are still quite gun shy about investing in the stock market again. Eventually though, and probably in a few years time as the economy picks up steam, this feeling should fade, and individual investors will once again return in droves. Reflecting the absence of these investors, AMTD's revenues are barely higher today than they were in 2007, and commission revenues are still lower than they have been in the past. This fact is despite the substantial population and wealth growth across America during the last decade, and the rise of high frequency trading (which has added to institutional revenues at the firm).This situation - a temporary but protracted downturn in business and near-term pressure on the stock due to nebulous regulatory worries are exactly the type of situation that a long-term investor in the space should be looking for. Research has shown that industries and businesses tend to move in cycles with those that underperformed in a given five year period often outperforming in future periods. And that bodes well for Ameritrade.To be fair, things have already started to turn up for the firm though. 2013 saw roughly 5% revenue growth YOY and 2014 should see at least as much, with monthly trading volumes up YOY as well. Combined with new client assets flowing in, the growth in trading of alternative investments like equity options, and improving overall retail sentiment, Ameritrade should start to see better earnings this year after several mostly flat years.In the 2Q2014, AMTD saw these positive trends continue with new client asset inflows of $12.2B, a bit below Q1's +$14.5B. The firm also executed ~30 million trades for clients, up 15% sequentially with an average number of client trades per account of 20.2 vs. 16 a year earlier. The quarter saw 30%+ growth in total trades, and 8% organic growth in new client assets If these trends hold, Ameritrade should be able to earn perhaps $1.45 this year versus $1.22 last year with operating margin expansion of maybe 400 bps. AMTD should also benefit from any increase in the yield curve as it will be able to earn better net interest margins on insured deposit account funds held for clients.The shift up in the yield curve will likely come into play in 2015 about the same time that I expect a significant recovery in retail investor sentiment to become obvious to the market. With these two factors backing AMTD, I expect the stock to make new all-time highs next year and probably for a year or two thereafter. Despite these positives, some caution is warranted here. Ameritrade is not particularly cheap right now, and the discount brokerage market is extremely competitive especially online. If a price war breaks out between brokers as retail investors return to the markets, then all bets are off for earnings at AMTD and its peers. I think the industry is now consolidated enough that this is unlikely to happen, but it is still a major risk that investors should be alert for.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

It is important to note that Ameritrade's fiscal year begins in October. The company reported double figure top-line growth as revenues grew significantly on a year over year basis. Revenue growth was able to trickle down to the lower levels as well. The company posted an impressive Q4 performance as revenues from assets along with trading commissions grew considerably. Ameritrade's share price fluctuated significantly over the course of the previous quarter, but showed an overall increasing trend. Share prices increased from $31.35 as at 30th June 2014 to $33.37 as at 30th September 2014, an increase of almost 6%. Share prices for Ameritrade currently stand at $33.71.

Revenue from the company's investment product feesincreased 24% over the previous year to $83 million. The company's top-line growth flowed down to the bottom-line as well which can be seen by its figures for EBITDA and Pre-tax income. EBITDA in the 4th quarter amounted to $394 million, which accounted for almost half of the company's net revenues. Pre-tax income amounted to $342 million and represented 43% of Ameritrade's net revenues for the quarter.

4025106,31561,2016-11-21T07:40:06-05:00,Russell 2000 up 11 consecutive days.Dollar up versus euro for 10 consecutive days.Micro-caps now provide most upside.Dodd Frank cause of Ferocious Micro-cap Bear Market.,"Small-cap stocks have been on fire and micro-caps will soon join the party. The Russell 2000, the U.S. index which is exclusive to the much smaller listed public companies advanced for eleven consecutive trading days from November 4 through November 18, 2016, when it closed at an all-time high. Over the period the Russell 2000 increased by 13.0% compared to the S&P 500's increase of 4.6%.There are two post-election developments which have caused the Russell 2000 to substantially outperform the S&P 500:1. U.S. dollar strength - The U.S. dollar has rallied sharply against all currencies since the election. It has advanced versus the Euro for the last ten consecutive days. The streak is the longest since the euro became Europe's primary currency in 1999. The dollar's strong rally has created a fierce headwind for the U.S.' large multinational companies, most of which are members of the S&P 500. Small companies do not have this headwind since most of their sales are generated in dollars and in the U.S.2. Fiscal Stimulus - Upon fiscal infrastructure stimulus being applied the U.S. economy will be better insulated against a global economic slowdown. The large multinational members of the S&P 500 are more susceptible to slowdown of the world economy than smaller companies. Infrastructure spending will have more of an impact on the U.S. centric smaller businesses than it will have on large multinational businesses.The chart below depicts that the Russell 2000 went back to historical premium above the S&P 500 after being at a discount for almost all of 2016. The chart also depicts that low priced shares and micro-caps remain deeply undervalued. This is even though the micro-caps are even better positioned to benefit from the strength in the U.S. dollar and fiscal stimulus than the small-caps. The micro-caps and companies with low share prices had tracked the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500 through 2012. The index consisting of low priced shares diverged to enter a ferocious bear market that was caused by the SEC's implementation of the Dodd Frank Act. Under Dodd Frank brokers became criminally liable for the first time in the history of the markets for recommending high risk shares to clients. Therefore, the brokers abandoned the micro-cap and low priced shares markets. Assuming that Dodd Frank is repealed as promised by Trump brokers will once again be able to recommend micro-cap and low priced shares companies. Regardless of whether or not Dodd Frank is repealed micro-cap shares have plenty of upside.The above price chart for the Royce Low Priced Stock, Russell 2000 and the S&P 500 indices also illustrates the wide divergence between the micro-cap and low priced stocks and the indices with the larger company members. This divergence is one of the five bubbles that I had discovered that could potentially cause a crash upon any of the bubbles bursting. See my article ""Five Super Bubbles Increase Market's Vulnerability to a Crash"", October 16, 2016. There is no current or historical rationale that supports such a wide divergence. The math does not support the shares of micro-cap companies trading at a deep relative discount to the shares of larger companies for an extended period of time. Micro-cap companies by their very nature can potentially grow by double digits in an economy which is declining. Larger companies are constrained by an economy's growth rate.The chart above which includes the Royce Low Priced and S&P 500 indices illustrates that upon a correction or crash happening the shares that recover and go to new highs the fastest are the low priced shares. After the dotcom (left red shaded area) and Lehman (right red shaded area) crashes the shares of small companies recovered quickly and significantly outperformed the S&P 500 for several years. Because there is a law of mathematics the gap between the S&P 500 and the low share priced and micro-cap companies will inevitably narrow. My prediction is that the S&P 500 will correct significantly to the downside while the shares of the low priced shares and micro-cap companies will spike upward. Another possible scenario is the shares of the small cap and micro-cap companies rallying significantly and outperforming for an extended period to catch up with the S&P 500. Under either scenario, low priced and micro-cap shares win.The video below entitled ""Crash! & 90/10 Crash Protection Strategy"" provides more details on why the market can potentially crash. It also provides more details about how and why low priced and micro-cap company shares will outperform large companies in crash and recessionary environments.One of my core areas of expertise throughout my 40 years in the markets has been to find micro-cap companies which have the potential to be ten baggers; shares of companies that have the potential to multiply by 10 times in price and produce long term capital gains.While conducting research during the second quarter of 2016, I discovered a recurring stock price chart pattern or theme for all of companies which had share prices below $5.00. The strikingly similar pattern was that their two to three year share price charts depicted an ""L"". A stock price chart depicting an L was an anomaly during the first 39 years of my career.The L illustrates a stock being on a cliff, falling straight down off the cliff and after hitting bottom, leveling out or flat lining for more than a year. With the vast majority of most of the companies with low priced shares having the same L pattern, I concluded that the market for small and micro-cap companies was the most undervalued throughout my 40-year career. After all, I had never seen such a phenomenon.My newest quest is to find and recommend the 100 best of the micro-cap companies as soon as possible. The video below entitled ""Diverging Markets Creating Rare Investing Opportunities"" provides details about the sense of urgency. Micro-cap shares are ridiculously undervalued and are now on the verge of their share prices multiplying quickly. The plan is to also provide continuous coverage and buy and sell price limit updates on every company recommended.For a company to be recommended its share price must have the potential to increase by at least 300% by 2020. To be among the 100 the company must have a business model that is capable of producing steady cash flow from operations (CFFO). The video below is about how I utilized my CFFO expertise to discover two low priced stocks. The share prices of both subsequently multiplied by 20 times in less than five years. One of the companies, Think or Swim/Investools was acquired by Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD).Below are five companies that I am adding to my recommendation list. They all have L chart patterns. Since they are all deeply undervalued my limit prices for all five are significantly higher than where their shares closed on November 18, 2016.Accelerize (ACLZ) with a market cap of $26 million has grown its revenue for three consecutive calendar years. Based on its trailing 12 month financials its revenue will again increase for its year ending December 31, 2016. More importantly, for the first time in its history the trailing 12 months of Cash Flow from Operations (CFFO) for this 100% digital company were positive. Based on its latest market cap ACLZ is at a deep discount since its trading at one times revenue. ACLZ is in the position to become the Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) of digital marketing. Company has a 41 year old CEO founder who is very bright and is a visionary.Live Ventures (NASDAQ:LIVE) with a market cap of $48 million has grown its revenue for three consecutive fiscal years. Based on its trailing 12 month financials the conglomerate's revenue will again increase for its year ending September 30, 2016. More importantly, after reporting negative CFFO for its last 3 fiscal years LIVE has produced positive CFFO for its last four consecutive quarters. Earlier this month LIVE announced that they had acquired a company for cash and debt that would take their revenue to $160 million and net income to $20 million ($1.21 per share). LIVE's business model is similar to Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK.B) and has 33 year old CEO who is extremely disciplined. He reminds me of Buffet.First Choice Healthcare Solutions (OTCPK:FCHS) with a market cap of $28 million has grown its revenue for the past three consecutive years. Based on its trailing 12 month financials the revenue for this provisioner of healthcare services in the U.S. will again increase for its year ending September 30, 2016. FCHS produced positive CFFO for its 2015 Calendar year. If it had not been for an accounting quirk ($9.2 million profit from the sale of a long term asset as a negative line item on its Cash Flow Statement) FCHS would have most likely reported record positive CFFO for its year ending December 31, 2016. The shares are now trading at one time sales and at two times tangible book which consists of current assets. It would not surprise me if FCHS utilized its cash to repurchase shares.Intellicheck Mobilisa (NASDAQ:IDN) with a market cap of $28 million is a pure play for the protectionist and illegal alien deportation policies to be implemented by the incoming new U.S. President. The company is a developer and seller of handheld and online identification systems which authenticate Drivers licenses and IDs, etc. IDN is not yet profitable and its CFFO has been steadily negative. However, IDN's gross margins increased significantly to 75% in its third quarter of 2016 from 66% for its fourth quarter of 2015. Additionally, based on comparisons of the company's 2016 third quarter with its last quarter of 2015, R&D and operating losses as a percentage of revenue declined significantly. Company recently announced that its newest product is capable of verifying the authenticity of drivers license via an online scanning. COPsync (OTC:COYN) with a market cap of $11 million has grown its revenue for three consecutive fiscal years. Based on its trailing 12 month financials its revenue will again increase for its year ending December 31, 2016. COYN is another pure play for the incoming new administration. The company developed and operates a real-time law enforcement mobile data information system in the U.S. It presently generates more than 85% of its revenue from Texas even though its penetrated only 9% of the state's municipalities. With Texas accounting for 2/3 of the U.S.'s Mexican border company is well positioned to increase its share in the state. Since the beginning of 2016 COYN has more than doubled the number of U.S. states which it has penetrated from eight to 18. The company has the weakest Balance Sheet and is burning more cash than any of the other four above companies. However, I am recommending it since I like growing automated services businesses that have a recurring revenue stream and very low attrition.The video interview below is about my finding an early stage private company and underwriting an IPO for the company when I was an investment banker. The company grew from less than $1 million to over $500 million in revenue and is presently listed on NASDAQ. The video is recommended since it explains the simple logic that I use to discover and recommend small fledgling companies.In SummaryDue to the plunge of the bond market and the spike in yields since the election the volatility and the risks to the downside have increased for large cap stocks. Until the bond market calms down and stabilizes all bets should remain off. Long-term positions for the following long-oriented ETFs, including the utilities sector ETF: (NYSEARCA:XLU), Dow 30 (NYSEARCA:DIA) and S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) should be avoided. The Dow 30 leveraged (NYSEARCA:DDM) and (NYSEARCA:UDOW) and the S&P 500 long ETFs (NYSEARCA:SSO), (NYSEARCA:UPRO), (NYSEARCA:VOO), (NYSEARCA:UUP), (NYSEARCA:IVV) and (NYSEARCA:IVE) have even more risk.Conversely, I am recommending that shares of the Royce Micro-cap Trust (NYSE:RMT) be accumulated. I am also recommending that Russell 2000 ETFs (NYSEARCA:IWM), (NYSEARCA:UWM), (NYSEARCA:URTY), (NYSEARCA:IWO) and (NYSEARCA:IWN) be held.For an overview about me and access to links to the subjects that I cover, including the digital economy, negative rates, perfect shorts, and micro-cap stocks please go to www.michaelmarkowski.net.

4015947,76105,2016-10-27T16:55:44-04:00,"TD just helped AMTD buy Scottrade.
        The deal expands both companies’ businesses in interesting ways.
        It’s a nice deal all around, over the long term.","Toronto Dominion Bank (NYSE:TD) recently agreed to help TD Ameritrade Holdings (NASDAQ:AMTD) buy privately held discount broker Scottrade. It's an interesting deal in many ways, but the bigger story is that Toronto Dominion appears to have helped craft yet another solid bolt-on deal.Moving partsThe real deal here is TD Ameritrade buying the brokerage assets of Scottrade. Since Toronto Dominion owns around 40% of TD Ameritrade, it clearly has a vested interest in seeing the discount broker succeed. Which has been something of an issue of late because of the shift toward index products and the expected industry upheaval from new rules that change the legal requirements of financial intermediaries. To put it simply, there's been less trading going on and the future is less certain than it was just a few years ago.That's bad for discount brokers who really earn their keep by letting people trade cheaply, as their name implies. Scale has become an increasingly important issue in the business. That's the basic reason why Scottrade decided to look for a buyer. The paired up companies will have assets of nearly $1 trillion and around 10 million accounts. That's notable scale in the industry, though still far behind Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), which has around $2.7 trillion in assets. Note that Scottrade was the smaller company in the deal, with just $170 billion in assets and around three million client accounts.That said, it's hardly surprising to see TD Ameritrade do a bolt on deal, which has been the way that 40% owner Toronto Dominion has chosen to grow in the United States. Moreover, if TD Ameritrade didn't step up, Scottrade would likely have ended up in the hands of a competitor. This deal, however, didn't get done without Toronto Dominion's help via its own bolt on acquisition. In this case, Toronto Dominion acquired Scottrade Bank.The bank deal wasn't huge, but it is slightly different from what Toronto Dominion would normally do. Essentially, Scottrade Bank services the banking needs of Scottrade's discount brokerage customers. That's different from the normal banking relationship that Toronto Dominion is used to. So it's probably best to view this deal as Toronto Dominion helping out TD Ameritrade more than anything else, at least for the moment.Two takeawaysOne aspect of the deal that will be interesting to watch is TD Ameritrade's absorption of Scottrade's physical store fronts. TD Ameritrade has around 100 locations while Scottrade has around 500. Although the goal is to close locations, at the end of the day the combined companies are expected to have 450 branches. That's a huge increase for TD Ameritrade and could give the company broader reach. At the very least, customer service will change, probably for the better. Watch this aspect of the deal closely, it could be bigger than you think. That's especially true if it allows the company to offer up more fee-based products, a business in which other brokers are growing more quickly.Toronto Dominion's acquisition, meanwhile, is also worth keeping an eye on. At some level it won't be more than a blip, and perhaps even a slight negative over the near term. On another hand, it shifts the company's focus a bit, broadening its exposure beyond the core East Coast region. That could give the company an entry into new markets. This is a big picture view of things, but it's worth keeping in the back of your mind. After all, growth for Toronto Dominion is going to be driven by expansion in the United States since its Canadian banking arm is really a mature business. The more visible TD Bank is outside of its core market, the more opportunity it creates for the future.The right playIn the end, Toronto Dominion appears to have done the right thing by helping TD Ameritrade buy Scottrade. It strengthens the broker's position, which helps Toronto Dominion, and it expands the bank's business a little. That includes increased exposure across the United States. I wouldn't expect this deal to move the needle for Toronto Dominion in the near term. In fact, it will probably be a slight negative for a bit. But the deal is important for its brokerage partner and that clearly helps Toronto Dominion. And if Toronto Dominion can leverage TD Ameritrade's new countrywide branch network over the long-term, well, all the better."
2063613,20568,2014-03-03T13:42:27-05:00,,"After a small hiccup, markets are again back on track with the S&P 500 now posting a modest gain for the first two months of the year. This quick rebound, coupled with the impressive stock market performance last year, is slowly beginning to draw more retail investors back to equities.This is especially the case as the 30-year bond bull market ends, producing losses in bond portfolios for the first time in memory. These losses in bond funds and the strong stock market are the catalyst for more retail interest in the space, which is undoubtedly great news for the online brokerage community which caters to this group.Companies in this space are seeing asset levels soar and trading orders rise too. This is greatly helping their bottom lines, and it is making an investment in the brokerages an intriguing idea, particularly if the current trends in the market continue. While there are a number of companies that focus on this market, one excellent option is TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD).AMTD in FocusTD Ameritrade is an Omaha based online broker, allowing retail investors to purchase and sell a variety of securities including stocks, preferred stock, mutual funds, ETFs and options, just to name a few. The firm has grown into a giant in the space, as it now has close to six million funded customer accounts with client assets approaching half a trillion dollars.As you might expect, TD Ameritrade makes a sizable amount of its revenues from commissions and with more interest in the market, the total amount of trades are soaring. However, AMTD actually makes just over half of its revenues from items like interest revenue and insured deposit account fees, and with investors piling capital into their online accounts, these revenues look likely to increase too.Thanks to this trend, AMTD has had an easy time in beating estimates at earnings season, beating by about 6% on average over the last four quarters. And with these trends likely to continue in the space, analysts have been raising their earnings estimates as of late, suggesting that the picture is definitely improving for AMTD.Earnings EstimatesIn the past two months, earnings estimates have been moving universally higher for AMTD. Not a single estimate in our consensus has gone lower in the time frame, including 11 estimates moving higher for the current year earnings, and eight moving higher for next year's earnings forecast.These revised estimates have pushed the current year consensus up from earnings of $1.34/share 60 days ago to $1.41/share today. Thanks to these moves, AMTD is now projected to have year-over-year earnings growth of 15% for the current year, and just under 20% growth for next year, meaning that the there is still plenty left in AMTD's growth story, and that if anything, it is only going to get better with time.Bottom LineDue to these factors, it shouldn't be too surprising to note that AMTD has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and that we are looking for outperformance from this company in the weeks and months ahead.And while the broad investment broker industry is highly ranked too, AMTD clearly stands out thanks to its growth trajectory, brand name and rising estimates, suggesting this firm is the crème of the crop in this important market segment.TD AMERITRADE (AMTD): Free Stock Analysis Report(email registration required)"
1351261,23479,2013-04-18T12:03:35-04:00,,"TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) reported on April 16 that its net revenue for the second quarter (quarter ended March 31) was $679 million, up 1% from the same period last year. The growth came primarily from investment products fees, which were up 34% y-o-y due to strong asset gathering activity during the quarter. The net interest revenue earned by the firm on client balances was also up by almost 7% on the back of an improvement in the average annualized yield earned on these balances. However, the company’s transaction based revenues continued to be a drag on the firm’s overall performance and experienced a 2% y-o-y decline as the total trades executed on Ameritrade’s platform decreased by over 5% y-o-y.The firm’s results are almost in line with our expectations and our current price estimate for the company is around $19.50. We will soon update our model to reflect all the information released in this earnings call.Asset Gathering Remains StrongAmeritrade continues to gather assets at an impressive pace. However, as predicted by us in our pre-earnings article, the net new asset performance for this quarter remained lower than the previous quarter’s figures. The company attracted a total of $13 billion in net new assets over this quarter, compared to the previous quarter’s tally of $16 billion.Nevertheless, the pace of Ameritrade’s asset growth is praiseworthy as the firm’s total client assets reached an important milestone in March when they crossed the $500 billion mark for the first time in the company’s history. [1]Specifically, a large portion of this quarter’s asset growth came from increases in Ameritrade’s fee-based investment balances, which were up by over 32% y-o-y and reached $105.7 billion at the end of 2Q13. We noticed the same thing in Charles Schwab’s (NYSE:SCHW) case and highlighted in our earnings review article on Schwab that the average balances in Schwab’s mutual funds and advice solutions (both are fee based products) increased y-o-y by 9% and 17%, respectively, in the first quarter of this year. This reaffirms our belief that the growth in advice led solutions is an industry wide phenomenon and will continue to drive the investment product fees higher at all brokerages that provide such services to their customers. Ameritrade’s revenue from investment product fees was up by almost 35% y-o-y in this quarter and reached $62 million.Trading Volumes Continue To Be A Drag As mentioned in our pre-earnings article, commission based revenues make up for around 40% of Ameritrade’s total revenues and account for nearly 30% of the value in the company’s stock. From that angle, it is important that this division performs well.However, the recent results suggest that Ameritrade’s trading based revenues continue to languish in the absence of a meaningful uptick in trade volumes, even though the average revenue per trade was up by $0.48 due to positive changes in trade mix. [2] Ameritrade’s transaction based revenues were down by almost 2% y-o-y to $287 million as the total trades executed on Ameritrade’s platform declined by over 5% y-o-y to 22.7 million.Going forward, we expect the firm’s transaction based revenues to remain depressed as “many investors hesitate to reenter the markets.” [2]Lower Expenses Are A PositiveOn the expense side, the company seems to have cut its expenses. The company’s total operating expenses are down by nearly 3% y-o-y, to $442 million in 2Q13 from $454 million in the same quarter last year. The expense cuts come primarily from lower professional services as the company continues to tightly manage its consulting and contractor spend as well as lower advertising costs.While lower expenses are generally a good thing, we will be closely watching the company’s earnings over the next few quarters to access if reduced advertisement spending has any impact on the rate of new account openings at the firm.Future ProspectsThe silver lining in the firm’s transaction based business’ performance was the impressive growth of mobile trading, albeit from a small base. In the word of Fredric Tomczyk, CEO of Ameritrade, “clients continue to embrace mobile as we average more than 2,500 new users per day in the quarter. Mobile trades at a record 31,000 per day, were up 25% year-over-year.” [2]We believe that this could be an important differentiator for the firm going forward and could lift the company’s trade based revenues disproportionately when trading volumes eventually recover.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"

Retail investors become so focused upon large banking institutions, that these smaller entities are often left somewhere in the wake. The goal here is to focus on TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation (NASDAQ:AMTD) and the positive indicators that are propelling this stock higher for investors.The Company TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation provides securities brokerage services and technology-based financial services to retail investors, traders, and independent registered investment advisors in the U.S. The company provides its services primarily through the Internet, network of retail branches, mobile trading applications, and interactive voice response and registered representatives via telephone. AMTD was founded in 1971 and its headquarters is in Omaha, Nebraska.What most investors know as today's TD Ameritrade started in 2006, when Ameritrade purchased TD Waterhouse USA from TD Bank Financial Group. This created one of the largest discount brokerages in the United States and the largest in terms of average client trades placed each day. In 2009, TD Ameritrade acquired the thinkorswim Group Inc., which was the fastest-growing brokerage at the time. This allowed the company to have access to innovative technology and sophisticated trading platforms. One end results was that the combination allowed TD Ameritrade to further expand its offerings for active traders by introducing complex options, futures and foreign exchange trading.With the onset of mobile devices and trading applications, AMTD provides investing and trading services for nearly six million client accounts.ManagementFred Tomczyk is the Chief Executive Officer and has served in that capacity since October 2008. Over that time, AMTD has delivered four consecutive years of double-digit annualized net new client asset growth, and grown the total assets to more than $500 billion.Marv Adams is the Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer where he oversees all IT and operations functions of the company. He has more than 30 years of operational and technology experience in the financial services industry. His prior work experience includes such companies as Fidelity Investments, Citigroup, Bank One Corporation and Ford Motor Company.Bill Gerber is the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. He has been with TD Ameritrade since 1999 and served as managing director of finance, where he played a major role in the merger and acquisition opportunities that the company has been through.Financials March 31, 2013 and 2012AMTD ended the second quarter of 2013 with relatively flat growth in net revenue and earnings. The company breaks its revenue out into three mains areas as identified below:Net revenue of $679 million was up 1% from $673 million in 2012. Commissions and transaction fees decreased 2% to $287 million, primarily due to decreased client trading activity. Asset-based revenues, which consist of net interest revenue, insured deposit account fees and investment product fees, increased 4% to $376 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2013. Other revenues decreased 16% to $16 million, due primarily to lower client education revenue, partially offset by increased fees from processing corporate securities reorganizations for the second quarter.Operating income dropped roughly 3% in the quarter and net income of $144 million was up 5% from $137 million in Q2 2012. Earnings per share calculated to $0.26. The total client assets were $517 billion and the total funded accounts were numbered at 5.9 million.Another positive trend for AMTD deals with the company's average client trades per day. The fourth quarter of 2012 showed the average trades to be roughly 328,000. Moving to the first quarter of 2013 saw growth as that number was 334,000. Finally the most recent second quarter of 2013 shows a figure of 378,000. That is a difference of 50,000 trades per day increase from Q3FY12 to Q2FY13.Balance SheetThe company ended the second quarter of 2013 with $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents, which was up 33% over the end of September 2012. Of course this was offset against a $150 million drop in the reported short-term investments. Total assets stand at $20.5 billion. Liabilities included standard current items and long-term debt of $16.1 billion. This is an increase from September 2012, by $1.02 billion, which is an increase of 15%.Dividends and Stock BuybacksATMD has declared a $0.09 per share quarterly cash dividend on its common stock during each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2013. The company also declared and paid a $0.50 per share special cash dividend on its common stock during the first quarter of fiscal 2013. AMTD paid a total of $372 million to fund the quarterly and special cash dividends declared during the first half of fiscal 2013.On October 20, 2011, AMTD's board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to 30 million shares of common stock. This was disclosed on November 18, 2011, in the company's annual report on Form 10-K. See below the current status of the buyback:Obviously the buyback has really yet to begin looking at the latest reporting. During the quarter ended March 31, 2013, 20,165 shares were repurchased from employees for income tax withholding in connection with distributions of stock-based compensationCompetitionThe table below (from Yahoo! Finance) shows AMTD's direct competitors which are E*TRADE Financial Corporation (NASDAQ:ETFC) and The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW). SCHW obviously has the largest market capitalization followed by AMTD and finally ETFC. SCHW shows it had higher quarterly revenue growth rates, but AMTD had the highest operating margin (0.36). AMTD's key measurements compare very well against its direct competitors when looking at its EPS of 1.07, while SCHW comes in at 0.69 and ETFC is reporting negative figures.All the stocks for these companies mentioned have been doing rather well as shown below with a comparison of the stock returns for each.Unique SituationsAfter the initial analysis, AMTD looks like a company that is operating like a well-oiled machine. A closer look finds something very interesting for investors. One key event was identified in June of 2013. At that point in time it seems 23,500 January 2015 $25 calls were purchased. There was also an equal-sized block of January 2015 18 puts and January 2015 $30 sold as well. Before the transaction there was almost no open interest at these strikes. Any option trader knows that this is an extremely bullish position for the stock. Since that time the open volume has only gotten bigger as the positions have nearly doubled in size as shown below on the option chains dated 7/8/2013:This huge anomaly, or outlier, is definitely worth noting. While not a guarantee for success, this large option position is a vote of confidence by larger investors that the stock price for AMTD will continue its rise.ConclusionTD Ameritrade offers investors some compelling information that supports its investment thesis. The industry it exists in is doing rather well as shown by the charts above. Huge bullish call buying has been in play since early June 2013. Finally the company's market-fee-based revenues and average client trades per day have been steadily on the increase. AMTD is a stock that investors should consider.Disclosure: I am long AMTD.

3824776,22148,2016-01-21T12:14:23-05:00,"TD Ameritrade posted solid FQ1 earnings though only stable with prior periods.The online brokerage will benefit extensively from interest rate hikes, if the hikes actually occur.The recommendation is to use dips and negativity regarding rate hikes as an opportunity to buy this stock.","With the recent dip in the stock price, TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) becomes an interesting way to play a rebound in the stock market. The online brokerages have produced meager results in the last few years in part due to low-interest rates and that environment could change in the next year.The quarterly results beat estimates, but the stock now trades at lows as expected rate hikes this year start to disappear. The stock is now at $28, down from $38 in early November when rate hike expectations were rampant.The primary reason that rate hikes matter is that Ameritrade gets over $380 million per quarter in spread related revenue. The amount is a large piece of the $812 million generated for Q4. The interest revenue is big part in why the brokerage generates operating margins of 42%.Whether this lasts or not in this volatile market, Ameritrade increased the interest rate sensitive assets by 9% over the last year. The combination of more rate hikes and higher asset balances sets the online brokerage to drive earnings higher.The primary methods are from an immediate hike in the margin lending rate on January 1 and earning higher rates on interest earning assets while the client gets paid the same rate. The below slide highlights the benefits of higher rates to the company. A 25 basis point hike like in December adds $0.08 to $0.12 to EPS over the next year.Source: TD Ameritrade FQ1'16 presentationClearly Ameritrade is one of the best ways to play a rising rate environment. The online brokerage has successfully increased the asset base while awaiting for the eventual rate hikes.The only major problem to the bullish scenario is that the Federal Reverse might not actually hike rates this year. At the same time, the turmoil caused in the market by the suggestion of rate hikes will hurt the transaction based business and reduce asset balances.Investors shouldn't chase the stock on rate hike expectations, but the recent slump likely provides a great opportunity to wait out the eventual rate hikes. Without rate hikes, Ameritrade is solidly profitable and can continue using excess cash to repurchase shares and pay the 2.3% dividend. With rate hikes, the company will see earnings surge and push the stock higher.The recommendation is to buy TD Ameritrade on dips."

But while opportunity exists, it is important to consider  whether the company can really differentiate itself this way. RIAs seem  to be a trend among other online brokerages and financial services firms  too, like E-Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC), Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).Our price estimate for Ameritrade is $22.65, roughly 10% above market price.Understanding the Concept of an RIARIAs provide investment advice to investors to help them decide which  type of investments would best serve their short-term and long-term  investing goals. The term ‘registered’ comes from the fact that such  investment advisors are registered with the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC).RIAs normally deal with high net-worth individuals (HNIs) or  institutional investors. In return for their services, they charge an  advisory or management fee. The fee is normally around 1% of the value  of the assets managed by the RIA, although the rate can decline for  higher asset values.The Relationship Between RIAs and Online BrokeragesOnline brokerages traditionally compete on factors like commissions  & fees, types of investment products offered, research & advice  for investors, and customer service. But as industry demands force  brokerages to offer a one-stop shop for retail investment, these firms  are becoming more and more alike.RIAs contribute to the strength of an online brokerage’s research and  advice capabilities. The information an online brokerage has about its  customers’ investment appetite and trading history allows it to act as  an intermediary between a particular customer and an RIA that would best  suit that customer. This makes the hunt for an investment advisor  easier for a customer, while the brokerage firm earns revenue from the  RIAs – normally as a percentage of RIA advisory fees.(Chart created by using Trefis' app)How RIA’s Can Lift Ameritrade’s ValueAmeritrade provides personalized investment advisory services under the trade-name AdvisorDirect, [1] and any RIA interested in being recognized under AdvisorDirect is require to register with Ameritrade.As the battle for new customers continues, we believe that an  increasing focus on RIAs could give Ameritrade an edge in this regard. A  nominal 5% increase in Ameritrade’s online customers over our base  forecasts would add about 2% to our $22.65 price estimate for the company’s stock.(Chart created by using Trefis' app)This increase would, in turn, raise the value of interest-earning  assets held by Ameritrade as well. If the value of these assets also  increases by 5% over our base forecasts, it would add another 2% upside  to the company’s stock value.The combined 4% in stock value from these two scenarios would push our price estimate just above $23.50.See our full analysis for Ameritrade hereDisclosure: No positionsNotes:"

The popularity of options  comes from the concept that the buyer of an option does not have the  obligation to complete the asset transaction. The buyer essentially  holds a right to complete the trade if it is profitable.Standardized options contracts are listed and traded at various  futures and options exchanges around the world. With the number of  retail investors exploring options trading along with normal equity  trading on the rise, all online brokerage firms allow investors to  undertake options trading. This works out to the advantage of the  brokerage firms, as they normally charge higher commissions for  executing options trades.Ameritrade in the GameAmeritrade, like its competitors, provides customers with a platform  to trade in options contracts. In fact, option trades accounted for 21%  of total trading volumes in the December quarter for 2009. [1]  While the company charges $9.99 per equity trade, the commissions for  options trading include an additional $0.75 per options contract on top  of the $9.99 fee. [2] The structure does not actually put Ameritrade in position to gain much from investors’ increased interest in options trading.However, Ameritrade’s options trading offerings are priced  substantially higher than that of almost all its competitors.  Competitors like OptionsHouse and TradeKing allow customers to trade in  options while charging less than half the commissions and fees. [3] Their services, notably, are not as diversified as Ameritrade’s offerings.But Competitive Pressures will Drive Trading Commissions Lower in the Near FutureOnline brokerages have been waging a price war for quite some time,  due to commoditization of their trading offerings. Although the giants  in this industry like Ameritrade, Charles Schwab and E-Trade provide a  larger range of trading options for investors, the significant price gap  between the smaller online brokerages will likely force fees down south  in the near future.(Chart created by using Trefis' app)See our full analysis and $22.65 price estimate for AmeritradeWe estimated that Ameritrade’s average revenue per trade will decline  from its current level of $12.6 to nearly $11 by the end of our  forecast period. However, should Ameritrade slash its fees for options  and other futures trading, which made up 30% of all trades in 2010, it  could potentially reduce this average revenue per trade to just above $9  by the end of our forecast period.

The Street currently rates the former a ""hold"" and the latter a weak ""buy"". Based on my multiples analysis and DCF model, I agree with this sentiment.From a multiples perspective TD Ameritrade is the cheaper of the two. It trades at a respective 14.3x and 12.4x past and forward earnings with a dividend yield of 1.5%. Charles Schwab trades at a respective 16.4x and 13.9x past and forward earnings with a dividend yield of 2.1%. Both firms are 30% more volatile than the broader market.At the first quarter earnings call, TD Ameritrade's CEO, Fred Tomczyk, noted the business environment:Then came the Fed's announcement and the report that US GDP grew by only 2.8% for the fourth quarter. Ultimately, this will have a very meaningful impact on yield-driven sales for both TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab, hence the major estimates revisions. With that said, TD Ameritrade has a strong brand and a market that is uniquely focused on taking long-term positions. First quarter results featured earnings growth of 4.8% y-o-y and a 7.1% sequential decline. With limited control over the economic and political headwinds, management is likely to focus more on mitigating its cost base. The firm is targeting a capital allocation policy that returns upwards of 60% of earnings back to shareholders.Consensus estimates for TD Ameritrade's EPs forecast that it will hold flat in 2011, grow by 17.1% to $1.30 in 2012, and then by 20.8% more in 2013. Of the 19 revisions to estimates, all have gone down for a net change of -4.2%. Modeling a CAGR of 12.3% for EPS over the next three years and then discounting backwards by a WACC of 9% yields a fair value figure of $19.94, implying 23.8% upside.Charles Schwab similarly faced negative earnings revisions with all 178 down for a net change of -7.3%. Fourth quarter EPS of $0.13 was roughly in-line with expectations. The conclusion of the year featured a notable rise in NNAs to $10.5B in December, but revenues still declined by 6% sequentially. MBS prepayment was faster than expected and non-comp costs climbed 5% higher sequentially. Charles Schwab netted 42K more brokerage accounts during the quarter.Consensus estimates for Charles Schwab's EPS forecast that it will decline by 2.9% to $0.68 in 2012 and then grow by 22.1% and 30.1% in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 16x and a conservative 2012 EPS of $0.80, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $12.80, implying 9.9% upside.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

2225303,49501,2014-05-20T09:01:11-04:00,"TD Ameritrade has gotten itself into deep trouble by selling retail investor order flow to an HFT hedge fund.Higher net interest margins will likely take 2 years or so to meaningful impact EPS, and even then, the upside is limited.Regulators will be pushed by the populace to act against market predators.","Barron's recently wrote a bullish piece on TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD), the Omaha-based discount broker, alleging the shares are oversold and there is substantial upside from NIM (Net Interest Margin) growth with the advent of rising rates. This is a thesis that may has been popularized for the big discount brokers Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) and E-Trade (ETFC) as they sit on large deposits of client assets. However, Barron's errs in their analysis, as I will argue, rate increases will take time to hit EPS. Also, this EPS boon is likely already priced in, as the discount BDs trade with PEs north of 25, well above their brokerage peers. However, and far more importantly, AMTD has for years been aiding and abetting the legal front running of retail investors by selling order flow to a prominent hedge fund. This has gone unnoticed until recently, and was characterized exceptionally well in Michael Lewis' new book Flash Boys. Ameritrade will pay dearly for this, as it has sold out literally millions of unsuspecting retail customers to the ""big bad hedge fund"".I won't delve deeply into AMTD's business model. It offers a discount brokerage service, and I suspect many Seeking Alpha readers and contributors are its customers. Its product appeals to ""active traders"", offering clients bells and whistles, including complex charting and analytic tools. AMTD gives its customers the impression they can utilize its platform to receive an ""edge"" in the marketplace. In reality, AMTD provides a massive hedge fund (Citadel) with a means of profiting in a riskless fashion, versus its retail customer base, by legally front-running them (more on that later).AMTD is in the business of collecting revenue based on transactions, which accounts for about 42% of revenues. 17% of revenues are derived from net interest margins, defined as the spread between what its capital costs are (say on deposits) and what it lend it out at (say, to other customers on margin). As interest rates have been quite low since 2009, its NIMs have been compressed. Interestingly enough, AMTD has, in many instances, had to waive fees on money market accounts to prevent the customer from receiving a negative net yield.AMTD trades at 22x tangible earnings; Schwab is at 28, E-Trade at 40. Even if NIMs were to double (highly unlikely, as I would expect rates to remain essentially flat for at least another two years), the direct impact on EPS would only be about $0.23, or 15%. Given this, I am led to believe that the EPS tailwind for AMTD and the other discount BDs is priced in.All that aside, however, AMTD has gotten itself into a bit of a pickle by allowing Citadel to front-run its customers. One analyst estimated that approximately 8% of AMTD's revenues came from Citadel, another estimate was approximately $220M annually.When Citadel receives order flow from AMTD, it has the ability to make a killing manipulating the orders to its benefit, using a whole slew of predatory HFT strategies. For instance, a customer may place an order to buy one share of Apple at the market, and Citadel will buy the share in a dark pool at a discount and sell it back to the customer at premium. So long as the price given to the customer is at or below the NBBO (National Best Bid or Offer), it's all legal. One can only imagine how many millions of dollars investors have gotten shafted out because of this; AMTD sends out about 400,000 trades a day.In a rising rate environment, I would prefer to own the money center banks and full service BDs. They are able to capture upside on rising interest rates as well. The key risk here is principal risk in the fixed income market. As the large banks and BDs, think Citi (NYSE:C), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) are market makers in the fixed income space, they are prone to take a shellacking if the F.I. instruments they own get beaten down in value.The lawsuits are beginning to pile up against the players in predatory HFT. The city of Providence, RI, notably just sued everyone and their mother for their involvement.Here is what they claimed:AMTD's day of reckoning is coming. As incompetent and senile as most regulators may be, they will not be able to resist the public uproar to punish a company that has so maliciously placed small, unsuspecting retail investors in a barrel to be shot by the machines controlled by a massive hedge fund, whose founder is worth over $5B.This will not end well. In the interim, I would advise that AMTD is Uninvestable. If the stock should pop higher, I may seek an attractive short entry point.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in AMTD over the next 72 hours.

253337,24175,2011-02-16T18:46:22-05:00,,"OverviewRecovering equity markets and increasingly optimistic expectations for economic recovery have helped push shares of TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) higher as the online site attracts record high assets from retail and institutional investors. Total client assets recently reached an all time high of $395 billion last quarter, a 2% monthly increase from December, helped by estimated inflows of $2-$3 billion. Retail trading activity was strong, although at least partially helped by seasonal trends, reporting an increase of 25% in January from December. Also, as client confidence continues to grow stronger, margin balances increased 7% last quarter. Surprisingly, trading activity only paints part of the picture for AMTD considering less than half, 45%, of revenue is derived from commissions and transactions fees. This form of revenue is expected to continue to represent a declining percentage of total revenue going forward. Insured deposit account fees are the second largest revenue driver at 27% of the total, while net interest revenues are 18%, investment product fees represent 6%, and the remaining 4% are from other various business activities.Increased volatility in the equity markets and a period of sustained optimism have been a positive catalyst for AMTD shares over the last six months. However, near zero interest rates have been a serious headwind to profitability. The steepening of the yield curve has been helpful, but until the Fed starts to raise rates again, AMTD will not realize its full earnings potential. A Credit Suisse report indicated that for every 25 bps rise in the Fed Funds Rate, AMTD is likely to gain an incremental $0.07 of EPS. (EPS for the last fiscal year were reported at $1.05 per share.)While the Credit Suisse report indicated the helpful impact of future rate increases, they are not expecting an event to occur until the 2013 calendar year. This is where I believe expectations are too modest. Given the recent inflationary backdrop in the worldwide financial media, I believe that rate increases will take place sooner than 2013 to combat inflation in the United States. The sooner the increases take place, the more likely the upside surprise will be for EPS. However, this scenario could occur, and still not provide a positive outcome. Should inflation come too fast unexpectedly, corporate profitability could be negatively affected resulting in a relapse of fear for the investment community, causing investors to withdraw assets.Although the short and intermediate term outlook and subsequent consequences for AMTD are uncertain, the long term outlook remains attractive. With a mostly fixed cost structure, AMTD is poised to increase profitability margins as the company continues to grow. The balance sheet has $1.4 billion in cash compared to $1.3 billion of long term debt and is a strong cash flow producer. The company recently repurchased 3.2 million shares last quarter and has approximately 27 million shares left in their current repurchasing program. Also, AMTD paid its first dividend, $0.05 per share, to shareholders two quarters prior.Overall, the AMTD business model is very attractive; however, there are two noteworthy risks. First of all, price competition in the online investment brokerage world will always be a risk. Should a competitor choose to offer significantly lower fees for trades than AMTD or offer competitive rates for insured deposits, revenue would be negatively affected in a severe way. Another slightly worrisome characteristic of AMTD is that 40% of shares are owned by Toronto Dominion Bank, while another 15% are owned by the Ricketts family. This automatically puts all other shareholders in the minority, which leaves them subject to the interests of these two parties.ValuationShares of AMTD have rallied over 44% since the end of August 2010, outperforming the S&P 500 by over 17%.The rallying equity market has brought excitement back into the shares of AMTD, but the consensus estimates for EPS for the upcoming calendar years of 2011 and 2012 have actually been pressured lower as the stock has climbed higher. The stock now trades at 18x forward EPS, which is at the high range of where the stock has traded over the last four years.The intrinsic value of AMTD is $24.50 based off internal valuation models, which is 14.5% higher than the closing price on 2.15.2011 of $21.38. The one year target price is $29. These values were found after assuming an average annual revenue growth of 9.5% over the next five years and operating margins expanding to 47% from the 2010 levels of 37%. (Operating margins were 48.5% in 2009 and 52% in 2008.) The terminal value five years out was derived by using a 16x trailing EPS multiple. This multiple was chosen because of the long term EPS growth expectations of 10-%11% and strong cash flow generation which will be used for share repurchases and also an increased dividend payout.While the most opportune moment to buy shares of AMTD may have passed, there still appears to be some upside from the current price. Perhaps a better window of opportunity will present itself in the near future, but AMTD’s sound business model and profitability outlook make it a solid name to own for the long term even at current valuations.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
229237,20502,2010-10-10T06:02:10-04:00,,"The ETF free commission price war heated up some more. TD Ameritrade is offering free commissions on 101 ETFs selected by Morningstar. But there is a little catch! Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) will be copying an idea from the mutual fund industry, and will be charging a $19.95 exit redemption fee for any ETF holding held less than 30 days. (Note: Some articles and media reports have incorrectly reported this fee as $9.95).Let’s say you purchase five lots of an ETF, and need to sell your entire position in less than 30 days from the first lot purchase. You will be hit with a $100 commission (actually $99.75).Be careful- Ameritrade will be using LIFO (last-in first-out) to determine if any lot exceeds the 30 day period. So if you buy 100 shares of an ETF, hold it a year, then buy  a second lot of 100 shares and sell it in less than 30 days, you will still be hit with the $19.95 fee.Some other key points:I think it is great that Ameritrade has joined the free ETF commission community, but I am quite concerned that their ETF exit redemption fee “concept” may be adopted by other brokerage firms that already offer free ETF trading (Schwab, Fidelity, Vanguard), and that the exit redemption fee period could start creeping up from 30 days to 90 days or even 180 days. This would greatly reduce the attractiveness of using ETFs in tactical allocation models.I read an article saying that Ameritrade’s earnings would not be greatly affected by introducing free ETF commissions, because this is currently a fairly small percentage of their commission revenues. But there is a possibility that as time goes on, more investors and financial advisors will sharply reduce trading in individual equities and move almost exclusively to free ETF trading.Many discount brokerage firms also make significant revenues from customer money held in near-zero interest money market accounts. Some of this revenue may also be lost as customers invest money in low risk fixed income ETFs instead of leaving more funds in cash. It will be interesting to see if this actually happens or if inertia wins out. I think Ameritrade is betting on inertia.I wonder how long it will take for Scottrade and E-Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) to join the free ETF commission party. My guess is they will be forced to do so within the next year."

Since '00, not so much - except for a few pockets of outperformance.But on the other hand, I doubt over the long term many folks who don't put a ton of time, and have a passion for it will succeed on their own i.e. I might not be happy with the job the auto mechanic did, but if I gave it a try, I would promptly destroy the engine. The last time I read such stories below of massive influx of retail traders was 1999 - a lot of cab drivers and hair dressers were completely slapping the market silly. That didn't work out so well within a year or two. It will be interesting to see how this era turns out.Via the WSJ:[Apr 2, 2009: WSJ - Individual Investors Pile Into Citigroup]Student body left... student body right. Rinse. Wash. Repeat.

ThinkorSwim has ranked as the #1 or #2 software-based online broker and ""best for options traders"" by Barron’s for the past three years. The company has a best in breed trading platform with a differentiated approach to customer service (customer service staff comprised primarily of former Chicago Board of Options Exchange floor traders). Further, 80% of its daily average revenue trades are derived from the fastest growing and most recurring (think monthly expirations) source of retail trading: equity options. ThinkorSwim’s existing account base has higher than average balances and trades more frequently than its peer group.Despite these positive attributes, and others such as the highest revenue growth rate for the brokerage sector, and the lowest new account acquisition costs, ThinkorSwim trades at a significant discount to its peer group.click to enlarge imagesThe revenue multiple disconnect shown above is supported by a cheap absolute valuation of the company which when including our forward cash flow estimates trades for only 4.0x our 2010 earnings estimate, or a 25% free cash flow yield. The analysis below simplifies ThinkorSwim’s income statement by reducing the education division’s sales and expenses into a single line item which reflects net marketing expenses created via investor education. Cash balance builds in 2008 and 2009 assuming no cash income taxes are paid due to a large net operating loss carryforward. Cash and book taxes are assumed to be 40% in 2010.ThinkorSwim Group includes two divisions: 1) a retail brokerage, ThinkorSwim, and 2) a legacy investor education business that offers retail investor education products and workshops. The company’s education unit, once a profitable standalone business, now serves as an attractive customer acquisition vehicle which results in extremely low customer acquisition cost.During 2007, the ThinkorSwim brokerage unit acquired new accounts at a profit, when given credit for the education division earnings. The chart below demonstrates ThinkorSwim’s customer acquisition cost advantage versus its competitors.  When the brokerage marketing budget is combined with the substantial education marketing budget, the combined marketing power of ThinkorSwim exceeds that of its competitors and is comparable to brokerages 10x larger (by market capitalization).By deploying a relatively large marketing budget effectively and garnering more brokerage accounts, we expect the market capitalization gap between ThinkorSwim and its peers will narrow over time. See the chart below.The large marketing spend continues to pay off in new account growth. During the month of April 2008, ThinkorSwim opened a record number of net new accounts of approximately 9,650. This figure is significantly greater than the 5,400 net new accounts opened by OptionsXpress which carries a market capitalization of more than twice ThinkorSwim.The charts below demonstrate ThinkorSwim’s account and trading volume growth relative to its peer group.The investor education unit is simply not well understood by the investment community and up until now has held back the company’s share price. Wall Street is focused on the declining profitability of the education unit and the informal SEC investigation.Despite its perceived flaws as a standalone business, the education unit is a valuable strategic asset as a customer acquisition tool for the ThinkorSwim brokerage. The doom and gloom spread by Wall Street analysts after the company’s first quarter results has been an overreaction. Losses at the education unit in the first quarter totaled only $3.5M on an operating basis. The degradation of the education unit’s profitability reflects intentional price reductions by management in order to garner more potential brokerage customers. While profits at the unit are still possible, the investment community should view any losses at the unit as an inexpensive investment in new customer acquisitions.Since education revenues help offset a significant marketing spend, greater awareness for ThinkorSwim brokerage is created than would otherwise be possible. For example, if the education unit spends $80 million annually on marketing while generating a $10 million net loss due to education revenues, ThinkorSwim accrues the benefit from most of the $80 million marketing budget while costing the company a mere $10 million. More significant losses at the education unit are unsustainable long term because the cost structure of investor education is primarily composed of variable marketing expenses, which can be shifted to more productive marketing channels if necessary. Significant cost cutting is already underway within the education unit and we understand that some 50 – 100 employees have already been let go.No matter the profitability of the education division in the future, there will always be skeptics on ThinkorSwim Group who will say the education product is not worthy of its price. We have attended several of ThinkorSwim’s seminars over the past two years and have found them informative and insightful, especially with regard to options and technical analysis. We believe the non-professional investor will increase their knowledge tremendously from taking classes. Will all attendees and graduates become multi-millionaires? No. But most women that purchase and adorn Victoria’s Secret lingerie won't be mistaken for supermodels Gisele Bundchen or Heidi Klum either. That does not make the Victoria Secret product less desirable or relevant.Finally, the outcome of the informal SEC inquiry is difficult to quantify. However, at the current share price we believe the market has fully discounted worst case scenarios. ThinkorSwim Group appears to be taking the appropriate action with regard to certain employees, and the reorganization that is already underway will give the ThinkorSwim brokerage more control over the educational classes and content.ConclusionWe believe the company is extremely undervalued. The ThinkorSwim brokerage should generate over $235 million of revenues in 2009. Slower growing brokerage comparables trade at price to sales multiples of 4.4x to 5.6x. Given ThinkorSwim’s aforementioned competitive advantages and superior growth rate, we believe the company’s shares should be valued at the high end of the comparables range which would yield a $20 share price or some 150% upside from current levels. The 25% free cash flow yield on our 2010 enterprise value provides more than an adequate margin of safety, even if our projections are materially off.Notably, our forecast does not assume we are entering another bull market. We would expect further upside to the company’s share price and our forecast whenever the next bull market begins. Upside would be derived from the following factors:These events could result in a stock price well above our $20 price target.Disclosure: David Makula manages accounts that hold this position long."

Aside from the bad news revenue was up 66 percent and ahead of
estimates driven by Think or Swim. I think their product Investools is
a little exploitative. The only reason I'm actually looking at the
stock here is because of Think or Swim. It is their brokerage business
they bought just over a year ago and it is doing extremely well.
Revenue at Think or Swim was up 109% year over year. The board has even
approved that Investools change the name of the company to Think or
Swim. This is going to happen by year end according to their conference
call. The opportunity in this sector is a historic transfer of
wealth that is occurring as baby-boomers are retiring. For the
brokerages, I think poor conditions in the US stock market might be
off-set by this huge populations of individuals managing their own
money. Think or Swim's business has been gangbusters regardless. That
macro story isn't even the play I'm looking at here with SWIM. This
kind of over-reaction can be an investors dream because the uncertainty
is high with this SEC inquiry but the risk of buying Investools at a
big discount is probably very small. The fear in the market creates
buying opportunities. The deal I'd like to see here is if the stock
falls to below a conservative value of the Think or Swim segment
itself. The SEC trouble could be a thing of the past in months and
Think or Swim will have new accounts opening up every day. Think or
Swim is also sponsoring CNBC's big stock picking contest and has a big ad campaign. The
whole company sells for around $540 million right now in the $8 a share
range. I figure Think or Swim is worth conservatively $6 to $8 a share
based on last years revenue of $110 million. The $6 to $8 a share is
based on a multiple of only 4 times sales. TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) goes for
around 5 times sales, OptionsXpress (NASDAQ:OXPS) 5.9, and Charles Schwab
(NYSE:SCHW) is selling for about 5 times sales. I have mixed feelings about
their Investools but below $7 a share SWIM looks hard to pass up. Full disclosure: no position in any stocks mentioned."

Planning for retirement probably seems like a more daunting task than ever, so many financial services companies have developed online tools to help investors of all ages determine how to reach individual retirement savings goals. The benefits are twofold – investors receive quick retirement planning insights while financial services companies can use their various tools to help promote specific financial products.Fidelity myPlan Snapshot: Fidelity’s myPlan Snapshot combines simplicity and speed. It can be completed in less than a minute with information that most individuals know off hand (e.g. age, annual income, monthly savings). Once an individual reaches the summary page (below) they are able to see where their current savings and investment track will likely put them financially once they reach retirement age, even taking into account possible future market conditions. Using the interactive slider bars, an individual can easily run through hypothetical scenarios to see how increased monthly savings or a change in investment strategy will impact future returns.TD Ameritrade’s Wealth Ruler:TD Ameritrade’s (NASDAQ:AMTD) Wealth Ruler is a similar retirement tool to MyPlan Snapshot but with a more in-depth and detailed setup. With a similar output as MyPlan (see below), it also allows for measured adjustments based on savings, retirement age, and investing style. However, while myPlan asks five basic questions, users of Wealth Ruler are asked to input each investment product they own as well as input expenses that will likely be incurred over the long haul. While these features likely make it a more precise representation of future savings, it is definitely not as simple as Fidelity’s myPlan Snapshot.Vanguard: Instead of constructing a stand alone tool such as Fidelity’s or TD Ameritrade’s, companies like Vanguard have created tools that are integrated within information-focused pages. There is very little information required to use this tool, but the tradeoff is receiving little information in return. Tools like this also do not allow for contingencies such as a change in retirement age or projections based on certain market conditions. It seems clear that companies that provide calculators of this variety are not using them as tools to drive conversion. They are more likely viewed as additional research provided to current and potential customers.With the varied tool offerings, the question remains – Are the tools an effective way to drive business? And the answer is a resounding Yes; IRA shoppers that used an online retirement tool between January and June 2008 were 50% more likely to start an application than those who did not use a tool.Stand alone tools such as Fidelity’s tend to be more successful at engaging shoppers than those tools used simply as another information source. In the future, it would be even more impactful if companies were to provide more comparative measures to help benchmark their products against the competition. Implementing the use of similar tools could make a powerful statement and gain a competitive advantage for the financial services company in a time when they likely need any edge they can get."

54509,20479,2007-11-16T05:42:15-05:00,,"INVESTools (SWIM), according to their most recent 10-k calls themselves ""a leader in investor education,"" helping users achieve their goals by using the ""INVESTools method."" The company consists of four subsidiaries including ZiaSun, Telescan, and SES Acquisition Corp., and Prophet Financial Systems. INVESTools recently acquired retail broker Think or Swim, rated highly by Barron's (.pdf), for what that is worth. Business Strategy The company's business strategy raises concern, and their products are gimmicky and misleading. INVESTools products and services are built around ""a 5-Step Investing Formula that is designed to teach both experienced and beginning investors how to approach the stock selection process and actively manage their investment portfolios."" The stated end goal for INVESTool customers is to ""take control of their financial futures,"" just like every other infomercial I have seen. Investools courses range from a basic 5-step course to the laughable ""Master Investor Program,"" and ""Program of High Distinction."" However, if INVESTools customers are truly interested in learning about financial markets instead of falling victim to another get rich quick infomercial, why don't they sign up for a course at their local university, consider a career change to the financial services industry, or visit their local library, which costs nothing. INVESTools' management team should not kid themselves into thinking that their product is somehow unique, special, or proprietary. Sources of Revenue According to the company's 10-k, revenue comes from (i) the initial sale of the company's products and services as a result of marketing efforts across multiple acquisition channels which include, but are not limited to, television, print, postal mail, radio, online banner, paid and organic search and email direct marketing campaigns driving customers to either a free preview of investor education products offered at locations near the prospect or the opportunity to speak with a telesales representative about the products offered; and (ii) the additional sale of products and services to graduates as a result of continued interaction with us in workshops, periodic email and direct mail communications and through access to coaches and instructors. In a nutshell, revenues for the INVESTools' segment come from continued marketing efforts. Holes in the INVESTools Story I believe that when the company's customers start to realize that this product does not work after several diligent efforts to get rich quick with INVESTools, the company's business model will crumble. The large increase in earnings growth is mainly a result of the ThinkorSwim acquisition in February, which provided $32.586 million during Q307 in additional revenue, and increased revenue for nine months ended September 30, 2007 of $69.441 million, with both increases coming from an easy comp base of zero. Comps for the investor education segment were actually down yoy Q307 by 20%, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2007 were down by 13%. Bottom Line With what appears to be growth mainly from the ThinkOrSwim acquisition, the quality of INVESTools' earnings must come into question. Although ThinkOrSwim may be a viable brokerage business, management needs to divest or liquidate their investor education unit and focus on the ThinkOrSwim segment, or risk wasting valuable resources on basically an infomercial business that is not viable long term. Management's exit strategy should be to continue to grow ThinkOrSwim before selling out to a strategic acquirer such as TD Ameritrade due to the intense competition and commoditization in the brokerage industry. However, this appears unlikely based on CEO Mr.Lee Barba's comments to SeekingAlpha.com contributor Joseph Citarella. With a fairly successful career on Wall Street managing the global trading business of Banker's Trust, as well as stints at Paine Webber and Lehman Brothers, it's astonishing that Mr. Barba can't see the weaknesses in his own company's business model.

37854,20871,2007-06-12T02:55:04-04:00,,"There has been some serious chatter about Ameritrade’s (NASDAQ:AMTD) platform being compromised in some way, including the fact that customers’ accounts could be in jeopardy. It seems that the minute that you sign up for a new Ameritrade account, you are bombarded with third party Ameritrade/stock spam. What does this mean? Somewhere during the client signup or login to Ameritrade, the user’s account information (E-mail address at a minimum) is being collected and used to resend spam back to the user. This would constitute a serious security breach. What else is being collected? Perhaps it’s not a software issue at all, but rogue employees of Ameritrade selling client information. How far does the penetration go, and where is it in Ameritrade’s system? Regardless of the mechanism of the breach, this is serious, and the responsibility to pinpoint the problem will ultimately come to unhappy regulators with Ameritrade customers holding pitchforks and torches right behind them. Bennet Hasleton of Peacefire ran a test to see if he could duplicate and prove the problem exists. It does. He signed up for an Ameritrade account using an e-mail address consisting of 16 random alphanumeric characters, which would be extremely difficult to guess mathematically. He then kept the E-mail address private – he was the only one that knew it. Lo and behold, he began receiving Ameritrade spam at this address as soon as he completed the sign up process. This is clear proof of a serious security issue. Read more about Bennet’s experiment here. Ameritrade has issued a statement acknowledging the problem, which has sent the conspiracy-minded into overdrive. The following comment from Ameritrade is particularly suspect: ""Please be sure to delete any spam you might receive, then empty your e-mail's trash so that it's no longer kept there, either."" This doesn’t really serve any security function but cleverly removes (sort of) evidence from the user’s system. To delete it would be a prudent request, but emptying the trash? The Ameritrade response: Whatever the response from Ameritrade, it is clear that more light needs to be shed on this serious problem. This is clearly an issue that can affect shareholder value if Ameritrade trading volume declines and people close accounts because of lack of trust. There is significant downside risk here if this problem starts to receive national media attention. Remember that this is a financial company with highly valuable information like social security, trading and bank account numbers. It’s also worth noting that ChoicePoint (NYSE:CPT), the data broker that suffered a security breach in 2005, settled last week with 44 states and will pay a fine of $500,000. This is on top of the $15 million already levied by the FTC which was the largest civil penalty in FTC history. ChoicePoint’s stock fell 21% within one month after the media exploited the story. Two years after the event, the stock still hasn’t recovered to its pre-incident high. The timing of this couldn’t be worse. With mounting pressure on management to agree to a deal to be acquired by either E*Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC) or Schwab (NYSE:SCHW), which is being put forth by hedge funds JANA Partners and S.A.C. Capital Partners, this is not a good time to have the kind of serious structural issues that could blow up any deal. Hedge funds that are long can switch to short in an amazing amount of time. If Ameritrade is confronted with a situation similar to ChoicePoint, expect the stock to excrete large volumes of pain.

Investools MentorsInvestools brags that it ""is the only investor education company that has more than 100 certified educators on staff to assist you."" Funny thing--Investools is not an accredited educational institution. The 10Q Detective is left to ponder the definitive meaning of 'certified.'In addition, of the seven mentor profiles to be found at Investools’ online homepage, only one has a history of employment with a Wall Street and/or Investment Banking concern—she was a stockbroker—and only three of the coaches had more than ten years of personal investing experience!To all the bulls out there—tell me again how Investools is not a Seminar Selling company?The Company ignored a request by the 10Q Detective for audited performance results for any of its coaches. Accounting Red FlagsIn November 2007, Investools restated its previously filed Form 10-Q for the 2Q:07 ended June 30, to reflect additional revenue recognition. The 10Q Detective believes that a material weakness still exists in Investools’ internal control over financial reporting.For the Investor Education segment of Investools, which represents almost 69% of aggregate revenue, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables” accounting principle: The Company often bundles (multiple deliverables) that include on-demand coaching services, website subscriptions, educational workshops, online courses, along with other products and services.In our view, Investools is capable of determining many of these products/services being sold to—and received—by its customers. For example, the Investor Toolbox and Stocks Course offered online (for $199/month) and the Stock Workshop Seminar have clearly defined refund policies of 30 days and seven days, respectively. Hiding revenue as a deferred liability, even when the real risk of the customer trying to cancel the contract has lapsed, is advantageous during periods of slowing growth. By being too conservative in deferring recognized revenue during prosperous cycles, management can impact—smooth out—future reported revenue by accelerating the recognized product/service as being completed, boosting sales (when needed). However, in connection with the TOS merger, certain employees and consultants of TOS have the opportunity to participate in a retention bonus pool, which equals, in the aggregate, $20 million conditioned upon continued employment. The first payment is to be made in February 2008.The bonuses will be paid in equal annual installments over a three-year period.In addition, come August 2012, a $37.5 million balloon payment on a term loan facility to JPMorgan Chase Bank , N.A. (NYSE:JPM) is due. Investment Risks & ConsiderationsInfomercial Scam? RebuttalThe 10Q Detective believes that having tools that help you do industry group research, focusing your attention on the very best market sectors, and leveraging analytical software to make sure that a stock you are considering is in an up trending industry is worth the monies—especially for experienced or professional traders. However, Investools target market of novice traders would best be served by enrolling in an investment course offered at a local community college (for a fraction of the cost). Valuation AnalysisOperating metrics—funded accounts, trading activity and active subscribers—are firing on all cylinders. Noteworthy is the potential dual revenue stream, converting Investor Education Group graduates to active trading accounts on the TOS brokerage business.Volatility is good for transaction volume at TOS; however, on the negative side, a weak stock market performance, an ongoing credit crunch, and erosion in discretionary income could damage the Company’s retooled business model.The online brokerage business is a bright spot in Investools’ portfolio. Recent metrics suggest that the Company has hungrily digested its September 2006 purchase of TOS.For the third-quarter ended September 30, the brokerage division added 17,900 accounts to bring the total to 47,850. The company said investors wanted to take advantage of the wild swings in the market during the third quarter to make money trading.Revenue from brokering investments more than doubled to $32 million.The average commission rate increased, too. TOS charged a commission of $10.16 per trade, compared with $9.25 per trade in last year's third quarter.Trading activity remains heavily options-oriented, with average annualized trades of 170 per account (compared to 11, 9, and 13 for AMTD clients, SCHW clients, and ETFC clients, respectively).Approximately 31% of revenue now comes from online investing services; and, management expects this business to continue to account for an increasingly significant portion of revenues in the future.As any student of stock markets ought to know, downturns or disruptions in the securities markets could reduce trade volumes and margin borrowing and increase the Company’s dependence on its more active customers—who receive lower pricing.In addition, top-line visibility could be obscured by continued weakness at the Education segment—loss of pricing power and higher SG&A costs.

But that explanation is “less than straightforward,” according to Robert Ellis, an analyst with Boston-based research and consulting firm Celent LLC.
“In fact, greater volatility increases trading volume and revenue for online brokerage firms,” Mr. Ellis said.
A bigger factor affecting TD Ameritrade’s earning potential is lower commission rates from competitors, including Just2Trade, SogoInvest and Zecco, he said.
“If these firms catch on, TD Ameritrade may find itself in a perpetual spiral of lowering commission rates, even though it offers superior trading tools,” said the Celent analyst.
Earlier, TD Ameritrdade, a unit of Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE:TD), announced an 18% drop in quarterly earnings compared to the same period last year.
Earnings of US$141.1-million for the quarter ended March 31 were down from $172.8-million in 2006.

INVESTools has a high degree of difficulty to fully understand what drives the value of the business. The core driver of the earnings is their ability to rapidly grow their business in two attractive market segments, Education and Brokerage, with the added bonus of a marketing subsidy for the brokerage arm. The Investor Education business dominates the market with market share of 4-5x their next closest competitor from what we can find. The Education side has grown from $55mn to $250 from 2003 to 2006, while margins have improved from 7% to a high of 21% and the company generated $50mn in Free Cash Flow in 2006. However, with the acquisition of the Brokerage arm, the management has accelerated acquiring customers and is now spending 30% of Education's sales transaction revenue acquiring students (calculated by adding back the indirect marketing channel spend and the direct), which is hurting the profitability of the Education business in the short term but creating very high margin growth on the Brokerage side, which, in turn, is causing the Brokerage business to grow at a rate of 4-5x that of the industry average. So what is happening here? Here is where it gets a little confusing. Simply put, approximately 67% of the Education students opening a brokerage account with ThinkorSwim (#1 rated by Barron's 2007) with an average balance of $45K and trading 150 times a year this produces annual EBIT of $1,200 per account with fairly low churn rates. Therefore, management has an incentive to grow this business and it makes sense to increase unit volumes in Education by dropping the front end price points for the entry level product. So now the initial price points are lower in Education and unit volumes are ramping at a significant rate. In fact, INVESTools depended 100% on other brands to bring in customers two short years ago, and today the INVESTools brand represents over 75% of new students that come in the door. The marketing with the infomercials is not the best, from what you would like to see as an investor. What are the risks? It comes down to suitability. Are they overselling the product is the key question. Let's look at some facts. INVESTools has sold $550,000,000 worth of educational products/services over the last 3 years to over 100,000 paying consumers. According to the Better Business Bureau, there are a total of 18 complaints relating to sales/marketing practices and the over that time frame products range from $1,000-24,000 on education, or one complaint for every $30mn dollars worth of product/service sold. Why? INVESTools business is built on a lifetime value strategy where user satisfaction and retention is critical, due to the high customer acquisition costs and the extremely high incremental margins on any renewal. As an attendee of north of 45 preview events and someone who has attended every national user conference held over the last several years in (Las Vegas, Orlando, and Chicago), believe me when I say that the core INVESTools customer loves the product. To put this in perspective, why else in one of the worst markets, August 2007, would INVESTools/ThinkorSwim 2-day user conference sell out with 2,200 people flying to Chicago paying $999 plus hotel and other travel costs? In our opinion, INVESTools has an incredible business with very little working capital required and extremely high returns on capital combined with high user satisfaction while targeting the upper quintile of the American population (look at the demographics of the average student). If INVESTools was picking up students that were not qualified, the Company would not have an average account balance of $45,000, which is multiples higher than nearly any other online broker in the US. The real story here is that INVESTools has a marketing budget of approximately $75,000,000 annually while their next closest competitor on the Brokerage side, optionsXpress (NASDAQ:OXPS), spends an estimated $15 million acquiring customers yet has nearly twice the market cap of INVESTools. For November, SWIM overtook OXPS in DARTS and total accounts opened while adding $200mn in client assets while OXPS lost $200mn in client assets. Education is running near a 10% EBITDA margin (which is being held back by spending 30% of sale transaction revenue on marketing) and the online Brokerage business runs at 50% EBITDA margins with top line growth north of 100%. We will leave our estimates out of the picture but Wall Street is looking for approximately $110mn in EBITDA for 2008 or about 10x EV/EBITDA with minimal capex. It's a business where the value should grow literally daily as long as the churn stays relatively low as it has historically. Everyday approximately 140 new students sign up for INVESTools Education and 120 fully funded brokerage accounts are opened. The Brokerage business has seen its assets increase from $780mn to $2.6 billion in 15 months or growth of 225%. I have hopefully highlighted a variant market view that the products are of high quality on both Education and Brokerage as backed up by Barrons highest point rating ever for the ThinkorSwim Brokerage unit March 2007 and very limited customer complaints relative to paid graduates. Second, both businesses, despite initial appearances, are of high quality in terms of growth, barriers to entry ($75mn customer acquisition and significant ""installed base""), and returns on invested capital (INVESTools Education business generated +160% in 2006). Operating margins should continue to increase over time as there high margin high growth brokerage side makes up a greater percentage of revenue. Points/CounterpointsNeither INVESTools nor its employees are licensed financial advisors. Right! Nor should they be as neither INVESTools nor the Brokerage arm recommends individual securities to buy/sell. The article is correct that INVESTools is not an accredited educational institution. Why does this matter? Neither is the CFA designation but still thousands of people get the Chartered Financial Analyst [CFA] designation year in and year out. INVESTools is an innovator and their services are designed to be for personal not commercial use. The article is correct that the coaches do not have years of experience and that they only hire successful traders that have gone through their system. INVESTools is in the business of teaching average people that they can succeed; what better way than having former successful students teach prospective students. I would urge anybody in doubt sign up for the course and use the toolbox; you can get 100% refund within two weeks if you do not think it is worthwhile. The most dubious claim is that the company is ""hiding revenue as a deferred liability...by being too conservative in deferring revenue during prosperous cycles, management can impact-smooth out- future reported revenue by accelerating the recognized product/service as being completed, boosting sales(when needed)."" First, 100% of all costs are recognized upfront in the quarter in which the student was acquired yet revenue is deferred as the product/service is delivered and the revenue is non-refundable after 14 days. How would you suggest that management can accelerate delivery of a subscription based (time based) product like the annual toolbox? We would disagree with the argument that there is much risk due to the net debt of $70mn. On the November conference call, the company stated it could approach 30% adjusted EBITDA margins for the 4Q07 which should be cash flow of $27 million and we think the company will have a net cash position by year end 2008. Finally the article states:This statement is incorrect as the filing states the actual number was $4,000 NOT $4,000,000! Disclosure: Author has a long position in SWIM"
29756,20430,2007-03-16T03:31:47-04:00,,"I continue to receive a flurry of comments and emails regarding the INVESTools, Inc. posts (original and follow-up). I wanted to make some important clarifications: So, what would it take to really prove that INVESTools is worth it? What do I need to see, to eat, crow and concede? I’ve gotten responses from a number of folks who say they have not done so well with INVESTools. Others have said they do remarkably well with INVESTools. My hat goes off to them. One common theme amongst these folks is (not surprisingly) that much of their success is due to hard work and dedication. Several readers have, therefore, likened INVESTools to a college education — you get what you put in, it doesn’t guarantee success but helps, etc. I’ve already mentioned that I find this analogy misguided. Earning a degree from an accredited University is an important and rewarding life experience, that any return on investment cannot fully capture. You grow, you learn, you experience, and many don’t even pay the tuition just to earn a bigger paycheck. Nonetheless, at the end, you at least have something (a degree) that makes you statistically more competitive in the job market (just look at any regression on wages and college education). So in that sense, at least college has data backing up its efficacy.    Some have gone further and used my own school, Yale, as a comparison. Yale, in particular, does have data about its average student that I took from a friend who works in the development office, which is quite impressive and from a purely monetary standpoint (which I think is a foolish way to evaluate a university, but that’s neither here nor there), it appears to be well worth the tuition: the average graduate from Yale 20 years out of graduation makes enough to put it in the top 1% of American households — so the average Yale grad can expect to be in the 1% income bracket by the time he or she is 42. Here’s the honest to God catch, though. Even this doesn’t say much because correlation does not imply causation. Are students who go to Yale more likely to be successful because of Yale, or because of themselves? Is there a text-book self-selection bias? That’s a similar dilemma to INVESTools. The only difference is that INVESTools can do a controlled study to prove causation! A university, for practical and ethical reasons, can’t (and probably shouldn’t). So for me to be convinced of INVESTools’ value, I would need to see two things: You should note that it is not enough just to say that the average student makes money or that INVESTools leads students to perform better than they otherwise would have, if this still means they underperform the market. The average graduate needs to beat the market net of all INVESTools fees and tuitions for the program to be worth it. Otherwise, INVESTools adds little value for the typical student, since most would be better off simply dropping money into an index fund, saving time, cash, and headaches. It is also necessary to demonstrate these results over time. Otherwise, results may simply be a “fluke” and/or the “proven systems” may not be sustainable through time (that is, they’re just “quick profits”). It is also not sufficient to say “well, some people make a lot, so that justifies it.” There can be aberrations in a sample size of 250,000+ graduates, and on the tails of any normal curve will be highly successful investors. What matters is the mean and the median over time, net of fees, and because of INVESTools. Thus, I’ll extend a second challenge to the company (in addition to the first to allow me to try the product for myself, which has not been taken): Show me the results of an independent, controlled study that indicates your students perform statistically significantly better than the market AND do better than they otherwise would have. I’ll then proceed to extol the glories of INVESTools and shut up."

The following article was written in 2007 and does not reflect current Investools, Inc. practices.""I never really short stocks, but I’m sitting here with the flu watching the tube (no, not YouTube — good old-fashioned television), and for the last 20 minutes I’ve been really tempted. It’s not because the flu has gone to my brain and driven me mad, it’s because an infomercial for a product called INVESTools , whose parent company is publicly traded (Nasdaq:SWIM), is driving me mad.The company is making absurd promises (see ""Avoiding the Charlatans"") that students who attend its seminars and use its pricey software will destroy the market in no time. Some of the testimonials even make claims of outrageous 800%+ profits in just two weeks! The software and “education” are based on a system of just “following the red and green arrows” that indicate by technical signals when to buy and sell.That’s it. No research, no bothersome accounting to learn, no money to start, no problems!At this point you probably know what I’m going to say: If this isn't a scam, it's at best a massive ripoff. And in the long-run, you can probably make a bundle shorting the company.In case you’re not convinced right off the bat that something like this is bonkers, allow me to convince you. First, as I’ve argued in the past, technical analysis (especially “systems” using these special, mass-marketed, cookie-cutter strategies) is almost always bound to failure. But I’ll bite my lip on this, and save it for a different place and time. Instead I’ll make the ridiculous assumption that the system does work, and show why it just isn’t sustainable.Even in the extremely unlikely case that the “system” did make its students a ton of money, like any trading system, the returns one could garner would disappear when everybody does it. That’s just part of the game. All good things must come to and end. Ask hedge fund gurus like Steve Cohen, who himself admits that opportunities become scarce when everyone is in on it.And, trust me on this, if there is some elegant system like this that actually works for an extended period, you can count on the hedge fund folks to find it and trade it away before INVESTools does. So the product seems bound to mediocrity or failure.    Furthermore, the way I understand it, INVESTools’ students often spend upwards of $10,000 on seminars and software and what they actually “learn” is not stock trading, but actually option trading. Right off the bat, this should scare anyone who knows anything about options. They’re not exactly easy money. It’s a bit frightening that this company is teaching the average Joe (and yes, when it comes to options you can include this Joe on the list) that this is somehow safe and guaranteed money (and yes, it is saying that).Worse still, the web is littered with disgruntled students who never made a dime and whose attempts at a refund prove futile. It seems only a matter of time before this fad, to put it nicely, comes to an end.From an operating standpoint, the company has grown the top line dramatically over the past few years. And its cash flow is strong, despite mounting accounting losses (which are mostly a function of the fact that it collects the cash for services up front, but books revenue over the course of the subscription, leading to a large deferred revenue line item). The stock trades for around 20 times the TTM cash flow.Nonetheless, with the basically-bound-to-fail product, I have trouble seeing any sustained growth, and would be surprised to see much of anything at all in a few years when everyone catches on that the product just isn’t worth it. I encourage anyone who has used the product to share your thoughts, and I hope that any bulls would share their take.SWIM 1-yr chart"
48638,20355,2007-10-01T18:59:43-04:00,,"I’m sometimes tempted to switch to savings accounts paying the highest rates or the online brokers charging the lowest commissions. But I find 30-day GICs in my TD Waterhouse online account give me top interest rates without having to go through the hassle of opening up an account at a new institution and transferring money back and forth. 
I’m not a frequent trader so I don’t mind paying the higher commissions at TD Waterhouse and other places to gain access to their broader package of offerings such as online research reports and stock screeners (besides, TD Waterhouse recently began now offering disounts for larger accounts).
Now there may be another reason for staying put: service levels. Canadian Capitalist wrote a recent blog post, 'Giving up on Questrade,' detailing a frustrating experience with service staff at Questrade.com. Also, the RedFlag.com forum has a thread, 'Warning about ICICI,' complaining about poor service at ICICI Bank. 
No doubt many customers at these places aren’t having any service problems but one wonders, as suggested by bloggers and discussion board posters, if the likelihood of encountering such could be higher. It may be that the back offices at these places are a little more of a jumble because of the surge in customer sign-ups that comes from having the best rates."
30935,20302,2007-03-28T08:45:33-04:00,,"About two years ago I tuned in to CNBC to see Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) CEO Joe Moglia boasting about the company’s recently announced acquisition with TD Waterhouse. He seemed especially proud of one-time special dividend of $6 per share to be paid to Ameritrade shareholders prior to the merger. What struck me as odd, however, was that he also explained that about two-thirds of this dividend would be financed not with cash currently on hand, but through new debt financing the company had obtained.I thought about this, questioning my own understanding of capital structure, but couldn’t convince myself that such an event actually benefited Ameritrade shareholders. Isn’t the company essentially forcing shareholders to take on a loan they never asked for and, at the same time, forcing an income tax payment that could otherwise be deferred (and at a long-term capital gains tax rate) to be made this year? About a year after that, Joe Moglia visited our college and I had the opportunity to speak with him one-on-one.I can say unhesitatingly that Mr. Moglia is an outstanding and motivational leader. The story of his life is rather famous in business now, and I was not dissuaded of the characterization and reputation that follows him. He really seems like a great guy.Nonetheless I couldn’t get past the seemingly irrational dividend payment the company had made. And so I asked him, “What was the rationale behind borrowing to pay a dividend?” His response, peppered with reminders of how beneficial the merger would be, was that the special dividend was a reward to the Ameritrade shareholders that had stuck with the company throughout the difficult times following the tech bubble.I was unconvinced. Naturally the stock price immediately dropped by $6 upon the dividend payment, and the balance sheet was left much more levered. So although the shareholders were “rewarded” with a check for $6, their stock was also worth just as much less. Not my kind of reward.Surely there is a reasonable explanation for this. When I pressed further, Mr. Moglia explained that the company had an excellent credit rating and sufficient cash flow to pay off all the debt within a few years.Still, the plan had several blatant drawbacks. Through interest expense it reduces the company's future net income and the repayment of the principal will dramatically reduce future free cash flow. This limits the amount of capital available to be reinvested and used to expand the business. Where would such capital thus need to come from? Well either from borrowing more, resulting in mitigated net reduction of the debt, or from issuing more equity, which would dilute the current shareholders’ proportional ownership.    Dividends have become more popular and investor demand for them has increased over the past few years as the simple result of their new tax status. Long-term capital gains were once taxed at a rate of 20%, which was usually always less than the marginal tax rate investors would pay on their dividends. So there was a clear disadvantage to dividends.With both long-term capital gains tax rates and dividend tax rates now both at 15%, there is more parity and the new relative attractiveness of dividends has made them more common. But that doesn’t excuse their overuse. Dividends still face the disadvantage of forcing a tax payment sooner rather than later.Of course all this is old news now, but I have been thinking about the issue lately because there have been three similar special dividends announced that have caught my eye. As with the case of Ameritrade, the justification for them seems to me to be dubious. The announcements come from Health Management Associates (NYSE:HMA), Scotts Miracle-Gro (NYSE:SMG) and Dean Foods (NYSE:DF). I will look at each of these companies in upcoming posts.Full Disclosure: I have no position in any company mentioned in this post."

My response to the comment turned out to be longer than I expected and I figured I would make it an article instead.
The comment mentioned the highly entertaining and knowledgeable Jim Cramer's take on the Bank Of America announcement. I have often been at odds with what Cramer has said in the past and am not surprised that once again he has a different take on Ameritrade.
When he was bearish on Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) in December 2005, going so far as to say that investing in drug companies like Pfizer or Merck (NYSE:MRK) ""could really hurt people"", I picked Pfizer up for my personal portfolio and also featured it in the January 2006 edition of SINLetter. Without taking the generous dividend into account, the stock is still up more than 30% even after the recent pullback. 
When I was bearish on the Florida homebuilder St Joe (NYSE:JOE) and picked JOE as one of the most overvalued homebuilders in September 2005, Cramer was bullish on it as late as December 2005. As I mentioned in my follow up article Housing Sector in Pain, staying bullish on St Joe would have definitely hurt investors.  
As you may be aware, these are not isolated incidents -- he is generally right less than half the time according to CramerWatch.org. But I digress.
I did not sell Ameritrade just because of the Bank of America announcement. I also sold it because of lower trading activity in August, my outlook for a slowing economy in 2007 and because I did not want to sit on a 110% gain. The latest quarterly results came in below analyst estimates and trading activity continued to decline. Investors were clearly disappointed with the results and the stock fell another 4.75% today.
Would I consider switching to a free Bank of America brokerage account even if it did not offer any interest on money parked into the account? Certainly. I am usually fully invested in my brokerage accounts and park the cash portion of my portfolio in high interest accounts or in short-term CDs. With free electronic money transfers, there is really no incentive for me to leave the money in the brokerage account as the interest rate most online discount brokers offer is minuscule. I think the bigger concern for active traders would be trade execution and margin rates.
Regarding the offers by Ameritrade I mentioned in my last article, there is no URL for the ""free iPod nano"" giveaway as I got the offer by mail. Here is a blog that mentioned this offer in September. The Ameritrade representative at the San Francisco Money Show mentioned that the $1,000 offer on a $30,000 deposit was only valid at the money show and I did not have a chance to think about it and make a decision later. Since the money show takes place in various cities every year and is free to attendees, there is a good chance you may see an offer like this again."

14274,20182,2006-07-25T16:19:22-04:00,,"From InsiderScore: The chairman of TD Ameritrade (NASDAQ:AMTD) has made the largest purchase by any insider, at any company, in the past two years. Founder and Chairman J. Joe Ricketts bought approximately 7.3M shares at an average price of $15.59 on July 20th/21st, paying out more than $113.8M for the stock, and upping his holdings in the company to more than 120.55M shares, or about a 19.76% stake. Ricketts' last open market transaction came in November 2003, when he sold 2.7M shares at $12.38. In June 2005, after spurning a takeover offer from E-Trade (NYSE:ET), AMTD announced a deal to acquire TD Waterhouse, the U.S. brokerage business of Toronto-Dominion Bank (NYSE:TD). Under the terms of agreement, TD received a 32% stake in AMTD, and the Canadian company agreed to immediately launch a tender offer to acquire an additional 7.9% stake in AMTD. TD also agreed to limit its ownership stake in AMTD to 39.9% for three years from the closing (January 24th, 2006), and 45% from years four through ten. Ricketts, meanwhile, agreed to limit his family's ownership to 29% for ten years from the closing. TD eventually completed most of the tender offer, via purchases sometimes well above the $16 price, through a trading plan, and the company currently holds a 39.5% stake in AMTD. Ricketts founded what is now AMTD in 1971 as a local investment bank in Omaha, Nebraska. By 1975, he had launched a discount brokerage firm, and through a series of acquisitions, he eventually created an online brokerage giant, which he took public in 1997 at a split-adjusted price of $1.25 per share. Ricketts continued his acquisitive streak in the early part of this decade, taking over National Discount Brokers and Datek, among others. One son, Thomas, is currently a board member, while his other son, Peter, resigned from the board two months ago to pursue his candidacy for the U.S. Senate (he's a Republican running in Nebraska). The Ricketts family is #293 on the Forbes list of The World's Richest People, and #93 on the list of America's Richest People. On July 14th, shares of AMTD fell to $13.30, a new 52-week low on an absolute basis, though not taking into consideration a $6.00 per share one-time dividend paid out to shareholders with the closing of the TD Waterhouse deal. Since the dividend was paid on January 25th, and based on today's price at 11:15 AM ET, the stock is down about -15%. AMTD was able to move off its low thanks to a solid fiscal third-quarter (ended June 30th) earnings report, which also saw the company raise its fiscal 2007 guidance. For Q3, AMTD reported earnings of $139.8M, or 23 cents per share, up from $83.6M, or 20 cents per share (the disparity in EPS is the result of dilution from the TD Waterhouse deal). Revenue rose sharply as a result of the acquisition, from $234.4M to $540.3M, though operating expenses more than tripled as well, from $97.5M to $307.3M. AMTD's top line was a few million shy of what analysts expected, but the company beat EPS forecasts by a penny. Looking forward, AMTD said it expects FY07 EPS of 99 cents to $1.21, compared to a consensus forecast of $1.20, and Q406 EPS of 87 cents to 93 cents, excluding a one-time gain, and compared to a consensus forecast of 92 cents. ""Despite a decline in investor activity in June, we realized a record quarter, thanks in part to an increase in asset-based revenues,"" said Joe Moglia, chief executive officer. ""We continue to focus on completing the TD Waterhouse integration and positioning AMTD for growth in the long-term investor segment. Over the next year, we expect the investments we are making in our technology, value propositions, and brand to deliver results that will enhance our growth and strengthen our market position going into 2008."" Following AMTD's earnings report, Howard Chen, an analyst with CSFB, said that he believes AMTD will have ""significant earnings power"" once the Waterhouse integration is completed, although the short-term outlook for the stock ""remains choppy.""    Worth Noting: Ricketts' purchase trumps the $70M open market buy transacted by Dell (NYSE:DELL) Founder and Chairman Michael Dell in May, and is now the largest open market purchase by an insider, excluding institutional owners, in the past two years. Additionally, over the past year, only Aubrey McClendon, the CEO of Chesapeake Energy (CHK), has laid out more cash ($159M) for shares of his own company."

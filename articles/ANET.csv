        Investors are fearing that enterprise spend on Arista's hardware will be depressed for longer than the near term.
        Revenue guidance of $570-$590 million for Q3 is still pointing to revenue declines vs. last year's $654.4 million.
        Thankfully, and on the bright side, Arista's hard-won gross margins did not peel back.","Prior to the coronavirus overtaking the global economy, Arista Networks (ANET) was one of the hottest stocks in the IT sector. In contrast to many SaaS stocks, Arista Networks wowed the investment community due to the fact that despite being a hardware company, it clung to extremely high gross margins and critically, was profitable and generating tremendous earnings growth, which peaked when the Trump tax cuts settled in. Arista was billed as a ""Cisco (CSCO) killer"" and a long-term winner that would benefit as companies continued to invest in infrastructure that allowed them to adopt cloud-friendly infrastructures.Here's the problem: since the coronavirus began, companies have scaled back on spending. Not only have they slashed hiring and headcount, but they've scrapped capex budgets as well - and that includes IT spending on things like Arista products. Amid that backdrop, and due to the fact that unlike many other tech companies Arista doesn't have a recurring revenue base that protects it from volatility, Arista has been dealing with jarring revenue declines. After reporting a disappointing second quarter and guiding to an even more disappointing third quarter, shares of Arista have dropped ~20%:Now, here's the good news: these problems aren't Arista-specific. Arista's principal competitor Cisco (CSCO) tanked ~12% after earnings, due to disappointing results stemming from soft enterprise spending from its own customers. What this means is that, at the very least, Arista isn't losing pace with the rest of its industry. Looking longer term, I'm favorably dispositioned toward Arista. The company has earned a ""best in breed"" reputation as a networking product that was specifically designed with the cloud in mind, whereas Cisco has the negative connotation of an older legacy product. The cloud isn't going away - businesses aren't investing into infrastructure in the near term, but they will have to as our computing demands continue to increase. At the same time, there continue to be no near-term catalysts that can lift Arista higher. Arista's latest management commentary doesn't provide any hint of respite from the current demand environment (in contrast to many other enterprise companies, particularly in the software sector, that have signaled strong bouncebacks in June and July). Based on this, I think the best move is to continue to wait and watch. Considering that even after this stock price correction, Arista already trades at a ~23x forward P/E based on FY21 EPS consensus of $9.67 (+12% to FY20 consensus, but only flat to FY19; data from Yahoo Finance), I'd say there isn't much of a safety net on the valuation front either. We can now dive into the specifics of Arista's second-quarter print. Take a look at the results in the table below:Figure 1. Arista Q2 earnings resultsSource: Arista Q2 earnings press releaseArista's revenue declined -11% y/y to $421.4 million, which is certainly better than Wall Street's consensus of $530.6 million (-13% y/y) but still a disappointing continuation of the -12% y/y growth trend that we saw last quarter. With a weak macro environment, companies are focused on conserving cash and aren't lining up to replace infrastructure products, which are delayable expenses in most cases.Here is the bright news, however. It's possible that Arista's underlying Q2 demand could have been stronger than the -11% y/y decline that it generated, due to the fact that it was supply-constrained and had to push out fulfillment of some orders. Here's some important commentary from CFO Ita Brennan on the Q2 earnings call. This isn't exactly a whole lot of information to go off of, but we feel reasonably confident in estimating that ""somewhat constrained shipments"" means at least a few points of growth were pushed out from Q2 into Q3 when the orders are filled. Arista's guidance - which calls for the same -11% y/y growth in Q3 - may have some points of opportunity by that logic, assuming of course that the company is finally able to catch up to its backlog by the end of the quarter. And while Arista's CEO Jayshree Ullal did offer the unsurprising commentary that many of its large customers (and cloud titans) are pushing out spending decisions to future quarters, ""Arista experienced a cloud titan recovery and enterprise strength in Q2 offset by extended sales cycles in the campus sector."" In other words, there are some mixed signals - and while Arista remains uncertain about the overall demand picture, it's not all unidirectionally bad news.The other piece of good news is that Arista was able to hang on to its hard-won margins in the quarter. Arista's pro forma gross margins remained flat at 64.7%, which is incredibly high for a company that primarily sells hardware. Similarly, pro forma operating margins held roughly constant at 38.1%. Figure 2. Arista margin trendsSource: Arista Q2 earnings press releaseWe also remain encouraged by Arista's fortress balance sheet. As of the end of the June quarter, Arista held a whopping $2.78 billion of cash and marketable securities on its books, worth roughly 17% of its market cap and also just over a year's worth of revenue. This cash also comes free and clear of debt. This liquidity gives Arista plenty of flexibility to manage through the current crisis and re-invest in growth, and also take advantage of a lower share price to continue repurchasing shares, on which it has a ~$0.5 billion authorization left to go on its existing $1 billion share buyback approval. Arista is far from doomed forever. As the leading provider of cloud-friendly networking infrastructure, Arista is closely tethered to the trends that are driving the modern tech and computing landscape. Its problems are thankfully not self-isolated, and we've seen similar cautious commentary around Cisco, Arista's biggest rival. The fact that Arista was supply-gated and couldn't fulfill all its shipments in Q2 also suggests that underlying demand may be stronger than its current financials are showing. Stay cautious for now, but keep on the lookout for a buying opportunity if shares drift meaningfully lower."

The benefit is easy to explain. Arista Networks (ANET) sells switching equipment to expand the capacity of the Internet. Suddenly all of us are using the Internet far more intensively, using videoconferencing like Skype or Zoom (ZM), or simply self quarantining with Netflix or Disney+.Growth was in doubt prior to the virus. Will the surge last?ANET is a holding of ours from years past. In the last 18 months however we have traded in and out. Increasing our holdings after a poor guidance plunge and reducing our position once the market price recovers. But ultimately, despite its great historical track record, should ANET have an asterisk over its growth future? Does the virus change things?We profile ANET as part of our Global Technology Growth Star investment strategy. In this strategy we focus on strongly growing technology companies with a market capitalization in the range of 1-100 billion USD, not just in the United States, but from around the world.We look at our standard testsBut first, what does ANET do?Arista Networks makes high speed switching equipment for networks and data centers, thus making it the biggest challenger to Cisco System's (CSCO) market dominance. Major clients are cloud giants like Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB), but also large corporates, universities and governments.Arista Networks has undoubtedly been a growth star in the past growing at a strong consistent rate. That is, until growth slowed in 2019.Source: CGP Asset ManagementQ4 of 2019 in particular was a bad quarter, falling below both the previous quarter but also Q4 2018. This is not a seasonal effect either as previous 4th quarters have usually risen.The US/America's also remains the vast bulk of company revenue.Source: Arista Networks Investor PresentationDuring the Q4 conference call, CFO Ita Brennan put two ""cloud titan"" customers at above 10% of revenue. These were:In the call, a lack of visibility from cloud titans was also cited as a reason for the lack of full year guidance for 2020. The virus might have changed that.We think after the initial surge passes, we will also be left with an ongoing change behavior that will increase in Internet demand going forward. Here are just two examples.How much of the demand will be affected remains hard to guess. But once the surge fades, the change in consumer demand will likely drive internet growth for several years to come. ANET is likely to see a surge in sales given their reliance on cloud titans who are trying to respond to a massive surge in demand. Even better, Cloud titans have plenty of cash to pour into network infrastructure investment.ANEET has a long track record of growing profitability ever since its 2014 IPO (and even before).Source: Arista Networks Investor PresentationOperating margins have been maintained at strong levels in the 35-40% range for quite some time. These are very good levels for a company involved in technology hardware.Source: Arista Networks Investor PresentationHigh and stable margins are a key test for investors like Warren Buffett when he looks at stocks. Arista Networks meets this test.Competitors - Cisco Systems and the othersArista Networks has grown from a niche player in switching to become one of the main competitors to the dominance of Cisco Systems. Network management systems built for the specifically for the purpose of managing cloud systems has helped.Source: Arista Networks Investor PresentationStill, Cisco Systems is far and away the leader of market segments like 10GbE and Higher - Excludes blade switches, that are represented in the diagrams above. Arista Networks isn't the only competitor to Cisco Systems although the ability of Huawei to take market share in the current political environment, at least in the United States, is likely to be inhibited for the foreseeable future.Source: Arista Networks Investor Presentation.Bottom-line: Market share growth and margins give signs of a moat but recent lagging growth a concern.Internet and Data will keep growingThe simple answer is ""Yes, the TAM is big enough and growing fast enough.""Should you have any doubt, these trends are increasing network traffic include:There are many sub-sectors that require switching. A main focus for Arista Networks is Data Centers with campus ethernet a focus for future. This forecast is below, although this forecast was released in January 2020. The coronavirus might mean this is quite likely to beaten. Arista Networks with around $2.4 billion in total annual revenue, which includes other segments and service revenues, still has plenty of room to grow.Source: Arista NetworksWe usually like to consider several different management decisions and history to get a sense a management style. But in the current crisis times, capital management is far more important, so we will just focus on that.But here is a quick summary.$2.4 B in cashSource: Arista Networks Investor Presentation.Overall ANET is well prepared for any cash crunch with cash levels far in excess of requirements plus further unused borrowing capacity given the lack of any long term debt.Like many growth companies Arista Networks has regularly traded at PE multiples in the 30-plus range. Even now after sell-offs due to growth concerns, the historical PE ratio of ANET is around 18 at the time of writing.Data by YChartsGiven current volatility levels it makes sense to consider a range of stock price levels. A ""strong buy"" last week, could yet see the stock reach sale price next week on internet demand confidence. The flattening of sales in 2019 leaves us unconvinced of a long term growth profile.From this we produced these guidelines, for ANET at present. Interestingly they also do support recent trading history where the stock traded in a range of $200-300 with brief excursions outside this range.For us, here is how we are looking at ANET at the moment.Source: CGP Asset ManagementNibble at stocks, but keep some powder dry.We feel it is likely that the market may yet retest lows as the virus emergency spreads from New York to Louisiana, Florida and eventually most states. An 08/09 sized recession seems almost certain given the likely ongoing economic impact of ""shelter-in-place"", despite the unprecedented stimulus provided. So although ANET is at a buy price, just nibble at current prices. Keep some powder dry, because we could yet see further falls if the economic gloom darkens.Bottom line: ANET is a buy below $225.Arista Networks is undervalued compared to the boost in growth it will receive, which should substantially improve profits. We believe however that this is a trading opportunity to exit at around $290 over the coming weeks or months. We have sufficient doubts over long term growth that ANET does not qualify as a buy-and-hold stock for a multi-year hold."
4324794,25120,2020-02-17T18:02:38-05:00,"Arista Networks has long been a darling yet growth has not just come to a standstill, but in fact has reversed.The long-term promise looks good, and the question is if the company is just losing a few accounts or faces more prolonged competitive headwinds.Expectations have come down quite a great deal as value seems imminent, provided that revenues stabilize and start growing again.Shares deserve a prominent spot on the watch list, as I look to buy on dips, looking with eager to show clues about growth later in 2020.","Arista Networks (ANET) seems to have lost its mojo. Since the company went public in 2015, it has proven to be a worthy challenger to Cisco Systems (CSCO) and the likes. Shares traded in their sixties in 2015/2016, yet thereafter started a huge momentum run to levels above the $300 mark in spring of 2019. Over the past years shares have fallen quite a bit to current levels of $223, despite the market at large setting fresh highs.My last take on the business was February of 2018. That article followed the initial review at the time of the IPO at $55 in 2015. When the company went public, shares traded at 9 times sales. While this is on the high side, growth was quite impressive and very profitable, yet I was somewhat scared of the overhang caused by litigation risks.Early 2018 I noted that shares had essentially increased a factor of 5 times in a period of just about three years. The company reported $1.65 billion in sales in 2017 on which it earned $5.35 per share, while holding $20 per share in net cash as well, implying that operating assets traded at an elevated 40 times earnings. That high valuation prevented me from jumping aboard at the time.The potential for Arista is huge as the company is all about EOS offerings supporting virtualization and cloud solutions for all the major cloud players involved. EOS addresses these scale issues related to placing data in the cloud, as Arista operates in secular growth markets, which has been driving its growth trajectory in the recent years.When I last looked at the shares in February of 2018, when shares traded at $250 per share, I noted that a 40 times earnings multiple looked very rich, a bit too rich for me. Assuming 25% earnings growth in 2018, that suggests earnings of $6.70 per share. In 2018 I concluded that I would be willing to apply a 25 times multiple to that, and including $25-$30 per share in net cash, I would be happy to become a buyer around the $200 mark.Shares actually fell a bit during 2018 and fell below the $200 mark during the market sell-off late in 2018, yet that fierce and short sell-off created opportunities across the board of course.Fast forwarding to February of 2019 Arista reported its 2018 results. Those results were actually quite solid with full year sales up 31% to $2.15 billion, as momentum towards the end of the year was solid with fourth quarter revenues up 27% year-over-year.The company reported net earnings of $328 million, or $4.06 per share which actually marks a fall in earnings. While these are still very nice margins, note that the company took a huge $405 million settlement charge with Cisco, exactly the thing I worried about at the time of the IPO. Adjusted earnings came in at $7.96 per share, or $643 million. That number is not really fair, as it excluded a $91 million stock-based compensation expense, which after tax amounts to nearly a dollar per share. Adjusted for that, realistic earnings number came in around $8 per share.With net cash balances having increased towards $2 billion, net cash has increased to $25 per share. That actually meant that at $200 per share early 2019, valuation multiples had compressed a great deal. After backing out net cash, earnings multiples compressed to 25 times earnings, in line with my entry target as opportunities elsewhere made that I allocated by funds in other investments at the time.That was quite a shame as these solid results and a market recovery made that shares recovered from $200 at the start of 2019 to $320 in April, with shares showing 60% gains in the time frame of just a few months.From that moment on, growth has slowed. First quarter sales grew 26% year-over-year. At the start of August it became apparent that growth slowed down to just 17% in the second quarter, as this growth slowdown triggered a sell-off to levels in the low $200s. Shares plunged to $190 in October as third quarter results revealed that growth remained low at 16%. Note that despite the slower pace of growth, the company was still in essence generating earnings at close to $10 per share, as net cash balances had increased to roughly $30 per share. That implied that operating assets were merely trading at a market multiple, despite very strong balance sheet and actual still double digit growth.This appeal actually triggered a recovery to $240 earlier this year, yet shares now trade at $223 following weak fourth quarter results, with sales actually down 7% year-over-year. This is actually a bit on the contrary to the dip seen in the datacenter market results reported by Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA) and therefore suggests some operational weakness, not just market dynamics. Industry talks seem to suggest that the growth slowdown is attributable to Facebook (FB) hitting the breaks, although it does not seem very credible that one company is responsible for the fall in sales.For the first quarter of 2020, Arista sees revenues at a midpoint of $527 million and non-GAAP operating margins of 34%. At the midpoint of the guidance, sales are seen down 11-12% year-over-year, as the fall in margins makes that earnings could drop about 20%. If this is the new normal for 2020, earnings could easily fall back to $8 per share, yet investors are mostly worried about what is causing this weakness, as it seems that competitors are eating Arista's lunch for a change.Trading in the low $220s, and recognizing that net cash balances have risen to more than $30 per share, that implies a 24 times earnings multiple applied to the operating assets, assuming this weakness is prolonged throughout 2020. Given the complete lack of momentum and uncertainty about the competitiveness, this is probably a fair approach until more becomes clear.Despite some current woes, the long-term promise of the business look good as I would not rule out M&A interest over time as well, making that I am now truly willing to buy some further dips at $200 per share.While a short-term recovery might not seem very realistic, I recognize that shares ripped higher from $200 to $320 in a time window of four months this time last year. Recognizing that the $300 call by early 2021 is on sale for just $8, as a similar $120 move higher from here could make you 5 times your money, or even more in case such a similar recovery might occur in a shorter period of time, although I do prefer the risk-reward on the stock for now."
4343542,103480,2020-05-06T09:14:24-04:00,"Shares of Arista dipped after reporting Q1 results, primarily on the company's announcement that revenue deceleration would steepen into Q2.
        Following a -12% y/y contraction in Q1 revenues, Arista is calling for revenue to slip as low as -15% y/y in Q2, with operating margins to decline sequentially as well.
        Arista is also no longer producing substantial margin/earnings growth, making its ~25x P/E ratio look quite rich.
        Downgrading to neutral based on Arista's slowing prospects and limited demand visibility in 2020.","The past year hasn't been easy for Arista Networks (ANET). As a relatively new entrant in the networking hardware space, Arista was previously able to enjoy huge revenue and earnings growth rates as the company continued to steal market share away from incumbent leader Cisco (CSCO), but now as Arista scales into a company with ~$2 billion in annual run-rate revenues, that explosive growth has pacified somewhat. Add in the uncertainties of the coronavirus, which has led many companies to delay their capex and IT spending plans, and Arista's stock is left looking for direction.It's important to note, however, that Arista's shares have outperformed the broader market in 2020 - perhaps reflecting investors' optimism that greater usage of the internet and cloud services during the remote-work trend may drive some increase in hardware spend from large cloud titans (while Arista has confirmed this hypothesis is true, there are negative offsets). Whereas major equity indices are still down in the low-teens year-to-date, Arista shares have actually risen in the single digits. That trend of outperformance may slip, however, as following the release of Arista's first-quarter earnings, shares of Arista declined modestly:I was pro-Arista in 2019 and even early this year as the company's valuation multiple - trading consistently in the mid-20s - was below its historical multiples and seemingly undervalued a company that was previously able to produce >40% EPS growth. As I've seen Arista's growth rates taper off and come under pressure during the coronavirus, however, I no longer believe Arista is a deep bargain stock. At present levels, and considering Arista's rather dour expectations on its performance this year, Arista's risk/reward profile is balanced. While Arista's rich profit margins and ample cash balances keep me from being overly bearish on Arista (because investors will continue to see Arista as a relatively safe stock in the tech sector), I don't see any meaningful near-term catalysts that can significantly lift shares higher. My stance on this stock is now neutral - investors should wait and see until either fundamental performance improves or valuations come down. Let's now examine Arista's latest results in greater detail. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. Arista 1Q20 resultsSource: Arista 1Q20 earnings releaseRevenues declined -12% y/y to $523.0 million, slightly beating Wall Street's projection of $517.5 million (-13% y/y), but coming in at the low end of Arista's guided range of $522-$532 million, or -12% y/y to -13% y/y. Worse yet, this is Arista's second consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue decline (and the only two quarters of revenue decline in the company's history), with growth decelerating five points from last quarter's -7% y/y growth rate. Product revenues in Q1, meanwhile, slipped an even steeper -19% y/y, eight points weaker than -11% y/y in Q4.Unlike the many other tech stocks that have seen stable share prices this year, the majority of Arista's revenue base is non-recurring, and each sale it makes must be renewed. To some extent, we already expected some weakness in Q1 revenues as Arista cited tough comps versus the first half of 2019 due to revenue recognition timing - but we had hoped that Arista would be able to maintain single-digit decline rates, and that the worst would subside by Q2. This doesn't seem to be the case any more - Arista's guidance for Q2, calling for $520-$540 million in revenue (-11% y/y to -15% y/y), has growth decelerating even further at the midpoint. Wall Street, meanwhile, had hoped for $544.2 million in revenue, or growth improving to -10% y/y. Figure 2. Arista guidance updateSource: Arista 1Q20 earnings releaseIn terms of how the coronavirus has impacted Arista's business: while investors' earlier hunch that cloud titans would boost their hardware spend in the near term to support increased usage is true, Arista believes that this short-term boost is fully offset by other customers prolonging their purchasing cycles. CEO Jayshree Ullal noted that the company's revenue visibility for 2020 is quite low (which may also mean Arista is at risk of meeting Q1 guidance) in her prepared remarks on the Q1 earnings call:Another potentially concerning update is that Arista noted some supply chain shortages for some products in its lineup. Arista is working to resolve these component shortages, in the meantime Ullal has warned that lead times ""have doubled recently for our popular products.Additionally disappointing is the fact that Arista's margin profile softened slightly in Q2. Though Arista managed a 110bps boost in gross margins thanks to a higher mix of service to product revenues in the quarter, it squandered these gains through higher operating expenses. Despite the decline in revenue, sales and marketing expenses rose 12% y/y in the quarter to $57.2 million, while general and administrative expenses also ballooned 18% y/y to $18.3 million. As a result, Arista's operating margins fell 40bps to 37.1% - rare for a company that has a long history of margin expansion and double-digit percentage gains in EPS. Figure 3. Arista margin trendsSource: Arista 1Q20 earnings releaseArista also further expects pro forma operating margins to slip to the ~35% range in Q2, presenting another red flag. Though many companies in the tech sector have announced spending cuts (through furloughs, layoffs, exec compensation cuts, and cutbacks in advertising spend) to preserve profitability throughout the coronavirus, Arista has not yet announced a plan to eliminate expenses this year.Perhaps why deep spending cuts are unnecessary, however, is the fact that Arista still maintains a fortress balance sheet - which is one of the primary reasons it's difficult to be overly bearish on this stock. Arista still generated $194.5 million in operating cash flows this quarter (+15% y/y), adding to a substantial cash pile that ended Q1 with $2.64 billion in cash and investments, versus no debt. For sizing purposes, Arista's operating expenses in Q1, after netting out stock compensation, depreciation/amortization and other noncash charges, amounted to only $146.6 million. This suggests that Arista has substantial resources to withstand a sharp downturn in sales for an extended period of time. With this much liquidity on hand, investors will likely continue to view Arista as a safe, dependable stock that still generates operating margins in the high 30s. Still, Arista's consecutive declines in revenue to the mid-teens, the reductions in the company's operating margins, and the fact that pro forma EPS slid -13% y/y in Q2 (versus EPS gains of nearly 40% in early FY19) make us question Arista's premium valuation multiple.A stock trading at a 25x forward P/E ratio like Arista comes with an implied promise of above-market growth - but with both Arista's revenue and EPS declining in the low teens, we fear Arista's valuation multiple may begin to recede from its past premiums. I'd be interested in Arista again if it slid below a 20x P/E multiple versus consensus FY21 EPS of $9.72, which is roughly flat to Arista's earnings in FY19 (a $195 price target), but I see no outsized benefits to buying Arista at present values."
4349925,105308,2020-05-25T15:55:13-04:00,"Arista Networks displays a stellar balance sheet and juicy net profit margins.Discounted cash flow model points towards a return to $300/share, with prudent growth assumptions.Despite numerous risks, the stock is a great buy at its current valuation.","Arista Networks (ANET) sells advanced network-operating systems, enabling third-party developments to scale and achieve speeds from 10 to 400 Gbit/s. The company has been making significant progress in capturing a larger pie of the network hardware space, but shares have lagged behind, currently trading at their late 2017 levels. In the meantime, the company has grown both its top and bottom line, where it enjoys juicy margins. Moreover, the balance sheet is stellar, with $2.6B in cash and no debt. I see Arista as a great buy in this market environment. With high valuations and indices near all-time highs, Arista is a free cash flow generator, at a reasonable price.In this article, I will discuss:Source: Arista.comBalance SheetIn uncertain economic environments like the one we are currently undergoing, companies must have robust financials to withstand potential adverse outcomes. Arista has impressed me with its balance sheet, which reassures me that the company is built to last. Since its IPO, Arista's cash position has been consistently growing. Because the company has not issued any long-term debt, its cash pile has been accumulating entirely through its net income generation, which has totaled to nearly $800M over the past twelve months. With a cash position worth ~15% of the company's market cap and no outstanding interest payments, Arista should have enough ammo to both withstand short-term adversities and return sufficient capital to shareholders.Income StatementMy greatest concern with Arista, and what has probably caused the market to be trading the stock sideways, is its revenue growth deceleration. The same company that was growing at nearly 50% YoY around three years ago, increased its sales by only 2.8% on a trailing twelve months (TTM) basis. In fact, in the most recent Q1, sales declined by 12.2% YoY. This is in the nature of the hardware business, which tends to be cyclical. I expect the company's revenues to continue rising in the long term, as I will discuss later on.Despite the slowdown in sales, Arista has managed to boost its profitability, achieving spectacular margins. Net income margins are hovering around 35%, increasing Arista's bottom line, as shown in the earlier graph.Here's where my thesis with Arista is starting to take form. Sure, ""growth,"" the word that makes investors exciting and interested, has not been impressive lately. Profitability, however, has. Hardware companies are subject to revenue fluctuations based on business cycles being deprived of the recurring revenue model many SaaS businesses enjoy on the software side of things. The important point, in my view, is for cyclical businesses to have juicy margins in order to maintain or even grow in this case, their profitability. Arista does exactly that. If the company can grow its profitability, while its revenue growth declines, the bottom line should increase even more rapidly once revenue growth resumes.Such cases, in which cyclicality can cause stocks to drop or move sideways, allow for investors to grab unique opportunities. I believe that Arista is one of those, currently trading near its all-time low P/E ratio, around 22 times.I am now going to illustrate why Arista could soon return to its $300/share price point. I am going to use a discounted cash flow model to do so. As I mentioned, revenue growth decline has overshadowed Arista's massive free cash flow generation, which is what drives value in stocks in the long term. As always, I am going to take a prudent approach.I have set the risk free rate at 0.64% to reflect the 10-year U.S. Treasury bill. I have set the market risk premium at 5.6% to reflect the average risk-premium of the S&P 500. We come out with a WACC of 6.63%. Remember, Arista has no long-term debt.Source: AuthorI have then set our projected free cash flow. Over the past twelve months, Arista has generated $973M in free cash flow (cash flow from operations - CAPEX). While the company has grown its cash flow generation in line with its earnings, as shown earlier, I will take a more prudent approach. Thus, my growth rate starts at 5%, despite Arista's FCF CAGR of 58.35% over the past five years. In the short term, the growth rate fluctuates between 1% and 5% to reflect some cyclicality, until it settles at a reasonable terminal rate of 2%.Source: AuthorUsing then these cash flows, along with our discount rate of 6.63%, we come to a fair value of nearly $300/share, representing an upside of ~35% from the stock's current price of $220.Source: AuthorI believe that the upside is considerable, especially since I assume FCF growth never goes beyond 5%. This is rather unlikely as the demand for data-centers and networks is rapidly increasing.Arista's future in the high-speed data-center network should continue to grow. Not only is the demand for data centers and network solutions is increasing, but the company is proving product superiority, stealing from Cisco's (CSCO) existing market share. Over the past six years, Cisco's market share in the space has been nearly halved, while Arista's presence gradually grows larger.Moreover, the company announced an optical line system for 400G. The coronavirus has caused massive casualties for many businesses. At the same time, it has forced many of them to embrace and take advantage of the power of the cloud. Businesses have been moving the majority of their activities online. Consumers are demanding unprecedented levels of data transmission for their streaming and in-home entertainment services. Data centers that previously utilized 100G switches will inevitably have to upgrade to 400G, to keep up with the demand.Projections show that the 400G+ market will account for the majority of data-center Ethernet switch revenue, and Arista is ready to claim its piece of the pie.However, despite the many opportunities that Arista can tap into as the network market spreads, there are potential risks, including massive competition. The cloud networking market swiftly evolves. Should Arista fail to innovate and fall behind its competitors, the company will lose immense credibility and market share. Companies like Cisco and Juniper Networks (JNPR) may start recouping Arista's piece of the pie.Further, the company highlights its issues when it comes to having limited customers in its 10-K. Arista's revenue accounted for 23% and 17% by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), respectively. The company suffers from not having a diversified customer base. With 40% of its sales coming from two single companies, the concentrated nature of its customers may have its future sales fluctuate. In fact, the company mentioned that certain sales to both Microsoft and Facebook benefited from one-off factors that are not expected to be repeated in 2020 or the years after.Finally, the nature of its market is massively cyclical and could easily be affected by budget-cutting and adverse macroeconomic conditions. The increasing demand for data-centers should help Arista withstand COVID-19. However, future network infrastructure spending reductions could materialize, should the macro environment worsen.I believe that Arista is a great buy. Despite the risks mentioned, the company is a free cash flow monster. With great net income margins, its cash position keeps on growing, stacking ammo for future acquisitions, and a cushion for adverse times. Besides, having no debt makes for a clean, impressive balance sheet. As the discounted cash flow model suggests, the stock offers significant upside, even with little growth. The competition is indeed harsh, but so far, Arista has shown resilience and skills in capturing and increasing its market share.Finally, while the stock has traded sideways for numerous months, demand for shares should now start increasing. The company has been executing its buyback program, retiring $494M worth of shares over the past four quarters. This should leave around half a billion worth of shares to be repurchased under its current program. Since the company has built a massive cash position, it can use some of the money to return capital back to investors. The remaining buyback program should account for around 3% of the company's current market cap, whose buying pressure should boost the stock higher.As always, thank you for reading.

Product sales made up more than 80 percent of $2.4 billion in revenue for 2019. Gross margin has been around 64 percent since 2017, and revenues grew at an annualized rate of more than 30 percent between 2014 and the end of 2019. This has led to excellent free cash flow generation.Source: Risk ResearchIn addition to advanced routing hardware, Arista is known for its Linux-based Extensible Operating System (EOS) that allows cloud capacity and capabilities to rapidly scale modularly without adding equivalent operating costs. Arista acquired Mojo Networks in 2018 and rolled their engineers and tech into Arista’s Cloud Vision Wifi offering. Cloud Vision delivers wifi user experiences through analytics and proactively addressing issues at the network level before they get to the user, smoothing out issues that would normally disrupt video conferencing or using cloud-based applications.Aristra acquired Metamako in 2018, known for their high-speed data routing technology. Arista’s hardware and software now offers financial institutions extremely low latency transmission for software-assisted trading, a major advantage. In early 2020 Arista acquired long-time Dell partner Big Switch for their network monitoring and software defined network expertise, introducing an additional pool of existing Dell customers. These acquisitions help position Arista for growth over the next decade, especially among enterprise customers that could have otherwise been drawn to competitors like Cisco (CSCO).Much of Arista’s growth has come from their relationship with so-called ""cloud titans"" like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that make up 23 percent and 17 percent of revenue, respectively. Arista is a market leader in developing data center infrastructure and software, and frequently works with large customers to help design and optimize their cloud networks powering products like Microsoft (MSFT) Azure. Aristra saw tremendous growth on sales of their 100G Ethernet switches and are poised to sustain similar growth from sales of the next generation 400G switch.Source: Arista Q4 Earnings PresentationArista’s campus cloud technology shifts the experience from one where users connect to wifi networks specific to a meeting room, cafeteria, or office space of an organization to one where they simply connect to the overall campus network. From an end-user perspective this is a welcome upgrade that will bring improved network stability, speed, and coverage. Changes to the network architecture however are much more involved and will rely heavily on the analytics and workflow management software Arista offers alongside their industry leading routing hardware. This type of ubiquitous system will also be essential to the reliable operation of the many Internet of Things (IoT) devices being deployed in commercial and industrial settings over the coming decade.Arista increasingly offers IT administrators more value from their systems to meet the needs of business improvements enabled by technology and supported by robust network infrastructure. They have done it with excellent and improving efficiency, with a positive trend of increasing return on assets.Source: Risk ResearchArista recorded a record number of new customers in the fourth quarter. Segments related to recent financial and enterprise acquisitions saw strong momentum in 2019.Aristra’s board authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program in 2019 using operating cash flows, of which $266 million has been deployed. Management also announced the Big Switch acquisition on the Q4 earnings call, with expectations the purchase will be accretive by the end of 2021.While business has grown among smaller customers, Arista’s stock price is still largely tied to capex spending from the large companies that make up 40 percent of revenue. Microsoft cut capex spending in Q4 2019, and combined with weakness in other verticals, Arista guided Q1 2020 revenues down 12 percent compared to the previous year. Management did make a point that the decline was the result of reduction in planned capex spending, and not of loss of share or business with any cloud titan customers. The Q4 earnings call was in mid-February, so it also seems possible that coronavirus-related demand issues from enterprise customers could have driven revenues even lower in the last few weeks of the quarter. If not, it seems likely there will be a notable effect on Q2 earnings and beyond, depending on the severity of economic slowdown caused by COVID-19.Arista is trading at historic low P/E multiples, with a TTM ratio of 20.5 compared to an average P/E ratio of 37 over the history of the company.Source: Risk ResearchAfter peaking in April 2019, the share price has followed a trajectory that does not reflect the growing value of the business as measured by free cash flow generated per share, signaling a potential buying opportunity for the patient investor.Source: Risk ResearchRisk Research has developed software that identifies optimal entry and exit points based on historical analysis of thirteen years (a complete market and economic cycle) of daily high and low stock prices in relation to the simple moving average. The models currently return a maximum buy price for Arista of $155.72 (down 40 percent from the April 28 closing price), and a sell above $218.88. Buying at that price will generate a return of nearly 70% per annum based on comparisons of historic growth in net asset value per share. The company has an intrinsic value of $356.44 per share according to the model, with the potential to reach $733 per share by the end of 2022, assuming current trends continue.The Risk Research approach is to buy quality businesses on weakness and short sell deteriorating companies on strength. Arista's stock will likely be weak after first and second quarter earnings are announced due to the temporary slowdown in cloud titan-derived revenue and the impact of COVID-19 on enterprise spending. This may present the buying opportunity of the decade.Arista is in for a few difficult quarters in the near term as a result of factors outside their control. However, the company’s exceptional ability to generate cash flow and return on assets remains intact as does its prominent position in cloud titan infrastructure. Management has used the ability to generate cash to make intelligent acquisitions and diversify its business away from concentrated revenue sources. It's quite possible that over the next few quarters investors may be presented the opportunity to buy a business with excellent margins, cash flow, and diverse growth prospects at a deep discount.For those not familiar with Risk Research, our approach is focused on detailed financial statement trend analysis with particular emphasis on return on assets by pre-tax free cash flow and its constituent components (margins, asset turnover), and trends in total liabilities and long-term debt in relation to free cash flow. We look for companies with an extraordinary ability to consistently generate high returns on assets, including on new capital employed. We employ Python software that constantly combs the financial statements of all public companies.Central to our approach is the observation that, over time, a company’s stock price trend closely resembles its free cash flow per share trend. In the short term, stock prices are more volatile, sometimes much more volatile, than the free cash flow of the underlying businesses. This deviation creates opportunity for the patient, observant investor.We also employ software that analyzes daily pricing peaks and troughs over the last 140 days and compares those to the peaks and troughs in relation to simple moving averages over the last 13 years, or a complete market cycle. This analysis indicates entry and exit points that have the potential to generate particularly favorable investment returns. The minimum target is twenty percent per year.Summarized, we buy quality businesses on weakness and sell deteriorating companies on strength."
4343576,105055,2020-05-06T10:22:43-04:00,"2020 will be a stagnant year for Arista Networks with reduced revenue in Q1/Q2 and a quick pickup in the second-half of the year.
        2021 will see growth resume as network infrastructure needs to upgrade to keep up with humanities digital transformation.
        Arista Networks could also become a takeover target due to their stellar balance sheet.
        Buy price: Under $216.","Arista Networks (ANET) is a seller of IP and ethernet-based networking products. On the back of slowing growth, a significant customer (Microsoft (MSFT)) cutting capex spending, and COVID-19 concerns, Arista has been trading down 30-50% off the 52-week highs. I believe this $200-220 price range that Arista Networks is currently trading in to be a good entry point for investors looking to buy-and-hold over the next few years.Image: Arista Networks LogoArista Networks, as I mentioned, sells IP and ethernet-based networking products to a variety of companies. If a firm requires a network buildout of any kind or deals with any sort of communications, then that firm operates in Arista's total addressable market.Some practical uses include streaming TV providers, trading firms (low-latency for high-frequency trading), healthcare, banking, insurance, or the infrastructure that powers the ""cloud titans.""""Cloud titans,"" includes the likes of Microsoft (MSFT) and Facebook (FB), two of Arista's largest customers. While I hate to spoil my ""risks"" section so early on, it should be noted that Microsoft and Facebook make up 23% and 16.6% of sales respectively (per 10-K).In total, Arista boasts more than 5,000 customers, primarily in the United States. These customers turn to Arista thanks to its advancements in networking hardware, the ease of working with Arista, the support Arista provides, and the list of technology partners that have software that can readily tie into a buyer's Arista Networks built ecosystem.Arista Networks is a $16B firm competing against one of the biggest names in tech, Cisco (CSCO). This is not an article about Cisco, but I am bullish on its prospects in much the same way as I am of Arista.Other names readers might be familiar with include Juniper Networks (JNPR) and Huawei. Juniper presents healthy competition against Arista on many fronts. Huawei, at least in the United States, not so much given the current macro landscape.Image: Arista Networks support map (each pin is a location, red are closed)While Juniper, Cisco, and Huawei all compete to supply the buildout of networks around the globe, there is one distinctive feature of Arista that I feel makes them stand out over time, their customer support.In a recent talk (video above), Arista COO Anshul Sadanda discussed the company's goal of providing a fantastic operator experience. In the video, Sadanda notes that 18 seconds was the average time for a person calling the toll-free number to be connected to a real-life human ready to answer questions, not a machine. Oh, and that human, they're not just looking to hand you off; they're third-level support and trained to get problems resolved.Alongside strong support, Arista also has big tech on its side. Facebook, to not become single-sourced and own everything internal, worked with Arista to ensure that their own ""FB Minipack"" was interchangeable with Arista's latest 7368 switches. This shows an innate ability of Arista to go where for-profit companies traditionally wouldn't, into the white-box world (open source).I used to say we will ""return to normal,"" but the longer the lockdowns go on, the more apparent it becomes that ""normal"" is gone. During Microsoft's earnings call, Satya Nadella said something that changed my opinion of our future:Our digital transformation may recede a little once COVID-19 is marked ""resolved,"" but people will be choosing to stay home a lot more. Let's face it, we were already heading that way, COVID-19 just accelerated it. Conferences seeing success online might remain online. We'll likely see businesses keep some form of remote around. Consumers will opt for the latest streaming release over an overpriced cinema trip. All of these, and more, will require network infrastructure to be updated and made faster than ever, leaving Arista Networks in a prime position going forward.Data centers that were using 100G switches will need to upgrade to 400G, if they haven't already, and very few companies make a reliable 400G switch. Arista is also working on 800Gb ethernet and switches that will support it (ETA 2023), which would be genuinely game-changing and push us ever closer to terabit Ethernet connections. You'll have to excuse my use of a Cisco image, but the following shows why we already needed faster connections (and this has now been accelerated).Image: Data usage 2015-2020 in zettabytes per yearNow for the business side of things. As I mentioned, I am bullish on the whole industry. I like Cisco, Juniper, and Arista Networks, and I believe they all have a fantastic future ahead of them. When it comes down to it, though, the balance sheet is what has me raving about Arista Networks.Chart: Arista Networks cash & equivalents quarterlyWe will start with cash on hand where Arista has managed to build up a fairly sizable position. At more than 15% of the firm's market capitalization, one could argue that Arista is a prime takeover target in the space. This is made even more likely when factoring in Arista's zero long-term debt.One way to visualize the excellent financial position Arista finds itself in is via a crude mathematical exercise. If we assume Arista lost all sales but did not cut operating expenses, how long could the firm survive? The answer is a little over a year and a half.We are being unfair, however. Arista would continue to make a product and have inventories. Even still, the company could survive a downturn that saw no one purchase for a full year, at a minimum. That's the kind of stability we should be looking for when uncertainty greets us at every corner.Making it better for investors, Arista won't see zero sales. As we discussed in the last section, they're a competitor in what is sure to be a surging industry over the next couple of years. The company will get a second wind, too, with 800Gb ethernet in 2023.The most significant risk facing Arista Networks has already been discussed a little in this article, an over-reliance on two customers. Microsoft provides some 23% of revenues, and Facebook another approximately 17%. 40% of business being reliant upon two companies is a risk all investors should be wary of.Chart: ANET Price over the last yearA loss of one of those two companies would be a considerable burden to growth for Arista, and we've already seen that play out on a somewhat smaller scale over the last year. With Microsoft's reduction in capex spending, Arista took several deep steps down in trading prices, as you can see in the graph above.While it has not been confirmed that spending increases will resume at Microsoft, I'd have to imagine it would given the two-years of digital transformation quote from Nadella.Competition also poses a significant risk for Arista. Failure to keep on top of enhancements in the space could cause buyers to move onto whichever company is providing the latest/greatest/fastest. By working with industry, offering the best in class support system, and working with the major alliances on future standards, I think Arista has a place in this industry for years to come.Q1 earnings, released on May 5th, showed an expected reduction in revenues. This release gave shares a downward jolt in after-hours trading.GAAP EPS came in at $1.73, which beats estimates by $0.21. Revenue was down ~12% from the same period last year at $523M. We knew this would happen, and this was priced in. What I was looking for were consistent margins, and we got those (64.7% gross margin).Unlike many companies, Arista also provided some guidance for the next quarter:If we assume that a slight uptick in revenue growth occurs in the third and fourth quarters (with the larger firms needing to upgrade their networks), I think we're looking at ~$2.2B in 2020 revenues, conservatively. This is roughly $270M less than in 2019. Margins appear to be consistent at Arista Networks, so leaving that at 35%, we have $770M in non-GAAP operating income.With $1B in share repurchases authorized, and ongoing, Arista could buy back stock at these lower levels that would work out to a pretty level year in terms of EPS and get back to growth in 2021 as companies begin to release the clasps on their pocketbooks.While I think the days of 30-50% growth are behind us, I do believe that 2021 will be an especially bright year for firms in the networking space, and Arista will benefit from that. At a reasonable 20% growth rate in 2021, Arista Networks would be looking at operating income of around $920M, or an EPS of $12.04 per outstanding share today. This, with no debt, and cash on the balance sheet, would easily command an 18x multiple, or $216 per share.Image: High-Quality Hideaway Scores via HighQualityHideaway.comThe Hideaway Scores are a methodology I developed over time to quantitatively bring the best stocks into view. It's actually how I came to find Arista Networks. In tracking A+, A, and B rated firms beat the market.Arista Networks is a company in a growing, in-demand industry. Towards the end of 2019, things were looking a little bleak with customers like Microsoft slowing spending, but this firm might benefit from COVID-19 due to increased network demand.My target buy price for Arista of $216 assumes a stagnant year this year, followed by a 20% growth in 2021. It also assumes that Arista does not buyback any stock (which it is doing), and it also assumes Arista trades at an 18x multiple, far below the 25 it is trading at today."
4324778,96246,2020-02-17T15:48:45-05:00,It's pretty amazing that companies are not seeing a slowdown from China.You'd think sales would have slowed and supply would be disrupted.Not really. I think this is a pretty bullish story.,"We've listened to numerous earnings conference calls and some companies speak at the recent Goldman Sachs conference. One amazing consistency is that companies are not talking about a big China health-related slowdown. It sounds like customers are still ordering and consumers may be buying to build up their work-at-home presence.The China health outbreak is definitely one of the biggest risks out there in the stock market today. But for some strange reason, it's not yet hitting results.As long as this doesn't hit results, it's not a negative for stocks. And more than that, I think, when this outbreak passes, it's going to be a huge boost for sales thereafter. If sales managed to hold up during this outbreak, you have to believe that sales get stronger after the outbreak passes.Let's listen to what a few companies have talked about.Here's what Nvidia (NVDA) said on their earnings call:When Nvidia says it's still very early that tells me they are not getting hit. It's not so early actually. This health scare has been happening since November or December with major shutdowns. It's not early at all if they were seeing a slowdown. But since they are likely not seeing a slowdown, they think it's early and want to be on the safe side to adjust their guide down by $100mm.Skyworks (SWKS) said at the Goldman Sachs conference last week that they saw no change in customer orders.Micron (MU) did say they saw some slowdown in China when speaking at the Goldman conference but said they are still on track with their quarterly targets. Micron said that trends outside China were still strong.Here's what Arista (ANET) said on their earnings call about China's health concerns:As we mentioned in our take on Nvidia's wording, here Arista clearly says ""too early"" means they ""haven't seen"" an impact.The timing, currently, doesn't hit companies as much because it's during a Chinese New Year break, so there typically is scheduled downtime for many companies.Still, to me, it's odd that there hasn't been that much economic pain as per companies that have had public comments.SourceApparently, there was a catch up in reported cases in China, so the numbers spiked a few days ago. That doesn't necessarily mean that the number of cases jumped. It likely means that actual numbers had previously been suppressed.Previous to the spike, the number of new cases had been up 3,000-4,000 per day. It sounds like after the spike, new cases have tracked back to about 3,000 new per day.Obviously, we're hoping for a speedy recovery and an end to this outbreak and health scare.For businesses, we also care how it affects quarters and earnings reports.If the outbreak doesn't slow, obviously, risk builds for companies exposed to China.Here are companies with the largest exposure to China.SourceAbove, you have who's most exposed to China. We told you what we heard from Skyworks, Micron, and Nvidia. They are companies with big exposure. They all spoke to the Street last week.If they aren't really seeing a hit yet, it's bullish for companies, in general and the general market.The health risk has forced many to work from home. It's also left people with more time on their hands. The combination may have caused consumers to purchase from home and also build up their home offices. That can actually drive sales rather than crimp sales.We've seen a spike in numbers due to reporting adjustments, but the companies that are speaking don't seem to be talking about a big risk from China. So far, the timing of the Chinese New Year may have lessened the blow. But also consumers maybe beefing up their home offices, actually driving tech sales.If companies survive unscathed during this outbreak when it's finally over, I think it's fair to assume there could be a big jump in sales helping the stocks."

Still, Arista beat expectations on the top and bottom line.In spite of the revenue crunch, Arista managed to grow gross margins and hold operating margins flat.Arista continues to gain market share versus Cisco, and sees a total market opportunity of up to $30 billion.","This article was highlighted for PRO+ subscribers, Seeking Alpha’s service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.At one point, Arista Networks (ANET) was an investor favorite. Analysts praised the company's strong growth - among the fastest-growing companies within enterprise hardware - and its proven technology leadership against longtime market incumbent Cisco (CSCO). Recent times, however, have hit Arista hard. In particular, its end-customer demand has been lumpy. Over 2019, Arista shares pulled back hard when the company announced that a certain large customer (presumably Microsoft (MSFT) was delaying its spend), and then yet again last quarter when another large customer (presumably Facebook (FB)) told Arista it would be materially reducing its purchases in the near term.Now, the impact of these large spending gaps are being felt in Arista's financials. Arista's revenues declined for the first time in Q4, and though this was largely expected and revenue still landed above Wall Street consensus, investors sold off Arista post-earnings:Data by YChartsIt would be an understatement to say sentiment is weak for Arista. Though the company doesn't provide full-year guidance, Wall Street consensus (per Yahoo Finance) is predicting the following for Arista this year:Savvy investors willing to take on risk, however, would know that weak sentiment often offers a great opportunity to buy shares of companies with strong moats at a deep discount. After all, Arista's hardware forms the infrastructure that powers the modern cloud. Though large customers like Microsoft or Facebook may have the discretion to cut capex spending in certain quarters, they must eventually spend in order to keep growing.The fact that consensus is calling for contraction in 2020 means Arista has plenty of room to outperform - after all, its demand is incredibly lumpy thanks to its huge concentration of large-value enterprise deals, and it may suddenly return to growth in 2020 (we'll discuss the company's growth drivers shortly). In addition, on the profit side, we've seen evidence in the fourth quarter that despite revenue contractions, Arista has managed to at least maintain, if not even grow, its margin profile and earnings per share. So the fact that consensus is calling for a 7% EPS decline paired with essentially flat revenues isn't exactly supported by Arista's history.Stay long here and buy the dip.Forget the short-term noise about spending pauses and near-term revenue contractions for minute, and consider Arista's position in the networking space (essentially the hardware that connects corporate and institutional campuses and allows for modern computing infrastructure). Gartner, the leading technology industry analyst, has consistently named Arista one of the Leaders in its space. In the latest July 2019 edition of its so-called ""Magic Quadrant"" rankings, Arista beat out its longtime rival Cisco (CSCO) for the top spot in the quadrant (rankings to the upper-right of the square are most favorable):Figure 1. Arista Gartner rankingSource: Arista NetworksTo me, this technology leadership gives Arista a deep moat that gives the business durability despite down-cycles like the past several quarters.We note as well that Arista has continued to take share from incumbent Cisco in its flagship market for data center switches. Since Arista's IPO in 2014, the company has gained about ten points of dollar-based market share, while Cisco has correspondingly lost more than twenty points:Figure 2. Arista vs. Cisco market shareSource: Arista Q4 earnings deckArista's market opportunity is also still vast. Growing adoption of both public and private clouds has also driven the need for hardware spend, and by 2024, Arista expects its total TAM at $30 billion. This implies that its current revenue base of ~$2.4 billion is only ~8% penetrated in this market.Figure 3. Arista TAMSource: Arista Q4 earnings deckYes, enterprise companies that rely on huge deals will see revenue fluctuate from year to year. But as long as Arista's technology leadership is in place, it can continue winning share in this critical market. We note as well that Arista recently announced the acquisition of a company called Big Switch, which has complementary products that help enterprises monitor their network performance. The addition of Big Switch's product portfolio deepens Arista's ambitions to grow beyond hardware and provide a complete platform with software tools. The company expects Big Switch to become accretive to growth in calendar year 2021.There are two key facts to realize in parsing through the details of Arista's fourth-quarter results:See the company's results below:Figure 4. Arista 4Q19 resultsSource: Arista Q4 earnings releaseRevenues contracted -7% y/y to $552.5 million, but came in one point ahead of Wall Street's consensus of $551.2 million. Ita Brennan, Arista's CFO, commented as follows on the demand landscape on the Q4 earnings call:What we have appreciated in spite of this revenue decline, however, is the fact that Arista's profitability didn't plunge alongside its revenue growth - which will be a key differentiator for Arista in an investment climate that has become far more profit-centric.The chart below compares Arista's margin from year to year. The company grew pro forma gross margins by 110bps to 65.2%, and Brennan noted that Arista expects to keep margins in the ~63-65% range. Arista also managed to keep pro forma operating margins at a rich 37.3%:Figure 5. Arista margin trendsSource: Arista Q4 earnings releaseMeanwhile, pro forma EPS still eked out a slight gain to $2.29 (+2% y/y), squarely beating Wall Street's expectations for $2.09 (-7% y/y) - again giving us confidence that Arista can still grow its bottom line even if revenue is under pressure.I view 2019/2020 as trough years for Arista. The global slowdown in demand isn't unique to Arista, however - many businesses have cited geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties, especially with the unknown impacts of the spreading coronavirus, and many have responded by cutting capex (including IT spend). While lumpy businesses like Arista may feel the impacts of temporary spending cuts more deeply than others, I believe Arista's technology leadership and continued innovation despite slow demand will give it an edge in the long run. In addition, its shrewdly-managed business has a proven ability to hold onto profits despite deteriorating revenues - which should help keep investors patient as they wait for Arista to rebound. Stay long here."

However, chances are that the slowdown in growth will only be temporary, and the stock could deliver attractive returns from current price levels over the long term.Arista actually reported better than expected sales and earnings for the third quarter of 2019, with revenue growing 16.2% year over year and earnings per share amounting to $2.69 and beating expectations by $0.28 per share.However, the company provided disappointing guidance for the fourth quarter, with revenue expected to amount to $540-$560 million, considerably below the $686.5 million expected by analysts at the time of the report. Management also warned about slowing demand through 2020.The main reason for this reduced guidance is that one of the cloud titans - most probably Facebook (FB) - has reduced its spending forecasts over the coming quarters. This cloud titan is actually doing two things, they are offering less visibility regarding their spending over the coming quarters, and they are also extending their server assets.From the conference call:This raises a major question for investors. If this is just about reduced visibility and delayed spending by a big customer, then the slowdown is only transitory and hence a buying opportunity. On the other hand, if Arista is losing market share versus the competition, then the damage would be much more serious and permanent.Management addressed this question during the conference call, clearly indicating that the business remains as strong as ever from a competitive perspective.Looking at the evidence, it's important to note that Arista has consistently gained market share versus its largest rival, Cisco (CSCO) over the years.Source: Arista NetworksIn terms of the big picture, initiatives such as 400-gigabit Ethernet and cognitive campus network solutions are still in the first stages, providing plenty of opportunities for growth over the long term.Source: Arista NetworksAs a response to the reduced guidance from the company, Wall Street analysts have significantly cut their earnings and revenue estimates for Arista Networks in 2020.Data by YChartsBased on these reduced expectations, Arista Networks is trading at a forward P/E ratio of 20.46 and a price to sales ratio of 6.23. These valuation levels are more than reasonable, and things get much more interesting when looking at the numbers for 2021 and beyond.Sales and earnings are expected to accelerate in the years ahead, as the company should get back to its long-term growth trajectory.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialEarnings expectations are expected to move in the same direction, a small contraction in 2020 and then a reacceleration in 2021 and forward.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialProviding more details, the tables show the average earnings per share estimate, the implied growth rate and the forward P/E ratio based on these estimates over the years ahead.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialDoing a similar analysis, revenue growth is also expected to regain speed in 2021 and to accelerate further in 2022 and 2023.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialFor 2021 and 2022, the numbers are showing that Arista Networks would be trading at below-average valuation levels in terms of price to earnings and price to sales while also growing both earnings and sales at a vigorous rate.A basic strategy could be waiting for the 2020 slowdown to be over, and then buying the stock as 2021 approaches with better growth prospects for the company. However, this kind of linear reasoning is too simplistic, and things are not that easy in the stock market.In the words of JM Keynes, successful investing is anticipating the anticipation of others. If the company is on track to accelerating growth in 2021 and beyond, chances are that the stock price is going to reflect this much sooner than the financial statements. After all, the stock market is a forward-looking mechanism.Importantly, Arista Networks has an impeccable track record of delivering both sales and earnings above Wall Street expectations over the long term. The company has not missed earnings or sales numbers in one single quarter in the past 16 quarters. This is quite an outstanding trajectory for a company operating in a cyclical and dynamic market.Source: Seeking Alpha EssentialSource: Seeking Alpha EssentialPast performance does not guarantee that the company will continue delivering above expectations in the future. However, the hard data shows that management tends to under-promise and over-deliver throughout the years.If the company continues delivering numbers above Wall Street expectations in the coming quarters, this could be an upside fuel for the stock in 2020, even sales and earnings are declining versus 2019 figures.Arista faces tough competition from a larger player such as Cisco, and the industry is prone to technological disruption. The company has done a great job of gaining market share versus the competition over time, but investors still need to keep a close eye on the competitive landscape in order to make sure that Arista is still leading the industry in terms of technological capabilities and revenue growth rates.Besides, corporate spending is typically quite sensitive to economic conditions. If we get an economic slowdown or even a full-blown recession in the coming quarters, this will probably have a considerable impact on both the company's performance and the stock price. It is only fair to say that Arista Networks carries above-average macroeconomic risk.Those risks being acknowledged, chances are that the recent pullback in Arista will turn out as a buying opportunity for investors. The company has an attractive potential for growth in the long term, but the growth trajectory is also uneven and fluctuating over different periods. Buying as the company goes through a period of slowing growth can make a lot of sense from a contrarian perspective.When a high growth company faces a temporary deceleration in growth, this is generally a buying opportunity for long-term investors who can tolerate the uncertainty in the short term. Based on the information currently at hand, there is no reason to believe that Arista can't generate attractive performance over the coming 3 to 5 years.The slowdown in 2020 is already incorporated into expectations and into the stock price. The market tends to overreact to negative news and a low bar is easier to beat, so I wouldn't be too surprised at all to see Arista outperforming Wall Street Expectations in the coming quarters. If the company gets back on track and growth accelerates in the middle term, then the stock should deliver attractive returns from current price levels."
4320535,98236,2020-01-31T10:24:31-05:00,"Arista shares have bounced sharply since their nadir after the release of quarterly earnings and disastrous guidance.Some of the upside relates to the apparent acquisition of Big Switch by Arista after a hard fought competition with other networking vendors.While cloud titan Microsoft indicated a Q4 decline in capex, other indications from suppliers to the cloud titans such as Intel saw different trends.Arista, long a vendor whose fortunes were firmly tied to the capex of the cloud titans, is pivoting smartly to the enterprise and to the financial institutions segment.Arista's valuation is far below average for its growth rate and cash generation outlook.","This article was highlighted for PRO+ subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. This article was highlighted under our Tech vertical. Find out how you can get access to the best content on Seeking Alpha here.The shares of Arista Networks (ANET) have experienced woeful performance until the last few weeks. Overall, they lost 42% of their value from peak to trough, with the latest trough occurring in early November after the release of Q3 earnings, which were fine and guidance which was dreadful. Lately the shares have bounced around 15% since the start of the year based on hopes that guidance was a bit of a sandbag and regarding the possibility of Arista acquiring Big Switch, one of the key movers in the networking world. (Industry press has confirmed that the deal closed, but there has yet to be a formal press release from either party. I assume a press release is most likely when Arista announces its quarterly earnings on February 13th. The deal is said to be on very favorable terms (a song according to the linked article, and is more about Arista acquiring people and technology.)Should readers consider taking a position in the shares at these levels? I think a strong case can be made for entering the name at this price and at this time. There are plenty of demand growth drivers that have yet to be felt by Arista and which could turn current estimates upside down. The acquisition of Big Switch could mark a renewed period of growth for Arista based on the combination of technologies. And the Intel (INTC) announcement regarding strength in its business from the equivalent of Arista’s cloud titan segment has to be taken positively. But most of all, in a sea of high valued names, ANET shares are painfully cheap, particularly on an EV/S basis, if only the growth, forecast to be negative for the next two quarters, resumes at a meaningful pace.So yes, this is a call to buy the shares, and I intend to do so opportunistically, perhaps starting this week.In the course of editing this article, I became a ware of a downgrade of Arista shares by the analyst at Barclay's from buy to hold. The principle issue raised by the analyst is his contention that Arista is losing market share or its market share gains have stalled in the cloud titan space. That is such an inflammatory comment that I needed to reference it in what is a rather long article. I am not sure as to the basis comment by the Barclay's analyst. Needless to say, it is one that I feel is way off base. At the end of the day, given there aren't very specific statistics by quarter that can be used to determine market share data with regards to cloud data center switching revenues, one is left to rely on proxy data. As I will detail in this article, Arista has indicated that its forecast both for the quarter to be reported, and the for 2020 are predicated on flat to down capex for switching in its key cloud titan vertical. The evidence we have is that is exactly what is happening. Later in this article, I have illustrated from company data that Microsoft has indeed cut its capex. The business results of FB also suggest a company that is likely reducing its capex in an effort to size its infrastructure growth to the growth in revenues. That is precisely the forecast that was made by the Arista management.Because this is a key point for me, I think it reasonable to look at the precise answers made by company management on the market share issue. ""Alex Henderson -- Needham & Company -- AnalystGreat, thank you very much. I was hoping you could spend a little bit of time relative to this cloud issue, to what extent you're confident that there is no competitive incursion here that's causing it, and that in fact you have sustained share at that customer. How can we judge that -- how do you get your arms around, clarity around that point?Jayshree Ullal -- Director, President and Chief Executive OfficerAlex, that's a very good question. From our perspective, the competitive dynamics have not changed in the cloud or in general as we always have aggressive competition and we will continue to see aggression there. But what gives us confidence the cloud titans are delaying their spend or distributing their capex differently is, as you know, we always pride ourselves in a close partnership and relationship with cloud titans. And generally, especially in the case of Facebook and Microsoft, they have been not only a vendor customer relationship, but really a core development that requires the kind of partnership which is engineering to engineering, it's not just business.So, when you look at that, there is no evidence that competitively or white-box wise, there has been any change, there has been a process processing, there is better inventory management, there is better procurement, optimization etc.. And you can always expect these cloud customers of ours to want to be multi-sourced, but it isn't any different than we've seen in the past in behavior, in relationship, in our innovation we have 10, 400 gig products, and lot of then in styles . So, relationship and the technology partnership couldn't be better. Anshul, do you want to add to that?Anshul Sadana -- Chief Operating OfficerSure. Thanks, Jayshree. Alex, we work very closely with these customers to a point where we are working on this 2021 roadmap along with these customers right now. And quite well aware of the thesis they are making with the architecture as well and have very direct feedback from customers as well that there is no alternate that's pleasing us, it's simply the demand has gone down and we are very confident of our share when that demand comes back as well since we collaborate with these customers. So, we're not worried about it. And the customers are pretty direct as well, this is not our share going to someone else. Their demand reduce.Alex Henderson -- Needham & Company -- AnalystOkay. Thank you very much.""One can either accept the specifics of management commentary on market share, or accept the unsubstantiated assertions of the Barclay's analyst. The Barclay's analyst has apparently had some issues in calling this name properly having initiated Arista as a buy last August before the company forecast its problems with the cloud titans. I might also observe that the analyst is positive about Cisco. At some level, it is not really possible to be positive about Cisco and positive about Arista. Either one company has staunched market share losses and is suffering because of macro demand issues, or its smaller rival is continuing to take share. I will take the latter side of that argument based on the industry sources, such as they are, that seemingly suggest that Arista's competitive position remains positive.Arista Networks was founded to cater to users who needed high capacity switches that took advantage of the latest technology-an oversimplified description bound to irk some readers but one that captures the essence of what Arista does. One of its co-founders, Andy Bechtolsheim, is well known as the co-founder of Sun and a founder of Granite, a company that became the core of Cisco’s (CSCO) Gigabit systems unit. And he was one of the early investors in Google. (GOOG).The company’s CEO, Jayshree Ullal has held that role since 2008. Before that, Ms. Ullal had held senior management roles at Cisco and was responsible for the company’s switching portfolio and its offering of unified communications technology.The company was a pioneer in software defined networking and in offering multi-layer switching technology. The company’s Extensible Operating System (EOS) is the core of its technology. The company has always used “merchant silicon” as part of its technology, allowing it both to take advantage of advances in technology and to achieve very high gross margins which are greater than 64% on a non-GAAP basis. The low latency of the company’s switches has appealed to important users, and in particular, what the company calls Cloud Titans, which are firms such as Facebook (FB), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT).For some years, the story was a happy one with but few distractions other than a hard fought IP lawsuit between this company and Cisco. The company was wildly successful and very profitable selling its offerings to both the Cloud Titans identified earlier, to smaller cloud vendors, to financial services companies in need of the low latency and to service providers and enterprises. The company went public back in 2014 at a price of $43/share and first traded at around $58/share.The year the company went public, ANET had revenues of $392 million, EPS of $1.29 on a GAAP basis and operating cash flow of $132 million. This year (2020) the company is forecast to have revenues of $2.4 billion with non-GAAP EPS of $9.06. So, over a span of several years, valuation has compressed noticeably. Is ANET a value name-not quite, but it has an EV/S of less than 6.2x on a forward basis and it has a 30% free cash flow margin.Over the past year, the ANET story has been shaken by issues regarding the growth in demand for some of its cloud titan customers. Different titans at different times have slowed down their procurement of network infrastructure. The issue hasn’t been loss of share, or even an overall slowdown in growth of the cloud titans, but essentially changing architecture that has allowed some of the titans to achieve their latency goals without continuously upgrading servers and switches.And some of the company’s growth initiatives such as the 400 gb switch and the company’s campus switch offering have simply not taken off-or taken off more slowly than the rate that some commentators, including this writer, had once hoped for.Overall, revenue growth which had been 45% as recently as 2017, is now forecast to have been 12% last year and the First Call consensus estimate for 2020 shows a forecast of no growth at all. EPS is forecast to decline by more than 6% at this point, which actually would be a strong result if revenues don’t grow at all. These next two quarters, essentially congruent with company guidance, forecast the nadir of revenue decline, with March quarter revenues expected to fall by 12%.With those kinds of expectations, it is little wonder that Arista’s share price has suffered grievously. Last year, after hitting a high of $328/share in April, the shares imploded to as low as $188 by the start of November. Since then, there has been a strong rally and the shares are now back to the mid-$230 range.Starting earlier this month, Arista shares have rallied very strongly, rising from about $203 at the start of the year to Friday’s close of $238 last Friday, prior to the current panic regarding the Coronavirus and its possible impact on world economic growth. Over that span, the company’s Chief Customer Officer resigned, and then rumors started to fly about the company winning the race to acquire Big Switch. In addition, the earnings release of Intel (INTC), which spoke about robust demand from cloud service provider customers, has lead to some speculation that what Intel saw, Arista is likely to see at some point in the near term.Not all of the potential positives are likely to emerge in one fell swoop. But I do believe there are enough positive potentials to suggest that the risk/rewards of establishing a position at this level makes sense in a portfolio that is willing to own some speculative names.The acquisition of Big Switch by Arista is all about a new direction for the company that involves a much greater focus on the enterprise, and a much lower level of customer concentration. While we do not know just how much revenues the 4 cloud titans have accounted for at Arista, we do know that their slowdown in network switch acquisition has brought the company’s growth to a halt. By acquiring Big Switch, Arista is changing the center of gravity of its go-to-market effort and should become perceived as more of a software company. I do not think that any hyper-growth vendor can survive at this point simply peddling boxes, even if the boxes come with lots of software. I think it is premature for me to speculate precisely how the numbers are going to work. And I think that commentators that might look at historical revenues of Big Switch in evaluating this transaction will be looking at it upside down-this is a merger about changing the future of Arista by buying the technology leader in software defined networking. Just how the revenue synergies play out is really indeterminable at this point and any guesses I make would be just that-guessesAt this point, it hard to speculate just how the relationship between Dell and Big Switch might evolve. Presumably that has been a component of Arista’s evaluation. Overall, the acquisition is likely to help Big Switch revenues maintain triple digit growth for several years into the future, but perhaps of more importance it is likely to help Arista sell its high performance switches to enterprise vendors who may have been reluctant to buy from Arista before it acquired this capability.As mentioned, there has yet to be a formal press release detailing the purported transaction. So much of the following is speculative-although even after the deal is announced, there will be much white space and speculation in figuring out how the two companies will combine and achieve the revenue synergies required to pay for what was inevitably an expensive transaction.How much Arista might have paid for Big Switch is not known-although it is said to be ""a song."" Big Switch is thought to have had multiple suitors over the last several months and of course some of these suitors like Dell have significant financial resources. Arista had gross cash of more than $2.4 billion on its balance sheet at the end of September, and is generating cash at a rate in excess of $800 million so it should not have had trouble in financing the deal. Big Switch may have been burning cash lately; its last capital raise was back in 2017 and just the working capital needed to support an enterprise of this size and with triple digit growth might suggest that the company needed to find a home where capital constraints were not an issue.Big Switch has been a private company which has been growing at triple digit rates for some time now. As opposed to much of Arista’s focus on the cloud titans, this company is focused its sales effort on selling to the Fortune 100 and it has some installations in 30% of those users. While there is no real estimate for revenues, the company has raised about $120 million in venture funding. Some analysts believe that the company has a current revenue run rate of as much as $150 million-but obviously Arista is not buying Big Switch for its current revenues-this is deal about major revenue synergies and one that is likely to redirect some of Arista’s focus.Big Switch was founded by some of the research team that developed software defined networking. There are some observers who have maintained that its founders were just too far ahead of its time. Just to be clear, it is a software company and it has partnered with hardware vendors, and in particular Dell and HPE, with the Dell relationship said to be the most meaningful. It also has relationships with Nutanix and VMW. Big Switch only sells through channel partners at this point. The company uses and contributes to many different open-source communities. I have linked to a couple of evaluations of the Big Switch technology by current users.The company currently offers 2 primary “fabrics.” The Big Cloud Fabric is built with cloud networking design principles and delivers cloud-Network as-a service performance for private cloud platforms such as those offered by VMW, Nutanix, Microsoft and Red Hat. It is another visibility platform, but one that is designed to operate in a multi-cloud environment offering one-click trouble shooting.It’s other major product is called Big Monitoring Fabric. It is known by users as Big Mon-and I have had nothing whatsoever to do with making up that name. That platform is all about providing users with what is known as pervasive visibility which includes elements of predictive analytics, security monitoring, connection tracking and correlations between events and applications.Users have adopted this technology because it lowers TCO by 50% over 5 years, it apparently speeds up new service enablement dramatically and improves change management. There are many competitors in this space, and most larger networking vendors have bought a specialist vendor so they can offer their users something in terms of network management. Arista has lacked a significant competitive capability in attempting to compete in the enterprise with both its network and campus switches by not having this technology and will inevitably be able to enter far more competitive procurement processes than had heretofore been the case.In closing this segment, I think it worth noting that on last quarter’s call, Arista talked about its introduction of CloudVision 2019, a platform designed to bring cloud principles to network operators across “Places in the Cloud.” This is very similar to some of the offerings of Big Switch and I expect to see the Big Switch technology offered as part of Arista’s CloudVision platform as an important offering for the company’s enterprise and financial users.As mentioned earlier, part of the reason for Arista’s share price decline at the time of its last earnings release was its guidance and its comments about demand from cloud titans. Two of Arista’s customers, Microsoft and Facebook are each more than 10% of revenue. Both of these users have seen some variable capex and indeed, this afternoon, MSFT announced that its capex in the December ending quarter had fallen, rather than risen, and that was enough to drag shares of Arista down after hours.I have chosen to provide readers with the exact quote from the call rather than interposing my own filter. Here is the part of script that is relevant, “ After we experienced the pause of a specific Cloud Titans orders in Q2 2019. We were expecting a recovery in second half 2019 for cloud titan spend. In fact, Q3 2019 is a good evidence of that. However, we were recently informed of a shift in procurement strategy with a material reduction in demand from a second cloud titan, reducing their forecast dramatically from original projections for both Q4 2019 and for calendar 2020. Naturally, this type of volatility brings a sudden and severe impact to our Q4 guidance.Given the step in forecast and volatility of this cloud segment, we believe the cloud titan forecast should be modeled as flat to down in calendar 2020.The following quote is from the CFO and is perhaps somewhat different in terms of providing an outlook than the quote from the CEO,“All indications or are these actions do not represent a loss of positioning our share for Arista at these customers, but will likely effect -- will likely result in demand from this part of the business being flat to down on a year-over-year basis for the remainder of 2019 and into 2020. While we are not at this point in a position to provide overall guidance for 2020, we did want to make the following points. at this point, we believe this trend combined with typical Q1 seasonality and the recent updates to cloud forecast described above may result in revenues for the first quarter of 2020. They are approximately 5% below Q4 2019 level.”The current consensus forecast for Q4 and Q1 are almost exactly consistent with the guidance that was in those passages. The guidance as provided would lead to Arista showing revenue declines in Q3 and Q4 by 7.5% and 12% respectively.The CEO elaborated that her concern related to the fact that she believed that cloud titan capex was likely to be flat to down, and that the titans would pivot their capex from networking to infrastructure. Further, the CEO said that the 400gb product line, while shipping to customers, is not seeing adoption at scale tracking the results that were seen when the 100gb product line were introduced. Adoption is slower, although why that might be is not quite clear.Intel, however, in its latest earnings report, covering the period down through 12/31/19 had a different experience and a different outlook as can be seen in the following quote from that company's conference call. “Intel's collection of data-centric businesses achieved record revenue in the fourth quarter, led by record Data Center Group (DCG) revenue. DCG revenue grew 19 percent YoY in the fourth quarter, driven by robust demand from cloud service provider customers.”Intel is a much larger company than Arista, and even the DCG segment is several times the size of Arista. Intel and Arista are not competitors; they often partner and collaborate. And it seems unlikely, simply based on the overall business trends for the cloud titans, that they would make a decision to slow capex growth. While there obviously is not a one for one correlation between revenue growth and capex spending, and cloud titans have many capex priorities, it seems unreasonable to believe that the titans are actually pausing capex or can pause it for very long, and far more reasonable to expect that cloud titans are investing heavily in their infrastructure.It is much more difficult, at least for me, to determine whether the comments of the Arista CEO regarding the reprioritization of capex at the titans is still valid. Apparently, the one titan that essentially shut down their procurement of Arista switches did so in the wake of a shutdown in the procurement of servers. So, at least in this one instance, capex for servers and capex for switches has been correlated. If capex for servers is now rising again, per the comment in the Intel earnings report, than so too, should capex for switches. I think it is evident, given the rather dramatic changes in the forecast being seen for the titans and their procurement of either infrastructure or switches, that there is a material lack of visibility.It isn’t that Arista, and its management had any specific data when they last reported numbers, but the numbing effect of being shut down at one particular user that unnerved management, and lead to what I believe to be hyper-cautious guidance and commentary. My own guess, and I freely acknowledge that is all it is or can be, is that Arista will report upside in revenues, and a return to a more benign demand environment for their cloud titan segment over the course of 2020-although this trend is likely to take a couple of additional quarters before it becomes totally apparent. Overall, I think the likelihood that Arista can achieve double digit revenue growth in 2020 is better than 50/50 and despite the run-up in the shares, the valuation does not reflect that kind of outcome, in my opinion.My thesis regarding investing in Arista is long term. Arista’s success is not specifically about calling a turn in demand for high performance switches from cloud titans. The company itself doesn’t have a perfect record in terms of understanding how cloud titan demand wanes and waxes-and that is putting it kindly. I would be foolish to suggest to readers that I have specific knowledge regarding the outlook for the quarter that will be reported or the quarter that has recently started. And even more emphatically, I can’t foretell what guidance this company might provide for the full year.In one sense, if you are a long term investor, it doesn’t matter greatly. Of course I like to get quarters right, and depending on what is reported and what is forecast the shares will react materially. If the guidance for the full year is still marginal, and still calls for a revenue decline, the shares will go down, and I would far rather buy for less than more. So buying before this quarterly earnings is a gamble-although less of a gamble than it might appear because of the company’s still compressed valuation.My contention is that this company can and will return to mid-teens growth over the next 12-18 months as several demand generating factors start to generate business. I do think it is reasonable to believe that cloud titan capex, and the demand of cloud titans for network switches will revive. But investors should also take account of the other factors that will influence growth.Of course the acquisition of Big Switch is a component of that, and indeed, if it works out as I have tried to suggest might be the case, the revenue synergies from the deal alone would go a long way to change the overall demand curve for Arista. But beyond that, over the past couple of years, the company has made several conspicuous product announcements that are likely to be factors in generating growth for the company outside of the cloud titan area by the second half of this year.Probably the most significant is Arista’s line of Campus Switches. Arista indicated that volumes for the product family had reached or were reaching an annualized rate of $100 million or about 4% of TTM revenues. I think that the campus switch offering from Arista has some unique features and is quite differentiated from the offerings of competitors. Importantly, about 50% of customers are new to Arista. It is apparent that the campus switch offering has driven Arista’s enterprise segment into position as an important revenue segment. It isn't farfetched to expect campus switch revenues to provide a tailwind to total revenues both in 2020 and beyond.The company has launched the next generation of switches, its 400GB -7500 product family It is now about 16 month since the launch, and the company hasn’t seen the kind of acceptance it initially had been expecting. Many observers, including this writer, had expected a demand growth cadence similar to that which had been seen during the introduction of the 100GB product line. Why it has taken longer for the 400GB architecture to get accepted is not readily knowable. Many in the industry have different theories. Arista has talked about the optical components, necessary for deployment, having moved out such that initial deployments of the switch on a mass basis will come in 2H of this year.The introduction of the 100GB solution set “made” Arista. It was the single most salient factor in the company’s hyper-growth and market share gains in 2016-17. The reasons users have migrated progressively to higher performance switches haven’t changed. Users need more bandwidth to support digital transformation applications. The cadence of the migration will not determine the amplitude.Does Arista enjoy the same level of perceived product differentiation withing the 400 GB switch category as it has enjoyed heretofore. That is another issue that is hard for me to determine with any degree of confidence. I have every reason to believe that the advantages that Arista has enjoyed haven’t changed much in this category when compared to the 100GB switch. My guess, too, is that when the apparent logjam of implementation breaks, the upside in demand for Arista will be far greater than anyone might prudently forecast. I have no reason to believe that the growth in demand caused by the advance in technology will not be of a similar magnitude to the growth seen in 2016-17, and that is obviously not what is being factored into forecasts or valuation analysis.Finally, it might be well to suggest that some growth for Arista is likely to be coming from Arista’s other two acquisitions, Metamako and Mojo. Both of these are smaller companies, but both of them have solutions that fit well for Arista’s strategy. Can they produce a few hundred basis points of revenue growth. Both of them fit the thesis of pivoting this business to one with a more balanced revenue profile: Metamako’s solutions are focused on users in financial services with ultra-low latency requirements and Mojo invented the Cognitive WiFi offering that has facilitated the development of cloud managed wireless networking.Recommending ANET shares at this point involves a certain amount of a leap of faith or a leap into the dark if one prefers. I chose to write this article at this time to take advantage of that uncertainty and to comment positively on the potential ANET has to use its Big Switch acquisition to emerge as a different company from one exclusively based on selling high-performance switches to Cloud Titans.There are certainly straws in the wind suggesting that some of the demand obstacles that Arista commented about last quarter have abated. Amongst these would be multiple comments from various companies talking about strength in enterprise IT spending, comments from Intel that its business with cloud providers was very strong in the December quarter and commentary from some 3rd party industry analysts suggesting that the pullback in IT spending is, or will shortly abate. Fundamentally, the growth of the cloud titans, and their need to manage data hasn’t changed; whether the timing of their capex, or its priorities may have changed they still have to manage data in their centers to provide their end-customers low latency service.On the other hand, MSFT’s quarterly report out this afternoon as I write this, showed a noticeable fall in Q4 capex, confirming in part the rather subdued guidance for Arista about which I commented earlier. That said, MSFT is not likely to be able to continue to grow its cloud revenues by over 60% and to grow other components of its business at elevated rates without the necessity of upping its capex at some point over the coming quarters.Arista talked on its latest call about demand issues with its two smallest verticals, Tier 2 Cloud Vendors and Service Providers. I imagine the Service Provider space will continue to be a negative for Arista as it has been for most other vendors selling to service providers . I think the negative sentiment expressed by the management of Arista on its latest call regarding Tier 2 cloud vendors may have been overstated. The overall growth in traffic in the cloud is not slowing, even if that is not always reflected in revenues.I wrote extensively about Big Switch and its potential revenue synergies as well as its acquisition changing the center of gravity of this company. I suppose we are going to have to wait until February 13 before we see an announcement, and just how many details will be revealed at that point is not knowable by this writer. Still, I think that taking the core capabilities of Arista, and moving them into the broader networking space is likely to produce a highly favorable outcome that has yet to be fully discounted.While ANET shares have bounced noticeably from the levels they fell to after the last conference call, the valuation metrics that I use are still materially constrained. Even after a rally of about 26% from the company’s trough, the EV/S ratio is still less than 6.2X and the free cash flow margin is at or over 30%. I have used a 3 year 10% growth rate in finding a growth cohort for Arista. I obviously believe that Arista has a potential to substantially exceed that kind of growth over the next several years, but regardless the shares are more than 40% below the average EV/S for 10% growth. In addition, the shares have a free cash flow margin that is 30% above average for the 10% growth cohort I think the management team is particularly strong as I have detailed in prior articles on the company. Not all of the positives are going to emerge in a single quarter or on a single conference call. But I think the risk/rewards are very strongly stacked in favor of a commitment to the shares at the current time and at the current price."
4282280,96246,2019-08-06T17:09:56-04:00,Arista was much less bullish on capex trends last week than others in tech.Q3 and Q4 may not be much better than Q2. That's the back half pickup?We'll review Q2 capex numbers and cloud comments which point to a slight second half pickup.,"Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and others in tech are expecting a back half bounce back in cloud spending. But based on Arista Networks' (NASDAQ:ANET) comments I think we saw that general level of spend in Q2 already. The second half bounce may be slight. That can disappoint tech investors.I'll review the cloud customer comments on their own budgets along with their numbers.Here's what they said about this coming quarter:Micron's calling for a nice pickup here and now.But Arista said otherwise on their recent earnings conference call""Arista's largest customer segment is cloud customers. They aren't seeing a big jump.Here's the Capex numbers through second quarter just reported by the largest cloud customers.Source: Company Earnings Reports, Elazar Advisors Estimates based on company comments belowI put my own expectations based on what the companies said, which I'll review.The key point is that overall it looks like Q3 and Q4 can be up 10%-11% in capex putting all the numbers together. That's not such a big jump from Q2's 8%. So Q2 is what just drove the numbers. If Q3 isn't that much better than Q2 then we just saw what that second half pickup will look like. Not much.Simple logic - 10%-11% isn't much larger than 8%. It's not the big back half that semi companies are hinting to.But look at last year's Q3 and Q4 up 47-48% in total capex growth.We are going to be nowhere near those levels.So Arista saying growth rates are ""going to hover in the low single digits"" means don't expect big pickups from here.And you see that in the numbers. So there's less capex to go around even if it's a little higher.Look what else Arista had to say and this is what really hurt the stock in the after hours last week.Sell-side analysts are expecting a stronger back half and Arista is not.Here's some of the biggest cloud customers' comments about their own capex budgets on Q2 earnings calls and their outlook.Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)This is Arista's most important customer, Microsoft on capex on their Q2 call:We pointed out the risks Microsoft posed to Arista in our last report, which predicted Q1's weak results and hinted to Q2's disappointment. We pointed out that Microsoft had one-time extra pull-ins into 2018 numbers which makes this year's growth rate tough for Arista.You see above Microsoft is planning flat capex for Q3 next quarter. That does drive a 12% growth rate though.Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)Here's what Amazon said about capex:Amazon's growth rates will start to accelerate.Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)Facebook is slowing their capex plans. Here's what they said on Q2:Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL)Google plans to slow capex ""significantly.""Here's what they said on Q2:So let's conclude. Amazon is picking up their capex spend. Microsoft is keeping their capex spend. Google and Facebook are slowing their capex spend.So more companies are slowing their spend. But by the numbers the spend growth looks like it inches up.The focus of this report is capex. But needless to say the ongoing trade war issues can easily dent capex plans for the second half as well.The heating up of trade tensions probably helped slow growth rates from 40s to 8%.A trade war can cause a continued slowdown through dislocation of the supply chain and a backing off of end demand.So the Q2 growth rate of 8% accelerating to 10%-11% may be at risk. That 2-3% acceleration is not that large to begin with but has risk.So this second half jump people are expecting from cloud is questionable.ConclusionArista sounds more cautious on capex. They had a good quarter and a decent guide but their commentary caused the stock to drop after their report. Their commentary called out slowing capex growth and aggressive estimates.We see from the ""cloud titan"" comments themselves that the second half should be a little better but not a big change higher than Q2. A small change but not big. And that little better depends on how fast Amazon grows.Micron's second half pickup depends on cloud picking back up. Cloud customers told you net-net they don't plan to pick up. The numbers show they may or may not. Arista says they won't.So I don't think it makes sense to be aggressive on a second half pickup."
4306273,76115,2019-11-13T13:49:42-05:00,"Arista Networks announced a drop in spending from a major cloud customer.That cloud customer is Facebook, but do the numbers agree between the two companies?Ultimately, servers and infrastructure will need to be upgraded and expanded, but right now, there's a pause until that refresh occurs.","Arista Networks' (NYSE:ANET) stock was hammered by its recent earnings because guidance for the fourth quarter was well below estimates. In fact, the company guided Q4 for $550M while analysts had it pegged at $686.5M. That's a 20% drop in expectations, and the stock nearly matched that drop - going from $244 a share to $190 a share, now two weeks removed from its report.(Source: dynamiccio.com)Through questioning and prodding, it was revealed by management on the earnings call that Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) was the cloud titan responsible for the reduced spend in Q4 and, ultimately, most of 2020.From the Facebook side of the equation, it appears what Facebook said on its Q3 call corroborates what ANET management is saying for its Q4. From Facebook's call:With one quarter of the year left, it erred on the side of $1B less in capex (from the midpoint of $17B). Being Facebook will become a 10% customer of ANET, and Facebook is investing in data centers and networking, dropping a billion from its capex guidance would be enough to rock ANET's guidance. Considering the size of ANET's guidance miss while including the fact Facebook will become a 10% customer for 2019, a 24% drop in expectations is close enough, especially when considering other smaller factors to confirm management's narrative.Now, the crux of the matter is visibility and not necessarily spend. What does that mean? It means Facebook is moving from projecting its orders two-to-four quarters out to ""just-in-time"" ordering, or in this case, one quarter.This means ANET management has less visibility into Q1, let alone 2020 as a whole. But at the same time, ANET has said Facebook has told them ordering will be down in 2020 as well. It seems confusing considering they are down to one quarter ordering timeframes but see 2020 down as a whole. Nonetheless, management has said Facebook has indicated spend will be down with regards to networking.But let's take a look at what Facebook has indicated. While it solidified capex guidance for 2019, it also gave guidance for 2020 capex.So, Facebook is going from capex spending of $16B in 2019 to capex spending of $18B - a 12.5% increase. This compares to a 15% year-over-year increase in capex spending from 2018's $13.9B to 2019's $16B. So, yes, it's a bit of a slowdown, but it's not a ton. Now, Facebook could be managing capex spend differently, and this appears to be what Arista Networks' management is hinting at - the allocation of capex toward networking.All of that said, this appears ANET gave a conservative look for 2020 and got all of the lowest expectations out in the open. Facebook is not going to stop investing in data centers and networking, though it may extend its refresh cycle and wait until late 2020 to make significant upgrades. This makes sense as 400-gig switching is not ready to be adopted until then, and therefore, Facebook will refresh its network when it refreshes its servers in late-2020/early 2021. But with capex continuing to increase year over year, expecting a major drop in ANET revenues from Facebook is not likely.At the very least of the bull case, Facebook will resume spending in late 2020 as it upgrades its data centers and refreshes server and networking infrastructure. With 400-gig products more likely to be adopted in 2021, this is the time for upgrades to happen, even if there is a pause in early-to-mid 2020.The concern about losing market share and Facebook moving away from ANET products is low. ANET management was very adamant about continuing to work alongside its cloud titans, including Facebook.Customers don't develop products this closely with a vendor if they don't plan on moving those products into their environment. As a major customer, Facebook has a hand in developing for its needs and, therefore, will integrate it into its environment to reap the benefits. So, this isn't an issue of market share loss but an issue of demand and capital spending.So, where do we go with ANET now? Should you buy on this 26-month low for the stock? With shares at valuation lows compared to its history, the stock looks enticing.The F.A.S.T. Graphs representations show this is the furthest the stock has been from its normal P/E ratio even after considering growth. Looking at the revised 2020 earnings numbers, it only amounts to a 5.5% decrease over 2019. I would consider this a place to initiate a position and start small, building as 2020 goes on and the refresh of Facebook comes closer into view. Once the market gets any hint spending from Facebook will return, the stock will jump.FQ2 guidance caused the same ripple in the stock when it was revealed Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was pausing spending. This is a similar situation, except spending growth for Facebook could last more than one quarter. The stock may be dead money in the near-term, but once 2021 and 400-gig switching comes into view, the stock will begin to rally.ANET is in the middle of a lumpy spending environment where many data center titans are pushing spending or making ""just-in-time"" purchases to spend more efficiently. But at the end of the day, these titans will continue to expand their capacity and will need to refresh their servers and infrastructure to remain competitive. Right now, it's merely a pushout of inevitable spend."
4302206,103480,2019-11-04T12:23:51-05:00,"Arista shares plunged more than 20% after the company reported Q3 results, despite beats on the top and bottom line.Concerns resurfaced around spending pauses from one of Arista's largest customers, presumed this time to be Facebook instead of Microsoft.Arista expects this impact to hit hard in Q4, but long-term demand still remains strong.Arista is under pressure because a slew of analysts are rushing to downgrade the stock, but long term, I like the company's earnings growth on a cheap forward P/E of 17.6x.","The article was also shared with PRO+ Tech subscribers - find out more about PRO+ here.One of this year's most inconsistent performers, hands down, has been Arista Networks (ANET). The manufacturer of networking hardware, which has taken significant market share from longtime incumbent Cisco (CSCO) thanks to its cloud-native architecture, has fallen several times this year due to lower capex from the ""cloud titans"" that are its primary customers.After reporting third-quarter earnings results, shares of Arista peeled back more than 20%, decimating the stock's year-to-date gains and putting it down at -12% for the year, versus the S&P 500 which is up more than 20% and at fresh all-time highs.Data by YChartsAt this kind of juncture, investors have to ask themselves: is the slowdown in Arista Networks' business a permanent state of affairs that fundamentally devalues the business, or is it mere sentiment that is pushing down share prices? In my view, it's the latter. Alongside strong third-quarter results, investors shouldn't laser in too much on guidance and commentary from a company that has historically been very conservative in modeling out the future. While Wall Street may be tripping over itself to follow the herd and downgrade Arista stock, investors can buy in now for a major bargain.At current share prices around $185, Arista trades at a bargain-basement P/E ratio of 17.6x, based on Wall Street's current FY20 EPS projections of $10.51. For a company that managed to grow EPS at 27% y/y this quarter despite a year-long warning that fundamentals would slow down in the second half of FY19, I find this valuation multiple to be incredibly attractive. If we give credit to Arista's phenomenal earnings growth rates, Arista is trading at a PEG ratio of just 0.65x. The need for Arista's networking hardware will only proliferate as more enterprises move into the cloud. Though quarter-over-quarter demand may fluctuate, Arista's dominance of the networking hardware space is still in its early innings.Let's cut to the foremost thing on investors' minds: Arista's warning of a spending pause in one of its largest customers. Longtime Arista investors will recognize the situation we're in: alongside the company's first-quarter earnings results, Arista also warned that one of its largest customers had temporarily halted renewal activity. The very next quarter, however, Arista reported that this same customer (believed to be Microsoft (MSFT) had resumed ""normal"" spending levels.Now, the customer likely in question is Facebook (FB), which Arista notes has risen to more than 10% of Arista's overall revenues. Here's what CEO Jayshree Ullal had to say on the spending pause (key points highlighted):This spending pause prompted Arista to release fourth-quarter revenue guidance of $540-$560 million, which is down -8% y/y versus 4Q18 revenues of $595 million. Note that Arista Networks has never seen a quarter of negative y/y revenue growth in its existence, hence investors' panic.Figure 1. Arista Q4 outlookSource: Arista 3Q19 earnings releaseWe have to take a more holistic view of this warning, however. Arista Networks isn't a software business that receives regular subscription payments, nor is it an internet advertising business that generates seasonally fluctuating, yet largely predictable, ad revenues. Arista sells hardware that gets billed as capex to its customers - and a slowdown in business investment has been a constant story all year.Arista's products, however, are not discretionary purchases. A company like Facebook might defer capital expenses until it has a better visibility on its growth trajectory or the macroeconomic environment, but as long as Facebook's data continues to grow, so will its need for networking hardware.And in this space, while there are many rival providers, Arista is hands down considered the category leader. In July, the company was named for the fifth consecutive year in the Leaders quadrant of the annual Gartner Magic Quadrant ranking for technology vendors, giving Arista the highest ""vision"" ranking of any other company in the market.Will revenue and earnings growth get hit in the short term? Certainly. It may take several quarters or years for Facebook (or whatever cloud titan is impacting Arista's results) to resume normal spending levels. But while stock pickers and short-term traders may worry about near-term earnings, I see no red flags that pose new risks to Arista's long-term growth. And in the case of Microsoft just two quarters ago, it only took one quarter for the company to resume its spend.Another encouraging sign is that, irrespective of dimmed guidance for the fourth quarter, Arista achieved better-than-expected results in Q3. See the company's earnings summary below:Figure 1. Arista 3Q19 earnings resultsSource: Arista 3Q19 earnings releaseRevenues grew 16% y/y to $654.4 million, decelerating only one point from last quarter's 17% y/y growth rate and beating Wall Street's expectations of $653.3 million. One interesting note from CFO Ita Brennan's prepared remarks on the call was that international revenues came in at just 19% of the total mix, down from 27% in the year-ago quarter.This illustrates how much revenue that U.S. cloud titans have pumped into Arista's revenue base - and how much opportunity it has to expand overseas.We note as well that Arista has managed to hold on to its extremely high gross margins - roughly flat at 64.4% versus the year-ago quarter. Note that virtually no other hardware company manages to generate gross margins in the ~60% range. Arista Networks has commented that it continues to see 63-65% as a healthy long-term pro forma gross margin target. By comparison, note that Cisco (CSCO) generated a 65.5% pro forma gross margin in its most recent quarter - despite the fact that Cisco owns several huge software assets, such as Webex, that contribute to a richer gross margin. Arista, on the other hand, is a hardware product-oriented company.Arista's earnings have also seen healthy growth. In the year-to-date, Arista's pro forma net income has jumped 26% y/y to $716.9 million, representing a rich 38.6% pro forma operating margin, up 220bps relative to 36.4% in the year-ago quarter. Despite the volatility Arista has already seen this year with large customers delaying purchases, the company has still managed to churn out impressive earnings growth.Similarly, Arista's pro forma EPS of $2.69 in Q3 smashed Wall Street's expectations of $2.41 with 12% upside. Year to date, pro forma EPS is up 31% y/y, while operating cash flows of $635.7 million have more than tripled from the year-ago period.Capex spending on cloud hardware falls under a category that economists might describe as ""derived demand."" Large cloud titans large Microsoft and Facebook may drive the purchasing decisions, but the eventual necessity of the purchase is ultimately governed by the underlying growth in the data and the users - and nobody is arguing that Internet and cloud usage is exploding globally. Instead of focusing on short-term sales, lean on Arista's product leadership positioning in the market and its history of strong operational execution. Stay long here and wait for the rebound."
4281625,103480,2019-08-05T10:18:26-04:00,"Shares of Arista Networks tanked more than 10%, reversing earlier gains, after reporting a beat to Q2 revenues and EPS.Investors are concerned over rather vague language from management regarding a possible slowdown in the second half of FY19.Q3 revenue guidance implies a growth range of 15-17% y/y (in line with this quarter's 17% y/y growth) but is still ahead of Wall Street's consensus.Arista's major customer, whose halting of purchases in Q2 made this quarter weaker, has returned to normal spending levels.Take advantage of the dip in Arista's share price to build a position in a growing industry leader.","For the second quarter in a row now, Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) has been pummeled on its earnings release - not due to missing current results but due to management's vague commentary about the future. This quarter, both Arista's CEO and CFO pointed to potential headwinds in the second half of the year, despite offering a generally upbeat Q3 forecast. Rattled by this news, investors sent shares of Arista Networks spiraling - despite the stock having risen in the immediate reaction to the earnings print.Data by YChartsHistorically, dips have been an opportune time to buy into Arista shares - especially when the catalysts driving the stock down are vague. Recall that last quarter, investors sold off shares of Arista on the news that a large cloud titan (which many presumed to be Microsoft (MSFT)) had temporarily halted purchases of Arista products, impacting Q2 revenues and driving a massive decrease in y/y growth rates to just 17% y/y this quarter, versus 26% y/y in Q1.This issue was quickly resolved. CEO Jayshree Ullal addressed this customer directly during her prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call:The resolution of this spending pause confirmed my earlier thesis that Microsoft's order delay does not represent perishable demand - in order for Microsoft or any other cloud infrastructure giant to continue growing, they must purchase hardware from vendors like Arista. While quarter-to-quarter cadence might be bumpy, Arista will still book the deals in the end.I believe Arista (and its stock) deserves some upside credit for clearing this hurdle and for proving that temporary headwinds like this can often have quick resolutions. Shares are now trading below where they were last quarter and are valued at a bargain basement forward P/E ratio of 23.2x, based on consensus FY20 EPS estimates of $10.55 (per Yahoo Finance). Considering that Arista has grown pro forma EPS by 32% y/y through the first half of FY19 (even after accounting for the tough Q2 period due to the spending halt), this P/E ratio also translates to a PEG ratio of 0.73x - indicating that Arista is undervalued for its growth.Buy the dip and stay long - Arista never stays down for too long.Let's dissect the commentary from the Q2 earnings call that spooked Wall Street. After discussing the success of new product launches and the resumption of orders from the cloud giant presumed to be Microsoft, Arista's CEO sounded off a downbeat note on the rest of FY19:Similarly, CFO Ita Brennan's prepared remarks on the call echoed Ullal's caution:The key takeaways here: Arista seems to have stabilized its demand for the second half of the year (as in, there are no company-specific sales execution issues - problems which are plaguing other cloud peers like DocuSign (DOCU), Pluralsight (PS), and others), but last year's second-half compare will be tough to beat.Despite this dour outlook, however, Arista's revenue guidance for Q3 actually came ahead of consensus:Figure 1. Arista 3Q19 guidanceSource: Arista 2Q19 earnings releaseArista's range of $647-657 million, representing 15-17% y/y growth, came in higher at the midpoint relative to Wall Street's expectations of $650.5 million (+15% y/y). In my view, I'd focus first on the Q3 upside without worrying too much about Q4 and the prior-year comps there. Arista has shown that its order books can flip very rapidly, and it has a history of guiding conservatively and using muted language in the past.Let's now turn to Arista's Q2 results in greater detail, which passed with flying colors on both the top and bottom line:Figure 2. Arista 2Q19 resultsSource: Arista 2Q19 earnings releaseRevenues grew 17% y/y to $608.3 million, surpassing Wall Street's expectations of $606.8 million. As previously noted, Arista's revenue growth slowed down rather dramatically from 26% y/y growth in Q1, but that's largely due to the spending halt from one of Arista's largest customers, presumed to be Microsoft. Arista's CFO additionally noted that its services business (which, unlike software companies, carries high 82% gross margins, better than Arista's product gross margins) saw strong renewal activity and bumped up its share of overall revenues by 50bps to 15.6%.And, despite the large customer headwinds this quarter, Arista continued to make progress on the margin front:Figure 3. Arista margin trendsSource: Arista 2Q19 earnings releasePro forma gross margins ticked up 20bps to 64.7%, while operating margins made a 190bps leap to 38.7%, driven largely by a reduction in R&D spending due to lower levels of prototype/new product expense activity in the period.Overall, Arista managed to generate $2.44 in pro forma EPS, up 26% y/y and crushing Wall Street's estimates of $2.20 with 11% upside. Arista's first-half free cash flow of $357.8 million (representing $366.5 million of OCF, less $8.6 million of capex) also showed respectable 14% y/y growth, providing ample firepower for the $1 billion stock buyback that Arista announced earlier.Arista's steep share price decline despite strong Q2 results represents a good opportunity to buy shares of a perennially strong, category-leading cloud hardware vendor. It's also a good opportunity for Arista's management to push through execution of its $1 billion share buyback program, which at Arista's current share prices could repurchase just under 6% of its outstanding market cap.Arista is a company that has historically been vague and conservative when guiding to its future; but as demonstrated with this quarter's resolution of the Microsoft spending pause issue, the company typically comes out on top. Stay long here."
4281173,104537,2019-08-03T09:12:51-04:00,"Arista Networks reported strong Q2 results.With the expected slowdown of the cloud segment and the entry into the campus area, the company is starting a new phase.The valuation corresponds to a flawless execution.","After a challenging Q1, Arista Networks (ANET) reported Q2 earnings above expectations. Yet, during the after-hours, the stock price dropped 1.92%. Guidance isn't the usual culprit though.The company is now at an inflection point. Management expects growth from the cloud titans to moderate. In the meantime, the company is making its first steps into the campus segment.In this article, I discuss this new phase and its impact on the valuation.Source: Arista (400G data center switch)During the previous quarter, Arista experienced the slowdown of capital spending from some of its more important customers in the cloud titan segment. These issues seem behind. The company recorded revenue growth of 17% and normal activities with these customers resumed.Down to the bottom line, the numbers correspond to a typical strong quarter for Arista. GAAP gross margin at 64.1% stayed in the traditional range of 63% to 65%. Management even indicated the potential extra 10% tariff on Chinese imports wouldn't have any meaningful impact on gross margin.With moving parts, operating expenses represented a smaller percentage of revenue. Due to the product cycle innovation, R&D decreased. In the meantime, sales and marketing increased with the development of businesses outside of the web-scale providers.The midpoint of the Q3 revenue guidance corresponds to a growth of 15.7% year-over-year. And management guided on stable non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 63% to 65% and non-GAAP operating margin of 36%.Beyond the short-term forecasts, I'm more and more interested in the new phase the company is starting.Over the last several years, Arista succeeded in taking advantage of the shift to cloud-based networking. The company developed a brand new portfolio to address this new high-growth market.Dealing with a few huge customers - the web-scale providers - entails low sales and marketing expenses (below 10% of revenue). In the meantime, the scale effect of selling more hardware and software to the existing customers materialized. In contrast, many high-growth software companies spend more than half of their revenue to reach thousands of customers and gain market share.Thus, Arista was already highly profitable several years ago with a much smaller revenue base. And with scale, non-GAAP operating margin now exceeds 35%.Data by YChartsBut a couple of quarters ago, earlier signs of a slowdown in the data center area materialized with reports from other companies like Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), Mellanox (MLNX), and Juniper (JNPR). Arista was impacted a bit later with a challenging Q1. And management indicated during the Q2 earnings call the days of high growth from the cloud titans were over:In the meantime, the entry into the campus segment Arista announced last year is happening. Following its acquisition of Mojo last year, the company announced a unified wired and wireless solution to address the campus segment. CEO Jayshree Ullal said:The table below lists some valuation ratios based on the Q2 results and my assumptions.Source: Author, based on company reportsWith a PE ratio ex-cash of approximately 27x and an EV/Revenue ratio above 7.5x, the market expects strong, double-digit revenue growth to continue over the next several years.But management indicated cloud titans would now represent a growth in the low single digits. Thus, the current valuation assumes Arista will be successful in growing at a strong double-digit rate outside of its cloud titan business. The market also expects the company to still generate strong non-GAAP operating margin above 35%.Yet, addressing the campus market will require a ramp-up of the sales and marketing effort to reach smaller logos. Management indicated sales and marketing expenses would increase to about 10% of sales over the medium term.Expanding its offering outside of the cloud area, Arista will propose a portfolio that is getting closer to its competitors Cisco (CSCO) and Juniper. Despite their bigger scale, Cisco and Juniper operate at a lower operating margin than Arista. Thus, keeping GAAP operating margin above 32% will require strong execution from Arista.Data by YChartsAlso, with this new phase, Arista is entering into a crowded campus market with established vendors that propose a much broader portfolio with security solutions that Arista doesn't offer (yet?).Arista has the potential to succeed in this new phase, though:But with a PE ratio ex-cash above 27x, the market already assumes strong execution and the valuation doesn't provide any margin of safety.As a side note, the company spent $100 million to acquire shares at an average price of $246/share. As I don't estimate Arista is undervalued at this price, this capital allocation decision is another reason for me to not get involved.The investment proposition is changing. The growth from the cloud titans is expected to slow down and the company is making its first steps into the campus segment.But competing in the campus market represents new challenges. Arista must demonstrate its campus portfolio is relevant. Also, the company will compete against established vendors that propose a broader portfolio. Gaining market share while keeping its non-GAAP operating margin above 35% will require flawless execution.With a PE ratio ex-cash above 27x, the market assumes management will succeed in this new phase and the valuation doesn't offer any margin of safety.Note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on my latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."

Wow, right?The two-year means that we add up this year's quarter's growth plus last year's same quarter's growth.To me, that tells you the underlying trend. That smoothes out one timers like Cisco patent issues, or other one-time benefits or hits. It shows you an underlying trend that helps you model forward quarters.Holding that 79% two-year trend put our revenue numbers nicely above the Street. The Street was worried about that slowdown from 40% to 28% in Q2 2018, remember. But the two-year showed you nothing was wrong at all.That's why we went to Strong Buy in July. Our numbers showed big upside.But The Fourth Quarter...What's strange is the fourth quarter reported in mid-February. The Street was pumped that the company didn't slow despite cloud capex slowdown fears.Arista revenues kept the one-year growth trend but actually slowed on the two-year, and we didn't get the revenues we were looking for.The Street was pumped, but we weren't. We stuck with it through to March and early April because the Street was pumped and the stock had momentum.But we stepped off for the same reason we got on board.The two-year slowed in Q4 and the guide implied a slower two-year. For a high-flying high-multiple momentum story, revenue slowdowns are not fun.But something else bothered us...Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) One Timers in 2018A lot of 2018's strength was helped by deferred revenues shifting into 2018 that wasn't going to repeat. Listen to what Arista said on their February call.The deferred revenues from Microsoft could have driven as much as 10% of 2018. It wasn't going to repeat in 2019 so you had this big natural headwind to the numbers. You have that headwind all year.Yet Arista was expecting their cloud vertical to keep up its growth rate. But losing its largest customer's huge revenue benefit was a risk.So when we matched that with the slowing two-year we started to get concerned.Here's what we told subscribers March 26,So you had a slowing two-year trend knowing their largest customer was going to hit revenues negatively by about 10% in 2019. That gave you visibility that revenues could slow further. You had the two-year and the largest customer.Then when we saw Q1 earnings reports from Microsoft, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) all show down capex spends we had even more confirmation that cloud capex was in trouble. Arista is probably one of the most levered companies to cloud capex.This has tech implications with tech capex slowing. The strongest spenders in tech have been cloud companies. Yes, enterprise is starting to pick up but cloud spending slowing meaningfully is not so great and a big impact to overall tech spend.Here's what Microsoft, Arista's largest customer, said April 24, days before Arista's earnings report. Arista reported May 2.To me that was a huge confirmation that their largest customer's capex was down and that could help Arista's two-year slow further.Here's Google's capex reported on April 29, also days before Arista's quarter.The right side is this year vs. the left side, last year.SourceGoogle's capex was way down.Amazon - same thing.One question on Amazon's earnings spoke the same story.So you have three of the biggest US cloud spenders all saying (days before Arista's report) that cloud capex spending was slowing big time.That was a big tell, especially when figuring in the Microsoft one-timer and the slowing 2-year.February GBOONWe pointed out on the chart above where we ""got big."" We like to see stocks way down and start peeking higher. We told subscribers that's the time to ""get big out of nowhere,"" which is our internally famous GBOON acronym.Many in tech are seeing worse trends now and expecting a magical pickup in the second half. Here's what Arista said.That means at the time of their call last week trends were most likely still getting worse.The trends we saw from cloud titans' capex days before Arista's earnings proved correct.Arista has a lack of visibility. Even though they called for a second half pickup here's what they said that means more to me. This means they don't have confidence in the second half,I believe their slowdown in their guide. They don't really know. Their slowdown is happening real time so there's really no way to predict timing of a bottom.We've been pretty vocal that tech and semis have risk for the back half. While companies are reporting weakness now, they are predicting a second half pickup.In my career I have not heard of that much. Usually when you see weakness, you predict weakness. When you see bottoming, you predict improvement.It's not a normal set up that you see things getting worse and you predict for better.I think this is setting up high expectations for the back half that have a high likelihood to disappoint for tech in general.Look at Amazon, Google, and Microsoft all slow their spending.Arista is a great company with huge prospects. We can't know if the slowdown they are seeing is short term or something that can extend for some time. I would guess it can last a quarter or two, but it's something we're going to have to track. Cloud spending is key and Microsoft's spending is key. For now we're staying on the sidelines."
4263464,98236,2019-05-13T10:37:01-04:00,Arista's latest earnings release contained a growth guidance reduction that lead to a noticeable share price pull-backi.The forecast reduction was entirely a function of the cyclicality of Cloud Titan demand.Arista continues to gain market share in its switching business.The turn in the Cloud Titan capex cycle appears to be just on the horizon.Arista is starting to see the fruits of its massive research and development investment and the growth of its enterprise business is accelerating and is likely to continue that trend.,"Just about everyone interested in the matter has seen Arista’s (ANET) quarter by this point and seen the share price implosion in the wake of the weak guidance for this company. It was a huge surprise and disappointment, and no one was more surprised than this writer. The quarter itself, as reported wasn’t terrible, although neither was it a blowout. The upside to EPS came from margins-particularly the improvement in gross margins. It is worth noting that despite the demand speed bump, gross margins, due primarily to the customer mix, have been rising and not falling. And DSO fell noticeably year on year; the quarter was not back-end loaded and the company did nothing unnatural to achieve the numbers that were reported. The company did see an increase in inventories based on the supply chain ramp for the production of new products.Arista’s problems, such as they are, are not competitive or operational but relate to demand in one component of its business, Cloud Titans. The problem, of course, is that Cloud Titans are the company’s most significant business component. And Cloud Titans rarely have a smooth demand pattern-although the comments about one of the Titans halting orders seem a little bit more volatile than one might reasonably anticipate.At this point, ANET shares have lost 20%+ of their value from the high that they made in mid-April. That compares to a total pullback of less than 1% for the IGV over that same time That is, I believe, a substantial and unwarranted reaction to the earnings release and the guidance based on the information currently available. ANET shares at this point are still up by about 25% YTD, but they are essentially flat over the past year which has resulted in a substantially improved relative valuation that is now noticeably below average for the company’s growth cohort and far above average when looking at the relationship of free cash flow to growth. We have, to be sure, recommended the name on several occasions-and continue to do so.I am not likely to claim that I know more about the network switching business than the folks that run ANET. I have said before that the two of this company leaders, Jayshree Ullal and Andy Bechtolsheim, are amongst the crème de ’la crème of the networking world. That remains the case and will remain the case for the foreseeable future. And so far as it goes, I am inclined to believe that Anshul Sadana, Arista’s new COO, and long-serving networking veteran with lengthy careers at both Cisco (CSCO) and Arista, knows more about the day to day activity in the network switching world than anyone else currently in the space.It is obvious that none of these executives has formed an opinion at this time about the specifics of demand from the Cloud Titans in the short term. And of course there is a reason for that: there is simply no data regarding cyclicality on which they might rely to form an informed judgement. It is foolish to make commitments to investors or other stakeholders regarding the cadence of Cloud Titan capex, because trying to forecast things that have really no confirmed historical pattern is just not something that makes sense. My feeling in composing this article, has to be If the executives at ANET are unwilling to forecast beyond Q2, it would be more than a bit presumptuous for me to try to provide a dispositive forecast-although I have suggested, quite specifically growth rate ranges that seem likely to me.But while they haven’t quite formed an opinion regarding the length of the slow-down in Cloud Titan capex, management did talk about the digestion period coming to an end by the end of Q2. That comment by the company's CEO ought to be more considered by investors, than the reluctance of management to talk about specific forecast components beyond Q2.Obviously, the extent to which capacity is consumed by customers of the ilk of the Cloud Titans is the governing factor in the level of their capex. Cloud Titans need data switches to support the growth in transactions-over time there is a close correlation between transactions and Cloud Titan capex and that relationship can’t change materially. So, if the consumption phase of the cycle is coming to an end, then Cloud Titan growth will, of necessity, re accelerate.During the course of the ANET call, management essentially withdrew its forecast of 21% growth for all of 2019-simply because they stated that they lacked the visibility with regards to Cloud Titan demand to support that number-although, to be sure, even in February, Arista executives were not terribly specific about their growth expectations.. Analysts, in turn, have now reduced their consensus revenue growth estimate to about 19.5% growth for both this year and next year. At this point, according to management, it has some visibility of Cloud Titan demand for a quarter or two, and little visibility beyond that.. And just for the record, I think those commentators who want to second guess the management of this company regarding visibility and the consumption of data switches are barking up the wrong tree and are doing so with really unfortunate methodology. My belief, as I express below, is that the current growth consensus will prove to be quite inaccurate. I think growth for Arista will re accelerate in the 2nd half of this year, along with demand from the Cloud Titans, and then will reach 30% or more in 2020. An unorthodox view-perhaps, but I think it is better supported by the evidence than the view embodied in the current consensus.Obviously I do not try to form an opinion about capex for Cloud Titans in a vacuum. One can look at surveys or guess, or do something else. I have think looking at surveys is likely to be more accurate in compiling a forecast than other alternatives. At this point, the investment issue for ANET is pretty much a function of just how soon there will be a recovery in Capex by the large cloud vendors. The important content that I have drawn from looking at the numbers, and the forecast and one can find a variety of different surveys, often with conclusions that are not entirely congruent is that the capex for the Cloud Titans will increase markedly in the second half of this year and will show very strong year over year growth approximating 25% next year. Given my own limitation of resources, when it comes to surveys I have to rely on 3rd parties such as Gartner and IDC, but also on various brokerages that have their own survey teams. Brokerage teams actually do try to specifically forecast capex for the 4 most significant Cloud Titans. I have no reason to suspect their conclusions.. One of the articles on SA suggested that they believed it unlikely to see a 2H 2019 capex acceleration. That is not the conclusion that was reached by the surveys.Since the article in question didn’t rely on much more than the judgement of its author, I will be happy to stake my investment thesis on the surveys that I follow. In particular, I anticipate that there will be a modest growth ramp in 2019. According to the latest survey I have read, 1H-2019 growth will be about 4%. It is that modest growth rate that has done in the current growth outlook for Arista. Indeed, looking at the expected growth for Cloud capex at 4%, and Arista’s revised Q2 growth expectation of around 16%, shows that the company is both likely taking share in its market segment and is also enjoying sustained material growth outside of the Cloud Titan space. The Dell’Oro surveys suggest that Arista has built its market share to around 17%, while Cisco’s market share in the high-speed data center switching market has fallen to about 49%. Cisco is still providing a noticeable price umbrella, and because of that and because of Arista technology, it is probably a low-odds bet to suggest that Arista’s share will continue to rise.As many readers may be aware, 400 Gbps switches have recently become available. The absorption of these switches is likely, at least according to the survey of the 650 Group, to follow much the same trajectory as the acceptance of 100 Gbps switches. I would imagine that some of the strong growth being projected by surveys for 2020 is a reflection of the acceptance of 400 Gbps switches.As was the case with the acceptance of the 100 Gbps switches, I would expect that Arista will have a larger share of the newer technology than it has built in the slower switch market-primarily because its software makes it easier to integrate the new technology into networks that are using the older technology switches.I have written in the past about the advantages that Arista has when it comes to cloud scale architecture. Things like stateful orientation, software reliability and scalable architecture are well reviewed and avoid the process failures inherent in the so-called “spaghetti” codes of past offerings. The use of merchant silicon is another significant advantage for Arista and is seen in the company’s high level of gross margins. I think it is important to re-state-the shortfall that Arista is guiding to has nothing to do with competitive positioning or sales execution-it is solely a function of Cloud capex.The estimates I have most recently seen suggest that capex for cloud service providers will rise by 19% in 2H and then rise by 25% in 2020. I think that a ramp such as that, would take Arista growth rates far above current published First Call consensus expectations. The survey work I have seen is backed up by committed plans of the cloud titans to open new data centers and availability zones. The data centers are obviously going to be commissioned with operating hardware. Arista will supply am increasing share of the data switches in new data centers; the Cloud Titans and Arista have a strong client/supplier relationship that is clearly not coming un-done. It wouldn’t be terribly surprising to see Arista Cloud Titan revenue growth rise from 10% or so this year to as much as 40% next year-levels that are both below and above a 20%+ growth trend and include market share gains for Arista.Arista has been a child of the cloud basically since it started. It was designed to provide product to the cloud and specifically to provide switches to companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB) and Microsoft (MSFT)-the 4 cloud titans. But it sells to other users as well and over time, and despite the torrid growth of the cloud, it will be likely that the other client groups will surpass the size of Cloud Titans as a revenue source for Arista.Probably the most significant potential for Arista is in the Enterprise area, the company’s #2 revenue generator. There has been no growth slowdown in the enterprise area and given the size of the opportunity and the advantages offered by Arista, I have no reason to believe there will be any growth slowdown, either now or into the future. The company had a record number of new $1 million customers in Q1 as it did in Q4, and these are, for the most part, in the enterprise segment. New customers are being closed at a rate of 1/2/day and as Arista becomes established at these customers, it will ultimately generate substantial revenues; much of the evolution of enterprise customers involves Arista landing and then expanding throughout the breadth of enterprises.I have written in past articles about the potential for Arista’s campus switch, a product designed for enterprise users. I think it is reasonable to expect that 2019 will be a year during which Arista is qualified and accepted at many enterprises and continues to take noticeable share from Cisco, Juniper (JNPR) and other vendors in the enterprise space.Arista classifies financial services as a separate vertical apart from the enterprise. And financial services is probably not the strongest vertical at this point. That said, many of the newest Arista products, which will be further discussed by the company during its June analyst day, are likely to resonate with those customers. The company has a segment that it describes as Cloud Specialty and Hosting Providers. This is a relatively small segment by revenue at this point but is growing a bit faster than the cloud titan space this year. Finally, the company’s smallest vertical is the service provider market and this segment has seen lackluster performance and is not expected to improve any time soon.Arista obviously needs to see rapid growth in its Cloud Titan revenue vertical to achieve 30% growth-and that will happen, I believe, but it can grow at mid-teens rates because of the success it is enjoying, primarily in the enterprise area.Arista, like all IT vendors is a product company in that what it sells, for the most part are products. So, the advent of new products which management suggested to be robust, will have a noticeable impact on demand. The company is seeing its software offerings show significant growth.Arista has most recently started to make acquisitions. The acquisitions it has made are technology based. One of these acquisitions, Metamako, is starting to gain traction with enterprise and financial services customers. There are other products that don’t get lots of attention such as CloudVision which is a software telemetry solution that is already starting to add to percentage growth rates. CloudVision bookings doubled last quarter.As noted, I have used a 3 year-growth rate of 31% in evaluating Anet’s valuation. I imagine some observers/readers will quarrel with that kind of outlook. I do think, looking at the specifics of the product offerings and the different verticals, suggests that 31% is quite reasonable and is most likely to be surpassed in 2020. But the fact is, one needn’t quite believe that Arista has a 3-year, 31% growth rate in order to make an investment case for the shares.ANET shares are currently valued at 6.95X EV/S based on a 12-month forward revenue estimate of $2.8 billion. That is really not an aggressive revenue estimate if there is any kind of recovery in Cloud Capex. But an EV/S ratio of 6.95 is actually the average for growth percentages in the mid-high teens.But more than that, ANET is far more profitable than almost all other IT vendors. In fact, based on my own analysis, its free cash flow margins are only surpassed by those of Palo-Alto (PANW), and only rivaled by Adobe (ADBE), Veeva (VEEV) and perhaps (TEAM). And those companies all have much higher EV/S ratios based on their profitability compared to ANET’s valuation.ANET is very profitable because its gross margins are noticeably higher than those of most other hardware vendors. Non-GAAP margins reached 64.5% last quarter and are essentially forecast to remain at that level. The increase in year-over-year gross margins is a function of the mix switch from Cloud Titan to enterprise. Not terribly surprisingly, Enterprise, with smaller average deals, has a higher gross margin than Cloud Titan.Like a few other companies I follow-most notably Atlassian-ANET has been able to trade its investment in research and development, for a very low rate of spending on sales and marketing. Sales and marketing spend, which grew by, 21% on a GAAP basis last quarter, is only 8.6% of revenues. Cisco, by comparison, has a sales and marketing spend ratio of 19.2% on a GAAP basis. Arista spent about 21% of revenues on research and development last quarter, up a bit more than 17% year-on-year. Cisco, by comparison, spent 12.7% of revenues on research and development.Essentially, it is this trade that has allowed Arista to continue to exceed Cisco‘s operating margin, a notable achievement given the relative size of the two companies (Cisco is 20X+ the size of Arista).Arista’s free cash flow margin will closely track its non-GAAP operating margin. The company, somewhat remarkably, has a very low ratio of stock-based comp-far less than most other high-growth tech vendors. Last quarter, stock-based comp was 4% of revenue and 14% of cash flow. Cash flow contracted last quarter, mainly because of a noticeable increase in inventories. The rise in inventories was mainly a product of the company beginning to prepare for production of some of the new products-both announced and unannounced. Over the course of the year, the increase in inventories will likely reverse, and thus the free cash flow margin will continue to rise, albeit at modest levels.It seems to me, that ANET offers investors a combination of growth and profitability that is not to be ignored. It is, to be sure, a hardware company, and it does have customer concentration. But I really would like to be selling solutions that enable the continued growth of Azure and Facebook and Amazon. It is a nice spot. The company’s diversification efforts are under-appreciated, at least by some commentators, and its very successful trade between development spend and sales and marketing is not reflected by its valuation.The shares have been pretty much eviscerated by the company’s growth guidance forecast and it is that forecast that has de-risked the shares and presented an excellent entry point. I am a strong believer as I have been for some time, that Arista will continue to provide investors with positive alpha."
4263474,103480,2019-05-13T10:42:19-04:00,"Since reporting Q1 results, shares of Arista Networks have shed approximately 20%, signaling a technical bear market.
        Investors are concerned over the company's decelerating growth and subpar Q2 forecast, which are largely caused by a delayed renewal by a large tech giant, which many think is Microsoft.
        A push-out in renewal demand is not necessarily lost revenue; Arista may make up for it with strength in the back half of the fiscal year.
        While revenue growth faltered, margins continued to expand, and Arista showed impressive ~40% y/y EPS growth.
        The company announced a $1 billion stock buyback program, indicating that shares are undervalued.","When the market is getting hacked to pieces again, it's a good time for investors to cherry-pick the hardest-hit growth stocks that have recently fallen from grace. One of these names is Arista Networks (ANET). Last year, Arista was an undisputed Wall Street favorite, with analysts praising the company for being a ""Cisco-killer"" (CSCO) and being the most cloud-oriented networking hardware platform; but this year, slowing growth and a fear of commoditization in the hardware space have put immense pressure on Arista stock. Those fears were compounded when, in releasing Q1 results, Arista pointed to upcoming deceleration thanks to a delay in purchases by major cloud companies. Since its earnings release, Arista has shed more than 20%, cutting its year-to-date gains in half:The question for investors now: is Arista headed for a steeper decline, or does this technical correction mark an entry point in this once-favored growth king? In my view, Arista has become a strong buy.Valuation is one of the first metrics we can turn to in order to justify the bullish thesis. Despite the dour forecast for Q2 (shown below; the revenue range represents 16% y/y growth at the midpoint and a ten-point deceleration from Q1), analysts still have a pro forma EPS target of $9.35 for the year, up 17% y/y (per Yahoo Finance).Figure 1. Arista guidanceSource: Arista 1Q19 earnings releaseFurther, despite a slowing of revenue growth even in Q1, Arista's margin and profitability expansion remains unhindered. This quarter, Arista's pro forma EPS grew at 39% y/y. At the company's current share price of $257, the stock trades at a P/E ratio of 27.5x, based on FY19 EPS estimates. If we take into account Arista's phenomenal Q1 EPS growth rate, Arista trades at a PEG ratio of 0.70x - a classic indicator of an undervalued growth stock.The other reason to stay long on Arista is fundamental. While Arista's guidance gives us management's viewpoint on growth in the first half of calendar 2019, the back half of the year is still hazy. It's likely that the cloud vendors that are delaying purchases this year (perhaps in connection with tariff uncertainty) may catch up on their orders in Q3 or Q4. After all, the global cloud expansion is showing no signs of slowing down - SaaS companies are still reporting record earnings quarters. Here's some useful commentary (key points highlighted) from CEO Jayshree Ullal on the Q1 earnings call:Many analysts and commentators have speculated that the ""one cloud titan"" responsible for the slashed forecast is Microsoft. Yet Microsoft Azure's growth shows no signs of risk; Azure revenues rose a startling 75% y/y in Microsoft's most recent quarter, while total commercial cloud revenues jumped 41% y/y. Figure 2. Microsoft Q3 segment metricsSource: Microsoft Q3 earnings releaseIn essence, Microsoft's order delay does not represent perishable demand. It's more than likely that Arista will be able to ""catch up"" in the back half of the calendar year, especially as Ullal noted that Arista's ""new product introductions are slated to ramp in the second half of 2019."" It's also likely that Arista's customers have under-called their Q2 forecast and will place their orders later in Q2, rather than communicating their spending intentions upfront - giving them the flexibility to adjust their order books throughout the quarter. In my view, Arista's slashed valuation and low PEG ratio gives investors a margin of safety to bet on the thesis that hardware orders will recover in Q3 and Q4 as cloud vendors resume their normal pace of spending.Let's now take a closer look at how Arista performed in Q1:Figure 3. Arista Q1 resultsSource: Arista 1Q19 earnings releaseWhen we step away from the lackluster guidance that accompanied it, there's actually a lot to like about Arista's most recent results. Revenues grew 26% y/y to $595.4 million, in-line with Wall Street's estimates but decelerating only one point from last quarter's 27% y/y growth. Arista also continues to make tremendous progress at pushing into international markets, with international revenues now comprising 26% of the total revenue base - up two points from 24% in the year-ago quarter. Arista's gross margin, however, was a bigger highlight in the quarter. The company managed to bump up its sky-high gross margin by an additional 10bps to 64.5%. Note that very few hardware companies are able to achieve such a premium margin - even Cisco (CSCO), whose revenue base includes higher-margin software and services, only has a gross margin in the low 60s:Arista also achieved efficiencies on the operating spend side. Sales and marketing costs consumed only 8.6% of revenues this quarter, versus 8.9% in the year-ago quarter. Similarly, general and administrative costs - which I think of as the ""least productive"" component of operating expenditures - fell to 2.6% of revenues, 160bps lower than 4.2% in 1Q18.These cost controls, in spite of decelerating revenue growth, helped Arista to notch an EPS of $2.31 in the quarter, up 39% y/y and beating Wall Street's consensus estimate of $2.07 with 12% upside. This EPS beat - almost double that of revenue growth - gives us confidence that even if Arista's revenue growth decelerates to the ~16% neighborhood next quarter, the company will still be able to achieve EPS growth in excess of 16%. Recall that Wall Street's EPS target of $9.35 for the current year implies only 17% y/y growth over FY18 EPS, and Arista is already well ahead of that mark with this quarter's results. Arista's ~20% fall from recent heights has made it an incredibly attractive buying proposition. Arista has had many scares like this in the past, and it's always one of the quickest companies to recover. After the December crash in the stock market, for example, Arista shares skyrocketed 51% in the first calendar quarter of 2019 - one of the fastest recoveries in the broader market. Fundamentally, Arista remains a best-in-class vendor of networking hardware that continues to take market share from Cisco. Near-term spending pullbacks by major customers are no indicator of Arista's long-term health. Note also that Arista has a clean balance sheet with $2.15 billion fo cash (representing more than 10% of its market cap) to ride out any near-term weakness. Pick up shares of Arista while its valuation is temporarily slashed - if anything, the company's announcement of a $1 billion buyback is a further indication of management's confidence in Arista's ability to turn the ship around."
4275181,103231,2019-07-16T10:07:37-04:00,"After giving a guide that the market has not liked, the price of Arista shares has fallen to more reasonable levels, considering its historical valuations.Arista's forward ratios show a very attractive valuation, considering double-digit growth and better margins expected in the second quarter.Although executives expect some transitory setbacks in their cloud titans segment, we see that a better mix of customers has made the company more profitable while maintaining double-digit growth.","It seems that the price of Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) has begun to recover after the fall of almost 22% that the weak guidance for the second quarter of 2019 caused in May. The panic caused by the pause in the investment of a key customer that caused this fall has started to dissipate in July, as the stock price increases slightly.Despite this, some analysts remain skeptical about the sustainability and accelerated growth that the company has maintained in recent years. Although the executives' guidance for the second quarter suggests the revenue will continue to grow between 15.5% and 17%, this figure falls well below the three-year average of 37%, which worries investors who begin to believe that the company is entering a period of slowdown.In the past, investments from large cloud customers such as Microsoft (MSFT), which accounts for more than 16% of total revenues, have boosted revenues astronomically. Unfortunately, this has also created a risk of concentration, which begins to blur the future of the company.Despite this, we believe that this risk has generated problems that are only punctual and transitory, and we do not see that it creates long-term repercussions. We recognize that Arista Networks holds competitive advantages such as a strong relationship with its customers and a high switching cost, which gives us confidence in the future of the company. In addition to this, and as a result of the hard blow in the price suffered in past months, we believe that the forward ratios are quite attractive both historically and comparatively.We see that the current uncertainty has generated a buying opportunity for investors interested in Arista Networks. Below, we will show some of the bullish arguments that we believe continue to prevail, as well as some factors that may influence the medium-term recovery of the share price.Source: Arista Networks on Twitter.Arista Networks has achieved a leading position, given the unique characteristics of its EOS software and hardware. Its commitment to developing products and services that allow companies to boost the productivity of their networks and reduce property costs is a quality that has earned it essential customers.Arista has developed an attractive competitive advantage through its relationship with its clients who have been ""loyal"" to the extensible operating system software (EOS) and the company's adjacent products. This loyalty seems to come from the mutual development of projects and the personalization of products for large cloud customers. The cooperation with key companies such as Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has allowed Arista to maintain an accelerated growth in revenues for an extended period.Similarly, both the EPS and the FCF have benefited from this growth in the top line. Arista has positioned itself as one of the fastest-growing companies within the cloud network space, and also one of the most profitable. Its operating margins, which are at an average of three years at 32%, make the double-digit revenue growth more remarkable.Source: Data provided by YCharts.Unfortunately, although the results of the first quarter of 2019 came practically in line with market expectations, executives warned that orders for the second quarter would arrive below normal levels. Management attributes this slowdown to the pause in orders by a cloud titan. Despite this, we think that the introduction of new products such as the network architecture for the Enterprise Campus will begin to bear fruit in the second half of 2019. We believe that this architecture designed to address the transition to the Internet of Things (""IoT "") will reinforce the demand for Arista products such as EOS, CloudVision, and Cognitive Cloud Networking in the medium term.We think that the second half of 2019 will be crucial in the adoption of campus business data centers as their clients migrate to this offer, which will partially compensate for the transitory weakness of their most important vertical, the cloud titan segment. Looking to the future, we see that the addition of new customers for its 100 GB EOS and Ethernet products that the company still maintains is a good sign for growth in the short and medium term, while the adoption of 400 GB Ethernet products still has a good prospect in the long run.With this in mind, we think that Arista could easily maintain growth between 15% and 20% in the next five years. It seems that the company has become a key provider of solutions for a significant customer base, which will continue to grow with them as they continue to expand their capabilities and scale their networks in the cloud.Arista has financial metrics that make it one of the most attractive companies in the cloud networking space. The company has begun to see an expansion in margins as a result of a more diversified customer base, being less dependent on large companies. This customer mix has allowed management to better control operating costs and selling expenses, and to balance margins. As a result of this, executives now expect gross margins for the second quarter to come in the range of 64% to 65%, above the three-year average. In the same way, the operating margin that has historically been about 32% will reach 36% in this period.Although management expects that the pause in the demand by a significant customer will cause a slowdown in growth, it seems that Arista's new offer of higher-margin Enterprise Campus will make the company more profitable in the medium term. In our opinion, this improvement in profitability is enough reason to compensate for the slight deceleration in revenues. Looking at the fundamentals closely, we estimate that Arista will maintain a high fundamental score despite a ""slow"" growth.On the side of the price multiples, we see that Arista's value has reached a turning point, where bearish sentiment has met with the historical valuations of the company. From the perspective of the PS ratio, we see that this multiple has recovered quickly after being briefly below its average of three years, which suggests that the market is willing to pay a high premium despite recent drawbacks. Comparatively, although Arista's valuations cannot be considered ""cheap"" from the perspective of the industry, we see that the company's PS, PE, and EV to EBITDA ratios are now at historically reasonable levels.In addition to this, the forward ratios of Arista are quite attractive compared to current levels, thanks to the bearish sentiment that contracted the price and the double-digit growth and better margins expected for the next quarter. We anticipate that the results for the second quarter, which are scheduled for the first of August, will reach the highest level of executive guidance. Despite this, we believe that the company still maintains a certain degree of uncertainty, which may generate some opportunities for investors who are looking for a better point of entry in the short term. For the long run, we estimate that as the company announces the progress of its new 400 GB Ethernet and campus products, the bullish sentiment will return quickly, which will give Arista a high premium again."
4260704,47521,2019-05-06T21:01:41-04:00,"Exposure to ""cloud titans"" results in weak guidance for next quarter.Guidance overshadows otherwise solid quarterly results.It raises the question of the potentially weak underbelly of the company when large customers face spending pressures.","Source: hpcwireThe share price of Arista (ANET) got hammered after it lowered guidance for the quarter in its earnings report, and its revenue only managed to reach in-line estimates.Management cited the weakness of spending from what it identifies as ""cloud titans"" as the reason for lowering guidance, with one in particular being the main catalyst.In this article we'll look primarily at whether or not this poses a significant problem for the company over the long term, especially now the sector appears to be slowing down.Another key issue is what will happen when the next recession hits and major companies look for ways to cut costs.The bottom line for me going forward is Arista is likely to trade choppy and will find it harder to return to the momentum it has been enjoying.Revenue in the reporting period was in line with estimates, coming in at $595.4 million, up 26 percent year over year, and earnings did very well in the quarter, finishing at $2.31 per share, beating expectations by a hefty 24 cents.On the revenue side, it is a slight concern that it was only able to meet expectations, considering the high valuation of the company and it being a high-growth performer for some time. That, combined with the weak guidance, is what resulted in its share price getting hammered.With investors buying the rumor before the earnings report, many scrambled to get out once the actual earnings news was released. That was one reason the stock took such a big hit, in my opinion.As for the outlook, management downwardly revised its estimates for the next quarter to a range of $600 million to $610 million, significantly below the $639.3 million analysts were looking for.The reason behind the adjustment is the other key reason for punishing the share price, as it cited some of its ""cloud titans"" as the major catalyst for the revision, with an unnamed big customer as the key reason.This points to some risk exposure to its larger customers, which could be a negative catalyst if that trend were to continue.What's somewhat puzzling about Arista in regard to the change in guidance and the reasons behind it is three months ago, after some of its competitors pointed to sales from large cloud customers slowing down, the company said its business with its ""cloud titans"" continued to be strong.While I don't doubt at the time that it was asserted it was the case, it's obvious something happened between that assertion and the earnings report to change the company's narrative. Not only that, but the news had to have been something that happened within a relatively short period of time.In the earnings report the company essentially repeated what its peers stated, that ""massive cloud titan providers fulfilled in 2018 have led to a period of absorption in the first half of 2019.""More important for the thesis of this article is it stated one of its major customers ""has placed most orders on hold for Q2 2019.""As a result of that changed guidance, it points to annual revenue growth of 16 percent, down significantly from the 26 percent growth rate in the first quarter.Exposure to a few big players in this market means the performance of Arista will remain volatile, depending on the various cycles the individual companies are going through, and the resultant change in spend, as happened in the reporting period.Another challenge is the size of these companies allows them to better terms, which would put some downward pressure on gross margins, which I think is going to be an issue going forward.That, combined with the obvious need to boost hiring in its marketing unit in order to attempt to maintain its robust growth rate, means it's highly probable its earnings per share will struggle to grow.Global expansion and the need to target smaller clients in order to continue to grow and reduce risk exposure to larger customers are the major reasons behind this.I think Arista is going to start to struggle more with revenue and earnings as measured against its past performance, and with presumably higher costs to generate revenue, its EPS will start to decline.The overall cloud market isn't going to falter anytime soon, but the needs of many of the companies dominating this market have, overall, already been met, and meaningful growth will have to come from outside its existing customer base, as evidenced by its weak guidance.While I understand this is a one-off situation, it's one I am convinced will happen over the near and long term. For that reason I think the share price, over time, is going to get more choppy, rather than the growth trajectory it has enjoyed over the last three years. This isn't to say the share price of the company is going to collapse, as the catalysts that have driven growth, in general, remain in place. The point is the value of the company already has the large users priced in, and it is observably vulnerable to its major customers changing their spending considerations in any one quarter. If that starts to happen on a consistent basis, it would be a challenge for the company to continue to find support at these prices.Over the next few quarters I don't anticipate this being an issue, unless more surprises are revealed in its earnings report. What I see shareholders needing to do is to keep their future outlook of the company measured against its hefty exposure to ""cloud titans"" that can significantly have a strong effect on its performance. To mitigate that exposure it will have to win a lot of overseas business and business from smaller firms. That means its days of heady EPS performance may be over, even if it scores some solid results in some quarters.Again, I don't see this as a major issue in the near term, but I don't think shareholders should have the same conviction concerning the company as they have had since 2016.Finally, if the decline in cloud demand becomes a trend, this will be a bigger negative catalyst than risk associated with exposure to large companies.In the short term, if the drop in share price continues, it could be considered a favorable time to increase your position, but I think we're going to see the narrative concerning Arista weaken some in the months and years ahead.It should still be a good performer, but I think its pace of growth is going to slow down and be more choppy, even as its EPS comes under pressure. For that reason investors may want to wait to see how the next quarter plays out before making a decision on whether or not to add to their positions in the company, or sell."

In the context of the impressive stock price increase since the beginning of the year, the 14.5% drop in the stock price isn't so important.Even with a disappointing revenue growth forecast, the company still outperforms many network vendors. In this article, I explain why this weak outlook is a temporary event rather than a structural issue.Despite the drop in stock price, the market valuation still doesn't offer any margin of safety.Image source: Arista.comArista delivered slightly better than expected Q1 results. Revenue and GAAP gross margin at $595.4 million and 63.9%, respectively, both exceeded the midpoint of the guidance.Of course, the weak outlook for the next quarter is due to the 15% drop in the stock price. Over the last several quarters, the company has been consistent in delivering a growth rate above 25%.Data by YChartsAs the company is gaining scale, a declining revenue growth rate is expected. During the previous quarter, management indicated being comfortable with a 21% growth rate for 2019.Thus, the forecasted Q2 growth rate of 16.3% was disappointing. During the earnings call, management justified the weak guidance with a slower activity from a few cloud titans:The market reaction was strong as the stock dropped 14.5%. But considering the 47.5% stock price increase since the beginning of the year, the drop isn't that significant. At $265, it still represents a 25.8% year-to-date increase.Also, despite the disappointing forecast, management still expects revenue to grow by 16.3% in Q2. In contrast, Extreme Networks (EXTR) and Juniper Networks (JNPR) both reported a year-over-year revenue decline during this quarter. And both network vendors expect a revenue decline for the next quarter. Cisco (CSCO) didn't release its earnings yet. The giant network vendor reported strong revenue growth over the last several quarters. But it's safe to assume Cisco won't forecast double-digit revenue growth for the next quarter.Beyond the comparison with other network vendors, the most important aspect to consider is that the disappointing guidance isn't due to structural issues. Instead, I see this development as temporary and normal volatility.Arista's strongest segment is the cloud titans, and it depends on a few big customers. In a previous article, I discussed Arista's impressive marketing advantage due to its business with the cloud titans. But this type of business, besides penalizing gross margins due to the cloud giants' negotiating power, involves volatility.This volatility was favorable when the company delivered better-than-expected revenue growth. For instance, after the Q4 results, I highlighted in a previous article that Arista's excellent results contrasted with negative results from other cloud data center providers. The concentration of customers also means some quarters will be less favorable.But the big picture doesn't change. Cloud titans invested with Arista to build scalable and integrated cloud data centers. There's no technology change in the network data center area. The network designs are still based on the elegant and simple spine-leaf principle. Once the spine (core network) is in place, it's easy and cheap to extend the network with a leaf switch. Also, applying the same existing network design and reusing integrated software provide economies of scale to the cloud titans when building data centers.Besides the temporary issues with some cloud titans, management discussed the soft business with security providers and the encouraging performance in the enterprise segment.Taking into account these moving parts, management still expects its operating margin to reach at least 35% and indicated 21% is a fair tax rate to consider.In my previous article, I had estimated a 25% growth rate in 2019. With a lower-than-expected growth rate during Q2, I now assume revenue growth will reach 18% in 2019. The table below shows some valuation ratios based on these assumptions:Source: AuthorEven with a 14.5% drop in the stock price, and based on estimated 2019 results, the market still values the company at a PE ratio ex-cash of about 27.8x and an EV/revenue ratio of 7.6x.Assuming a 25% revenue growth in 2019, the market still values the company at a PE ratio ex-cash of 26.2x.The growth rate, high margins, and a solid business justify the high ratios. But at the current valuation, I don't see any margin of safety.The weak guidance for the next quarter overshadowed the good Q1 results. Arista's long-term potential doesn't change, though. The volatility in the results is a natural consequence of dealing with a limited number of huge customers like cloud titans. There's no change in the network technology, and the cloud giants have invested with Arista to build scalable and integrated architectures.The strong results justify the high valuation ratios. But, even with the 14.5% drop in the stock price, the market valuation doesn't offer any margin of safety.Note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on my latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."

Market's reaction to the earnings announcement was clearly strong, with the stock jumping by 9.6% after the news hit the wires.Revenue during the full-year 2018 amounted to $2.15 billion, an increase of 30.7% versus 2017. Adjusted earnings per share reached $7.96 during the period, a vigorous increase of 35% year over year.

The company has delivered both revenue and earnings numbers above Wall Street's expectations in each and every quarter since the second quarter of 2014. This level of consistency in fundamental momentum is quite exceptional.If the company performs better than expected, this generally means that Wall Street analysts are running from behind and increasing earnings forecasts for it in the future. Unsurprisingly, stock prices and earnings expectations tend to move in the same direction over time.The chart below shows how earnings forecasts for Arista Networks in both the current year and next fiscal year have evolved over time.

But the stock is not overvalued at all, especially if the company keeps crushing expectations in the future.Wall Street analysts are on average expecting Arista to make $8.89 and $10.31 in earnings per share for 2019 and 2020 respectively. If the company meets those numbers, then the stock would be trading at a forward PE ratio of 29.7 for the current year and 25.6 for next year.These valuation levels are clearly demanding, but not excessive at all for a company that is delivering revenue growth well above 25% year over year and expanding profitability.Besides, valuation is a dynamic as opposed to a static concept. Arista has an exceptional track record in terms of delivering earnings numbers above expectations over the long term. If the company continues exceeding expectations in the future, this would make the stock much cheaper than what current numbers are showing.The PowerFactors system is a quantitative algorithm available to members in my research service, ""The Data-Driven Investor.""

The company has solid numbers across the four quantitative drivers: quality (99.39), value (85.57), fundamental momentum (98.9), and relative strength (60.65). This means that the big picture in Arista Networks looks clearly attractive from a quantitative perspective.Only because the numbers look strong, this does not guarantee that Arista will outperform the market going forward. On average, companies with strong quantitative metrics tend to outperform the market more often than not. However, this does not tell us much about how a single stock will perform over a particular year.Arista needs to continue reinvesting for growth in order to sustain its technological advantage, and the company is facing tough competition from bigger players with deep pockets such as Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).

The networking hardware company has had a challenging summer, dropping from highs above $300 back into the low $200s, but after the company's Q3 earnings release, a ~15% share price pop positions the company for a near-term rebound. Faith in Arista had been evaporating for most of the year - especially when rumors surfaced that Amazon (AMZN) would be entering into the enterprise switch market at low-cost, white-box prices. These rumors were later dispelled, but that did little to remove the worries that Arista was facing commoditization of its core hardware products and that its gross margins would eventually tumble down.ANET data by YChartsArista's most recent results - and in fact, its earnings trends all year long - have shown only a company that is leading innovation in cloud-enabled networking hardware and is constantly winning market share against Cisco (CSCO), the decades-old giant of the space. In spite of fears that Arista would suffer from both sharp revenue deceleration and gross margin deterioration, its results have proven that it's currently not at risk of either.It's worth noting as well that Arista Networks joined the S&P 500 in August, a key psychological milestone that confirms Arista's critical position in both the IT landscape and in U.S. enterprise. It's also a consistent winner of awards - from lists of fastest-growing companies, to technical awards from Gartner. In a nutshell - Arista is incredibly appealing from both a raw fundamentals perspective as well as from a narrative and momentum front. Obviously, this caliber of quality doesn't come cheap - Arista is trading at a 36x forward P/E ratio, but considering the company's earnings growth power - in the year-to-date, Arista has grown its pro forma EPS by a massive 46% y/y - it's not too ridiculous of a price to pay for a company with a stable long-term growth trajectory.There are several risks, of course, to this thesis. The most obvious risk is competition - Cisco is a much older and better-funded company than Arista, and though it has slackened on the innovation front in recent years, its recent crisis of survival may force the networking giant to step up its competitive game against Arista. Cisco has upped its software offerings lately - something which Arista lacks. In addition, though the Amazon scare has mostly died down, there's no telling when a white-box competitor can come in and push prices and margins down in the sector.That said, however, Arista has maintained its leadership position for a reason: it has earned a solid reputation as ""best-of-breed"" in the networking space. In my view, investors should stick to Arista as a multi-year, long-term hold.Here's a look at Arista's most recent quarterly results:Figure 1. Arista 3Q18 resultsSource: Arista investor relationsRevenues grew 29% y/y to $563.3 million, actually accelerating one point over last quarter's growth rate of 28% y/y. This is a fairly wide beat over Wall Street's expectations of $548.7 million, or +25% y/y. Evidently, the consensus opinion held that Arista would decelerate growth - not the other way around.During the third quarter, Arita launched 400 gigabit platforms - offerings which support 400G ethernet, which Arista claims delivers four times the throughput and double the power efficiency of its prior 100G products. This is a cloud-native offering that is well suited to complex, demanding applications - introduced in response to customer needs. This is an example of the type of growth-driving innovation that Arista has consistently engaged in.It's also worth noting that Arista managed to eke up its gross margins in the quarter as well. The company achieved gross margins of 64.2% on a GAAP basis this quarter, up 10 bps relative to 64.1% in the year-ago quarter. Last quarter, too, Arista had managed a 10 bps gross margin increase. Though this is only a small bump, earlier in the year Arista was up against widespread fears that margins would fall as competition kicked into higher gear. Arista has, to the contrary, maintained its wide margin premium against Cisco - which, despite the inclusion of higher-margin software offerings, still carries a ~3-point margin deficit to Arista:CSCO Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsOn a pro forma basis, Arista hit 64.6% gross margins, up 20 bps from the year-ago quarter. With a pro forma margin guidance of 63-65% for the fourth quarter, the company is also signaling that it continues to expect margins to come in at current elevated levels.The only disappointing note in the quarter was that operating margins declined - largely due to a 48% y/y increase in R&D spending to $117.6 million, consuming 21% of Arista's revenues versus 18% in the year-ago quarter. Innovation has been key to Arista's continued market share gains, however, so investors should be patient with Arista as it continues to scale and gain operating efficiencies. On the plus side, general and administrative costs - the ""least productive"" component of operating spend - declined -21% y/y to $15.3 million. Arista still managed to grow GAAP operating income by 28% y/y to $180.8 million, but on a pro forma basis, operating margins dipped 150 bps to 37.1%, versus 38.6% in the year-ago quarter. Still, however, we must stress that Arista carries a premium margin profile relative to most hardware companies - and certainly one that connotes a value-added, non-commodity product offering.Arista also generated $2.11 of pro forma EPS in the quarter, smashing Wall Street's expectations of $1.85 with 15% upside. Year-to-date, that takes Arista's earnings growth to 46% y/y. During these nine months, Arista has also more than doubled its operating cash flows, as shown in the table below:Figure 2. Arista OCFSource: Arista investor relationsArista's third-quarter results serve as a breath of relief to investors who had expected to see Arista begin to decelerate on the top-line and possibly see some near-term margin contraction. The long-term growth thesis for Arista is still very much intact: Arista is continuing a healthy pace of innovation and maintaining its premium positioning in a market that is seeing robust end-customer demand for datacenter and IT hardware.Though investors will have to keep a close eye as competitors encroach on its space, Arista's moat seems well-defined for the near future. Even after this quarter's gains, Arista still remains ~15% off highs that it reached in the late summer. Hold on to this stock for the long term."

But the fundamentals of the company didn't change. Management even reported results above expectations during the last earnings. And the revenue is still expected to grow above 20% for the next quarters.The stock price dropped below my estimation of fair value of $212. I'm still not buying as I require a margin of safety. But this drop is an opportunity to verify the validity of a key aspect of Arista's success.Revenue has been growing at a CAGR above 20% while net income margins gravitate at about 20%. A key factor to this performance is the low sales and marketing expense. But is it a sustainable advantage? Before answering this question, let's see why Arista is unique from this perspective.Image source: NeuPaddy via PixabayIn the tech industry, the performance of Arista is exceptional. Companies that achieve a similar growth rate usually report a low - or negative - GAAP net margin.The graph below compares the revenue growth of Arista with other network and security vendors. Cisco (CSCO) and Juniper (JNPR) are obvious references. I have chosen to include security vendors as there is no network vendor with Arista's growth profile. And the security and network businesses are similar. They both sell hardware and software to build IT infrastructures.ANET Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsOver the last 4 years, Arista has been growing revenue at a higher rate than the other companies listed above. The growth is comparable with Palo Alto (PANW), Proofpoint (PFPT), and - to a lesser extent - Fortinet (FTNT), though.The next graph compares the profits margins. I exclude Cisco and Juniper as their revenue don't match Arista's growth. ANET Profit Margin (Annual) data by YChartsWhile Arista has been generating net margins of about 20%, the other fast-growing IT companies delivered GAAP net margins between approximately -40% et +2%. Besides the quality of the respective solutions the companies propose, there is one explanation for Arista's exceptional performance. Sales and marketing expenses are way below what the other fast-growing tech companies spend as a percentage of revenue. And this advantage is not due to scale as all these companies generate annual sales in the range of $1 to $2.5 billion.The 35%+ sales and marketing margin advantage for Arista is huge. The question of the health and the sustainability of such low expenses is legitimate.There are many reasons for Arista to spend less on sales and marketing. But over the long-term, and considering Arista's strategy, I expect the sales and marketing expenses (as a percentage of sales) to increase.Let's see why Arista can afford lower sales and marketing expenses and why this competitive advantage will diminish over time.Arista started its business selling network switches and software to the cloud providers. Arista also addressed other verticals starting with big customers in a niche (banks with high-frequency trading activities). The limited number of these customers and their scale favor low sales and marketing expenses. Acquiring one customer in the web-scale area can yield great results. As an illustration, management recently confirmed Microsoft (MSFT) still represented way more than 10% of sales at Q3 2018.By turning to enterprises and smaller businesses, Arista will face a new challenge. The number of potential customers is more important than web-scale providers. But the sales potential per customer is much lower. Arista will need a more versatile and denser sales force. The company will also have to adapt its sales strategy. Solutions will become more complex with the integration of the campus infrastructure. Sales teams will have to speak to different corporate levels instead of dealing with web-scale engineers. Check Point (CHKP) is currently following this path to address the weaknesses of its sales processes. In the Q3 conference call, Check Point mentioned the importance of reaching higher level management. The goal is to pitch sales of solutions and architectures at management level instead of speaking to engineers to sell a product.The growth overseas will also increase the costs. Currently, U.S. sales still represented more than 72% of revenue during Q3 2018. And the three big web-scale providers (Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft) are American companies. So, the development overseas will not generate as much web-scale business as in the U.S.Thus, the low sales and marketing expenses are not sustainable. But it's not that bad for three reasons:For the next quarters, I will check the sales and marketing expenses and the costs of revenue progress in opposite directions. If that's the case, there's no reason to worry about the higher sales and marketing expenses.I highlighted in my last article about Proofpoint the recent convergence of the valuations for the fast-growing IT security companies. Despite its unique combination of revenue growth and high net margins, Arista is no exception to this valuation trend. The market values the company at an EV/Revenue (Forward) ratio of 5.ANET EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsThat doesn't mean the market is offering a bargain as I estimate the other high-growth IT company overvalued. But at least, Arista is a bargain relative to these peers.As there is no change to the fundamentals of the company and considering the sustainability of the margins, I keep my estimation of the fair value at $212 per share. The company reported last earnings above expectations. The fundamentals didn't change. Yet, the stock price dropped by more than 35% off its highs about 6 months ago.Due to the nature of its business with web-scalers, Arista has been growing at a fast rate while generating high net margins. Even if sales and marketing expenses will not stay so low over the long-term, the company will still generate high margins and growth for the foreseeable future.Yet, the market values the company at the same EV/Sales ratio as other fast-growing IT companies that generate GAAP losses. Considering the fundamentals are still solid, I keep my estimation of fair value at $212 per share."

What does that mean for 2019?Our Marketplace Roundtable panel tackles the direction of the sector.FAANG gets a close look, with views on Facebook diverging especially widely.The panel considers the recent semiconductor downturn, as well as big stories from China to self-driving car progress.The panel shares their range of top ideas for 2019, ranging from familiar big names to a few under the radar ideas.","2018 seems to be ending on a bad note in the markets. December is setting the wrong kind of records, and Q4 has been a bumpy one in general. This is what happens in the stock market sometimes, but it's been easy to forget over the decade-long bull market.We're using the end of the year as a chance to lift our heads, survey the market, and see what might be coming ahead. To do so, we're inviting our Marketplace authors to do a series of roundtables. 2018 was another steady growth year for the platform, and we have a lot of great voices on the Marketplace, so we wanted to share their perspective with you.Our Year End Marketplace Roundtable series will run through the first full market week in January. We'll feature ten different roundtable discussions, with expert panels chiming in on Tech, Energy, Dividends, Other Income strategies, Gold, Value Investing, Small-Caps, Alternative investing strategies, Biotech, and the Macro outlook.This roundtable looks at tech, which led the market higher and is doing so again lower, with the Nasdaq hitting a bear market in the last full week of the year. What's going on? We asked our panel to make sense of the situation:Tom Lloyd: Deviation from the mean describes almost perfectly what is happening to the Tech Stocks. Just take a look at the monthly charts for Apple (AAPL) and Netflix (NFLX) and you can see how irrationally the market, the ETFs and the robot trading had moved price to unsustainable highs. The efficient market eventually kicks in and price returns to the mean. I am looking for bargains where the pullback is overdone and in 3 to 5 years the stocks will double. I am just waiting for the bottoms to be confirmed so I can put them back in my model portfolio once again.Elazar Advisors, LLC: Tech was doing great in 2017 and the first half of 2018 but hit a brick wall in the third quarter. We told subscribers to be hedged through just about all of October, November and December because we saw that earnings growth was peaking. Earnings drive stock prices. Q3 ended up being even worse than we expected. Q4 should be no different. Be careful.Damon Verial: In the short term, it certainly does feel like the NASDAQ hasn’t been doing well. But as stated, tech stocks are actually up as a whole. The fear right now is a product of the recency illusion: That this time is different. In fact, every bull market has corrections, and these corrections are healthy for their ability to prevent real bubbles, such as that of 2000. As the economic environment is still one of growth, I am confident that this current pullback is a mere correction and not a repeat of 2000.Michael Wiggins De Oliveira: It has been a year of two halves. In the first half of 2018, tech stocks were fashionably in favor. It became a brainless transaction for many market participants. But towards the back end of 2018, there has been a slightly more subdued market. Now, here is the thing, while many investors are panicking, and while the market has been swift in its sell-off, it has not been, overall, all that bad. There are still plenty of names, such as Amazon (AMZN) and Netflix, which still carry egregious valuations. Yes, there are some pockets which have been grounded slightly, like Nvidia (NVDA), but even then, these slightly cheaper opportunities are not yet trading in the bargain basement. Overall, the market is still very expensive – contrary to most investors’ opinion.The Freedonia Cooperative: Regardless of green or red, 2018 is going to go down as a defining year for tech in terms of privacy and security. Facebook (FB) bore the brunt of it this year and I think they'll continue to do so; but Google (GOOG) and Apple may find themselves under fire with recent reports on apps tracking locations. Tech is still seen as a major good in American life, but tides are changing where the size, scope, and microeconomics that these companies support are going to come into questions of fear from users. Companies are going to have to both invest in privacy in 2019 and assure users of it; bringing spikes in investments here and/or changes in business strategy that relies heavily on targeted advertisement.Joe Albano: Tech has seen a myriad of factors play into its ups and downs with much of it balancing out to a neutral sentiment albeit barely green year overall. Social media stocks such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter (TWTR) are feeling the effects of incidents and allegations brought to light throughout the year leaving them in a flat-to-down return for the year. On the other hand, software has seen a pretty stable year as tariffs on physical items haven't affected these companies nearly as directly - companies like CyberArk (CYBR), FireEye (FEYE), and Microsoft (MSFT). Hardware has seen the best of times and the worst of times this year. Many 52-week highs were made just a few months ago including Nvidia and Apple, both of which dealing with retail-sided pressure. Tech performance overall has fragmented forcing investors to find where the pockets of strength are. It's not as easy as filling the shopping cart with everything from aisle 4, and so this is where the advantage of knowing the industry to know what will perform well comes into play.App Economy Insights:  I don’t look at the market on a calendar year basis and would rather focus on where we are in the credit cycle. While 2018 might look almost flat, there is a much bigger story here. On December 20th, for the first time since 2008, the NASDAQ entered bear market territory, falling more than 20% from its record reached at the end of August. This bear market was much needed after a 10-year bull run. I welcome it as a great time for opportunities to put new money to work. Investors who maintain a diversified portfolio and stay invested so they experience the subsequent recovery should not be harmed. Remaining focused on the long term is an important thing to do when in the middle of a bear market.B&B Market: The majority of 2018 has been a strong year for technology companies, however hectic is a great word to summarize the year. The NASDAQ had returned 15% as of the beginning of October but has lost 17% in the last 2 months, making the YTD return about -5% as of this writing. This year, the markets were plagued by privacy scandals, government attacks, and a trade war as some notable events. The markets became extremely volatile near the end of the year and I foresee the beginning of 2019 to act similarly.Matt Bohlsen: 2018 for tech has been a tale of two halves - H1 2018 was good, and H2 2018 has been bad. In particular, late 2018 has seen risk-off sentiment due to the US-China trade war and rising US rates. Fundamentals have not really changed, except for greater regulator scrutiny on the way tech companies use customers' data and some slowdown in the tech giants' growth rates which was to be expected.Billy Duberstein: Well... it ain't green anymore as of 12/20 as I write this! I think the word I'd use to describe 2018 is ""Whipsaw."" Tech is a mixture of high-growth, high-multiple software companies and cyclical chip/hardware stocks. In the wake of the 2017 tax cuts, U.S. growth accelerated, leading to blowout results and fueling optimism. Then, Trump started the trade war with China in the Spring, which has, at least rhetorically, escalated since that time. In addition, the October Bloomberg Businessweek article about Chinese hacking of Super Micro Computer motherboards called into question the security of much of the tech supply chain. Then, just as soon as we get a trade ""truce"" in early December, the Canadians arrest the CFO of Huawei for violating Iran sanctions. These tensions fueled fears that a wrench would be thrown into global trade generally and the tech supply chain specifically. Add in the Fed going somewhat on autopilot with rate hikes, and all of that growth optimism has reversed (killing cyclicals) while investors began to use higher discount rate assumptions (killing high P/E growth stocks at the same time). So, there was a huge whipsaw in sentiment from extremely positive in 1H to extremely negative in the matter of a few months. ""Whipsaw!"" Quite a change from the low-volatility environment we were in last year.Mark Hibben: It was a good year up until the beginning of October. Then a number of factors converged that caused the market to sell off many tech companies. There was weak earnings guidance from companies such as Apple and Nvidia. There was fear that the trade war would hurt, both directly and indirectly, companies that do business in China or which have production in China. Bloomberg's The Big Hack, which alleged that the Chinese had infiltrated the data centers of companies like Amazon through modified server hardware, seemed to heighten the paranoia concerning China. And there were numerous analyst warnings about a ""chip slowdown"" which the media applied indiscriminately to all semiconductor companies. The combined effect has been to drive many companies negative on the year. However, many of these companies represent buying opportunities, and I plan on making purchases in 2019.Tom Lloyd: No, the story has not changed and the only thing that has changed is price and how cheap you can buy them. I keep thinking about how Warren Buffett was smart enough to buy Apple at the very bottom. Now we will have that opportunity with all of the FAANG stocks. I don’t see one loser, but obviously some stocks are going to stay bottoming longer than others.Elazar Advisors, LLC: They seemed to all slow in Q3 for different reasons. I think it's safe to stay away as long as their growth rates continue to contract. High multiple stocks with contracting growth rates is not a pretty formula. Usually it takes at least 4 quarters for a company to work out of a slowing trend. But you can't just buy in four quarters. You'd first need some inkling that something's improving.Damon Verial: FAANG is a coin termed by Jim Cramer, who has been shown statistically to be wrong more often than right. As an analyst with mainstream appeal, Jim Cramer gains more from speaking about popular stocks than stocks that are likely to outperform. I don’t choose my plays by the popularity of the stock but by the probability that the stock will move in a certain direction.Michael Wiggins De Oliveira: FAANGs make for a catchy name. However, that’s all it is, nothing more than a journalistic sounding name. Because, for instance, even within the FAANGs themselves, there are huge valuation discrepancies. For example, no rational and experienced investor should make the argument that Apple and Amazon should be similarly valued. Yet currently we find them trading with similar market caps. More specifically, we know that Amazon’s Q4 2018 results are guided to post revenue growth of between 10%-20%. While presently, investors are pricing in substantially higher growth. On the other hand, Apple is growing its top line around 15%, yet investors are not willing to pay more than 15 times earnings. And remember, Apple has a rock solid balance sheet and an accelerated share repurchase program which has more than $50 billion allocated for repurchases over the near to medium-term. Amazon, on the other hand, carries a weak balance sheet with debt and capital leases and yet investors are willing to pay more than 90 times its earnings. In summary, the story has not changed as much as investors believe. Amazon was in favor at the start of 2018 and it still is. Apple, Facebook and Alphabet were cheap earlier in the year and they still are. The only question mark could be around Netflix. While it appears that its bubble may have started to deflate, it’s too soon to call it one way or another. For now, Netflix is still very much in favor with investors.The Freedonia Cooperative: Facebook is the first to feel the burn of this, but I think others will soon. Social Media is so reliant on data-based microtargeting because it has few other inherent value propositions in terms of revenue; but Google may have some of this coming, as well as Amazon, who took the lead in 2018 in product search.Joe Albano: All for one and one for all is the best way to sum it up. Facebook's issues aren't affecting Netflix, but Netflix is down almost 40% from its July highs while its business looks pretty decent on a subscriber momentum basis. Amazon has had its political struggles, down 25% since its highs. Each has had their unique struggles but being the largest companies traded, it's easy to deflate these stock prices first especially as high valuation leaders (exceptions of course). They all have their own problems, but they all seem to affect each other - the answer is they each represent a leading and relevant facet of our society. Therefore, one weakened pillar supposes the idea the other pillars are not far behind.App Economy Insights: To a certain extent, the air that came out of FAANG is mean reversion working its magic. Investors should not reasonably expect a +20% year time and time again. Google, Apple, Amazon have built platforms and ecosystems that developers, publishers and consumers will probably rely on for the decades to come. Government regulation has been the theme in 2018 for social media giants like Google and Facebook. More of these growing pains should be expected in the coming years. These are necessary steps in their outstanding growth stories. It might create a lower ceiling than expected on their overall potential, but it will create an even stronger moat around their leading positions.  David Pinsen: I think the business story is still the tension between their moats as oligopolies and the threat (however small in the near term) of antitrust or other regulatory action against them. Amazon increasing its minimum wage in the U.S. to $15 per hour (nearly double the current federal minimum wage) can be seen as an attempt to ward this off.Matt Bohlsen: Facebook has seen user growth slow down or stall especially in developed markets such as the US and Europe; however, developing markets such as Asia are still growing well. Amazon has seen their revenue growth rate slow. Apple is seeing a slowdown in global smartphone sales. Netflix sales growth is still strong and doing well from a smaller base than those mentioned above. Alphabet growth has slowed. What this all tells us is that the % growth of the very large FAANG stocks has slowed, with the smaller Netflix as the exception. It is like China GDP - the growth rate % can slow, but due to the massive size, the raw number growth is still impressive. Investors will need to expect a bit lower (but still positive) rates of return on big tech going forward. Valuations have been adjusting in H2 2018, and are now closer to fair value, and worth starting to accumulate again.Billy Duberstein: Stories are always changing with FAANG, which is why these huge companies are so interesting, but the most significant story change is indeed Facebook. The degree to which the story has changed is unclear, but there are now some legitimate questions around the business model. Facebook is still very profitable and growing, but there is a big concern around how much it will have to spend to police its platform and if the margins of the company are now structurally lower, or if the margin contraction next year will be a one-off. There is also some concern around data privacy. I'm not sure if the company's ads will be quite as effective if users withhold meaningful data from the company (I suspect they will still be pretty effective though). But I don't think there will be much defection from the platforms. Thank God the company also bought Instagram, which most users probably don't even know is owned by the same company. Instagram really seems to be doing well and beating Snapchat at its own game. There's also some personality drama around Zuckerberg and Sandberg, but I don't think the average user or advertiser cares that much about that stuff. I lean towards Facebook turning out okay in the long run, but my confidence in Facebook is admittedly now the lowest of the FAANGs. Since the others have now all sold off as well this month (Facebook fell first), I'd prefer the other FAANGs to Facebook, though I didn't necessarily think that some months ago when the others were relatively more expensive. That being said, these companies all remain incredible businesses and I think all are probably good long-term buys after the recent swoon, Facebook being the riskiest.Mark Hibben: FAANG is kind of a convenience category and these companies don't always have a much in common. I've never been a fan of the ad supported social media companies such as Facebook and Google. I consider Netflix still overvalued, although it's not as bad as it was. Apple and Amazon I consider to be interesting ""new paradigm"" semiconductor companies. New paradigm companies design their own processors rather than buy from commodity vendors such as Intel. Apple has been doing this for years for its iOS devices, and Amazon recently joined the ranks of the new paradigm when it announced that it was deploying custom designed ARM processors in its data centers. Although the recent downturn has certainly affected their valuations, I don't think it's changed my fundamental takes on these companies. The social media companies are mainly about merchandising personal information. This is becoming more of an issue, and I don't think it's an issue that can be solved without fairly dramatic change to their business models. I avoid social media companies, but consider the new paradigm to be the wave of the future in semiconductors.Juan Carlos Zuleta: I beg to differ - I am instead of the opinion that the second half of the year and in particular the last three months of 2018 was bad for FAANG because all of reasons that triggered the fall of their stocks occurred beginning July. Here I am talking about Facebook's scandal over data privacy; Amazon's Q3 earnings report; Apple's legal battle with Qualcomm (QCOM); Netflix's drop in subscriber growth due to competition; and Google's European fine over security flaws.Hans Hauge: Facebook has become a tech dinosaur. I think what we're seeing now is their slow decline. Just talk to any kid on the street and ask them what they think of Facebook. They'll tell you it's just not cool anymore. Besides that, people who are interested in privacy jumped ship long ago, and the rest of the population is only hanging around because, well there's nowhere better to go yet. Does that mean Facebook is a bad investment? I'm not saying that, they could continue to make money, good money even; despite being long in the tooth.Tom Lloyd: Facebook is probably dead money for 2019, but once it moves off the bottom, I think it will zoom back to making new highs. Unfortunately, it has enormous challenges, but I think Zuckerberg has shown he knows how to handle challenges. Facebook is in dry dock for repairs to its leaky boat, but be ready for the launch and a less leaky boat making the trip around the world and taking Facebook back to new highs and beyond. Facebook becomes even more important in a recession as users spend more time on it. Ad budgets will be cut during a recession, but Facebook may take more market share, rather than less. I think they will beat Google.Elazar Advisors, LLC: I think this is getting worse. The company guided now two quarters in a row specifically citing a slowdown in revenue growth. Based on what Mark Zuckerberg has said publicly that 2019 will be a tough year I think this trend can continue to worsen. Facebook has a problem. They are trying to muscle their core customer's usage habits from passive consumption back to social engagement. Typically they've done a good job chasing consumer habits. Now they are trying to change them? This is not a safe stock. We are below the Street for earnings.Damon Verial: Facebook is safe. The company has a monopoly on social media advertising and arguably the best customer metrics in the industry. As a former digital marketer, I’ve used practically every digital advertisement vendor on the internet, and Facebook stands out as the best in terms of specific targeting. While Google advertisements get you more exposure, Facebook offers marketers the ability to target virtually any specific group intersection (e.g., newly wed women in their 20s who are interested in cosmetics). Some analysts consider Google and Facebook competitors, but the truth is both of these companies are monopolies in their given niche and can operate alongside each other, provided Google Plus never gets big or Facebook never creates a search engine. As the marketing becomes increasingly digital, stealing revenue from television, radio, and the like, both Facebook and Google should continue to grow their revenue and earnings.Michael Wiggins De Oliveira: Facebook is my best idea among the tech stocks. There is no scenario where the stock is not undervalued. Pick any metric. Most investors could not seriously expect Facebook to continue to grow in the medium term at plus 40% year-over-year as it has been. Those days are gone. But what’s left?Well, it's my strong contention that Facebook can grow above 20% year-over-year over the next 2-3 years. Having said that, most investors are fearful (understandably) of Facebook’s elevated operational expenses, which are going to hit between 40%-50% in 2019 - worse case assumption Facebook’s FY 2019 operating expenses will reach $47 billion. In other words, Facebook’s operating income will hover around $27 billion. Is that so bad? For a company priced at $420 billion market cap? This implies that Facebook is being priced at roughly 15 times operating income. And we should remember, that Facebook’s balance sheet carries around $40 billion of cash and equivalents (and no debt). Moreover, two further aspects need to be brought to the front of the thesis. Facebook is an extremely asset-light business, where 30% of its revenue ends up as free cash flow. In essence, Facebook is not a capital intensive business, where a large portion of its earnings need to be reinvested, no. Not at all. And finally, investors should recognise that Facebook has increased its allocation for share repurchases by $9 billion to $24 billion. If this is not a sign of management’s confidence in the business, I don’t know what is.The Freedonia Cooperative: It'll rebound and have enough capital to reinvent itself (I believe they still have no debt on their books) — but it'll need to find a way to repair its image with the young people who are active on mobile but also more conscious of what's happening in the tech arena.Joe Albano: Facebook has been mired in PR report after PR report - none of which have been positive. The media is doing much the same they do in politics - if they don't like you, it doesn't matter what is happening, you're wrong. Also much like the media, when they move onto their next target, the last target falls to the wayside. 2019 could be that transition to the next target while Facebook works toward its goal of moving toward Stories and Messenger (also WhatsApp) revenue. If both happen, then Facebook will be on the map again for stock price appreciation.App Economy Insights: The story that has changed the most during 2018 has certainly been Facebook amid scandals of election meddling, private information usage, and management transparency. There will be consequences that will soon unravel: regulations will come with additional costs for the company to keep its platforms in check, some of the revenue growth could suffer from tougher rules around private information, and the hidden costs of a much-needed re-shuffle of the leadership team given the way they have handled PR.For 2019 and beyond, Facebook remains an outstanding business that is bigger than the sum of its parts. They are learning the hard way but will come out much stronger on the other side, with new rules and standards that will be very hard to replicate for any newcomer. Remember: even Google wasn’t able to build a sustainable social media platform.B&B Market: Facebook is a stock that has been abused this year. The company has been involved in multiple privacy scandals, on its main platform and on others such as WhatsApp. However, the stock is currently trading at very attractive multiples compared to historical norms. While I am not personally a user of Facebook, I see the data showing that it is a booming business. Users are reaching all-time highs, ad-revenue is strong, and the company is actively diversifying its business line into other segments such as VR and competitors like the Instagram acquisition. The market has beaten the stock down in 2018, I see this reversing in the future. Valuation wise, this is a strong opportunity to buy in my opinion.David Pinsen: Of the FAANGs, Facebook would be the most vulnerable to antitrust action, because its core platform has been in decline, and it has depended on acquisitions (e.g. Instagram, WhatsApp) to attract users. Whether there will be any antitrust action against it in 2019, I don't know, but the company faces other challenges regardless, such as the lawsuits by video advertisers.Matt Bohlsen: Facebook platform overall user growth will slow, but monetisation across their various platforms should improve. Further data scrutiny and some fines can be expected. Overall, 2019 should see a solid but not spectacular year for Facebook with the stock price recovering to back above USD 150 and probably closer to USD 175, assuming no significant global slowdown and poor sentiment.Billy Duberstein: 2019 should be flat earnings on higher spending. The big question is if the company can moderate spending and continue to raise ad prices in 2020 and beyond to rejuvenate operating leverage. It will be interesting to see how long the terrible headlines last for Facebook - there seems to be a new one each week and I don't see that changing in the near-term unfortunately. How patient will investors be?Mark Hibben:  Facebook usage appears to be on the decline, according to a recent Pew survey. I'm not convinced that more extensive privacy settings will be enough to solve Facebook's fundamental problems of fake news and foreign exploitation. This is a problem not unique to Facebook, of course, but is general in social media.Jeffrey Himelson:  I see regulatory measures disrupting its business model.Tom Lloyd: Tesla (TSLA) seems to be Teflon coated for the time being. By all accounts they should have gone bankrupt, but the stock keeps climbing to that $420 target of Elon Musk, just to prove the regulators were wrong and Elon was right. It is too risky and too overvalued for our model portfolio. Computer assisted driving is taking over all cars and Tesla is at the cutting edge here and in the electric car. This is the Tech story that will affect everyone that drives a car in the next 5 years.Elazar Advisors, LLC: The trade war was just news until it hit earnings. Earnings are what drives stock prices and corporate CEOs all blinked slowing purchasing decisions in Q3 waiting for trade war resolution. Until that is resolved, I see tech continuing to slow. What bigger story is there?Damon Verial: On the topic of Facebook, note that the company gains its data essentially for free, from its users’ (not paying customers) devices. Facebook has come preinstalled on many phone brands for some time now, but a more recent development will allow the company to acquire even more detailed data. Before 2019, a new Android update (which will be automatic, without a permission prompt) will force users to allow the OS to continually update Facebook with your phone information, including SMS and call logs. Of course, Google has a hand in this because Android is its OS. The question is whether Google will be collecting data for their own use as well.The Freedonia Cooperative: Facebook and Cambridge Analytics and the fallout from that being seen elsewhere.Joe Albano: The global economic story - it's affecting everything including tech. But let's not forget the front half of this year was quite good. There's a lot of uncertainty in the back half of this year and it's causing quick decisions by management in all companies to change investment directions and move to safer places. 'Growth' and 'safe' generally don't go together. Growth requires investment and return on investment and that is being stagnated right now with the state of global affairs. The hope is this doesn't trigger other events and economic faults to appear or the dominoes to fall but the preparation at the end of this year is to ready for it if it does.App Economy Insights:  Coming from the video game industry, the biggest story of 2018 for me has been Fortnite from Epic Games (40% owned by Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY)). Following the success of Fortnite (more than 200 million registered users and $2 billion revenue in 2018), a new expectation of the way we play video games has emerged: cross-platform play, seamlessly syncing people playing on smartphones, PCs and consoles. Not only did Epic Games reveal a new store that will compete with STEAM and Google by disrupting the pricing model on PC and Android (challenging the status quo with a 12% distributor margin), they also announced they will launch free services designed to help developers implement cross-platform play into their games. This is more important than you might think: this paves the way for competitive games to become platform-agnostic and could make existing console hardware mostly irrelevant.B&B Market: Funny enough, the biggest story had to have been the Chinese IP scandal that was just reported in mid-December. Reportedly, the Chinese government has been employing hackers to steal IP from American companies, codenamed ""Operation Cloudhopper"". This story encapsulates all the negative themes that we have seen in the tech markets throughout this year. There is malpractice from China, a break of privacy and law, and there is IP theft which has been a main driver of the US-China tensions. IBM and HP are among the affected and these reports will most likely be a direct impact on the outcome of the recent 90-day cease fire between the 2 nations. It is sure to be interesting to see how the current administration handles this report.David Pinsen: Probably the precipitous declines in the esteems of Facebook's CEO and COO. Sheryl Sandberg was mooted as Hillary Clinton's likely Treasury Secretary had Mrs. Clinton won the election in 2016, and Mark Zuckerberg appeared to be testing the waters for a presidential run of his own before this year's Facebook scandals.Matt Bohlsen: The November launch by Alphabet of autonomous vehicles with no human driver in Phoenix, Arizona. The era of the robo-taxi has arrived. This can be a multi-billion dollar industry, and Alphabet's Waymo is leading the way. It should also help boost electric vehicle sales as EV robo-taxi fleets are purchased. I expect it won't be all smooth sailing, but disruptive change is never that way.Billy Duberstein: I think the China trade war and concerns of hacking/cybersecurity, because so much of the global tech supply chain moves through China, and the issue has really escalated to the forefront of both the business and geopolitical news. How the trade talks play out will be really consequential for tech and could lead to a binary outcome for the Nasdaq next year. Will China and the U.S. find ways to collaborate and prosper together, or will each nation re-trench and engage in an adversarial tech arms race? I would think cooler heads would prevail and that each side would act in its best interest. However, nothing's off the table for this administration or for China, for that matter, which has not been a good actor. On the positive/cool innovation front, you will begin to see the first 5G phones and deployments next year - though it will still be really early days for that. And, of course, the continuing trends of cloud computing/AI/IoT and more automation in every aspect of life both for consumers and enterprises, which is the most important story of this decade and era.Mark Hibben: I actually thought the AWS announcement of the custom ARM chip deployment was the most significant news of 2018. I've been expecting ARM penetration of the datacenter market for some time, but it came from an unexpected source. The hyperscale datacenter providers such as Google, Microsoft, AWS, all have the resources to design their own chips, and I expect more will do so. The handwriting is on the wall for commodity chip makers such as Intel (INTC) and AMD (AMD).Juan Carlos Zuleta: Apart from Facebook's shares fall over data privacy since July, the biggest story in tech this year was the lawsuit battle between Apple and Qualcomm that brought about a victory for Qualcomm after courts in China and Germany ordered to ban imports, sales and offers for sale of various Apple iPhone models in China.Jeffrey Himelson: Privacy concerns.Hans Hauge: The story behind semiconductors is simple, people underestimated the impact of crypto. The cryptocurrency market moves in waves, and from what we've seen the last few years, the waves are getting larger over time. Near the end of 2017, Bitcoin mining machines and graphics cards were selling on the secondary markets for multiples of their retail price. As the market crashed, all those cards flooded the market, and we saw the classic bullwhip effect. Suddenly there's inventory piling up, and it will take some time for this to rectify itself. Semiconductors are a great long term play, and if you can get in while the price is discounted, all the better.Tom Lloyd: This is just the usual cyclical downturn. It should be no surprise to anyone. Just recognize the truth and don’t ride the cycle to the bottom. Micron has to prove this cycle is different. Otherwise investors need to wait for the bottom and the next upcycle.Elazar Advisors, LLC: Semis especially go in cycles. Q3 was a clear drop making Q2 the peak. That would mean that year-over-year growth probably continues down through Q2'19 at least. The problem is this upcycle was a little longer than the typical two years so the risk is the downcycle takes a little longer to work out. This is also not yet a safe group and certainly not before the trade war is resolved. We've been cautious on semis for a few quarters.Damon Verial: Semiconductor stock strength is contingent on tech stock strength, which itself is contingent on the general economy. I believe semiconductors will bounce back shortly.Joe Albano: It's not a downturn like the market thinks of semi downturns. The last downturn was because end demand for an entire category basically came to a halt (PC DRAM) while supply was still ramping. This time it's not a matter of end demand weakening materially and not a matter of drunken supply. Instead, it's an inter-vendor demand issue. After a huge rise in demand, now a few levers have fallen off (crypto mining for one), and there's excess inventory at the OEM level. That inventory is being worked through to the end user, but it softens demand back to the manufacturer. Until this inventory is worked through, there isn't a need for more bits being shipped. However, once inventory is cleared out, the end demand that was still there - ""hidden"" from the manufacturers - will cause a need to put product in the channel. At that point, after a year of capex cuts (controlled supply), there will be an imbalance the other way and demand will overtake supply. Look for this to happen in Q4 2019, if not slightly earlier.Matt Bohlsen: I think we are most likely to have a short term (1 year) lull as global smartphone sales have currently stalled. As we move past this and with the arrival of (and increase of) 5G, robots, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, IoTs, cloud data storage expansion; that will lead to the next upcycle in semiconductors probably not felt until 2020. Many consumers are waiting to upgrade to 5G smartphones which we will start to see in 2019. This will increase further in 2020. 5G will be up to 100 x faster than 4G, and will soon have a huge impact.Billy Duberstein: Very important, and even experts disagree on this question. In my opinion, I think the current slowdown is a pause, or ""air pocket"" amid a powerful secular trend, and I'm sticking to my guns on this. That being said, if the Fed and/or administration makes a policy error on China or anything else and we get a global recession or depression, I'll be wrong, or it will take longer to play out. I happen to think the semi trends are very powerful (""smart everything""), which are battling near-term cyclical concerns - and by the way, these are still just concerns. The economy is still growing. We unfortunately had crypto-mania and tax cuts, leading to a boom, and now trade war and Fed hikes have slammed the brakes. This is not ideal if you are a chip company that's trying to match supply with demand on a near-term basis. I think the long-term picture is still pretty positive for most of these companies.Mark Hibben: I think the market has gotten overly frightened about semis. The news media and the market don't make the distinction between old paradigm, commoditized semiconductor companies such as Intel and Micron, and new paradigm semiconductor companies such as Apple, Nvidia, and Amazon. Memory and storage probably is headed into a cyclical decline, but that doesn't mean that the new paradigm companies will follow. However, the market is acting like semis are a monolithic block. I believe that when the new paradigm companies report December quarter results, they'll surprise to the upside.Tom Lloyd: We are preparing for slowing growth and lower earnings. The Fed, tariffs, gridlock in Congress, impeachment in the White House, combine for a disruptive and toxic brew for the stock market and the economy. We expect those who are Indexing will lose money in 2019 and 2020. So the Indexers need to become stock pickers again and make sure they are only in stocks that are beating the Index. Portfolio managers will rotate to lower beta stocks which will fall less than the market. The Dow stocks seem more attractive than the Nasdaq. We have a daily report on the Dow Index Stocks and only 11 have Sell Signals according to our computer system. I like the Healthcare, Technology and Communications Services ETFs for 2019.Elazar Advisors, LLC: I think 2019 is going to be super volatile, more than we see today. Everybody's going to need to change how they think about stocks, trading and fundamentals. We've added a market overlay component to our service in the last few months and it helped our subscribers hedge out the last three months. Why take risk when the market is showing you it's heading down. Volatile markets are bear markets. It looks like we're early on in that. That said, I want to respect the market up or down but we cannot be complacent hoping stocks only go up. Fundamentals slowing in combination with downtrending volatile markets is something to respect and tread lightly.Damon Verial: I believe that we will see the end of our current bull market and the beginning of a bear market in 2019. This is not tech-specific but will affect the entire market as a whole. The economic variables are peaking and growth is slowing. Once we see growth sloping down, which I predict we will see somewhere around the middle of 2019, the market should be around its peak and begin to fall. This will be a normal, “natural” bear market and is something all investors – tech investors included – should be preparing for as we enter 2019.The Freedonia Cooperative: Crypto (that's my area of expertise here). 2018 was a tough year for it, with the storyline being something akin to the bubble burst. But what happens next? I'm hoping 2019, or perhaps 2020, will be where the real projects separate themselves and show the world what this innovative technology can do to industries. I think we'll see heavily invested-in companies be able to do this first (Ripple, Stellar, Vechain), but the big elephant is going to Bitcoin at least through 2019. So depending on how the world economy adjusts to either let Bitcoin in or lock it out will have a huge effect on the crypto market at large.Joe Albano: Recovery. When does large growth return? That's the question.App Economy Insights: As someone based in the San Francisco Bay Area who covers the App Economy, 2019 couldn’t look more exciting. It looks like it will be the year of the “decacorns” going public such as Uber, Airbnb, Lyft, possibly Pinterest among others. I look forward to following closely the trends that make the rise of the App Economy and the businesses resulting from it so fascinating, both from a consumer and an investor standpoint: the gig economy, experience economy, games as a service, online dating, transportation and more.B&B Market: Given that I focus on China and Chinese ADRs, 2018 had a lot of drama from the trade relations to currency weakness and more. As a result, we saw China stocks get crushed for the majority of the year and only just start to improve. For 2019, I am looking to capitalize on this. A lot of these companies have had revenues, earnings, margins, you name it, improve over the past few years but they are trading at very low multiples. The trade-war has been the focus and while I do not think it will disappear in 2019, I think most of the fear is already priced in.Matt Bohlsen: My top 5 tech trends for 2019 are 5G, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence, Internet of Things [IoTs], and cloud data storage expansion. Many of these themes are just starting to grow now so will take about 3-5 years to really see the full impact.Billy Duberstein: I am leaning towards quality and balance sheet strength. Many high-quality companies have been sold off really hard, so it's a great opportunity to upgrade the quality of your portfolios. Market leadership and a great balance sheet can help mitigate (or take advantage of) near-term volatility, especially in a rising rate environment. Fortunately, there are lots of leading tech companies that are currently in the best financial shape of their lives after the boom times of 2016-2017. Still, I think we will have a somewhat binary outcome in tech, revolving around US-China trade talks. If the U.S. and China make a deal that investors believe in, we could have a huge rally. If we don't, we could languish here. Hard to think it could get worse, but then again, I didn't think we'd be at these levels we're at today.Mark Hibben: I'm mainly hoping that prices stay low for the tech companies I'm interested in so I can load up before prices go back up. For the time being, I'm content to wait until I see some signs of market stabilization, and because I can't afford to buy any more at the moment. I am becoming concerned that the markets could induce a recession through a self-fulfilling prophesy, but right now, the indicators are just for a slowdown. The overall performance of the U.S. and other world economies in 2019 is going to weigh heavily on investors no matter what.Juan Carlos Zuleta: In 2019 I am preparing for more news on electrification of the global automotive industry with China consolidating its leadership and North America surpassing Europe in the second place, which is altogether likely to exert much more pressure over the energy lithium value chain.Hans Hauge: I think Bitcoin (BTC-USD) will be the best performing asset in 2019. Since 2010, we've seen the hash rate double 30 times, the number of transactions double 11 times, and the price double 16 times. Each time we see the price hit a new factor of ten (which has happened five times already), there's a pull back and a ""crypto winter."" During this crypto winter, the technology continues to be upgraded, improved - it evolves. Right now, the exact same thing is happening. Bitcoin's average fee at this activity level was $10-$20 earlier this year, now it's less than $0.40. A majority of the arguments against Bitcoin are based on two things (1) people don't understand what it means, so they just can't process what success would look like or (2) they don't know what drives the value and they just aren't educated on the topic. However, if you really dig in, you'll see why some very smart people have dedicated their careers to the cryptoasset space. Blockchain technology is changing the world, and Bitcoin is the gold standard of the blockchain universe.Tom Lloyd: I expect the market to be down in 2019 and 2020. Therefore, I am very interested in stocks that are already beaten down to their bottoms, have very little downside risk and will bounce back. We will add Facebook, Apple, Nvidia and Netflix to our model portfolio as they bounce up from their bottoms. Micron is not one I am interested in bottom fishing. I think Amazon and Google will beat the Index, but I don’t think they will be in our model portfolio. We let our computer Buy/Hold/Sell Signals tell us on a daily basis.Elazar Advisors, LLC:  I have to tell you there are not so many good ideas out there right now. You have to respect slowing fundamentals. If you do, then you don't want to own much of anything. There are a few great ones though and we've managed to catch big earnings performers in this market downdraft. Twitter is starting to see a big earnings inflection. There was that Citron call that Twitter's going to get hit because of trolls harassing people but Twitter's been on to that already. There was no new news in that call. Twitter's priority throughout '18 was ""health"" removing bad actors. The recent report that Citron cited I think changes nothing in Twitter's already proactive process. In the meantime, more importantly, we saw Twitter with a big Q3, and Q4 is seasonally stronger than Q3. They are making gradual changes to their network that are benefiting usage and advertiser ROI (Return On Investment). They might have an opening with Facebook and Google woes as well. Based on blow-out earnings potential, we see the stock can approach the high-50s which is like 100%+ upside potential.Damon Verial: As previously stated, I believe 2019 will see both the peak of the bull market and the beginning of a bear market. Thus, my thesis for 2019 is not single-fold but two-fold. The market should represent an inverse parabola in this year, so my best idea for Q1-2 2019 will be bullish, while my best idea for Q3-4 2019 will be bearish. As Q3-4 is too early to call, I will simply answer that my best pick for this recent correction and the bounce back is Arista Networks (ANET), a fundamentally solid company still in a growth phase unfairly devalued by the recent selloff and one on which I have recently discussed in my newsletter.Michael Wiggins De Oliveira: Every single large tech company is laser focused on content: either scripted or unscripted. Netflix accomplished the unthinkable and very quickly. It has added 130 million subscribers to its platforms by focusing in on large quantities of scripted content. Furthermore, Netflix's platform has carved out strong time share in consumers’ viewing time. It has indeed been so successful that well financed companies are now all trying to play this same game. Accordingly, 2019 will see Apple enter the foray as well as Disney+. Alphabet’s YouTube has also spoken about its plans to increase viewers' time on YouTube as an educational tool. Additionally, Facebook Watch has also shown determination to aggressively increase the amount of time its users spend watching and interacting with Watch’s content. Obviously, we also have Amazon Video playing this game too. However, a meaningfully less discussed company which I believe might succeed in surprising many investors in 2019 is Discovery (DISCK), of which I’m a shareholder. Discovery’s business model is different from that of Apple’s, Amazon Video or Netflix, in that Discovery’s content is unscripted and very inexpensive to produce. In fact, not only is Discovery’s business model is very cost-effective but Discovery has the IP on all of its content. For viewers of specific genre, be it sports, such as golf on the brand new Golf Tv platform, or Olympics through Eurosports, Discovery leads. Also, among women Discovery has a particularly strong market share. And while the self-propelled myth of cord-cutting appears to be engulfing Wall Street, this has left Discovery trading irrationally cheap. For FY 2019 Discovery is roughly guiding for $3 billion of free cash flow. Which means that currently, Discovery is trading for less than 7 times free cash flow. Compare that with Netflix, which will not have free cash flow for many years, and in the best case scenario, by my own estimates not likely to generate more than $2 billion of free cash flow once it tapers off its elevated content investment - leaving it trading at 50 times future free cash flow multiples. While at same time, its top line is already slowing down to below 30% year-over-year.The Freedonia Cooperative: Anyone following my posts and/or is part of The Coin Agora knows I love Vechain, a logistics blockchain company out of China. Right now, its coin is super discounted (in my opinion) and gives investors a chance to lock up a significant amount of coins before its platform really gets started. In the coming year(s), Vechain will host DNV GL's food shipping blockchain and BYD's electronic car aspect of the carbon credit system—just to name two of many partnerships. It's my favorite bet in crypto and it has nothing to do with disrupting the worldwide financial system—it's just putting logistical data on a blockchain for better record keeping.Joe Albano: The best idea for 2019 is to have cash at the ready. We're in a downtrend in tech and there's no reason to rush in yet. That being said, I like Broadcom (AVGO). It's a standout in the tech space - an outlook that is robust and bullish - while the rest of the sector is not on a firm foundation. Raising the dividend 51% was the ""put your money where your mouth is"" moment and management is putting forth all the right signals. I'm a buyer on technical support tests.App Economy Insights: In a market that is likely to be volatile and possibly with depressed valuation and the prospect of the r-word (recession), I am looking forward to strengthening positions in Enterprise Software. Indeed, Enterprise Software is likely to shine in a slowing economy – while consumer goods may suffer, enterprise software will remain relatively constant. Thus, there will be no shortage of demand for the best-in-class tools that empower the data science, finance, sales and marketing or engineering teams to achieve greatness.B&B Market:  I focus on Chinese ADRs, that is my specialty. The idea that has been on the forefront of my mind lately is Momo (MOMO). The stock reached all-time highs (near-$60) earlier in 2018, but is now back down into the low-$20s. Both top-line and bottom-line are growing at strong double-digit rates, MAUs are increasing every quarter, and the company has recently acquired Tantan, which is also growing in popularity. All of Momo and Tantan are internet platforms that are not impacted directly by tariffs from the trade tensions. However, because of a recent guidance cut (still growing at 40+%), institutional analysts have cut the PT from $60 down to $31. I may have missed the class that states short-term issues warrant a 50% reduction in valuation in the long-term. I am very bullish on this stock and believe that a majority of the Chinese ADRs are undervalued as a result of market overreaction from the trade war.Matt Bohlsen: My best idea is to use the current tech and semiconductor downturn to start to accumulate positions at cheaper prices ready for the next upcycle. For example, I would be accumulating the following:Others that have broad exposure to the above themes are also worth considering such as Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF), Baidu (BIDU), Intel, and Microsoft. Cashed up giants Apple, Facebook, and Microsoft are also good tech names to accumulate at yearly lows.Billy Duberstein: I rode Micron all the way up in the first half of 2018 with terrific gains and then unfortunately rode it all the way back down. It currently trades just over tangible book and the company has $3 billion net cash. The stock just sold off on what *could* be a trough quarter guidance that missed expectations but really doesn't look so bad relative to the current valuation of the company if it is the low point (or close to it) in the cycle. $2 billion net income and ~$1 billion FCF for the next quarter on a $35 billion market cap ain't so bad, especially if it's a trough. Last year the company made $14 billion and ~$10 billion in FCF. The DRAM oligopoly seems to be working to control supply (Micron just announced capex cuts) and the long-term demand outlook for memory should be strong and diverse, even if we are currently in a demand ""air pocket"" (fueled by the boom-bust phenomenon I discussed above). Micron is also structurally a much, much more profitable company than it was just three years ago relative to its Korean competitors, so it should be able to stay profitable in a downturn while also buying back a significant amount of stock at the same time, which it didn't have the means to do in 2016. If the downturn turns out to be milder than feared, this historically low-multiple stock could re-rate higher coming out the other side. You may need to wait a couple quarters and have a strong stomach, but there's multi-bagger potential here, barring a global recession or trade war escalation.Mark Hibben: I think Nvidia is by far the most undervalued stock in my portfolio. It's fundamentally a new paradigm semiconductor company being priced as if it were an old paradigm company with no future. Of all the tech companies in my portfolio, I consider Nvidia to have the greatest growth potential in relative terms. Nvidia is pioneering in many fields, including AI, autonomous machines and high performance computing. Nvidia's Turing architecture GPUs are available for professionals and gamers, and provide real time photorealistic rendering that would have been considered impossible a year ago. Nvidia has no competition in this new category of graphics visualization (called ray-tracing), and has ensured continued leadership for many years due to its ray-tracing patents. I doubt that there's market for three major GPU suppliers (Nvidia, AMD, and Intel), and I believe that AMD will be forced to spin off or sell its Radeon GPU business since it won't be able to compete in ray-tracing. Intel is the most likely buyer.Juan Carlos Zuleta: Tesla is certainly my best bet for 2019 because despite all the problems it faced throughout the year, it demonstrated its shareholders its strength to preserve the value of the company. In this connection, we have to be vigilant as to how and when it proceeds to start assembling EVs in China and launching its long-awaited more affordable Model 3 in the U.S. and elsewhere.Jeffrey Himelson: I see Fitbit receiving FDA clearance, entering into numerous new partnerships and generating returning revenue streams, which will propel the stock in 2019.***Thanks to our panel for sharing their insights on the fast moving tech sector.

4241878,104537,2019-02-18T12:50:45-05:00,Arista reported Q4 earnings above the guidance.The results and the outlook contrast with the warnings from other vendors in the cloud data center area.The stock price rose by more than 30% since January 2019. Arista will have to keep on delivering a strong growth to justify the current valuation.,"Arista (ANET) reported Q4 earnings above the guidance. The performance is even more remarkable in the context of doubts about capital spending of cloud giants during Q4 2018 and H1 2019.And despite an exceptional performance - that will not repeat - with Microsoft (MSFT) in 2018, the guidance confirms the company still expects to grow by 25% in Q1 2019.After the stock price gained more than 30% since January 2019, the valuation is becoming demanding again. Management will still have to deliver a similar growth over the next few years to justify an EV/Sales (forward) ratio at about 7.Image source: bsdrouin via PixabayDuring Q3, management expressed optimism for the hyperscale business over the next few quarters. This segment is important for Arista as the cloud titans vertical represented about 40% of the total sales during FY 2018.The CEO added:Obviously, Arista's performance has been impressive. But I became skeptical about the hyperscale vertical growth considering the warnings from other vendors. About the weakness with its cloud business, Intel (INTC) mentioned:Also, consistent with Intel's forecasts, NVIDIA's (NVDA) management stated:And from a networking perspective, Juniper (JNPR) reported important difficulties in the cloud data center business with no sign of improvement over the next few quarters.Again, in the data center area, Mellanox (MLNX) also highlighted temporary challenges with the Ethernet business:The day before Arista's Q4 earnings, Cisco's (CSCO) management was evasive during the earnings call when speaking about the performance of the hyper-scale business.But Arista's story was different. Revenue grew by 27% YoY to reach $595.7 million, above the guidance at $582 million to $594 million. The gross margin at 64.1% was in line with the guidance of 63% to 65%.The operating margin exceeded the 35% forecast. With an operating income of $222.1 million, the operating margin amounted to 37.3%.Management indicated the revenue from Microsoft in 2018 was exceptional due to many win designs and due to the timing for the recognition of deferred revenue. The revenue from Microsoft represented 27% of the total 2018 revenue. But the company is confident that the growth will continue even with Microsoft revenue going back to about 10% of total revenue as from 2019. Despite the warnings from other vendors, Arista will benefit from the cloud data center tailwind.For instance, Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) will invest $13 billion in the U.S. for data centers and offices. And speaking about the cloud business, Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, mentioned:We could argue Arista's business in the cloud data centers is different from Intel and NVIDIA as it is not directly related to servers. And it is true. Capital spending timing is also different. Hyperscalers must first deploy a network infrastructure before implementing servers and connect them to the network. But Arista's results also contrast with the weaknesses network providers like Extreme Networks (EXTR) and Juniper reported. Of course, Arista profits from the tailwind of the cloud data center growth. But the contrast with other vendors shows Arista's performance is due to the strength of its portfolio.Despite the lower forecasted contribution from Microsoft to the revenue, management expects cloud titans to account for about a third of the 2019 revenue.Q1 2019 revenue is expected to be in the range of $588 million to $598 million, representing 25% year-over-year growth at the mid-point.The gross margin should stay stable at 63% to 65%. And during the earnings call, management indicated the target operating margin would amount to about 35%.Thus, for the valuation, I assume a 2019 revenue growth rate of 25%. My estimated net income margin is calculated from a 35% operating income margin and a 21% tax rate.Source: author, based on company reportsWith a PE ratio ex-cash of about 26.1 (based on estimated 2019 earnings), the valuation is becoming demanding.From the EV/Sales (forward) ratio perspective, Arista is more expensive than Cisco and Juniper.But the higher margins and the strong growth justify the higher valuation.Yet, Arista will have to keep on delivering strong growth while expanding to the campus segment. The net cash position of $2 billion can be used to acquire businesses and accelerate expansion. But external growth comes with extra integration challenges and higher risks.By contrast with other data center vendors, Arista delivered again a strong quarter with results above the guidance. And while other companies warned on a challenging H1 2019 in the data center segment, management is confident in growing revenue by 25% in Q1.After gaining more than 30% since early January, the stock price is back to high levels. With an EV/sales (forward) ratio at about 7, the company will have to keep on reporting impressive results to justify the valuation.Note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on my latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4217964,104537,2018-11-04T05:59:47-05:00,Q3 earnings above expectations.The company keeps on gaining market share in the cloud data center area.I give my opinion about the stock price and I provide my estimation of the fair value based on my discounted cash flow model.,"Arista (ANET) reported Q3 results above expectations. The 28.7% revenue growth and stable margins YoY lead to a GAAP EPS increase to $2.08.At this pace, the company is taking market share in the cloud data center area. These results contrast with the difficulties some other network vendors highlighted during the last few quarters.With a strong Q4 guidance and with the optimism management expressed during the earnings call, the market values the company at a premium. The $263 stock price implies a PE ratio ex-cash of about 39. With my discounted cash flow model, I value the company at about $212/share.Arista continues to impress with results exceeding the guidance. Revenue, at $563.3 million, grew by 28.7% YoY despite a tough comparison with Q3 2017.The GAAP gross margins and operating income stayed stable YoY at 64.2% and 32.1%.As a result of growing sales and stable margins, diluted GAAP EPS kept on growing to $2.08. The graph below shows the non-GAAP EPS growth over the last 8 quarters.Source: Q3 2018 presentationThese developments contrast with the difficulties Juniper (JNPR) and Extreme Networks (EXTR) expressed in the cloud networking area. And Arista keeps on taking market share in the cloud area from Cisco (CSCO).Source: Q3 2018 presentationDespite concerns about the reduced spending of cloud providers, management still sees a healthy market:Source: Q3 2018 earnings callAnd with the strategy of expanding the success of the cloud data center to the campus, management communicated encouraging early signs.Source: Q3 2018 earnings callIt is too early to predict that Arista will gain market share the same way as the company did in the cloud data centers, though. The company still can't offer a complete campus solution due to its limited portfolio.The tariff decisions don't seem to affect the competitive landscape. Arista adopted the same strategy as Juniper. While trying to mitigate the consequences by adapting the supply chain, the company will pass a part of the costs to the customers. And management indicated gross margin would stay in the standard range of 63% to 65%.There were also a lot of discussions around the 400-gig developments during the earnings call. But I don't see any competitive advantage for any network vendor with this development. Cisco and Arista announced during the last week of October the coming release of 400-gig switches. While Cisco claimed the availability of these switches during H1 2019, Arista spoke about deployments during H2 2019:Source: Q3 2018 earnings callJuniper communicated in July about the ramp-up of its 400-gig switches during 2019.In any case, the main network vendors seem to propose a commercial 400-gig offer during 2019. A few months difference for the release of these products will not make any difference in terms of market share.The Q4 revenue guidance indicates a range of $582 million to $594 million. For the valuation, I assume the mid-point of the guidance, which results in revenue growth for the FY 2018 of about 30%.I assume a GAAP operating margin of 30% and a 21% tax rate. Thus, my estimation of GAAP net margin amounts to 23.7%.Source: author, based on company reportsEven if Arista is a great company, a PE ratio of about 39 values the company at a premium.The table below presents my estimations of the stock price based on my following assumptions:Source: authorThe table shows we need to apply a 7% discount rate and a multiple of 18x to the earnings beyond 2022 to justify a stock price of $261.Considering the profile of the company, I prefer to apply an arbitrary discount rate of 9%. I chose a 15x multiple to the earnings after 2022 to arrive at an estimation of a fair stock price at $212. The $212 stock price corresponds to a PE ratio ex-cash of about 30.Arista again exceeded expectations with Q3 revenue growth of 27.8% YoY. The company is taking market share from other network vendors, including Cisco. These results contrast with the difficulties Juniper and Extreme Networks reported in the cloud data center market.The tariff decisions and the developments related to the 400-gig switches don't affect the competitive landscape. Management is optimistic and guided on strong Q4 revenue growth.As a result, the market values the company at a high PE ratio ex-cash of about 39 (with the stock price currently at $263). With my discounted cash flow model, I estimate a fair price of about $212/share, which corresponds to a PE ratio ex-cash of approximately 30.Note: To receive real-time alerts about my articles, click on the ""Follow"" link at the top of this page next to my name."

        Shares have 50% upside to my 12 month price target.","Arista Networks (ANET) is a disruptor in the networking industry growing revenues at double digit run rates but trading at only 28 times forward earnings. Shares are a very strong buy with 50% upside in the next twelve months.Seeing red sucks. But in the long term, volatility is just noise that doesn’t hurt the portfolio. What it does occasionally do, however, is present attractive entry points in high quality stocks. One such example is that of ANET, which has dropped hard from its highs:As we will soon see, this selloff has occurred in a name which is a best of breed disruptor in a large market while flowing plenty of cash flow. This is a gift and I am very thankful that tech has fallen.ANET is a supplier of cloud networking - readers may know that Cisco (CSCO) is generally considered the market incumbent in networking.The number of server shipments occurring on the cloud and telecom service providers however has already begun to eclipse those of legacy enterprise and on premise networks and is projected to continue to rise moving forward:(2018 Arista Q2 Presentation)This creates an opportunity: the old legacy network systems, like that of CSCO, can not handle the high network bandwidth demanded by cloud computing. These legacy network systems are also susceptible to network outages occurring on a total network scale, which is disastrous in cloud computing. Lastly, they are not easily programmable which means that it is difficult to integrate with third party applications for things like network management, automation, orchestration and network services.Enter ANET and their cloud networks, known as their Extensible Operating System (‘EOS’). Cloud networks are able to connect hundreds of thousands of servers together with predictable bandwidth. EOS is also highly available which means that network outages are isolated and self-healing. In other words, complete network outages are avoided and server uptime is maximized. EOS is highly programmable and thus is integratable with third party applications. Furthermore, their products come with automation and visibility tools which reduce the number of network engineers needed to manage the network, thus reducing the total costs.(2018 Arista Q2 Presentation)So we have a product specifically tailored for the cloud while simultaneously providing cost advantages - a total slam dunk.It is thus no surprise that ANET has been able to consistently take market share from industry incumbent CSCO:(2018 Arista Q2 Presentation)ANET offers the kind of product which customers not only keep using, but also continually increase their purchases. We can see below how their top 15 customers have shown in concrete terms how ANET offers very sticky products:(2018 Arista Q2 Presentation)This appears to be a market which CSCO has long dominated but now is finally coming under fire from innovative firms like ANET. Their commitment to customer satisfaction and top quality is the exact recipe for financial success, which we analyze next.ANET has been growing revenues very rapidly:Like many software companies, ANET has high gross margins:(2018 Arista Q2 Presentation)Unlike many software companies, ANET has deeply positive operating margins:(2018 Arista Q2 Presentation)This is a rare combination of high growth and profitability which as we will soon see is also trading at an attractive valuation.ANET has a very strong balance sheet with no long term debt and about $36 million in leasing obligations. ANET also has $1.8 billion in cash and marketable securities - this is almost 10% of their $18.7 billion market cap. ANET has a very clean balance sheet which gives it flexibility for acquisitions and even share repurchases, though I do not think that the latter option is likely to be used by management in the near future.ANET earned $5.35 per share in 2017 and is projected to earn $8.24 this year. This means shares trade at just over 28 times earnings which are growing 50% YOY. Revenues are growing 20-30%, with the latest quarter seeing 28.3% growth. While this earnings multiple is certainly premium to the broader market, the high growth at ANET means that it arguably warrants an even higher multiple. My 12 month price target for ANET is $370, or 45 times earnings. I view this to still be a conservative multiple given the high rate of growth and long growth runway (just look at all the market share it can still take from CSCO). This represents over 50% upside from current levels.As we can see below, ANET has large insider ownership especially from their CEO Ullal, and founder and CDO Bechtolsheim:(2017 ANET 10-K)It seems rare nowadays to see management teams with large insider ownership at tech firms. In general insider ownership is very positive for the stock because it means that management is extra incentivized to create shareholder value. While it is never a reason to invest in stock alone, I definitely do this as a clear positive for ANET.ANET trades at an attractive earnings multiple in spite of very strong growth. Given their high quality product offering and customer satisfaction rates as evident from their repurchase history, ANET looks like a steal only made possible by the market volatility. Shares are a strong buy with 50% 12 month upside.If you liked this article, please scroll up and click ""Follow"" next to my name to not miss any of my future articles.

4211360,103480,2018-10-12T15:05:20-04:00,"Shares of Arista Networks have been among the hardest hit of tech growth stocks, having fallen 30% from recent peaks.The company only trades at a slight premium to the broader market from a P/E standpoint (at about 26x), despite much stronger earnings growth.The company also benefits from being in a fairly recession-proof sector. In 2008-2009, competitor Cisco barely shed any revenues or earnings.The company continues to sell a beloved product with a deep moat in the industry.","The tech stock rout of the past two weeks has been a game of winners and losers. The NASDAQ itself has only fallen about 8% from recent peaks (prompting some market-watchers to declare that a fuller and more painful ""recession"" is still on the way), but under the hood, many individual stocks are now in full bear-market territory, defined as down more than 20% from recent peaks.This kind of market environment is where value-oriented, prescient stock pickers can make tremendous gains. Among the hardest hit stocks the one that deserves a recovery, in my view, is Arista Networks (ANET), the maker of networking hardware that up until recently was one of the best-performing growth stocks of the year.To be fair, it's not difficult to understand why investors are now suddenly turning on Arista. The company was one of the best-performing tech stocks in the hardware sector in 2017, a subsector that has famously been shunned by investors for becoming heavily commoditized. Adding fuel to that fire, fears have been stoked this year that Amazon (AMZN) would increase its efforts in the white-box networking hardware space, leading to widespread fears of price competition (in my view, this argument is already nullified by the fact that Arista is up against a huge competitor in Cisco (CSCO), against which it has already been able to compete extremely competitively). Arista Networks is no stranger to competitive markets - Cisco is about 20x larger than Arista on a revenue basis, and still Arista continues to gain market share.With this recent rout, shares of Arista are now down for the year (-6%), whereas the majority of the technology sector still remains in the green. It's also down about 30% from all-time highs of ~$310 reached in August (barely two months ago), marking an official bear market for this fantastic stock.ANET data by YChartsThis pullback, in my view, created plenty of opportunistic buying windows to build positions in growth stocks that are typically expensive. With Arista, you're not buying a hot internet or software stock with high revenue growth but deep losses - you're buying a growth stock that also has tremendous earnings growth power, as evidenced by a ~50% y/y jump in GAAP EPS in its most recent quarter. Investors may be right to dump high-growth, high-loss names like Snap (SNAP), Zuora (ZUO), and Domo (DOMO), but stocks that are backed by bottom-line strength should eventually be spared.I've used the recent drop to double down on my Arista position, and investors would be wise to do the same. Let's review the bullish case for this company:Arista built its brand as the anti-Cisco. Cisco is ""legacy"" technology, one that is famous for extracting top dollar from its customers while locking them into its ecosystem, without providing much in the way of innovation. It's the equivalent in the networking space to how others might perceive Oracle (ORCL), though Oracle has attempted very nobly to move away from that connotation with its push into the cloud.Earlier this summer, Arista was named yet again as a leader in Gartner's 2018 Magic Quadrant for Data Center Networking, an annual power ranking for various subsectors in IT that carry plenty of weight with IT buyers. Plenty of reviews also give a thumbs-up to Arista relative to other providers in the market, including Cisco. Against this backdrop, Amazon is far less of a threat. Yes, it has the benefit of AWS on its side, but Amazon isn't really known for being a hardware vendor. There will always be room for a ""best-in-breed"" vendor like Arista to thrive, even if Cisco and Amazon compete in the mid-level space.Part of what makes Arista appealing from a technology perspective is that it is designed with cloud IT infrastructures in mind (this is how the product is positioned in its marketing; whether or not systems administrators and IT professionals agree is a matter of opinion). Regardless, it's undeniable that Arista has struck up plenty of partnerships with public cloud providers to make for a more seamless integration with cloud workloads. In September, Arista noted new partnerships and solutions for both Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Cloud Platform and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, aligning itself with the faster-growing cloud platforms that are continually taking share from the dominant AWS.Arista's reputation for both product quality and continuous innovation, in my view, give it a deep moat that has allowed it to play hardball against the much larger and well-funded Cisco, as well as any potential future competitors like Amazon.One of the other benefits of owning a company like Arista is the fact that, for the most part, its business isn't heavily cyclical. Routers, switches, and other networking hardware aren't luxury purchases - you need to purchase and maintain them if you want to keep facilities and campuses running smoothly, which nobody will sacrifice even in an economic downturn.This contrasts very sharply against other sectors in technology. Consider internet stocks, for example. Social media and other ad-reliant companies like Alphabet could suffer if an economic downturn means a cutback in their customers' advertising budgets. SaaS companies like Workday (WDAY) on the other hand could also suffer if potential new prospects defer their planned implementations of a new and expensive HCM system, as they can't afford a costly multi-month systems transition period when sales are bad. When it comes time to upgrade or replace networking hardware, however, it can't be avoided.Arista was still a startup in 2008-2009, so it's hard to judge its performance back then or pull data for it. We can look, however, to Cisco's performance in the last recession for a hint at how this sector performs in a downturn.Cisco's revenues declined by only 9% in FY09, the low point in its history, while net income shed only about 20%. This contrasts sharply against other cyclical businesses, for which major profits swung to stinging losses in the course of a year. Cisco was also able to pick itself back up by FY10 relatively quickly:Figure 1. Cisco recession financialsSource: Cisco 10-KPart of the reason for the downturn in stocks over the past few weeks is the fear of the beginning of a global recession. Should this happen, while Arista will likely become affected as well, it's probably insulated from being too cyclical.There's no doubt that Arista is priced as a growth stock. If you look at Arista versus Cisco, or against the broader S&P 500, it doesn't look exactly cheap. Against forward 12-month EPS estimates, Arista trades at a P/E of ~30x (about twice Cisco's valuation), and against Wall Street's expected EPS of $8.53 for FY19 (as reported by Yahoo Finance), Arista trades at a P/E of ~26x.ANET PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsWe should be more than willing, however, to pay this kind of multiple for Arista's sheer growth power. Recall that Cisco is showing very slim single-digit growth (revenues grew just 6% y/y in its most recent quarter, while EPS growth of 15% y/y was due largely to tax reform).Arista, on the other hand, continues to outshine Cisco and steal away market share. Revenues for Arista grew 28% y/y in its most recent quarter (despite Arista now being at a sizable ~$2 billion revenue run rate), while margin improvements also helped net income grow by 47% y/y.The best way to view Arista's valuation is on a PEG basis. If we take the FY19 P/E of 26x and divide by its most recent 47% EPS growth rate, we find that it now trades at a PEG ratio of 0.55x - a downright steal for such a robust growth stock.Arista rarely trades this cheaply, and this is one of the only times we're able to scoop up shares for a <30x P/E ratio. Prior to its downfall, many analysts had based their price targets for Arista at 40x P/E (implying ~35% upside from current levels). And even now, the consensus recommendation is a buy (per WSJ, there are 16 buy ratings, 14 holds, and 1 sell among 31 covering analysts), with a median price target of $300.With such strong fundamental growth drivers and a proven advantage in a crowded market, Arista makes for a great stock to invest in for a rebound."
4195451,103480,2018-08-06T15:33:28-04:00,"Arista Networks, one of the fastest-growing vendors of networking switches and routers, has reported fantastic Q2 results.In addition to beating Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines, Arista also offered upside Q3 guidance.EPS grew by a stunning 44% y/y in the quarter, yet the company is trading at only a 30x forward P/E and is undervalued for its growth potential.Gross margins, one of the key topics from Q4 and Q1 earnings, also stabilized this quarter above the company's guidance.","After a short stint as one of the best-performing hardware companies earlier in 2017, Arista (ANET) has struggled through a months-long slump, as shares have traded sideways since its Q4 earnings report six months back. When we look at the company's results, it's difficult to understand why: though Arista's growth has certainly decelerated over Q1 and Q2, the dip is certainly better than feared. The company now produces half a billion in revenues per quarter, and we can't reasonably expect Arista to continue growing at a >40% y/y pace (its pace of growth in 2017) forever.I picked up shares of Arista shortly after its Q4 stumble and have watched as the shares have attempted for mini breakouts since, only to fall back down. And despite two good earnings reports in Q1 and Q2, Arista still can't shake off its doldrums:ANET data by YChartsI've been steadily adding to my position as shares dip. Among hardware companies, Arista is one of the fastest-growing companies whose product is widely acclaimed by the IT community. A quick valuation check on Arista: with shares now trading at $263, the company is trading at a ~32x forward P/E multiple based on analyst consensus expectations for FY19 EPS of $8.33, as reported by Yahoo Finance.A 32x forward P/E might sound rich, but in the context of 44% EPS growth this quarter, the company is actually undervalued relative to its growth potential. Its PEG ratio stands low at 0.73x, and so long as that PEG ratio remains below 1.0x, I'm a buyer of shares and have faith in management's continued execution. I'm long with a price target of $332, representing 40x FY19 EPS and 26% upside from current levels.Perhaps what has investors miffed is the recent rumor (which broke in July) that Amazon (AMZN) would be entering into the networking space. For the moment, Arista investors have taken their eyes off its usual nemesis, Cisco (CSCO), and focused their attention on Amazon. We've been through this routine before in almost every industry - grocery chains took a fall when Amazon bought Whole Foods, and so did pharma stocks when Amazon bought PillPack.We can't live in fear of Amazon forever. While an entry into networking hardware would complement Amazon's leading AWS cloud hosting business, with Network World reporting that these would be unbranded ""white box"" switches that would have specialized connections to AWS servers, a move into hardware would be somewhat outside of Amazon's forte. It's also notable that since the early July rumor, no news has surfaced since.In any case, it's not like Arista isn't already up against fierce competition, primarily from Cisco. Networking hardware is already an extremely competitive space, and while an entry by Amazon would be a minor setback, it wouldn't completely derail Arista's growth story. Wall Street analysts from RBC agree, saying that both Cisco and Arista would likely be insulated from an Amazon entry. There's also the small possibility that Amazon, if it were truly interested in networking hardware, would make a play for Arista. Amazon has long had a tendency of buying its way into new markets, and paying ~$20 billion for Arista would not be significantly larger than the $13.7 billion price tag that Amazon paid for Whole Foods.Speculating on Amazon's actions, in my view, distracts investors from Arista's fundamental strengths, and I'd prefer to remain focused on the company's strong results. See the company's Q2 release below:Figure 1. Arista Q2 earnings resultsSource: Arista investor relationsArista's revenues grew 28% y/y to $519.8 million in the quarter, beating Wall Street's estimates of $509.3 million (+26% y/y) by two points. One important point to note is that the company's growth decelerated dramatically this quarter - from 42% y/y growth in Q1. No doubt this is one of the reasons that investors have been shying away from Arista, but to be fair, the company still achieved well ahead of its guidance and Wall Street estimates. The company isn't running out of ideas for growth, either - concurrently with its earnings release, Arista announced the acquisition of Mojo Networks, which will help push it into a new category of WiFi products.Jayshree Ullal, Arista's CEO, did not disclose the transaction economics behind Mojo, but said that the deal would close in 3Q18 and would be accretive to Arista's results in FY19.Though Arista's top-line growth isn't as impressive as in quarters past, I believe the company makes up fully for it via tremendous profit growth. One important achievement in the quarter is a seeming stabilization of gross margins, which have been in focus since Q4. Investors worried that a dip in gross margins may indicate that Arista is facing competitive pricing pressures from the market, but in Q2, GAAP gross margins rose to 64.2%, 10bps higher than 64.1% in 2Q17; and on a pro forma basis, gross margins also rose 10bps to 64.5%. This margin is comfortably ahead of the company's Q2 margin guidance of 62-64% that it offered in Q1, when gross margins dipped slightly from the year-ago quarter. Ita Brennan, Arista's CFO, noted the following on the margin outperformance this quarter:The company's gross margin outlook of 63-65% for Q3 also reflects a minor improvement from the prior quarter's margin outlook.Arista also achieved efficiencies in operating costs, with GAAP operating margins clocking in at 31.8%, 300bps better than 28.8% in the year-ago quarter. This is despite the CFO's acknowledgement that the company stepped up both R&D headcount and expenses, as well as marketing spend, in the quarter. Continued operating margin improvement has been a trend of the past several quarters, with Arista improving operating margins by 510bps last quarter as well.And as per usual, Arista blew away expectations on the bottom line. GAAP net income grew 47% y/y to $150.7 million, representing a huge 29.0% net margin (370 bps better than 25.3% in 2Q17, buoyed by a lower tax rate like most other profitable companies), while pro forma EPS of $1.93 grew 44% y/y and represented 14% upside over Wall Street consensus of $1.70.Arista is a great example of the kind of ""fallen favorite"" in the tech sector that I'm partial to investing in. Since the beginning of 2018, two dominant narratives have taken hold: that Arista would enter into a huge deceleration phase (a story that was made worse by a possible Amazon entry), and that gross margin pressures would bring its huge earnings growth to a halt.While these fears are legitimate, Arista's results in the first half of 2018 thus far have proven that they are largely overblown. Arista is still capable of fueling >40% y/y EPS growth despite a slowdown in the top line, and with shares trading at a PEG ratio below 1.0x, I'm inclined to stay long."

It is also an extra step into the campus area.The company is not interested in the hardware business. It will focus on integrating the WiFi software with its CloudVision solution.This acquisition fits into the strategy of the company.,"Arista (ANET) is making its first move into the Wifi world. During the Q2 2018 results, Arista announced the acquisition of Mojo Networks. This acquisition represents one of the first steps of the company outside of the core cloud data center network, its core business.Yet, the company is not interested in the full WiFi portfolio. Arista wants to integrate the intelligent WiFi software to its CloudVision solution. On the long-term, Arista could expand to the whole WiFi business.Mojo Networks is a 267 employees company. It sells a cognitive WiFi solution, some access points, some switches, and a cloud-based WiFi controller solution.The company is touting its nomination as “Visionary” in the Gartner 2018 Magic Quadrant for Wired and Wireless LAN Infrastructure. This quadrant is not yet publicly available. But the October 2017 quadrant shows that Mojo still has ample room for improvement.Mojo competes with Aruba Networks, which belongs to HPE (HPE), which partners with Arista. The relationship with HPE and Aruba will become a bit more complicated.An analyst questioned the management about the $100 million revenue run rate target mentioned in this article. Jayshree Ullal, the CEO of Arista, replied:It means that, from a revenue perspective, the size of Mojo is not significant for Arista. The undisclosed price should not be material for Arista.To summarize, Arista has acquired a small WiFi company that is lagging behind its competitors, according to Gartner. Yet, this acquisition makes sense.This acquisition is important for Arista as it is its first step into the wireless world. And it reinforces the presence of the company in the campus.The management has indicated the driver of this acquisition was the cognitive solution. It is the software that controls the intelligence of the WiFi network. Source: Conference call Q2 2018The company will leverage its CloudVision solution by integrating the Mojo WiFi intelligence. One single integrated software will manage the cloud data center, the campus, and the WiFi.This acquisition blurs the line with HPE and Aruba. Arista is partnering with HPE to sell its network solutions. Aruba belongs to HPE and is an important network vendor. Aruba competes with the Mojo WiFi hardware and solutions.The CEO stated her interest for the Wifi solution does not interfere with the HPE partnership:Source: Conference call Q2 2018Jayshree Ullal insisted:Jayshree Ullal said the company would continue to work with HPE and Aruba for the access switches.On the long run, it is less clear. The natural expansion of Arista would be to compete with HPE and Aruba. The phase 2 approach Jayshree Ullal is referring to is a sign in this direction:The evolution of the relationship with HPE and Aruba will be an indicator of the direction Arista will want to take about WiFi and the campus.Mojo also proposes Wireless Intrusion Protection services. Security could be another leverage for Arista in the future. This move reflects the strategy of the management. The company indicated being open to acquisitions if they fit with its portfolio, and this is the first illustration.This acquisition marks the entry of Arista into the Wifi area. Mojo is a small Wifi player, but Arista is not interested in the hardware business of the company. The integration of the Mojo intelligent WiFi software with CloudVision motivated the acquisition. It will allow the company to offer an integrated management solution. With this acquisition, Arista is also expanding its footprint into the campus area. It is one more sign of the growing interest of the company for the campus.Note: To receive real-time alerts about my articles, click on the ""Follow"" link at the top of this page next to my name."

This is mostly due to a broad market selloff particularly affecting growth stocks in the tech sector lately. Besides, there have been rumors about the possibility of Amazon (AMZN) increasing its presence in the networking sector.However, the big picture is Arista Networks looks as strong as ever, and chances are that the recent pullback will turn out to be a buying opportunity for investors with a long-term horizon.Arista Networks delivers software-driven cloud networking solutions for large datacenter and cloud computing companies. The company offers a wide variety of Gigabit Ethernet switches that significantly improve the price and performance equation of datacenter networks.Source: AristaAccording to management, the data center switching market is projected to grow to $13 billion in 2021, and Arista Networks is currently the number two player in terms of size and the fastest growing supplier of products to this market. The company has also entered the routing market with its R-Series platform, which could be an additional multi-billion dollar opportunity in the years ahead.Arista Networks competes against bigger companies with deeper pockets such as Cisco (CSCO). But the company is outgrowing Cisco and stealing market share from its larger rival. This speaks volumes about Arista’s technological prowess and its ability to successfully compete against all kinds of players.Source: AristaThere have been rumors about Amazon entering the networking space lately, and this is creating some uncertainty around Arista Networks' stock. Amazon has denied those rumors, and it doesn't really make a lot of sense for Amazon to enter this market. In any case, Arista Networks has proven its ability to compete and win versus larger rivals, so selling Arista because of unfounded rumors about Amazon entering the space is short-sighted at least.Financial performance is clearly strong, with revenue increasing by 28.3% and net income growing by 47% year over year last quarter. The business model is also remarkably profitable, with a gross profit margin in the range of 64%-65% and operating profit margin reaching 36.8% of revenue last quarter.Source: AristaManagement has done a great job at delivering both revenue growth and expanding profitability over the years, with both operating profit margin and free cash flow moving in the right direction over time.ANET Operating Margin (TTM) data by YChartsWall Street analysts are on average expecting Arista Networks to make $8.53 in earnings per share during 2019. Under this assumption, the stock is trading at a forward price to earnings ratio of 26. As a reference, the average price to earnings ratio for companies in the communications equipment industry currently stands at 33.1.Offering a similar perspective, the price to free cash flow ratio stands at 25. This is quite reasonable for such a dynamic growth company, and also comparatively low by historical standards.ANET Price to Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsImportantly, valuation is not an ecstatic concept, since earnings expectations for a company can rise and fall, and this can many times have a material impact on both the current stock price and the underlying valuation metrics.Arista has substantially outperformed expectations over time. The table below shows earnings expectations, the actual reported number, and the earnings surprise, both in absolute numbers and percentage terms over the past four quarters. Not only is the company consistently reporting above expectations, but Arista is also doing better than expected and by a wide margin.Wall Street analysts have consistently been running from behind when it comes to Arista and its earnings power. The chart below shoes how earnings expectations for both the current year and the next fiscal year have substantially increased over time.ANET EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YChartsAs long as this trend remains in place, Arista could be even more undervalued than what the numbers indicate if the company continues delivering earnings above expectations in the years ahead.The PowerFactors system is a quantitative investing system available to members in my research service, ""The Data Driven Investor."" This system basically ranks companies in a particular universe according to quantitative indicators such as financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength.The system has produced solid performance over the long term. The chart below shows the annualized returns for companies in different PowerFactors ranking buckets since January of 1999 in comparison to the SPDR S&P 500.There is clearly a direct relationship between the PowerFactors ranking and annualized returns, meaning that companies with higher rankings tend to produce superior returns and vice versa. In addition, stocks with relatively high quantitative rankings tend to materially outperform the market over the years.Data from S&P Global via Portfolio123Arista Networks is among the best 10% of stocks in the market based on the quantitative algorithm. The company has a PowerFactors ranking of 93.7, which means that the stock is well positioned for attractive returns when considering financial quality, valuation, fundamental momentum, and relative strength.The quantitative system alone does not tell you the whole story - it's important to understand the business behind the numbers in order to truly understand the main risks and return drivers in Arista's stock.Arista operates in a high-growth industry prone to technological disruption. It's important for investors to monitor the competitive landscape in order to make sure that the company remains strategically well-positioned for growth and market share gains in the years ahead.That being acknowledged, it's good to know that Arista Networks offers attractive upside potential from current price levels in the years ahead if management plays its cards well."

For those not familiar with the saying, it is from a passage in the ""Tale of Two Cities,"" a famous novel by Charles Dickens. The phrase comes from the opening sentence of the novel. On a day like many in the last two weeks, stock investors might have thought it was the worst of times. On the one hand, the economy is roaring upward, really in Goldilocks fashion. Inflation seems a distant threat based on most data. The country is experiencing full employment, and while wages are rising, so too is productivity and so unit labor costs are more or less stable.And yet, on the other hand, stock values have been plunging at a precipitous clip. It seems as though almost every high-growth IT name has managed to give up 20% or more of its value in just a few weeks and in some cases, just a few days.I have made that case, both in articles on SA and with my private investment community Ticker Target, that the macro conditions are and are likely to continue to create one of the most benign environments for IT spending that has been seen in decades. Without recapitulating the thesis, IT spending is yielding users greater ROIs because of the plethora of newer applications that are now available that has been the case for some time.It would have been hard to avoid the news that interest rates have risen these past several weeks. And we all know that interest rates are correlated with stock values - at least some of the time. I have lived through more than a few interest cycles and have heard about not fighting the Fed many, many times. Back in 1981, I had the sagacity to take out a mortgage at 15.5%. I can assure all readers that the payments on a mortgage with 15.5% interest were enough to cause a serious dent in my other personal consumption expenditure. But 15.5% is a long way from the mortgage rates of these days. And the differences between then and now are profound. Not only is the economy growing far more rapidly now than in 1981-1982 when the economy was in the most significant recession of the post-war period to that time, but the difference in growth rates between tech and everything else is much greater now than was the case at that point. Back then, inflationary expectations were at extraordinary heights; no one believed that mortgages could reach single digits again. Today, that part of the equation is different - almost everyone believes the Fed will act to constrain inflation and will do so successfully. For a variety of reasons, productivity growth came to a halt at that point - primarily as investments switched to from those improving process efficiency and capacity to those that saved energy. And, as a result, we were soon to have the famous Business Week cover that proclaimed the death of equities.And so we come to Arista (ANET). Why look at Arista now? Obviously, the shares have gone on sale - down almost 30% from recent highs. To be sure, the high was made in the wake of the inclusion of Arista in the S&P on August 28th. But lots of tech companies are down by that percentage and some are down by more than that. Valuation is one part of the story here, and an important one, but the fact is that Arista is one of the foundational companies of the cloud - its primary customers are those that it refers to as Cloud Titans and while the so-called ""white box"" issue is one that has bedeviled the shares, and from the perspective of this writer have confused some commentators, the company's operational performance and its outlook continues to suggest that it offers value to its user base and that even the largest buyers of switches find its offerings attractive.I believe for a variety of reasons that I will try to spell out that Arista is one of those names investors can count on as a long-term holding - ""A Fine Romance"" if you like (Music and lyrics by Dorothy Fields and Jerome Kern and initially and most famously recorded by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers). My thesis starts with the management team running the business. Many people write about management teams, but, in this case, there is lots of meat to substantiate the assertion. Most people acknowledge that Jayshree Ullal and Andy Bechtolsheim are two of the leading visionaries in the enterprise networking space. Arista has spent prodigiously to attract engineering talent and has assembled a great research and development capability.I think the second point to consider is that this team has consistently introduced innovation into the market and has been able to sell it successfully. The company has bested Cisco (CSCO) in the market for software-defined networking solutions. It was able to become the leader in the 100GB switch market. It has a unique OS that apparently makes its offering easier to use. And most recently, it has entered the market for what are called campus switches, an opportunity forecast to be the same size as its fast ethernet switches.One of the things a young company needs to do is to find a focus. This company has been able to focus on the fastest growing components of the networking space and it has been able to do so without being concerned about maintaining account control or ensuring that it supported legacy products. As a result, Arista has been very successful in competing against Cisco, perhaps to the extent that Cisco focuses more effort these days on network security development than it does on the networking space.I started writing this article when the correction was just becoming a factor in the conversation. Today, it has made it to headline status. I have no way to forecast when it will abate and reverse. But one thing that is noticeable about companies that grow at 30% or more is that it only takes a brief period of time before valuation metrics come crashing down.The fact is that Arista's share price has been stuck in neutral now for months - basically since the start of the year means it has a lower valuation than has ever been the case in its history as a public company. By this point, as it happens, the shares are down by 6% since the start of the year while the company will most likely grow revenues by more than 30% and earnings per share by 35%.I don't want to suggest that this year has been one of unalloyed pleasure for this company when the company reported earnings in May, some observers were disappointed with the forecast the company provided regarding its long-term growth expectation. I wrote shortly thereafter that the growth forecast for the company wasn't all that bad - see the link here - and that the company had opportunities for boosting growth to more than current consensus levels. The company has marginally exceeded expectations and raised its forecast since that time and I have every reason to expect more of the same when the company reports later this month or in early November. Analysts have gradually raised their forecasts as well, although I am inclined to believe that there is more to come in that regard. Last quarter saw the company increase its EPS forecast about 3% for this year and 2% next year; my guess is that something like that cadence would be the most probable expectation of what will be seen in the wake of the current quarter's earnings report. The company has a long-term history of beat and raise quarters - mainly double digit beats, and that is what I might expect going forward.But I think that there are some specific reasons other than the company's relative share price under-performance for investors to consider this name at this time for their growth investing. The first of these has to do with the company's advantages relative to its competitors in the tariff war that emerged with China. I will cover that in some detail later in this article, but the fact is, ironically that this company has unique advantages in being able to find sources of component supply not emanating from China that are going to provide it with advantages heretofore unforeseen. A second point worthy of some consideration is the company's set of newer product introduction, and in particular, its opportunities with campus switching. A third area of interest is the potential for the company's Mojo Network purchase. But most of all, ANET's EOS is really the most compelling sales proposition for the Cloud Titans. ANET, I believe, will continue to take market share from Cisco at a noticeable rate for the foreseeable future.Many readers are familiar with ANET and might wonder what new reasons can be adduced in its support. The one basic factor that I see is that of a growth re-acceleration. Growth re-acceleration, in part, is a function of some acquisitions the company has recently made, it is a function of new product introductions, and it may be a function of the company's superior positioning when it comes to the impending tariffs imposed as part of the Sino-American trade war. On the other side of the ledger, the strength of the USD will probably have some marginal impact on revenue growth, although Arista, with 73% of its revenues coming from the Americas, will see a smaller percentage hit than many other IT vendors.As I have written in the past, I think that Arista is going to see an acceleration of revenue growth in calendar 2019. At the moment, ANET is forecast to have 25% growth in the last two quarters of the current fiscal year, consistent with the company's guidance on its latest quarterly conference call that was held in early August. There are a number of drivers that should be of importance in driving growth for ANET beyond the percentage growth it is forecasting and that is embodied in the consensus.The company acquired Mojo Networks and Metamako this quarter. While Metamako is really tiny, Mojo, as part of Arista is likely to add perhaps $100 million of revenues to the likely business of Arista next year. Overall, my guess is that acquisitions are likely to add about 400 basis points to Arista's revenue growth next year. While Metamako, as a stand-alone company cannot greatly move the revenue growth needle, its technology which is focused on low latencies, should have a very beneficial effect on the switches that are offered by Arista.Mojo is a leading competitor in the Enterprise Wi-Fi space where its largest competitor is Ruckus. It has been achieving growth of more than 50%/year and obviously, there are material revenue synergies likely because of the company's inclusion as part of the ANET offering. Metamako's revenue synergies, while probably significant in percentage terms, and because of overall drag, will probably not be readily visible as part of Arista's operational performance over the coming 12 months.As most readers are aware, Arista and Cisco settled their lawsuit this past summer. I doubt if the lawsuit impeded much if any business by the time it was settled, but its absence does remove a distraction, however, minor and distant for the company.While ANET is always introducing products, the company introduced its campus switch offering earlier this year. This new offering is supposed to be one of the more significant families of products that the company has introduced. Just how much of a contribution will campus switches make to ANET revenue? There are those who believe that the campus switching market will double the company's TAM. Campus switches are those used outside of the data center, traditionally Arista's home. The Arista products, because they are new, avoid some of the impediments said to hobble campus network performance based on the solutions offered by the other vendors in this space. In addition, I think it is apparent that many users who have been using the Spline architecture will want to enjoy the benefits of a commonality in both the campus and the data center. (For readers who do not talk tech, I have linked to a definition of Spline in the networking world.)I don't think anyone expects much incremental revenue from campus switches this year, but I am counting on a noticeable bump from that product going into 2019. Again, getting large orders from large users to displace already deployed Cisco technology is more of a process than anything else. But in terms of growth re-acceleration, I think the campus switch offering will be of significance. It is simplicity as much as anything else that probably will be a factor in the competitive displacements the company will need if the thesis regarding 30% growth is going to succeed.How much will Arista's Campus products add to revenues over the coming year? Probably not all that much, according to the article linked here. But I still imagine that it will be a noticeable amount of revenue within an estimated revenue base of about $2.5 billion. Certainly, some Arista users are going to seek to experiment with the company's campus switches as a complement to the Arista technology they use in their data centers. The market for campus switches is said to be in excess of $2 billion/year-in overall market statistics in the linked article. Just some minimal share points would be noticeable within Arista's revenue growth model.Short of living under a rock, most readers will have heard of the U.S.-Chinese trade war. It is a real phenomenon and is likely to have loads of unanticipated consequences. One of the products that will be taxed are networking switches. The mercantilist policies of the People's Republic of China simply do not accord with the way we in this country think about trade competition and the disputes over IP and its sanctity seem even more intractable than tariff policies. The first phase of the tariff levy against Chinese products has gone into effect with some pricing actions already taken by most of the vendors in the space. In any event, at the start of 2019, there will be a 25% tariff levied on data switches, unless, somehow, negotiations wind up succeeding.For a variety of reasons and most particularly because of the experience that ANET has had in dealing with supply work-around issues when it was fighting its lawsuit with Cisco, it turns out that ANET is far better positioned to deal with the impact of the 25% tariff that is the case for its rivals, and in particular, Cisco, Juniper (JNPR), and F5 (FFIV).At this point, it appears that the pass through of tariffs will result in an average 10% price up-lift for Cisco switches as can be seen by the linked article. Other vendors have announced smaller price uplifts. If the 25% penalty tariff is implemented and that does seem likely at this point, it apparently will provide Arista with some cost advantages when compared to its rivals. At this point, Arista's price uplift has been in the range of just 3%.I would probably not be basing a share purchase recommendation solely on a cost advantage that Arista will achieve based on a penalty tariff. It is unfortunate that there is a penalty tariff or that the Chinese trade conduct has been such as to engender this kind of reaction. That said, many buyers in this market are quite price sensitive, and a few percentage points of pricing difference can often tip an order one way or the other.For some years now, perceptions of Arista have been clouded by two major issues. One of these is concerns about the ""white box"" phenomenon. The other inter-related phenomenon relates to the health of what the company describes as the cloud titan market. I am not going to solve the debate over the efficacy of white box hardware for larger users in a relatively brief article. White boxes have been around for years now, and while they certainly are used, they have not really displaced the demand for most branded solutions and that is true for the Cloud Titan market segment as well as for other important verticals.Before leaving the discussion of growth re-acceleration, it probably is important to note again that Arista sells a switch with more functionality for less money than competitors. I don't purport to be an expert on networking technology. There are more than enough 3rd party services that can report the state of play in the market. But what are called Cloud Networking Fabrics are becoming significant. Cisco's offering, ACI, is said to be high priced and lacking features to protect the investment of its installed base. The Arista EOS offering is designed to work with industry standard approaches which avoid user lock-in. In addition, the switches that Arista sells are far more efficient in terms of power requirements per port.I don't often care to make projections based on specific customers. But as is well known, Microsoft (MSFT) is now a 15% customer for ANET. And it is self-evident, I imagine, that the growth of Microsoft Azure is going to positively impact all of its suppliers, including ANET. Will Microsoft continue to be a major user of Arista switches indefinitely? Will other vendors build relationships with Microsoft As the saying goes, nothing lasts forever and there will be rumors of Microsoft looking for different approaches to building its infrastructure. But at the moment, and probably through 2020, the growth of Microsoft alone, given the 90% growth of Azure seems to be a significant growth driver in terms of forecasting growth reacceleration. Whatever else is true, ANET has been gaining on Cisco in this market for years now with no signs that anything is changing within the competitive paradigm.Given ANET's operational performance, the company's shares have been highly valued since the company became public in 2014. But it is interesting to note that the shares are currently only about 3X the price at which they initially traded while revenues have grown by 4X and earnings per share have grown by almost 5X.Arista has had stable GAAP gross margins for some time now. At this point, gross margins are around 64% compared to 64% in the prior year. While product gross margins have probably been optimized, services gross margins which were around 82% last quarter have been rising and services revenue is becoming a slightly greater component of the revenue mix.Arista spends almost 20% of its revenues on research and development and just 9% of its revenues on sales and marketing. These ratios are quite different than those seen at Cisco where development costs are 13% of revenues, while sales and marketing spend is 18% of revenues. There are many reasons for those discrepancies; one of them is the volume of sales Arista does with Cloud Titans. Sales commissions on Cloud Titan sales are minimal. But one of the reasons for Arista's product positioning is that it is willing to sacrifice current profits for cutting edge technology, and that is a trade-off that has allowed it to gain market share on a consistent basis.Last quarter, Arista's general and administrative costs fell to just 3% of revenues. Again, part of that ratio relates to the cloud titan content of sales. The company has always excluded the costs of its Cisco lawsuit from its non-GAAP presentation. The company achieved 37% operating margins last quarter, above what it says its operating model is. Most analysts model for non-GAAP operating margins of 33%, in line with guidance, and allowing for noticeable upside in a typical Arista quarter.Stock-based compensation for this company is a relatively modest 4% of revenues, a ratio that has been declining. While this ratio is rarely invoked by analysts and is probably not a factor in the company's share price valuation, I believe that it a desirable metric that reflects well on the company's quality of earnings.The company saw operating cash flow rise over the past 3 months and 6 months. Quite a bit of the improvement in operating cash flow comes from inventory turns which increased noticeably. But the company is no longer seeing any material increases in the balance of deferred revenues. Going forward, and on a year to year basis, I would not expect to see cash flow materially exceed non-GAAP net income.At this point, Arista has a market capitalization of $17.8 billion based on 81 million shares outstanding. Its enterprise value is about $15.6 billion. My estimate for forward 4 quarter revenues is about $2.5 billion. That yields an EV/S ratio of about 6.3X. To be sure, one can find lower EV/S ratios for a 30% growth rate in the market. But this company is highly profitable and has a markedly improving competitive position that seems to be locked in at this point. The company has a free cash flow yield of around 4% on a forward basis. It certainly has the potential to support some kind of capital return policy.I believe that the current price represents an excellent entry point for the shares."
4189473,104439,2018-07-24T11:21:47-04:00,"Rumors of Amazon entering the network switch market were squashed.Arista's core strategy revolves around providing technological solutions with better price/performance ratio.Unlike general purpose networking the solutions are crafted purposefully for datacenters, cloud and internet based firms.Litigation issues remain a prime risk.","Earlier in June IDC reported that the worldwide Ethernet switch market recorded $6.29 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2018 representing an increase of 10.9% year over year. Some of the most important drivers behind the stellar growth includes explosion of cloud service providers and datacenters, and the proliferation of internet based big firms (such as Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo!). Consider the public cloud computing market which stood at $219.6 billion in 2016 and expected to reach $411.4 by 2020 whereas datacenter market stood at $31.52 Billion in 2017 and expected to reach $62.30 Billion by 2022. Arista’s (ANET) competitor Cisco (CSCO) fell by 3% last week after a website called theinformation reported that Amazon is entering the network switch markets, no wonder why investors were worried about Arista too. But shortly after the rumor was squashed Cisco’s stock price was back on track. Valuation multiples alone suggest that Arista is overvalued, as indicated by its greater price multiples compared to both the average and median stats, as well as EV multiples. But sales growth and profitability metrics suggest otherwise, including technology.Source: Data from Stockrow, processed by the authorBack in 2012 Arista founder Bechtolsheim made a forward-looking statement: the best way for networking to catch up with Moore's Law is to abandon Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (OTC:ASIC) design. Even if you look at it from a general technological perspective, the power of integration will be a dominant value proposition in every aspect of information technology. ""I'll just flat-out say ASIC designs will never be on Moore's Law,"" he said. His reasoning was that certain considerations such as the chip's clock rate becomes secondary in the way ASICs are designed. In 2013 Arista's President and CEO Jayshree Ullal told in a NetworkWorld interview that Arista saw three disruptions revolving around hardware, software and customer buying, which serves as a core strategy in Arista’s operations till today. In the interview she pointed out that Arista saw three disruptions that involved hardware, software and customers.On the hardware front, she pointed out that reliance on custom ASIC and specialty chip have fallen behind by several years, and it is meaningful because Arista’s reliance on silicon chips have a better price/performance ratio than specialty chips. On the software segment the firm was seeing need for special purpose networking software for the datacenters and cloud. Because Cisco’s specialty was enterprise-side general and Juniper’s was service provider side with general purpose in mind, there was a special opportunity to tap. Arista’s networking software Extensible Operating system (EOS) is designed with integration ability in mind and it is fully programmable and highly modular. ""Cloud and software-defined architectures are shaking up the Ethernet switch and router markets.” said Petr Jirovsky, Research Manager of Worldwide Networking Trackers. EOS can integrate third party tools easily, allowing users to build their own software that can be used with EOS. There are also other issues, consider the traditional routers which are based on proprietary hardware and are expensive and difficult to scale up, whereas Arista’s software runs on off-the-shelf merchant silicon from Braodcom, intel and others and uses leaf-and-spine architecture to easily scale up.“One of the greatest threats to Cisco's business is the rise of generic ""white-box"" routers and switches. These unbranded devices generally have less powerful hardware than Cisco's products, but the heavy lifting is accomplished via cloud-based software. This disruptive approach is known as software-defined networking (SDN).” Motley FoolCisco didn’t like Arista eating up their market share. They understood that Arista’s purpose-specific approach will hurt them and that’s why Cisco sued Arista. A number of Arista’s employees, including its CEO is an ex-Cisco employee. If you hire people from Amazon to build you an ecommerce platform it is natural that the people you hired will use their experiences from Amazon. If Arista did not have a unique blueprint then the success it accumulated wouldn’t be so fast. The enterprise market wants lower cost IT infrastructures that are highly scalable, which is why Arista is on very good terms with some of the biggest tech firms. Now that AT&T decided to phase out Cisco’s equipment from a significant portion of its infrastructure with an in-house switch, it can save millions of dollar a year. Clearly the white-box routers and switches are on rise as cloud based software enable the heavy lifting. Earlier on 19 th this month U.S. International Trade Commission determined that it will review the t he final remand enforcement initial determination (REID) that the ALJ issued in June, which says Arista did not violate a cease and desist order regarding one of the patents. Currently the litigation risk is the prime factor in determining whether Arista is correctly priced or not, if results from the court are in favor Arista, it’s a buy."
4187248,104537,2018-07-14T06:22:45-04:00,"Amazon will start competing directly with traditional network vendors like Cisco in the cloud data centers.The online retailer and public cloud provider will sell white-box switches to business customers.Although this looks like a big news, the threat for competitors, especially Cisco, is limited.The market is overreacting and this could create an opportunity to buy Cisco.","A news on Seeking Alpha cited today an article from theinformation.com about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) planning to sell its own network switches to business customers, competing directly with Cisco (CSCO), Arista (ANET), and Juniper (JNPR).Considering the reputation of Amazon and its ability to squeeze margins, the 20%+ net margins that Cisco and Arista benefit from could be at stake.In response to this news, shares of Cisco, Arista, and Juniper have dropped by 4.13%, 4.26%, and 2.28%, respectively, while the market was slightly up.In my previous life, I was an IT network engineer when Amazon was starting to expand beyond selling only books, and I never thought that one day, buying data center switches produced by Amazon would happen.It made me curious, and in this article, I study what this move actually implies for Amazon, its competitors, and the market.Amazon is said to start selling switches for the cloud data centers. This $14B market is growing, but it represents only a subset of the whole networking area. The switches for cloud data centers do not have the same characteristics as switches for the other markets, like the campus for instance.The devices that Amazon plans to sell are white-box switches. It means that the hardware, designed by Amazon, would be produced by white-box manufacturers. An open source software would run the hardware.The article from theinformation.com says that:This statement seems exaggerated to me. All network vendors utilize the same manufacturers and silicon merchants to build their devices. It would be surprising if Amazon could squeeze even more the manufacturers, especially considering the scale of Cisco.Amazon could differentiate on the software, but Amazon still must compete with Cisco, Arista, and Juniper to attract network developers.Therefore, Amazon would have the same cost of sales as traditional vendors and would have to cut on marketing expenses while selling at no profit or at a loss in order to make a real difference.The article also says:It is true that white box switches provide more customization. However, this aspect does not correspond to what most companies want; they want an integrated, automated, and managed solution end to end.The analogy between Linux and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) applies: when Linux became famous, Microsoft was perceived as a dying company because Linux was better, free, open source, and more flexible.However, although Linux took some market shares in the enterprise, Microsoft is still dominating due to its integrated solution. The companies did not want to write or customize the software on top Linux because they did not have the resource or the skills to do it, and it was not part of their business anyway.The article continues:In fact, network engineer and software developer jobs are becoming more and more related because of the need of automation. A few years ago, a clear demarcation separated these activities. In the near future, both jobs will merge, independently of the white-box concept. Instead of savings, I see a change of paradigm in the way people work in the networking area.The article mentions:This concept, called hybrid cloud, is growing and that's why Cisco partnered with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) last year to propose a hybrid cloud solution for the Cisco data center networks to integrate with the Google cloud.And indeed, if Amazon sells its own switches, the company will be in a great position to propose an integrated solution with its cloud.However, I see an issue for Amazon in the hybrid cloud space. Most of the companies actually use several public cloud providers. Neutral network vendors like Cisco or Arista are looking to partner with all public cloud vendors to propose multi hybrid solutions.Amazon would not partner with competitors like Microsoft and Google in the cloud to facilitate the integration of its switches in a multi-hybrid environment.It could even be worse for Amazon because the company would be the only cloud provider not to partner with network vendors competing in the cloud networking market. In consequence, the Amazon cloud would be isolated from multi-hybrid cloud solutions proposed by traditional network vendors.The article says:Arista would actually be the most threatened. The company sells mainly cloud data center switches solutions.Cisco provides solutions not only for the cloud data centers but also for other areas like campus, routing, wireless, security, servers, video conferencing, etc.Cisco could also decide to sacrifice margins in the network data center switches to cross-sell other products that are integrated together.Juniper is already having difficulties competing against Cisco and Arista. One more competitor like Amazon will not help, but Juniper is also diversified, at a much smaller scale than Cisco, though.Another aspect to consider is that some of the biggest customers for the cloud data center white-box switches are... the public cloud providers competing with AWS. Unless Google and Microsoft purchase switches powered by AWS for their public cloud data centers, Amazon would miss some of the biggest customers.The article says:This would give some time for Arista and Cisco to still gain market shares and lock in customers with proprietary solutions or with some white-box solution.Considering the reduced threat for Cisco, a dip of the share price below $40 could constitute an opportunity at a PER ex-cash of 15.Amazon selling network switches to businesses would threaten the established network vendors enjoying 20%+ net margins.However, the threat is not as important as it looks like because it concerns a small part of the network market and the solution would not fit all customers.Arista would be the most impacted because Amazon would be in competition with its only core business.Considering the limited threat for Cisco, a dip of the share price could constitute a buying opportunity at $40.Beyond the news, and knowing Amazon's ability to expand, if the move is successful, I can imagine Amazon expanding into other IT network areas like security."
4187419,103625,2018-07-16T06:51:18-04:00,"Amazon recently announced that it will sell its own networking switches.This news sent competitors in this sector such as Cisco Systems, Arista Networks and Juniper Networks crashing.The market has likely overreacted with this sell-off.Premium selling strategies in ANET and CSCO are a way to profit from the market's overreaction.","On Friday, July 13th, news dropped that Amazon (AMZN) is planning to sell its own networking switches to customers. Switches are part of the enterprise computing market and move data traffic around networks. The Amazon switches would use unbranded hardware and open-source software. They would also include built-in connections to the Amazon Web Services cloud where they could access servers and storage. This would hypothetically take market share away from existing producers of network switches such as Cisco Systems (CSCO), Arista Networks (ANET), and Juniper Networks (JNPR). Reports have stated that Amazon's switches could launch for sale within the next 18 months at a steep discount to current offerings. Current customers of Amazon will likely be the first target market for the switches when (and if) they are brought to market.Networking companies CSCO, ANET, and JNPR sold off after the news was released on Friday. CSCO was down 4.13%, ANET was down 4.26%, and JNPR was down 2.28%.CSCO Price data by YChartsAs can be seen from the chart above, there was a sudden dip in stock price for all three stocks shortly after the news was released, and a small rebound from the lows of the day.Analysts have already been jumping to the defence of the networking companies, with RBC's Mitch Steves remaining bullish on CSCO and ANET. Both companies have solid businesses with potential for continued growth. The Amazon bombshell remains unverified and Amazon switches will likely not enter the market any time soon.After looking at the options chains of ANET, CSCO, and JNPR, a trade in ANET looks like the best way to profit from the recent moves in stock price. This is a neutral/bullish trade that assumes the market is overreacting, and that ANET's stock price will remain stable. With such a sudden move down in the stock price with a rebound already occurring towards the end of the day, further downside seems limited and unlikely in the short term for ANET and CSCO. An advantage of choosing ANET is the higher stock price. You will likely pay less commissions because you can trade less contracts to get a trade of the same size compared with options on a lower priced stock.When selling premium, I like to look at options with expiration dates 30-45 days out, to give my trade time to be right, while also taking advantage of the rapid time decay in the value of options as they near their expiration. Looking at options on ANET of the expiration Aug. 17, 2018, investors could sell the puts with a 240 strike price and buy puts with a 230 strike price. This trade would be profitable if ANET trades above 240 minus the premium collected for the trade. It is also necessary to consider that ANET has earnings coming up on August 2nd.For a less capital intensive trade, investors could consider turning this trade into an iron condor by selling a call spread. Investors could sell the 310 calls and buy the 320 calls with the previously discussed put spread to create an iron condor. The short contracts would expire worthless and the trader would collect the full premium of the trade if ANET trades between 240 and 310. As of this writing, this trade has a max profit of $313, and a max loss of $687 for a one contract trade. The call strike of 310 is just slightly lower than ANET's all-time high of $311.67.For a slightly more bullish trade, a trader could simply move up the strike price of the put options by $10, selling the 250 puts and buying the 240 puts. This trade assumes that near-term downside to ANET's stock has been mostly priced in, and that the coming earnings will be neutral to bullish. The trade would now collect $403 in premium, with a max loss of $597. One significant downside of turning this trade into an iron condor is the possibility of a bullish earnings surprise from ANET. Considering this, leaving the trade as a bullish put spread may be safer.ANET data by YChartsSimilar trades may be made using options on CSCO. One advantage of trading CSCO is that there is a higher volume of options trading on the stock. CSCO also has earnings later in the month, on August 15th. A trader selling premium with an expiration date of August 17th would probably want to close their trades early to avoid the chance of large swings in the price after earnings. One would also need to trade a larger quantity of CSCO options due to the lower stock price of CSCO, which can lead to higher commissions. I favor ANET for the discussed trades because of the higher stock price and the ability to collect more premium on the trades due to the higher implied volatility of the stock (CSCO has an IV rank of 55.2, whereas ANET has an IV rank of 74.8 [source: tastyworks]).CSCO data by YChartsFor all of these trade ideas, it is often a wise strategy to take profits early if the trade moves in your favor. If you are unsure of when to take profits, a good rule of thumb is to close the trade once you can secure 50% of the premium in profits.This trade takes advantage of a drastic swing in the prices of stocks as the market reacts to news. I recently completed a similar trade after news of AMZN acquiring the online pharmacy Pillpack was released. Pharmacy stocks, including Walgreens (NASDAQ:WBA), reacted negatively with large moves of over 8% downwards on the day. On 7/02, WBA stock was still down but starting to show signs of recovery, so I decided to sell bull put spreads in WBA. I closed the trade on 7/06 and was able to collect over 50% of the premium (sold for .44 credit, closed for .19 debit). This is an example of how a similar trade can be closed for a profit in a short amount of time as the stock price stabilizes after the volatility shock of negative news. Hopefully, the ANET trade will be a similar story."
4192157,70365,2018-07-30T18:02:55-04:00,Arista Networks is a fast-growing computer networking company.The company is led by a highly experienced executive team with an outstanding track record of delivering superior financial results.Valuation suggests that the company's shares are currently slightly overvalued but offer a promising long-term growth potential.,"Arista Networks (ANET) shares have advanced significantly over the last five years with roughly a five-fold increase in the market price. In the light of the company's fundamentals and valuation, despite momentary overvaluation, Arista Networks seems to present a solid long-run opportunity.Arista Networks is a leading developer, manufacturer, and supplier of software-driven cloud networking solutions, especially for the needs of large data centers and computing environments. Its switching and routing products have already been implemented by over 5000 customers including leading global internet companies and partners such as Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Oracle (ORCL), or Palo Alto Networks (PANW). The company is led by a highly experienced management team consisting of industry veterans with deep understanding of the market and rich and extensive experience in the computer networking space. One of the key critical components of Arista's networking platform is so-called EOS - Extensible Operating System - which enables programmability, customization, in-service upgrades, and easy application extensibility. The majority of company's revenue comes from the Americas (~72 percent), about a fifth from Europe, Middle East, and Africa, and the rest from APAC. In 2017, approximately 87 percent of total revenue came from the sale of products with the latter coming from services.Over the last five years, Arista Networks has showcased an unbelievable ability to beat analysts' revenue and earnings estimates. During the last five-year period, the company exceeded analysts' annual earnings expectations three times by more than 20 percent. On average, Arista Networks' positive earnings surprise totaled approximately 32 percent. This is relatively rare to see and generally a good sign of hidden profitability reserves.Source: www.fastgraphs.comApart from Arista's strong management team and exceptional ability to exceed analyst's estimates, the company can also show strong financial statements figures. According to Reuters' website growth rates calculations, 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year revenue CAGRs totaled 34.8, 46.2, and 51.8 percent respectively. Likewise, earnings per share 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year CAGRs amount to 49.7, 51.4, and 36.2 percent respectively. As illustrated in the YCharts graph below, all major fundamental metrics - revenue, earnings per share, and free cash flow - were kept in a strong growth channel. Over the last five years, these three metrics increased over 250, 400, and 700 percent respectively.Other positive signs are improving operational and profitability metrics such as EBIT margin or returns on equity and assets. Over the last three years, Arista Networks' EBIT margin increased from a local low of 18 percent in mid 2015 to current levels above 30 percent. This is a considerable improvement that is also apparent in the company's ROE and ROA.Under some of the most widely used valuation techniques - the discounted cash flow analysis - blended perpetuity growth and EBITDA multiple method - Arista Networks' shares appear to be overvalued. Under the perpetuity growth method, fair value of the stock comes at US$200.3, assuming 30 percent annual revenue growth over the next five years, steady EBIT margin of 28.6 percent, and terminal growth rate in perpetuity of 2 percent. Under the EBITDA multiple approach, the intrinsic value per share of the company stands at roughly US$298.7 if we assume that the appropriate exit EV/EBITDA multiple in five years' time is around 15x.Under a different valuation approach, giving a better picture of the company's long-run intrinsic value most probable evolution, a technique commonly-called Peter Lynch earnings line, Arista Networks' shares look a lot more attractive. Using the Fast Graphs forecasting calculator with a custom 30 percent operating earnings growth rate assumption, the company's intrinsic value by the end of December FY2023 is estimated to reach US$812, which implies more than 20 percent total annualized rate of return upside potential.Source: www.fastgraphs.comTo sum up, Arista Networks is an outstanding company with a further potential for growth. Today, in the cloud networking era, the company aims at seizing the opportunity in the rapidly developing data center switching market which could bring in additional revenue. Based on two valuation techniques I frequently apply in my research process, I believe Arista Networks' shares are currently slightly overvalued but offer a fair entry point for a participation on the company's long-run potential. After all, Arista Networks is a fast-growing company in a dynamically evolving industry, and this has always been, is and no doubt that will certainly stay a highly desirable attribute among many investors.Author's note: To bring similar articles to your attention, please consider subscription of my SA feed by clicking on the ''Follow'' button at the top of this page.Disclaimer: Please note that this article has an informative purpose, expresses its author's opinion, and do not constitute investment recommendation or advice.

4185218,104537,2018-07-03T04:49:02-04:00,Arista benefits from exceptional management.The company's impressive growth is due to the new paradigm of cloud data center networking.The software constitutes the added value of the company.The market is pricing the company for high growth and high margins.,"Andy Bechtolsheim and David Cheriton, serial entrepreneurs, founded Arista (ANET) in 2004. They occupied executive positions at Cisco (CSCO), from 1996 to 2003, developing the Catalyst switches. They had previously sold Granite Systems, a company they had created and that was in the business of gigabit ethernet switches. Andy Bechtolsheim was also the founder of Sun Microsystems.In 2008, they hired Ullal as CEO and President while she was senior vice president of data center & switching at Cisco, having built a multi-billion-dollar business. Before that, she was vice president of marketing at Crescendo, a company that Cisco acquired in 1993, and this was the first step of Cisco into the switching business.It seems that first class entrepreneurs are growing the company.In contrast with some other growth companies, Arista keeps on generating impressive net margins above 25% while growing. Free cash flow follows net income closely. The table below shows the evolution of revenues and net income per share.Source: annual report 2017Gross margins consistently stay above 60%.The balance sheet forces admiration as well: no goodwill, almost no debt, more and more cash, and as a consequence, growing equity.Source: annual report 2017Arista shipped its first product in 2008, but the majority of the revenue growth started in 2010. The company went public in 2014 and the share price progressed with the results, as shown on the graph below. Source: Seeking AlphaThe management indicated a revenue growth in the mid-twenties for 2018.Arista sells network equipment for cloud data centers. However, its added value does not come from the hardware. The real value comes from the software that Arista has been developing. The software allows customers to build a network layer on top of Arista's architecture in order to fit the needs of cloud data centers.Arista has been taking advantage of three simultaneous disruptive concepts on the networking side: new hardware developments, a new growing customer base, and more software.Arista's success comes from the fact that the company developed a software solution based on these three disruptive forces, while other traditional network vendors were lagging behind (yes, I'm thinking about Cisco).It is undeniable that Arista's solution successfully addresses a growing business need. However, a few aspects must be clarified for the non-technical investors in order to better assess Arista's potential:Source: presentation Q1 2018The white box concept decouples the software from the hardware. Network software running the network devices could be installed on any complying white box.That sounds a lot like what the big cloud providers want: they could run a network layer on top of white boxes. Even more threatening, some open source software could run on top of white box switches.Addressing the same market as Arista, these white boxes could take market shares and hurt margins.For instance, AT&T (NYSE:T) has made a noticeable announcement with its intention to purchase 60,000 white boxes. However, beyond the headline, we can see the extra efforts AT&T is deploying compared to a standard network solution: in a multi-year effort, AT&T is writing open hardware specifications, developing the software to power these boxes, and looking for partnerships.Moreover, incompatibility issues could happen when running a software on top of hardware provided by another vendor.On the cost side, all network devices, proprietary or not, are mostly made with the same silicon merchants products anyway. So, besides the fact that the white box hardware would not be cheaper to produce than legacy hardware switches, the company using white boxes would still have to spend resources on purchasing or integrating software with these boxes.For these reasons, I think white boxes would represent the same threat as any another competitor in the cloud data center area, not more. Established network vendors in the enterprise campus area don't seem affected because enterprises don't want to get involved in building a network layer on top of white boxes; they want to use integrated, automated solutions.In any case, Arista could also decide to sell some white box switches, taking advantage of its relationships with silicon merchants. Cisco could to the same. But both vendors are putting more value on the software.Now that we have a better idea of the potential of the company, we can try to value it. The management has indicated that Arista would keep on focusing on the cloud data center. The picture below shows a data center ethernet switch revenue forecast.Source: presentation Q1 2018The company addresses mainly the clouds service providers, the telcos, and the large enterprises. Currently, the market share for Arista is 14.5% and it has been growing at about 2.5-3% every year over the last few years.Based on this, the table below shows my estimation of revenues and net income till 2022 with 25% CAGR for revenues. I have estimated net margins starting at 24% and decreasing to 20% in 2022 in order to take into account the increased competition (and 20% corresponds to Cisco's current net margins).Source: Author estimationsFrom 2018 till 2022, Arista would generate a present value of $3.3B of net income with the arbitrary discount rates shown on the table above.Applying a multiple of 15x to $976M profits in 2022, discounted back at 10%, would give a present value of $13.2B.Adding back $3.3B of the net present value of the accumulated profits and the $1.7B net cash position would value Arista at $3.3B + $13.2B + $1.7B = $18.2B.With a current market cap of $19.15B, the market is pricing growth with high margins, which is understandable considering the history of the management and the quality of the solution that fits the growing cloud data center market.Considering the risks, the valuation does not seem to offer any margin of safety.Arista, led by an exceptional management, has been strongly growing since 2010, gaining market share in the cloud data center environment, thanks to its software-based network solution.However, competitors are catching up and the threat of white box solutions is real.The market, pricing growth and high margins, does not offer any margin of safety; therefore I am not buying at this price."
4173901,98236,2018-05-14T18:36:00-04:00,"Arista reported the results of its Q1 operations earlier this month.The results themselves were strong. The guidance was considered by many to be disappointing.The shares have become somewhat controversial over time, with 15 buy recommendations compared to nine hold recommendations, reported on First Call.I believe Arista's longer-term growth prospects are dramatically underrated by the current First Call consensus.As a result, I believe that the shares have significant upside potential, although I doubt that they will reprise their 76% appreciation over the past year.","There is a famous story about Benjamin Franklin and the framing of the constitution. Dr. Franklin was the oldest and perhaps the most widely accomplished delegate to the Constitutional Convention of 1787. Dr. Franklin was quite feeble by then (He was 81, a great age for most individuals in the 18th Century and he could not stand to deliver his speeches at the convention and so attended the sessions seated in a particular chair near that of the presiding officer.) As the last delegate signed the document, i.e. the constitution, Franklin pointed to a picture of the sun carved and gilded on the back of the Convention President’s chair. He commented that, “I have often…in the course of the sessions…looked at that sun behind the President (George Washington) without being able to tell whether it was rising or setting. But now at length I have the happiness to know it is a rising and not a setting sun.” The chair itself, monumental in size, is an elegant example of the Chippendale style with a gilded sun in the crest rail and is still on display in Philadelphia, at Independence Hall. Reproductions are available - they only cost $25,000. Lots of good stock picks necessary to buy such objects and the chairs are enormous and do not look as though they fit comfortably into the decor of most modern living spaces.And how is that relevant to the shares of Arista (ANET)? Arista is self evidently the networking company of this decade, having grown from essentially zero to a run rate of now close to $2.5 billion in revenues along with operating margins that have reached 35% on a non-GAAP basis. In the process, the company has become a thought leader and gained significant market share in its space, mainly from substantial success in competition against Cisco (CSCO), and its share valuation reflects that kind of performance.Recently, concerns have been expressed about future prospects for Arista, most particularly its ability to continue to grow at 35%-40% at scale with enviable operating margins. Two well-known analysts, one at Deutsche Bank and the other at Cleveland Research, have recently cut their ratings and trimmed their growth forecasts. One analyst is concerned about competition from Cisco. The other analyst believes that Cisco is cutting prices and that “white box” alternatives have the potential to reduce growth. (White box switches are those made by primarily Chinese manufacturers and assembled from standardized commodity components. White Box switches have either no software (bare metal) or minimal software and users then customize the devices to optimize performance within a specific business and network.)Much has been written about White Box switches and their potential impact on the networking space. I have linked with one article here that's fairly agnostic on the subject. I'm surely not going to resolve the White Box debate in this article, although I think that Arista is less vulnerable to competition from those vendors than is the case for its main peers. That said, Arista shares are vulnerable to such downgrades given their performance over the past year (they have risen by 76%) and their valuation. It's quite rare to see a hardware company which is able to command an EV/S multiple of greater than 8X, although the fact that this company is very profitable and generates lots of cash helps to sustain valuations. Just for the record, Arista’s forward P/E, based on the current First Call consensus is 34X, and its free cash flow yield is likely to be in the range of 4%-plus over the next 12 months. Just to address my own conclusion, before asking readers to embark upon a somewhat lengthy read, my belief is that this is a reasonable opportunity for investors to enter the name. I do not think the growth compression estimates are likely to happen at the rate forecast by the consensus. I think the company will grow market share, will improve margins and improve cash flow. No, the shares are not an unrecognized bargain, and there seems little chance that the company will be consolidated. But I believe that the shares remain an excellent commitment in the larger cap growth arena and I hope to return to my position in the name shortly.Despite all of the problems of the last few decades, and the problems with the Constitution over its life, I think Dr. Franklin surely got the right of it in suggesting the growth and success of this country under the Constitution. While not nearly such a seminal question, I'm going to outline the case for Arista shares continuing their rise even if it isn’t at a 76%/year cadence, and I will try to outline why the negative commentators have overstated or distorted their case. Arista shares have pulled back noticeably from their recent high point in early March and are down by about 15% from the peak. The shares lost 8% of their value in the wake of last week’s earnings release and conference call. Investors were noticeably unhappy with guidance which forecast sequential revenue growth of 7.4%. In Q2, the prior year, revenue growth was 20.8% sequentially. The current guidance, at the mid-point, represents growth of just 25% year on year, far below the growth of 41% the company achieved this past quarter. The company also forecast a small decrease in non-GAAP operating margins, sequentially. All of that said, in the quarter that was reported last week, the company outperformed the prior First Call consensus EPS forecast by about 8% and exceeded the high end of its prior revenue outlook range by 1%.The company’s CFO also opined that “the current consensus, which calls for growth in the mid-20% range, remains relevant.” I'm not quite sure that the statement is a forecast, or a guide, or what it is supposed to represent. Whatever the case, the statement led to about half of the analysts who report their estimates to First Call revising their EPS expectations up to a higher range, while the consensus revenue growth estimate for the year is now 28%.I have followed and recommended Arista shares for some time period although my last article on the company dates back to June of last year. The shares were $150-plus back then, having appreciated by 50% in the first half of 2017. Little did I expect that the appreciation rate would accelerate and after a further 20% of appreciation, I decided the shares had provided me enough of a gain and that I needed to share the opportunity with other investors. Not the best call I ever made. My trade records in terms of disposing of ANET shares are ones I would rather burn.No, I didn’t accurately predict, or perhaps better said, act on the last 25%-30% of the company’s extraordinary share price performance which left me more than a bit wrong footed. But this article is not about my trading disciplines or lack of perspicacity in terms of understanding investor enthusiasm for Arista. I'm well aware that Arista is King of the Switches (OK, that is the title of the last report I wrote on Arista) and that the company’s CEO, Jayshree Ullal, and its chief development officer, Dr. Andy Bechtolsheim, are two of the thought leaders in the networking world. I do not want to say that one person or the other “invented” software defined networking - really the key to the success of Arista and why it continued to gain share. But if that technology has parents, those two are clearly amongst the group of men and women who gave the technology life.The question is really why management chose the forecast it has published with its earnings results and whether or not that forecast is a sandbag or is related to reality. Obviously, this company has a history of conservative guidance so most observers do not take the specific numbers in its forecast all that seriously. I doubt if any professional investor would want to own Arista shares if they thought the growth rate would really compress quite so sharply as the company’s forecast might suggest (I confess to being a bit nonplussed when the CFO describes the current First Call consensus forecast as ""relevant""). On the other hand, there are many institutional investors who have decided to maintain their position in the name most probably because of their expectations that the reality of growth in the next few quarters will be greater than the company has most recently forecast.It is worth noting that the company’s CEO essentially said that it is not feasible to prepare a growth forecast beyond a quarter, and the company, based on its hyper growth in 2017, chose to make a conservative outlook… for no other reason but that 2017 was a very strong year. And there have been some analysts who have suggested that the appropriate long-term growth expectation for this company at 25%-30% does support their buy recommendations and target prices and perhaps given the company’s high level of profitability and cash generation capability that's a defensible position.At this point, I don’t imagine that there are many observers of the space who imagine that the market for switches and routers is a tremendous growth opportunity. It is a large market certainly, and one still dominated by Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) which gives Arista significant runway to expand its market share, but the overall market is not growing all that much. The latest data from IDC, which is a few months in arrears at this point, show that the market for switches, overall, grew by about 5% last year and reached $26 billion, while the router market reached $15 billion in annual revenues, an increase of 4% for the period.According to the IDC data, Arista had a market share of just 5.9% in switching. Cisco is dominating market share quite rapidly at this point, and beside Arista, it is losing share to Huawei and HPE (HPE).There are bits and pieces of the networking space that are continuing to grow. For example, Arista has a disproportionate share of the market for what it calls Cloud Titans (names like Amazon (AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT) etc.) The Cloud Titans are really the home base for Arista. And to a certain extent, as their demands rise and fall - well basically grow at different rates, Arista will see a major impact. Obviously, just looking at the performance of AWS, Google Cloud and Azure last quarter ought to suggest that the Cloud Titans are going to need additional capacity - but that doesn’t necessarily correlate with growth in Arista revenue in the short term - it takes a year or two to build a data center and outside observers really do not have a great perspective as to how the resurgence in percentage growth in the public cloud fits with capacity utilization.The major issue for Arista, and other vendors to Cloud Titans, is the potential competition from White Box suppliers who can work with software designed by the Titans to run on commodity hardware. Microsoft, traditionally Arista’s largest customer, now offers SONIC, open source software which is designed to run on white box switches. I'm not likely to write something here particularly dispositive when experts in the space - and that certainly is not me - haven’t had too much success in forecasting the progression of the white box. Arista's CEO, not terribly surprisingly, doesn't think all that much of a network running on SONIC software, although her public comments are somewhat muffled given the existing relationship between Microsoft and Arista. I guess all I can say of use to investors at this point is that Arista has been able to continue to sell steadily growing amounts of its solutions to those Titans and to be part of their long-term plans. It would appear based on what Arista reported for its Q1, and its commentary regarding the specific outlook for its Cloud Titan space, that there's enough market for a multiplicity of competing approaches to flourish.Many analysts are frustrated when companies provide guidance without any substantial amount of granularity that speaks to shriveling growth. For example, Arista had a strong quarter within enterprise, and in particular had some substantial wins within Financial Services, a market that Arista identifies as a separate business segment. The results were said to be strong in Q1 just as they were said to be strong in Q3 and Q4 of the past year. Why they might be less strong in Q2 and beyond was simply left unsaid. In fact, Arista plans to continue its expansion in the enterprise and has recently announced products aimed at what are called enterprise campus solutions. I’ve linked here to Arista’s announcement of what the company calls its Cognitive Campus platforms. Without trying to explain the details of the technology - which I barely understand in any event - the new offering is more than a bit transformational compared to traditional campus networking products which have really not been transformed in terms of architecture for a decade or more.Drilling down a bit further, the company talked about some of the success it was having in terms of driving international growth and growth in the media and entertainment vertical. Rather than trying to cite more examples, I will let Jayshree’s commentary speak for itself. “I fully agree that especially some of the high-performance verticals are going to be strong for us, and I expect to see enterprise continue to be a strong vertical for us.” In other words, there's no reason to expect that growth will slow down in either Q2 or the rest of the year, in either enterprise or in the Cloud Titan space or anywhere else for this company.Another example, relating to product, is the transition to 100GB capacity switches. Without trying to bore readers, this transition has been one of the key factors that has been the fuel for Arista’s market share gains. Arista has enjoyed a substantial first mover advantage when it introduced the product last year, and it continues to add many forms and flavors to the technology. The company believes that the need for 100-gig in what is called the networking spine and in datacenter interconnect and in routing will be further established. And a year from now, 400-gig switches of various kinds are expected to arrive to further enhance the product differentiation of this company. (Readers might be particularly interested in this particular article in which the CFO confesses she had no idea that the latest generation of switches would lead to hyper growth. Would anyone bet that the next generation of switches will not have a similar impact?)Last year, the company introduced its FlexRoute, one of the more innovative routers in some time. The company secured 200 customers last year and said it would double that amount this year - that doesn’t really sound like slowing growth.I think it is possible that some readers and Arista shareholders may think about competitive moats as though they were some kind of ditch surrounding a medieval castle with sharp spikes and a wall manned by men who might cast boiling water on attackers. Competitive moats in the tech world are really quite a bit different than that. I have linked here to an Arista White Paper that is a commercial for its competitive advantages in the current networking environment. For those readers who haven’t the time or desire to wade through the commercial, Arista’s claims its advantages include the 5A’s availability, agility, automation, analytics and open APIs. How much of the hype is real? I am not likely to provide a buying guide for data center switches for readers. I haven’t either the knowledge or the context to be able to do so. I'm reasonably sure that Arista has had substantial advantages in the switching space for many years - and I would be surprised, given the background and reputation of its leadership team, if most of the claims made in the white paper couldn’t be validated, in whole or in part.Arista has been in the pole position in Gartner’s MQ report for Data Center Networking for some years now, although it is fair to point out that Cisco isn’t that far behind - at least on the chart, with the other competitors badly lagging. Arista’s major disadvantage in the latest Gartner MQ, which is 10-months-old at this point, is that it lacks campus switching. Of course, with the company’s latest announcement, that caution has become an advantage. I have linked the MQ report here - it is probably more useful for potential investors in Arista to understand Cisco’s problems than to hear about Arista’s prowess. To summarize, Cisco is far more expensive, even after all this time than anyone else in the networking space. And some users have problems with migration to an SDN framework (Cisco's version is proprietary and called ACI), and the company continues to lag in terms of a fixed form factor for SDN which forces customers to make suboptimal hardware choices.As mentioned earlier, there really isn’t all that much “new” business available in the data center switching space - if Cisco has a product that costs more and has some deficiencies, it isn’t all that surprising that it is donating market share and Arista is capturing many of those donations. Is Cisco likely to become more competitive in the switching space - now, as compared to the recent past? That is an issue that always plagues companies with large installed bases and high market share. It is rarely something that can be measured by outsiders, and its raw price aggression often just doesn’t work - mainly because it does nothing to deal with functional issues or TCO analysis.Somewhat analogously, Dell has a program called “Refuse to Lose” which is supposed to prevent its market share loses in the storage space to Pure (NYSE:PSTG), NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) and HPE (NYSE:HPE). It simply hasn’t worked because the program doesn’t address issues of total cost of ownership - and Cisco is burdened with that problem as well.The CEO of Arista was asked on the call about the pricing/competitive environment in terms of possible changes. Her answer was pretty straightforward in terms of commentary about Cisco and Juniper (JNPR) in that the competitive landscape hadn’t changed - just normal aggression. The CEO actually talked about white box, or as she called it disaggregated EOS (Operating System) technology. She said she hadn’t seen any shift or change - the same as she has said before.From time to time, I expect Arista shares will be buffeted by analyst downgrades based on concerns about Cisco. After the dust settles, nothing much is likely to change, and Arista will continue its growth by taking market share in its several major business areas and in focusing its efforts at growth in the areas of the switching space that are actually growing. If Arista’s growth is going to slow down, it most likely will not be because of a breach of its competitive moat, or from newly enhanced competition from legacy suppliers.I really don’t know if I have successfully answered the question of Arista’s likely growth in the next couple of years. I think the company has plenty of opportunities such that growth can exceed 25%-30% and at times reach substantially higher. These opportunities include competitive market share gains in terms of improving its performance in the enterprise based on its recent product announcements. In addition, the company is likely to continue to see its business with its existing Cloud Titan customers grow rapidly as those businesses continue their breakneck expansion. The coming introduction of 400 GB switches is likely to drive faster percentage growth amongst this class of customer. Further, the opportunities for international growth are substantial as the company builds out its infrastructure globally under the management guidance of a relatively new leader. And while depending on whose statistics are considered, routing is a low growth or a shrinking market for Arista, all of its sales are net new, and it is forecasting 100% growth in this space this year coming from new use cases.Does all that total more than 30% - I really do not think there's any way of knowing with any precision if it does and that Arista management itself doesn’t have fantastic visibility when it comes to the back half of this year, based on their conference call commentary. My guess is that Arista is more likely than not to substantially exceed the consensus expectations which have growth descending to 25% this current quarter, and continuing to fall for the balance of the year and for 2019. And that of course is the crux of the valuation issue.The company has offered a very modest 7% sequential growth forecast for this current quarter that computes to about 30% year-on-year revenue growth. The odds seem quite high that the company will exceed that forecast and that the forecast was intended as one to be beaten. I think the current forecast that the company provided with its earnings release is a function of management’s concern that this quarter’s comparisons with last year’s Q2, when growth reached more than 50% based on large cloud networking procurements, will be difficult in terms of growth percentages. But that said, there was nothing that unusual regarding the Q1 revenue growth number - 7% sequential growth simply seems to be another forecast designed to be exceeded.ANET is one of the more profitable vendors out there, in part due to Cisco’s pricing umbrella. Last quarter, ANET’s gross margins were a bit above 64% compared to a bit less than 64% in the year earlier quarter. The company is guiding for slightly lower gross margins and lower operating margins in Q2, again based on a modest growth in sequential revenues coupled with mix variances. I think that if revenue growth is a bit greater than forecast, the margin “issues” such as they may be will vitiated.Overall, ANET saw operating margins grow sharply in Q1 from 30% to 35%. That was a function of a very modest growth in GAAP operating expense which grew by only 17%, compared to the 40% revenue growth. The improvement in EPS came despite the company's non-GAAP reconciliation actually rising from $.13 to $.14 in terms of EPS. Net after tax, Arista does not derive any benefit from stock-based comp and its GAAP earnings are greater than non-GAAP, which sets it apart from many other high-growth vendors in terms of earnings quality.In Q1, Arista increased its cash flow from operations by 20%. More than all of that increase was driven by the company’s increase in GAAP profits which in the event were up no less than 74%. Part of the increase in GAAP profits is because more of the company’s bookings are being reported in current period revenues based on age of the software that it sells. Thus, deferred revenue growth is slowing, with much of the difference falling into GAAP net income. This past quarter, the company ran down inventories substantially, perhaps because demand exceeded forecasts and the company saw inventory turns at 2.2X up from 1.8X in Q4. The company says it is optimizing its supply chain and this may result in higher inventory turns going forward. Arista does little manufacturing itself and hence, free cash flow is very close to CFFO.Arista does not forecast cash flow or free cash flow, and it is difficult therefore to forecast that metric. Historically, cash flow has significantly exceeded reported non-GAAP profits, and I imagine it will continue to do so, although perhaps by a smaller margin than in prior years. I think that it is probably reasonable to anticipate that the company can generate $750-$800 million of free cash flow this year, based on the company's current enterprise value which is about $19.2 billion. The projected free cash flow yield for Arista is about 4%.As mentioned earlier, I think this is a reasonable entry point into the shares of this high-quality growth franchise. It isn't cheap, but as in some many fields of endeavor, the best is rarely cheap. I think there's plenty of positive alpha available here for investors."

It beat the street’s revenue and EPS forecasts once again. In fact, this was actually the 17th straight quarter in which the networking stalwart registered 30%-plus growth in sales on a year-on-year basis. In spite of its remarkable results, Arista’s shares crashed by more than 10% on Friday on concerns that its growth momentum would slow down over the course of FY18. But this decline isn’t necessarily warranted or justified. There's reason to believe that the recent dip in its shares only presents a buying opportunity for long-term investors.(Source: Bigstockphoto, image license purchased by author)Let me start by saying that Arista’s latest set of financial results were absolutely spectacular. Not only did the company manage to beat the street’s estimates, but it seems like its growth momentum accelerated over the period. This aspect of Arista’s business isn’t quite apparent if we just glance over its earnings report without digging deeper into it. The chart attached below should put things in perspective. I suppose it only goes to show that markets are inefficient and tend to overreact from time to time.(Source: BusinessQuant.com, Data from MarketXLS, ""g"" stands for guidance)Fact of the matter is that Arista’s sales growth in Q1 FY18 was actually higher than the respective Q1 figures from the preceding two years and nobody seems to have mentioned this. Making matters worse, its shares witnessed a massive sell-off largely because its management gave rather conservative guidance. Conventional wisdom would suggest that unless there’s something wrong with operations, soft guidance should be met with softness in the concerned company’s shares and not with a sell-off in excess of 10%.The chart attached above provides us with another insight into the company’s growth momentum. Yes, its sales growth has been guided to cool down over the course of FY18. The company’s management did say during their latest conference call that their sales growth would average out at around 25% in the next three quarters. But can this guidance figure alone justify the substantial sell-off in its shares? I don’t think so.Rather than going with the crowd and sounding the alarm bells, there are a couple of takeaways that investors should rather be focused on. The company has tough comparables to begin with. The chart attached above would indicate that Arista has grown its sales at 40%-plus rates in Q2, Q3 and Q4 in the past fiscal year. So, if it’s guiding a 25% growth for the remainder of FY18, then it essentially means it will be growing its revenues on top of already stellar results from the past year. This doesn’t even remotely suggest that Arista has started to face headwinds from operational or competitive standpoints.Secondly, it seems like Arista’s management gave out rather conservative guidance for the remainder of FY18. Here’s an excerpt from the company’s latest earnings call:Its management explicitly noted during the conference call that they don’t have much visibility into its Q4 yet. So, rather than extrapolating historical growth rates, it seems like management chose to assign lower growth rates for periods where they lack full visibility. I suppose it amounts to conservative guidance at best. But the broad swath of market participants sold off the company’s shares anyway, almost as if:Quite clearly, there's no evidence to back any of the above statements so I suppose the sell-off can be considered an extreme market overreaction, and a buying opportunity at best.With that said, there’s another thing that caught my attention when reading the company’s earnings call transcript. It seems like the community of “professional” analysts (the bigshot guys on fancy pay packages who assign buy or sell ratings) don’t seem to have a full understanding of the company’s operations either.Here’s what Mitch Steves from RBC Capital asked during the conference call:Jayshree Ullal, CEO of Arista, responded by saying:This sounded like a basic concept of economics, one that a college professor would regurgitate in ECON101 lectures. I’m sure Mitch is an extremely smart guy who probably just misunderstood Arista’s operational dynamics. But this certainly begs the question - what if the recent sell-off in Arista’s shares was caused by a market-wide misunderstanding about its growth prospects?After all, Arista doesn’t reveal a segment-wise breakdown of its results on regular intervals. So I suppose it’s easy to miscalculate the extent of its growth potential or to evaluate the strength of its business verticals.One might argue that Arista’s shares are overvalued now that its sales are projected to grow at a much slower pace over the course of FY18. But that’s not necessarily the case here. The following chart, which was compiled using analyst projections for upcoming quarters, should put things in perspective. Arista’s shares seem to be trading at vastly lower multiples compared to their prior levels.ANET EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YChartsWith that said, I’d like to remind readers there's no evidence to suggest that Arista is starting to face operational headwinds. The company isn’t yet done with 100G launches, so the pending releases should bolster its revenue growth over the course of FY18. Arista also is simultaneously working on its 400G product pipeline so it would be able to transition to industry-leading products just as the 100G-market starts becoming commoditized. This can potentially further drive its sales and ASPs higher. I suppose that until there’s a credible threat to the company’s operational positioning, or to its growth trajectory, long-term investors should just stay invested in the company and ignore the short-term noise.Author's Note: I'll be covering Arista Networks more often in the future.

4165382,69175,2018-04-25T08:30:16-04:00,"Arista Networks is scheduled to report its Q1 earnings on May 3.Keep an eye out for its revenue and revenue growth figures as that could make or break investors' sentiment.Also, keep an eye out on its market share figures and international revenue share as both metrics stand to meaningfully contribute to its long-term sustained growth.","Arista Networks (ANET) is scheduled to announce its first quarter earnings report next week. The company's shares have largely been distressed and haven't recovered since its last earnings call, so investors would be hoping to get some positive announcements that can potentially fire up the stock. Only time will tell what the actual numbers will look like, but in the meantime, I wanted to discuss a few key items that investors should be watching closely when the software networking stalwart hosts its Q1 earnings on May 3. Let's take a look.Let me start by giving credit where it's due. Arista's management has done a fantastic job at growing its business amidst cut-throat competition. They didn't compete merely on price, but also focused on research and development in relevant fields which, in turn, enabled them to come out with products that offered cutting-edge performance at competitive price points. So, it wasn't a fluke that the company managed to grab a significant piece of the high-speed switch market from the current industry leader, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).(Source: Business Quant, MarketXLS)I've attached a chart above for your reference. Arista's growth rate has simply been phenomenal and the company continues to develop industry-leading networking solutions to continue growing going forward. This at least goes to show that the management isn't sitting on its laurels from past years but is actually working proactively with its engineering team to drive growth over the years to come. But I suppose the issue at hand here is that the market might be expecting a lot from Arista's management.I'd like to point to readers that Arista is currently trading at about 11 times and 48 times its trailing twelve-month sales and earnings, respectively. These pricey multiples indicate that the market is willing to be a part of Arista's stellar growth story even if it means paying a premium for it. I have no doubt that the company will continue to grow over the coming years. But we must acknowledge the fact that Arista may not necessarily be able to maintain its historical growth momentum with its size increasing every quarter.In fact, this aspect of Arista's business came to bite investors in the last earnings call. The company has been growing its revenues at 40%-plus rates for many quarters now, but its management noted that their growth rate would moderate to mid-20% for the year. This sent its shares spiraling down by as much as 23% in a matter of four trading sessions and the stock is yet to fully regain those past levels.The strange part here is that analysts are already modeling for Arista's growth to slow down substantially over the next few years and yet its shares continue to trade at lofty multiples. I suppose either the market or the analyst community is bound to be wrong on this one, primarily because:(Source: Business Quant, MarketXLS, Estimates from 4-traders.com)Management had guided in their last earnings call that revenues for Q1 would be anywhere between $450 million and $468 million which is more or less in line with the analyst consensus of $463 million. But rather than focusing merely on the extent of Arista's beat or miss, I recommend that readers also closely track its sales growth for Q1 and guided rate of sales growth for Q2. I suppose changes to its growth momentum can make or break the investor's sentiment relating to the company due to the aforementioned reasons.Anyone closely following the sector would know that Arista has been growing at Cisco's expense. It's not like the former managed to grow its sales over the past several years simply because the entire industry was growing and it grew along in tandem with others, or that it hiked its average selling prices ((ASPs)) to boost sales. Rather, Arista has been coming out with disruptive products that offer similar if not better levels of flexibility and functionality at competitive price-points compared to industry standards.(Source: Arista)The chart attached above would indicate that Arista's market share is quite small compared to Cisco's. But the fact of the matter is that Cisco is a giant and already has solutions for the broad swath of the networking industry. On the other hand, Arista is a much smaller firm that is selectively going after opportunities in the high-speed segment to make the most of its limited resources, whether it's cash, manpower, or intellectual property.Besides that, another prevalent trend in the chart above is that Arista has gradually managed to grow its share in the segment over time. Meanwhile, Cisco's market share has continuously declined. Granted that revenues indicate how a company is performing from a financial standpoint, but market share figures tend to indicate the competitiveness of concerned companies on an operational level, which is equally important in my opinion. So, I would also be closely tracking Arista's market share gains for the quarter.Arista doesn't provide a segment-wise breakdown of its sales, so it's hard to really predict how things will evolve on a more granular level. But given what we have access to, I'll be looking at its geographical mix. The company generates most of its revenues from the U.S for the time being.(Source: Business Quant)It's a well-known fact that Arista is a technologically sound company, with products that are making the industry-leaders very anxious. So, rather than limiting its prowess and the associated gains to just the U.S., I suppose Arista can make a killing if it could come up with a coordinated international sales effort.It would extend Arista's competitiveness in other established international markets as well. This would not only diversify its revenue streams and reduce its risk exposure but it will also unlock growth in geographical regions that Arista hasn't fully tapped yet. In addition to moving to 400G switches in 2019, I suspect its international expansion efforts could also pave way for continued growth over the years to come.So, I'll be also looking at Arista's geographical sales mix when it reports its Q1 earnings on May 3.When Arista comes out with its Q1 earnings report on May 3, everyone will be watching its sales growth and guidance figures. Given the company's growth potential, presented by 400G transition next year and the scope of its international expansion, I'm of the opinion that Arista can grow faster than what analysts are currently modeling for. Therefore, I would recommend that readers ignore the short-term noise and focus on the bigger picture. Tracking the aforementioned key items can provide us with a better understanding of where its shares could be headed next.Author's Note: I'll be reviewing Arista's Q1 earnings report on May 4 in a subsequent article.

4150426,21815,2018-02-24T18:08:08-05:00,"Arista Networks experienced a meteoric share price rise, so they came down quite a bit in short order.We don't see any fundamental problem. Talk of the growth rate slowing down a bit isn't new, especially given the 50%+ growth in Q2 and Q3 of 2017.For those who have missed this terrific stock, there is a chance to establish a position.","After the shares of Arista Networks (ANET) seemed to be on an eternal rising path due to a growing market and growing market share, they have sold off quite a bit in recent days.The rising path before this selloff isn't hard to understand, the company is pretty blunt about it in its earnings slides:Revenues have been steadily rising over the years, and on a percentage basis EBITDA and net earnings even more so:The worry is that the growth is tapering off. So far, there doesn't seem to be really all that much to worry about:But the CEO caused a bit of a stir in the last earnings call that top-line growth would moderate to a more typical mid 20s for the year (2018).While that doesn't seem illogical from the perspective of the law of large numbers (not to mention the large rally in the shares), we are not there yet.Q4 results were still very good:Q4 top-line growth was still 42.7% and 2017 top-line growth was 45.8%. That's not much of a slowdown, and it is nowhere near the 'typical mid-20s.' EPS beat by $0.30 to $1.71 and growth was also a beat, although by just 2%.The guidance for Q1 comes in at between $450M and $468M, which is still 36.8% higher than the $335.5M of Q1 2017. To get into the mid-20s for the year revenue has to slow down considerably from here.This isn't impossible as management argued during the Q4CC that the company faces some tough comps in the coming quarters, and indeed, looking at quarterly growth in 2017:These are certainly tough comps, but it doesn't hurt to look a little beyond the top line worries. Even with a slowing revenue growth, it's entirely possible the company still manages to expand margins and/or create increasing amounts of free cash flow, which provide other sources of shareholder bliss.One of the most promising growth areas where the company still has a lot of leeway is in international markets. Today, international sales constitute just over a quarter of sales, but as management argued, the company is acquiring international customers at considerably faster rate (a figure of 60% of new customers being outside the US was mentioned during the Q4CC). Companies outside the US are less used to Arista's unique solutions but management is seeing a lot of interest abroad, for instance in the service provider market. From Q4CC:Fellow SA contributor Mehdi Zare has given a good overview of some of the competitive strengths, market characteristics and growth opportunities (here), so we refer readers to that article. Non-GAAP gross margin was a tad higher even at 65.9%, up sequentially from 64.4%.Non-GAAP operating margins came in at 36.1%. Operating costs have a long-term target model (Q4CC):R&D came in a little ahead at 20.5%. Sales & marketing expense was considerably below (at 7.2%) and was even down in dollar terms sequentially due to reduced demo and sales cost.There might be some room for further margin expansion, but on the other hand, the company spent considerably less on sales and marketing compared to their long-term target. There was no indication that this was a one-off though.Since the company doesn't need much in the way of CapEx or other adjustments (apart from the services deferred revenue), free cash flow basically follows net income. It isn't surprising that the company has started to generate substantial amounts of cash, given the growth and increasing operating margins. Q4 free cash flow was very high and the company keeps piling it up:For the year, the company generated over $631.6M in operating cash flow and over $600M in free cash flow, but the company is not ready yet to start distributing some of that to shareholders, preferring to keep investing in the business. We don't have a fundamental problem with that as long as the cash keeps piling up. There is of course some worry from the share based compensation:But as long as EPS keeps growing as it has done (see bottom graph) we don't think shareholders have much (if anything) to complain about. Apart from the usual risks (market selloff, recession) Arista seems to have a very solid market position, gaining share from the market leader Cisco (CSCO). Here is the Motley Fool on this (from Yahoo):We tend to be on the bull side on this. While Cisco has had a decent quarter, returning to (albeit rather modest: 2.8%) growth, it's splashing money on buybacks (it has a $6B program and has now put a $25B program on top of that).Then there are the multiple patent cases that Cisco has brought to bear on Arista. We have no legal training so we're refraining from any judgement here (this article provides some useful intro), but so far Cisco hasn't been able to inflict much damage to Arista, apart from quite a lot of legal cost and some workarounds. From the linked article:And just last week Arista won another case when an appeals court deemed a Cisco patent not to be patentable. It's too early for victory laps perhaps, but so far so good.The figures above are GAAP figures and backwards looking, so there is little wonder the valuation seems a little steep. There is actually not all that much difference between GAAP EPS ($5.35) and non-GAAP EPS ($5.61), so that multiple is steep, despite the recent selloff. This year, analyst expect an EPS of $6.92, rising to $8.25 in 2019, but even the 2019 multiple is still 30. We have no doubt Arista is a terrific company and few would disagree with that. It has built a better mouse trap for a market that is still experiencing significant growth, and it will grow for quite some time to come. As a consequence, the company has taken market share from the leader, Cisco. And although the latter has fought back mostly with legal means, Arista still seems on the winning hand (also legally, although it's too early for definite conclusions). So unless something comes out of the blue (like Arista itself), investors can expect strong growth to continue, although whether that growth will be 25%, 30% or even higher remains to be seen. The company spends a lot on R&D (the base case model is 20% of revenue, it was 20.5% in Q4) so they keep innovating and improving.So the main question investors have to answer is how much they value the shares if growth indeed 'slows' to 25%. If the company can maintain its competitive advantage and hence margins, there is still the prospect of increasing cash, apart from the growth itself.Another question that needs an answer is why the shares fell so much in the first place. Apart from the fact that they were up quite a lot, we don't really have an answer to that one. What we do think is that opening a position here offers good risk/reward. We don't discard the possibility that the shares will fall a bit further, perhaps even to their 200-day moving average at $200 and change, but unless something drastic happens to the markets we think they will go up fairly quickly as well. More likely is that we have reached something of a bottom here. We wouldn't go all in at this moment, but a position seems attractive to us."
4169751,103480,2018-05-04T06:55:54-04:00,"Arista crashed 8% after Q1 earnings on soft gross margin guidance.Just like in Q4, Arista's selloff follows an extremely strong quarter in which the company beat expectations on both the top and bottom line.Revenues grew 42% y/y while pro forma EPS grew 83% y/y, making Arista one of the fastest-growing companies in the hardware sector.Arista continues its sector leadership over incumbents like Cisco, and a few points of gross margin shift are not a long-term indicator of slipping fundamentals.","Like many Arista Networks (ANET) investors, I continue to be frustrated by the market's lack of appreciation for what I believe to be one of the technology hardware sector's highest-quality names. The networking hardware vendor - which bills itself as sort of a new-age Cisco (CSCO) whose products are built for the cloud era - continues its dominance and growth in a staid corner of the technology industry that is more or less flat year-over-year. Yet Arista - led by a woman who was once a top lieutenant of Cisco's John Chambers - shows that new players with superior technology can turn a boring industry upside down on its head.Stocks that crash 10% after earnings tend to see much worse-than-expected results or terrifying forward guidance. In Arista's case - both this quarter and last quarter - it was neither.Let's recall what caused Arista to topple ~20% after Q4 earnings last quarter. The company had guided to $450-468 million in revenues for Q1, implying 38% y/y growth at the midpoint. Analysts had then expected $459 million, making the guidance in line, but investors weren't impressed and dumped the stock.What actually happened in Q1, which we now know, is that Arista ended up posting $472.5 million in revenues, or 42% y/y growth - ahead of the high end of the guidance range, and ahead of Wall Street's expectations both at the end of Q4 and now. Don't punish a company with a history of conservatism - Arista always beats itself and the market every quarter without fail. See below the company's earnings history, provided by Seeking Alpha:Source: Seeking AlphaThere is no cause for the post-earnings selloff that took Arista yet again below $250 (it had closed near $270 prior to reporting earnings, as shown below). Arista's P/E in the mid-30s certainly isn't cheap, but in the context of nearly doubling EPS on a y/y basis each quarter, this is certainly one of the best-valued growth stocks in the market. For me, every dip is a buying opportunity. I'm holding my breath and adding more.ANET data by YChartsHere's a look at Arista's results for the quarter:Figure 1. Arista Q1 resultsSource: Arista investor relationsAs previously noted, Arista achieved stellar 42% y/y revenue growth to $472.5 million, squarely beating its prior guidance range of $459-468 million in revenues as well as analysts' consensus target of $463.4 million (39% y/y), a target that had already moved upward during the quarter. Arista's long stretch of >40% growth (last year, for the full FY17, Arista had generated 46% y/y growth - an incredible number for a company exiting the year at a nearly $2 billion revenue run rate).It seems that Arista investors really didn't care much about the growth this quarter however (really strange because most of the Arista crowd are hardcore growth investors). What dominated the earnings reaction was Arista's gross margin.As seen above, Arista's gross profit of $302.9 million represented a GAAP gross margin of 64.1% - a hair lighter (just 10bps) than 1Q17 gross margin of 64.2%. There's no need to make a federal case out of this (as Elon Musk said in response to a gross margin question during Tesla (TSLA) earnings) - a 10bps shift in gross margin can easily rectify in the future, and can be driven by a lot of non-permanent factors.Investors, of course, also zoomed into Arista's gross margin guidance (on a pro forma basis) of 62% to 64% for Q2. Analysts had wanted to see 64.2%. Yes, it's true that a shortfall of as much as two points in gross margin for next quarter is a much bigger issue than a 10bps slide this quarter, but we have to remember that Arista is famed for its conservative guidance principles. It wouldn't be surprising at all to see Arista hit the high end or even exceed its gross margin range entirely in Q2. It has, after all, held its gross margin in the 64-65% range for the past several quarters, and a two-point shift would indicate some seismic event that is no more than mere conjecture.And in any case, Arista's continuous recognition by Gartner as a leader in the networking space, as well as the general flood of positive reviews from customers, continues to enshrine it as a top competitor in the space. Gross margin pressures are not, as Citron Research would have it, an indication that the industry is suddenly moving more toward ""white-box"" solutions. While certainly cost-conscious IT buyers exist out there, most IT decision-makers are spending their company's money, and they want the best that money can buy. It's these customers who generate the largest enterprise billings for the least customer maintenance expenses, and this is Arista's focus anyway. Gross margin moves are just one part of the story - it must also be read in context with Arista's incredible growth and tailwinds in the competition versus Cisco. The chart below taken from Arista's earnings deck showcases its share growth against the legacy giant:Figure 2. Arista market share gainsSource: Arista investor relationsGiven that Cisco still holds about half of the market (but is consistently losing share), Arista still has plenty of room for penetration.And gross margin aside, Arista clearly still has plenty of room to boost its earnings expansion regardless. Arista showed extreme expense discipline in growing its R&D and sales and marketing expenses by less than its revenue growth, indicating significant operating leverage as the company continues to scale. And the company also managed to take its general and administrative spending down.This has resulted in an operating margin of 35.3% this quarter, up an impressive 510bps from 30.2% in 1Q17. It's exceedingly evident that the company can make up for any gross margin losses by continuing to gain operating leverage.GAAP net income grew 74% y/y in the quarter to $144.5 million. Arista's earnings growth has outpaced the ~30% growth seen across the broader technology industry this quarter. EPS of $1.66 also grew 78% y/y and showed 10% upside to analyst expectations of $1.51.With a three-point beat to revenue expectations and 10% surprise upside on the EPS figure, it's unclear why investors would react with an 8% selloff to Arista shares. The company is still obviously on remarkably strong footing, with huge revenue growth and operating leverage improvements leading to a near doubling of profits.Disappointed as I am that my Arista position still hasn't recovered to pre-Q4 highs above $300, the silver lining is that this misguided Q1 selloff has presented an opportunity to load up on more undervalued Arista shares and dollar-cost average down. Few companies in the enterprise technology sector, much less the hardware sector, have generated as much goodwill from customers as Arista, and it shows in the company's hyper-growth results.Gross margin worries will recede. Twilio (TWLO), a CPaaS software company, went through a similar dilemma two quarters ago, where a dip in gross margins caused investors to panic that the business was becoming commoditized. Fast forward less than half a year later, and Twilio is notching new highs for 2018, with a new product launch and growth-driven results accelerating enthusiasm for the stock. Gross margin hasn't yet fully corrected to prior levels, but investors seem to care much less.Arista will undergo a similar phasing with its recovery. At the moment, too much doom-and-gloom surrounds the stock, but eventually, the market will give Arista credit for its revenue and earnings growth again. Be patient with this stock and continue to buy the dips."
4148067,25120,2018-02-19T06:47:54-05:00,"Arista Network has defied all doubters in recent years, having delivered on impressive growth and expanding margins.The company continues to undercut Cisco, which has again resulted in a very strong momentum run in 2017.Even after a 20% pullback, shares trade with gains for 2018, although continued growth makes that shares look interesting if they come under further pressure.","Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) has continued to amaze me. Around the time of the IPO back in the summer of 2014, I looked at the prospects for the shares, but decided that levels around $55 on the opening day left shares too risky for me.Trading at 9 times sales, although sales were growing quickly, left me cautious, although the real reasons for caution were the competitive environment and, even more so, the risk of litigation in which the company has been involved.Initially, my reservations looked reasonable. After all, shares were trading at similar levels in the summer of 2016, as investors have seen no returns over this period of two years. Unfortunately, I have not kept up with the growth development of Arista ever since, as valuation multiple compression, thanks to growth in 2015 and 2016, made that $55 was a great entry point in 2016 (with the benefit of hindsight). Continued advancements made that shares hit a high of +$300 in recent weeks.While a pullback to $250 looks meaningful, shares have still five-folded in about two years' time, as the setback provides a great time to review the situation.Arista is all about its EOS offering, which supports virtualisation and cloud solutions from most major players. The benefits of the cloud over traditional networks are well documented, as Arista's EOS solution addresses the scale of data which needs to be put on the cloud. The solutions are very much in demand with data centers and large customers which have their own dedicated centers.The growth trajectory over the past few years has been nothing short of amazing. Arista reported revenues of $361.2 million in 2013, the last year before the company went public. Revenues were up 62% in 2014 and rose another 43% to $837.6 million in 2015.Earnings were on the increase as well, although operating margins equal to 18% of sales in 2015 were actually similar in terms of percentages compared to 2013. The company reported earnings of $120 million in 2015, or $1.67 per diluted share. Including $645 million in net cash, the company operated with $9 per share net in cash.As shares were trading in the low $70s in early 2016, that implied that operating assets were trading around $60, for a 35 times trailing earnings multiple. That looked a lot more reasonable than the valuations at the time of the IPO, certainly as sales growth still came in at 40% per year.The company grew sales by 35% in 2016 to $1.13 billion, while it managed to grow operating margins to +21%. The +50% increase in net earnings attracted a lot of investors, as shares had risen to the $100 mark by the end of 2016.Last year was a crazy one for Arista, most noteworthy in its valuation. First-quarter revenues were up 38%. Growth accelerated to 50% in the second quarter, 51% in the third quarter and remained very steady at 43% in the final quarter.These results are astonishing, as growth is only accelerating on a percentage base, while the company already surpassed the billion mark in revenue in 2016. Full-year sales were up 46% to $1.65 billion, yet the real impressive performance was seen in the margins, as operating profits nearly doubled in absolute terms and rose to more than 28% of sales.The company earned $5.35 per share, which is more than double the earnings reported in 2016, as the net cash position of $1.5 billion comes in at nearly $20 per share as well. These achievements made that shares rose from $100 at the start of 2017 to $235 by the end of the year. After backing out net cash, earning multiples have risen from the mid-30s to 40 times earnings, following a doubling of earnings in 2017 and acceleration of growth.Very strong momentum pushed shares up to a high of $311 per share just ahead of the fourth-quarter earnings release, and despite a 19% pullback in response to the earnings report to $250 per share, these shares are still trading with gains of 6% so far this year.Alongside the fourth-quarter release, Arista provided its first-quarter outlook for 2018, as it traditionally only looks forward one quarter at a time. Revenues are seen between $450 million and $468 million, with non-GAAP margins at around 32%.Based on the midpoint of the revenue guidance, sales growth is at 37% in the first quarter, marking a slightly lower pace of growth than investors had gotten used to in 2017. It should be said that actual revenues have recently come in far ahead of the initial guidance provided, although the degree by which Arista has beaten its own guidance has come down a bit. In the fourth quarter, the company beat its own midpoint by $11 million, as a similar result would imply growth rates of 40% in Q1 of 2018 on an annual basis.What is clear is that Arista has built up a very impressive track record in a short period of time after it has gone public, by combining very steady and impressive revenue growth with real margin expansion. While the latest 20% pullback looks appealing, it has come in reaction to a great momentum run, as shares are still up for 2018 and have still more than doubled compared to this time last year.If we assume a more modest 25% earnings growth in 2018, driven by 25% sales growth and flattish margins (as the growth rates have recently been indicated by management), earnings might come in around $6.70 per share, as cash holdings could easily grow to $25-30 by the end of the year. The improved earnings potential, growing cash holdings and correction makes that multiples are coming down rapidly.Given the track record and still-impressive current growth rates, I would be happy to buy around a 25 times forward multiple, translating at $168 per share. Including cash holdings, that would make me a buyer at levels just below the $200 mark, as I would be looking to start initiating a small position at those levels, given the company has certainly pushed out the doubts which I had at the time of the IPO.After all, Arista has grown sales by >40% for years in a row now, taking huge market share from Cisco in the high-speed data center switching market. As insiders continue to hold large stakes in the business, the company gains market share by undercutting Cisco, and its target markets continue to grow at a nice clip, I am happy to pick up a few shares below the $200 mark."
4149350,103358,2018-02-22T09:05:56-05:00,Arista Networks experienced a sharp up/down trend over the last few days.Such movements are usual for ANET and happened a handful number of times since its IPO.ANET is undervalued based on my fundamental analysis.Low Guidance for Q1 is business as usual for ANET.,"I started covering Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET) back in September 2017 with a buy rating at $180 with a target price of $215 (Arista Networks: A Buy For Long-Term Investors). Since then, the company outperformed S&P 500, PHLX Semiconductor Sector (SOX), S&P North American Technology Sector Index (SPGSTI), Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductors Index (DJUSSC) and even its main competitor, by a large margin.ANETYChartsHowever, after the recent earnings report on February 15, 2018, the stock tanked severely by about 18% in two preceding sessions.ANETYChartsProbably you think ANET posted a decline in growth, a significant charge or notified stockholders about a management turmoil or at least some bad news.Surprise! It's entirely the opposite.Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) filed several patent infringement cases against Arista Networks and it is fighting in courts for years. Last week, Federal Circuit Appeals Court ruled in favor of Arista Networks. Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray believes ""this increases the probability of victory for Arista in the 945 case and potentially the '43 case.""During the conference call on fourth-quarter earnings, Jayshree Ullal, CEO and President of Arista Networks, mentioned that the company now has more than 15 million cloud networking ports and lead the market in 100 Gigabit Ethernet switching.To understand the significance of this event, I urge you to take a look at the graph I used in my previous article.Source: As Networks Speed Up, Arista Gains Ground On Giant CiscoLeading the 100-gigabit market is a critical success for Arista Networks. Based on the expected market demand for different speeds, 100 Gigabit will replace the older 10 Gigabit by 2021.Source: Arista Networks 2017 - Q4 Earnings call slidesCEO also mentioned that Arista Networks would enter the 400 Gbps market next year. It is worth mentioning that industry-wide standard for 400 Gbps Ethernet passed by IEEE just a few days before the end of 2017 (Source: http://www.ieee802.org/3/400GSG/email/msg01519.html).Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOG) are among the major supporter of these super fast Ethernet ports.The growth of cloud computing, high bandwidth applications such as video streaming, and the need for low latency intra-server communication in data centers pushed the providers to come up with intuitive solutions. Arista Networks is leading the way here by offering an independent hardware system for managing and optimizing routers.EOS (Extensible Operating System) is the hearth of Arista Networks offering. Unlike legacy solutions, a client can benefit from this highly customizable operating system without committing to buy any specific hardware from Arista Networks. This proprietary operating system is based on Linux, and Arista Networks modified it to run on different cloud platforms such as Google, Azure (Microsoft), Amazon, or even Oracle.Source: Arista Networks 2017 - Q4 Earnings call slidesThis approach is extremely beneficial from an economic standpoint, allowing the cloud providers to cut their costs to 1/30. Arista Networks claims that a 100 GB port which costs over $100,000 using a traditional router, costs only $3,000 using its technology.Source: Arista Networks 2017 - Q4 Earnings call slidesThe continuous double-digit growth rate in its revenue and quick penetration in a business to business market may be considered as a proof of its claim.It's still a perplexing question to me. The earnings surprise is not as big as it used to be and the guideline for next quarter is not as promising as before, but the growth rate is still far beyond competitors, its market acceptance is growing fast and its profitability ratios improved.To base our investment decisions on a solid foundation, I updated my previous DCF model using the results of past two quarters.The first step in estimating the intrinsic value of the equity is to form a reasonable hypothesis about the future profitability and revenue growth. Arista Networks grew rapidly over the past five years and posted higher revenue for each quarter compared to the previous one (except one quarter).Source: Quarterly earnings reports, graph prepared by the authorFor the last five years, revenue had positive growth except in one quarter (2016 Q1 vs. 2015 Q4), with the average of 12.1%. If we use annual revenue, the growth rate is between 34.8% and 86.8% with the average of 51.8%.To be on the conservative side, I used 45% as the expected growth rate for 2018 compared to 2017 with 4% annual decline.A legitimate debate over my assumption for annual revenue growth can be the guidance provided by the company during the latest earnings conference call.ANET provided a lower than expected guidance for its 2018 Q1 revenue and many believe that this is the reason for the recent sell-off. To defend my assumptions for annual revenue growth, I prepared a table consisting of previous revenue guidance since the fourth quarter of 2015.Source: Quarterly earnings conference call, table prepared by the authorThe lowest percentage changes in guidance compared to previous quarter happened to be on guidance for Q1. For 2016, 2017, and 2018, it was -1.67%, 3.17%, and 0.44%, whereas the average value for all quarters was 7.61%!I believe this strategy is a conservative move by ANET to manage expectations over the next quarter, not an indicator of declining revenue growth.ANET effective tax rate was 17.06%, 23.96%, and 10.86% for 2015, 2016, and 2017 respectively. Again, to keep my conservative approach, I set it at 21%.Arista Networks has no long-term debt, and the total effect of interest income and other financial expenses was immaterial compared to EBITDA. It doesn't have any plan to add debt for the foreseeable future, and considering the amount of cash on the balance sheet, I believe it's reasonable to omit this item from our model.Change in non-cash working capital is assumed to be 3% of revenue and Capex set to 1.3% of revenue.For other value drivers, I used the average of the recent years.Source: Data from quarterly and annual reports, model prepared by the authorEven with conservative assumptions, this stock is undervalued by a large margin.Arista Networks targeted a niche market in the high-end networking infrastructure used for cloud computing and proved to have an edge in its technology. Cloud computing just started its growth cycle, with abundant of new investments from major corporations to catch up with the demand. My fundamental analysis shows that even with conservative assumptions on revenue growth and tax cut implication, this stock is still undervalued by the market."
4149895,20256,2018-02-23T05:31:35-05:00,"Traders must adapt to changing market conditions rather than sticking to old trading methods that were once profitable but are now destructive.To avoid common cognitive errors made by human traders, our models automatically make adjustments when market conditions change, such as the recent increase in expected volatility.Our regular participants offer specific trading ideas reflecting contrasting styles.","The Stock Exchange is all about trading. Each week, we do the following:We also have some fun. We welcome comments, links, and ideas to help us improve this resource for traders. If you have some ideas, please join in!Our previous Stock Exchange asked the question: ""Were You Stopped Out?"" We reviewed the dangers of using stop orders to limit risks and discussed ideas for minimizing the chances of getting stopped out near the bottom only to miss out on the subsequent rebound. If you missed it, a glance at your news feed will show that the key points remain relevant.Traders often get comfortable with ""what works,"" until all of a sudden it doesn't work anymore. For example, by historical standards, anticipated market volatility isn't very high right now, but it is still twice as high as it was just last month, as measured by the VIX.If you don't know, the VIX is a market volatility measure, often referred to as the market ""fear gauge,"" and we just did a write-up about it earlier this week: What Investors Should Know About VIX. However, even though ""fear"" (anticipated volatility) isn't exorbitantly high by historical market standards, the recent increase has taken investors outside of their comfort zone. Specifically, they got comfortable trading in a certain market environment (i.e. extremely low volatility) and now that that has changed, some traders have been taken way outside of their comfort zone. In the words of famous baseball player Yogi Berra: ""The future ain't what it used to be.""This is relevant because there are a few important lessons to be learned (or at least reminded of) about how/when traders can/should stick to their setups and plans. For example, Dr. Brett Steenbarger has a brilliant write-up titled ""A Powerful Technique for Changing Your Trading Psychology"" which delves into the psychological problem of learning something so well that it becomes automatic. The problem is that when your environment changes, the conditioned behaviors you've developed become irrelevant and often even harmful.Returning to our discussion of the VIX, many traders had become comfortable shorting volatility. And that trade was working great until volatility increased. For example, here is a look at what happened to the inverse VIX (XIV) security earlier this month when volatility finally increased:A trade that had been working very well for many months, all-of-a-sudden turned into an enormous loss. And our suspicion is that the recent spate of increased volatility caught many traders off guard. Whether they were over-leveraged, or just too comfortable with risk, the market changed, and they were not ready. And now, they are outside their comfort zone in the new environment. According to Dr. Steenbarger:Knowing how to adjust for different trading environments is important to us. And one way we've built this into our trading programs is to adjust our defined trading rules and systems based on market volatility levels. This allows the humans to stay out of the way while the trading models do what they are supposed to do in different market environments. Our human execution of the model trades provides an additional check that nothing is wrong, but we rarely make changes.The key takeaway is that when the market takes you outside of your comfort zone, you need to adapt. In this case, when volatility levels change, traders should recognize their once profitable trading programs can quickly turn very destructive. And without adapting (in this case, our models adjust based on volatility levels), your profits can quickly disappear.Per reader feedback, we're continuing to share the performance of our trading models, and the following table shows this week's update.Important to note, we find that blending a trend-following/momentum model (Athena) with a mean reversion/dip-buying model (Holmes) provides two strategies, effective in their own right, that are not correlated with each other or with the overall market. By combining the two, we can get more diversity, lower risk, and a smoother string of returns.And for these reasons, I am changing the ""Trade with Jeff"" offer at Seeking Alpha to include a 50-50 split between Holmes and Athena. Current participants have already agreed to this. Since our costs on Athena are lower, we have also lowered the fees for the combination.If you have been thinking about giving it a try, click through at the bottom of this post for more information. Also, readers are invited to write to main at newarc dot com for our free, brief description of how we created the Stock Exchange models.This week's Stock Exchange is being edited by Blue Harbinger; (Blue Harbinger is a source for independent investment ideas).Holmes: This week, I bought Arista Networks (ANET). Are you familiar with this one?Blue Harbinger: Yes, Holmes - I am familiar. Arista supplies cloud networking solutions. Why do you like this stock?Holmes: ""Cloud networking solutions?"" Can you be a little more specific, Blue Harbinger? And I like it for the same reason that I like all of my picks: I am a ""dip-buyer,"" and ANET's dip over the last week is the sort of setup I like to see. From the chart below, you can see it is below its 50-day moving average, and it has attractive upside over the next six weeks.BH: Interesting, Holmes. And yes, I can provide a more specific definition of Arista's business even though I know you are a technical model, and you're far more interested in the price action and market conditions than you are in the fundamentals. Nonetheless, Arista pioneers and delivers software-driven cloud networking solutions for large data center storage and computing environments. Revenue and net income have been growing rapidly for this company over the last few years, but its price-to-earnings ratio is still fairly high, even after the shares fell last week despite announcing expectation-beating revenues and earnings. Here is a look at the Fast Graph:Holmes: So, you're telling me this company is basically growing like wildfire, it has essentially zero long-term debt, and it just announced expectation-beating earnings, but the shares still just sold off? I like Arista even more now than I did before.BH: Well, if you must know, Holmes, the reason the shares sold off is because management says growth is slowing. After delivering 50% growth in the last two quarters, Arista's revenues are only expected to grow by 37% this quarter.Holmes: ""Only"" 37%? I still like this setup a lot. I usually hold for about six weeks, so check back with me then.BH: Great. Thanks, Holmes. How about your, Road Runner - what have you got for us this week?Road Runner: I sold my Whiting Petroleum (NYSE:WLL) stock on Wednesday 2/22 after purchasing it on 1/24. Here is a look at my ""buy"" chart followed by my ""sell"" chart.BH: I see why you bought this stock, Road Runner. I know you like to buy stocks in the lower end of a rising channel, and you typically like to sell them after about four weeks, but this one did not work out perfectly.RR: I ended up exiting at a lower price than I bought, but I was able to take advantage of a slightly higher price in a period of decline. You can't win them all, but as long as the size of your winners is bigger than the size of your losers, you'll do alright. We've written about this in previous Stock Exchanges, such as this one: Know When To Fold 'Em and this one Were You Stopped Out?BH: So what you're saying is the price moved outside of your ""comfort zone?"" From a fundamentals standpoint, Whiting announced expectations-beating earnings and revenue, as well as forecasting a smaller than previously expected quarterly loss. This is an energy exploration and production company focused primarily in the Rocky Mountain region. And the recent unexpected drop in crude oil inventories will help the business. Here is a look at the Fast Graph, and as you can see, Whiting has been struggling since energy prices plummeted in the second half of 2014.RR: I wasn't out of my comfort zone. I am an objective technical model, and I was created to specifically avoid the ""comfort zone"" issue you're describing. However, thanks for that information. How about you, Athena - what have you got this week?Athena: I like Twitter (TWTR).BH: What do you like about Twitter, Athena?Athena: I am a momentum trader. Here is a look at the chart.BH: You certainly are a momentum trader. It takes courage to buy a stock that's just rallied nearly 38% in the last month. You must like that Twitter beat earnings and revenue estimates on February 8th when it announced, correct?Athena: I like the things you mentioned, but my pick is based more on strong technicals.BH: Well, it's nice to see Twitter finally turning a GAAP profit for the first time. However, I don't think this company is growing fast enough to get excited about. According to the earnings release, fourth quarter revenue grew by only 2% year over year, and net margins are only 12%. Plus, it makes me a little uncomfortable that CEO Jack Dorsey is also the CEO of Square (SQ). I question his focus. And honestly, I like Square's business and growth potential much more. Here is a look at the Fast Graph for Twitter.Athena: Thanks for the information, but you seem focused on long-term growth. My typical holding period is only about 17 weeks.BH: Well, then, I'll check back with you on Twitter in about 17 weeks. How about you, Felix - what have you got this week?Felix: This week, I like First Solar (FSLR).BH: You like First Solar? - this company designs, manufactures, and sells photovoltaic (""PV"") solar modules with a thin-film semiconductor technology. First Solar has developed, constructed, and currently operates many of the world's largest grid-connected PV power plants. Any particular reason you like this company, Felix?Felix: I am a momentum trader, but unlike the other traders, I hold my position for a longer time period, 66 weeks on average.BH: Then, I am assuming you are aware of more of the fundamentals, beyond only the technicals. How do you feel about the 30% tariff that was recently imposed on international (mainly China) suppliers of solar panels to the US.Felix: The tariff may help First Solar in the near term, although in the longer-term tariffs usually result in less efficient trade.BH: First Solar announced earnings this week. They beat consensus estimates by $0.06 per share, although the company missed on revenue. And worth mentioning, First Solar has a strong balance sheet which will enable it to invest in its business going forward.Felix: Thanks for that information, but I mainly like this stock because it has momentum and more room to run.When market conditions change, it often quickly takes traders outside of their comfort zones. And rather than sticking to a trading regime that was designed specifically for a market environment that no longer exists, it's important for traders to ""unlearn"" old trading behaviors that used to create profits but now create losses. For example, our technical trading models make adjustments when expected volatility changes.As famous baseball player Yogi Berra once said, ""the future ain't what it used to be."" In this case, the key takeaway is that when the market changes and takes you outside of your comfort zone, you need to adapt.Each week, Felix and Oscar host a poker game for some of their friends. Since they are all traders, they love to discuss their best current ideas before the game starts. They like to call this their ""Stock Exchange.""

4147579,103480,2018-02-16T09:03:40-05:00,"Arista Networks had its first quarterly disappointment in Q4, falling more than 10% in after-hours trading.The selloff comes despite the fact that Arista beat both revenue and earnings targets.The selloff is probably a profit-taking move from long investors who've enjoyed a 150%-plus gain in the past year.While Arista is not substantially cheap, its earnings growth is phenomenal and any pullback should be bought.","I've had my eye on Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET), the cloud-friendly networking hardware company, for a long time now. The company's sheer execution is undeniable, with the company gaining market share over entrenched incumbent Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) with each passing quarter and growing north of 40%, a true feat for a hardware company in an otherwise ""boring"" industry. Meanwhile, the company has been expanding its margins, earnings, and cash flow by envious amounts - leading the stock to go up, up, up over the past year.Hardware has had a bit of a resurgence over the past year, with typically ""boring"" stocks like semiconductors companies enjoying a bit of a renaissance with huge gains in 2017. But surpassing them all is Arista Networks, which twelve months ago was trading just north of $100. Right before Arista's Q4 tumble, shares crossed the psychologically important $300 mark, and even after taking into account its earnings pummeling, the stock is up 156% over the past twelve months.ANET data by YChartsNaturally, it's healthy for any stock that's risen this far, this fast to have a bit of a breather to consolidate gains before resuming a rally - no matter how solid the fundamentals. While fundamentals are the strongest backbone for any investment decision, one can't ignore the fact that traders will take profits on an extremely profitable trade no matter what the underlying results are.For this reason, I believe Arista's ""fall from grace"" is simply cosmetic - peeking under the hood at its results can find no immediate cause from disappointment. The stock will rise again, and though it would be foolish to hope the company can double again in 2018, it's more than likely that Arista will continue to outperform the broader market.Note also that Goldman Sachs' new telecom hardware analyst recently initiated Arista as a Buy with a price target of $320 (21% upside). While Wall Street's ratings and price targets are not a perfectly reliable source of investment due diligence (due to the fact that ratings skew mostly positive, especially from the larger firms with investment banking ties to these clients - irrespective of the so-called ""Chinese Wall""), the fact that Goldman added Arista to its Conviction List is certainly worth mentioning. Such accolades aren't frivolously awarded by a top research house.As previously mentioned, I've been eyeing Arista stock for a while, not daring to jump in because of the consistent gains. I try not to buy on the way up, but in Arista's case, that seems to be the only way the stock can go - and in my mind, it's just as dangerous to ride a huge rally as it is to catch a falling knife. I've been waiting for the pullback that never seemed to come until now, and if the stock falls to the $250-$260 range, I'm snapping up as much as I can.Analysts are pinning an EPS target of $6.27 for the coming year (as reported by Yahoo Finance) - so shares are trading at a forward P/E of ~40x. This is roughly in line with Arista's historical average, and before you jump to the conclusion that 40x is a ridiculous earnings multiple to pay, recall that Arista's earnings growth of ~70% is leagues better than legacy peers. On a PEG basis, Arista carries a PEG ratio of about 0.6x, indicating that the stock is undervalued relative to its earnings potential.Let's dive into Arista's quarter to see if there's anything we have to worry about (right off the bat, let's capstone this by saying there isn't anything of note to be concerned about).See the company's earnings summary below:Figure 1. Arista Networks Q4 resultsSource: Arista investor relationsArista grew revenues by 43% y/y to $467.9 million, a stunning growth rate for a company at its ~$2 billion run rate. One note here: Perhaps it's the deceleration from last quarter's 51% growth that has investors worried, but what are they to expect when the company has grown this large? Deceleration is a fact of life in growing companies, and Arista's revenue growth towers over Cisco's at 3% (and investors had applauded Cisco's results). Arista also beat analysts' expectations of $458.7 million (+40% y/y) by a comfortable margin, so there's not too much to criticize the company for.Arista's CEO Jayshree Ullal (herself a former top executive and protege of Cisco's John Chambers, a drama that has been chronicled in the Wall Street Journal) called FY17 a ""significant year"" for the company in which it gained widespread acceptance of its products, having sold a cumulative 15 million cloud networking ports to a base of 4,900 customers. Ullal also reminded customers that its top customer is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).What other badge of honor can be greater for an enterprise technology company than being a major vendor to the largest enterprise software company in the world? If that's not market acceptance, nothing else is. While Cisco and its contemporaries are racing fast to innovate again in the space after being stale for such a long time, Arista is climbing to the top of the leaderboards in new deployments and customer reviews.While it's true that Arista isn't the only networking hardware company that is compatible with cloud technologies - I'm sure Cisco products work just fine - it has the advantage of having the closest association with the cloud. It's a fan-favorite brand among forward-thinking IT leaders, and as cloud transformation becomes an increasingly important agenda item for top companies, Arista will continue benefiting from more customer conversions.All the while, Arista is taking advantage of its continuous growth to pump out more margins. As a percentage of revenues, all of Arista's operating spend components have scaled down, indicating much higher efficiency. In particular, notice how sales and marketing spend has essentially flatlined from $38.3 million in 4Q16 to $38.8 million in 4Q17, notwithstanding the much higher (43% higher) revenue base.This hints at the fact that Arista is pulling in demand fairly organically. It doesn't have to continually add bodies to a massive, expensive sales force to push its products into the market - it's doing just fine in the growth department without any incremental sales spending.As such, GAAP operating profits in the quarter rose to $139.4 million (a 30% margin) versus $77.5 million (24% margin) in 4Q16. Note that this is now in-line with Cisco's operating margin, despite being a fraction of Cisco's scale (and with Cisco having much more gross margin accretive businesses in its software arm). Arista's profitability, if market trends continue and the IT community continues to embrace its product, will eventually overtake Cisco's - it's only a matter of time.CSCO Operating Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsArista's pro forma EPS of $1.71 grew 64% y/y from $1.04 in 4Q16, and beat analyst consensus of $1.41 by 30c (a 21% beat). It's evidently obvious from the size of Arista's beat this quarter that the earnings reaction is solely profit taking, nothing more.Perhaps guidance was a bit tighter relative to Wall Street consensus than usual, but a beat is still a beat, and if history shows anything, it's that Arista continually outperforms relative to its targets and frequently revises its targets upward. The company called for Q1 revenues of $450-$468 million, the midpoint of which ($459 million) still beat consensus of $457.8 million.With profits growing ~70% y/y, revenues growing above 40% and beating analyst estimates in both the current quarter and for next quarter's guidance, there's no cause for concern in Arista's quarter. Declines in best-of-breed, top-notch growth stocks like Arista tend to be short-lived, so investors are encouraged to take advantage of the current volatility to pick up shares at a slight discount."
4147115,23567,2018-02-15T12:20:44-05:00,"Arista Networks is poised to benefit from the trend of strong spending on public cloud services and infrastructure.According to one market research study, this fairly new company which held its initial public offering in 2014 has taken a 14% share in the high speed data networking market.In its own words, Arista has been outperforming its key competitor, Cisco Systems, in “price, product, roadmap and vision”.Over the last several quarters financial results have consistently come ahead of expectations, and it has provided guidance higher than consensus. The company reports 4Q17 results after the market close on Thursday, February 15.At the current price of $302, the stock is not a bargain relative to our $298 one-year price target, nor is it a bargain on a relative basis. The stock has shown bouts of volatility before, and we suggest investors purchase the shares if it declines 20% lower on any news of slowing revenue growth.","This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing community on January 17, 2018.Arista Networks is poised to benefit from the trend of strong spending on public cloud services and infrastructure, which is forecast by IDC to more than double from an estimated $128b in 2017 to $266b in 2021.Already this cloud networking solutions company has taken more than a 14% share in the high speed data networking market while its largest competitor Cisco Systems share in this market has declined to just over 50%, according to Crehan Research.In its own words, Arista Networks has been “…outperforming Cisco in “price, product, roadmap and vision.” Arista is demonstrating very strong fundamental momentum, with ROIC reaching its highest level in 11 quarters.Over the last several quarters financial results have consistently come ahead of expectations, which has been followed by guidance higher than consensus.Our scenario-based DCF price target of $298 takes into account what we think could be a lower tax rate of 20% going forward versus our previous assumption of 28%. Our Base Case stock price target of $289 (not a typo) assumes free cash flow growth of 18% annually from an estimated $372m in 2017 to $2,1222m in 2027.On January 17 the stock was priced at $265.19 and we suggested that investors keep ANET in mind for a down day. While the stock did reach a brief intraday low of $250.41 on February 6, we do think there could be additional opportunities ahead to get into this fairly volatile stock of a high growth company.At the current price of $302, the stock is not a bargain relative to our $298 one-year price target, nor is it a bargain on a relative basis. In our opinion, the recent stock price increase is related in part to it being made a Goldman Sach's Conviction Buy with a $320 price target on February 7, RBC's price target revision to $310 from $234 on February 13, and a favorable court ruling in favor of Arista in a patent fight with Cisco on February 14 (see TheFly.com for more details).The stock has shown bouts of volatility before, and we suggest investors purchase the shares if it declines 20% lower on any news of slowing revenue growth as it approaches a ""normalized"" sales growth level of 20-30%.Arista Networks is an $22.1b market cap cloud networking company based in Santa Clara, California. It pays no dividend. The company was founded in 2004 by Andreas Bechtolscheim, David Cheriton, and Kenneth Duda and held its initial public offering in June 2014 at a listed price of $43.Current President and CEO Jayshree Ulla joined Arista in 2008 after 15 years at Cisco Systems (CSCO) and has been a key force behind LTM revenue growth that has averaged more than 39% in 2017 and more than 45% since 3Q14.Bechtolsheim is the company’s Chief Development Officer and Chairman. Cheriton left the company following its IPO but remains its second largest shareholder. Duda is Arista’s Chief Technology Officer who along with more than 800 developers is responsible for the development of its “Extensible Operating System” (EOS), a key component of Arista’s value proposition.The company’s primary competitor is Cisco Systems (CSCO). According to the company, Arista has been “…outperforming Cisco in “price, product, roadmap and vision” and, in the words of one customer, Cisco was “on target to become irrelevant” in the majority of data centers.” Arista has been embroiled with Cisco in patent infringement litigation since 2014. This remains a key risk to the company but so far it has managed well on the legal front. According to Gartner’s Magic Quandrant for Data Center Networking, Arista and Cisco are the leaders in the industry.According to the company, EOS “…is the most advanced, resilient, and programmable operating system.” Further, “it combines modern-day software and operating system (O/S) concepts… open platform development, (AND) an un modified Linux kernel…” A Linux kernel has the advantage of being extremely stable and widely accepted across many different systems and environments. The single image architecture of Arista’s EOS reduces the initial hardware qualification time that customers require for initial purchases, and simplifies its interoperability, saving customers time and money.Bechtolscheim and Cheriton are the largest shareholders of Arista Networks, with 17.3% (12.7m shares) and 9.3% (6.8m shares) ownership, respectively. Capital Research and Management Company is owns 9.05% (6.6m shares), The Vanguard Group, Inc. owns 5.4% (3.98m shares), and President and CEO Jayshree Ullal owns 5.2% (3.78m shares). Together insiders own 33.6% of the company. It is unclear how many shares Duda owns.ANET currently trades at 48.2x the consensus 2018 EPS estimate of $6.27, and at a 1.93x PEG multiple to the consensus long-term earnings growth estimate of 25%. In contrast, the 800 pound gorilla Cisco Systems (CSCO) trades at only 16.4x 2018 consensus EPS of $2.52 at a PEG multiple of 2.78x to the consensus long-term growth estimate of 5.9%.Adjusting for its growth prospects, ANET is relatively attractive on a PE-to-Growth basis compared to Cisco. However, the stock is not attractive on a relative basis relative to other stocks in the Technology sector at the current level. As a result, ANET was removed from our Core Long Model portfolio strategy on January 31.At the end of 3Q17 ended September 30, 2017, Arista Networks held $1,343m of cash and short-term investments, and only $38.2m in debt in the form of lease financing obligations. Cash levels have increased every quarter from the $800m reported as of 3Q16, benefitting from increasing cash flow from operations and low capital spending. LTM free cash flow, as defined as CFO less capex, was more than $450m. LTM free cash flow, using our estimated adjusted working capital figures, was $283m. We estimate free cash flow could move to $500m next year assuming no changes in working capital. It has never paid a dividend or repurchased shares.The three cofounders have a storied and very interesting history. All three have ties to Stanford University’s PhD program and Cisco Systems, Inc. Bechtolscheim received a PhD in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering in 1982 before leaving to found Sun Microsystems, which was acquired by Oracle Corporation (ORCL) in 2010. Cheriton has a PhD in Computer Science from University of Waterloo and has worked as a professor at Stanford University since 1981. Duda received his PhD in Computer Science from Stanford in 2001.Bechtolscheim and Cheriton were the famous first investors in Google. The duo were also cofounders of Granite Systems – the gigabit Ethernet company that was acquired by Cisco Systems, Inc. in 1996. They were also the cofounders of Kealia – the high-capacity streaming video server company was sold to Sun Microsystems in 2004. Cheriton is also known as an early stage investor in VMWare, which was acquired by EMC in 2003, which in turn was acquired by Dell Inc. in 2016. Duda’s first PhD project at Stanford University formed the basis for what later became Granite Systems, where he was an early employee.Arista and Cisco have been embroiled in patent infringement litigation since 2014. In a legal update posted on December 6, 2017, Arista stated that “despite Cisco’s distorted messaging, Arista has obtained significant victories” in its litigation. Arista is also being sued by OptumSoft, which asserts ownership of certain components of its EOS network operating system. OptumSoft is owned by Arista cofounder David Cheriton. “In a way, he’s suing himself.” Any litigation setback could have a significant negative impact on the stock price, but so far Arista has managed this risk well, in our opinion. On February 14, the company received good news in the form of an appeals court upholding a prior ruling that invalidated patent infringement claims by the International Trade Commission.According to IDC, worldwide spending on public cloud services and infrastructure is expected to more than double from an estimated $128b in 2017 to $266b in 2021, representing a compound annual growth rate of 21.0%. Driving this growth is demand from professional services, banking, and telecommunications. The United States is expected to represent 60% of worldwide revenues throughout the forecast period.According to Dell’Oro Group Server Research, which Arista Networks cites in its 3Q17 presentation, in 2010 only about 10% of the servers were cloud based. This has moved to about 50% today in 2017, and may grow to more than 60% by 2021. Bandwidth demands of artificial intelligence processes, still in its nascent stage, will also drive the need for larger and more efficient switches. The growth potential of the cloud network industry is clearly very high.As Arista explains in its 10K, “Cloud computing is fundamentally changing the way IT infrastructure is built and how applications are delivered…The aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud can be orders of magnitude higher than typical legacy data center networks. Therefore, cloud cloud environments must be architected and built in a new way. Cloud networks must deliver high capacity, high availability and predictable performance and must be programmable to allow integration with third-party applications for network, management, automation, orchestration and network services.”The company’s primary manufacturing partners include Jabil Circuit (JBL), Sanmina Corporation (SANM) and Foxconn Technology Group (OTC:HNHPF).By the end 2016 Arista Networks had delivered cloud networking solutions to over 4,200 end customers in more than 80 countries, with Microsoft Corp (MSFT) accounting for more than 10% of its revenue over the last three years. For the 9 months ended September 2017, revenue generated in the United States represented 73.8% of the total.As page 5 of its 3Q17 presentation indicates, according to Crehan Research as of 1H17 Arista had captured a 14.2% to 15.0% market share of the high speed data center switching market, as defined by share of dollars or share of ports, respectively. This is up from 3.5% to 4.9% back in 2012. In contrast, Cisco’s share has declined remarkably in recent years, moving from more than 70% in 2012 to just above 50% today.In addition to Cisco, other key competitors in the data center networking market include Broadcom (AVGO), Dell/EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprises (HPE) and Juniper Networks (JNPR).The growing demand for cloud networking solutions is driving acquisitions in the industry. For example, Dell has acquired Force10 and EMC, IBM has acquired Blade Network Technology, Hewlett Packard Enterprises acquired Aruba, Juniper acquired Contrail, Cisco acquired Insieme, and Broadcom just closed its acquisition of Brocade Communications Systems in November 2017.In recent management presentations some questions centered on white box competition – that is, internally developed high speed networking gear, especially from Amazon.com (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL). But according to Charles Yager of Arista investor relations, white box competition has not been material. “If you can buy something on the market that’s superior, there is no real strategic reason to build it [internally].” In addition, he added, customers want diversity of selection they will invest in the market. Kenneth Duda mentioned in December at a conference that internally developed switches would take tremendous development effort and perhaps only save the customer about $500 per switch.4Q17 GuidanceFor 4Q17 the company expects revenue of $450-464m, non-GAAP gross margin of 63-65% and non-GAAP operating margin of 30%-32%, which excludes expected legal expense of $12m associated with OptumSoft and Cisco litigation, stock-based compensation expense, and other non-recurring expenses.By way of contrast, the 3Q17 non-GAAP gross margin was 64.4% and GAAP gross margin was 64.1%. Since 4Q15, the quarterly non-GAAP gross margin has ranged 64.0%-64.6%, and GAAP gross margin has ranged 63.6%-64.2%.Guidance for 2018 has not yet been provided. However, at a December 5, 2017 presentation at a Wells Fargo conference, CFO Ita Brennan emphasized that a forward looking normalized revenue growth rate could range 20-30%, and a sustainable level of operating margin could be in the lower 30% range.By way of contrast, the non-GAAP operating margin reached a two-year high of 38.6% in 3Q17, up from 36.3% in 2Q17 and a low of 27.9% in 2Q16. The GAAP operating margin was 32.2% in 3Q17, up from 28.8% in 2Q17 and was at the lowest level of 19.8% in 2Q16. For the first 9 months of 2017 the GAAP operating margin was 7 percentage points below the non-GAAP margin.The 39% average LTM revenue growth in 2017 benefitted from a faster than expected ramp in 100 Gigabit Ethernet switches, which allowed it to a 40% market share for that size in 2Q17. The long-term earnings growth rate assumed by consensus is currently 26%.According to the CFO, the industry cycle for 100 Gbps switches is still in the early innings. For greenfield projects, 100 Gbps make the most economic sense. Sales of 400 Gbps switches are expected to be a meaningful revenue drive in late 2019 or early 2020, and grow to what appears to be 20% of total revenue by 2021, according to the slide on page 6 of its 3Q17 presentation.Since Arista serves large hyperscale types of customers, it does not need a large marketing and sales force. But an ongoing assumption of 10% for marketing and sales could be reasonable. It also expects R&D expense to move closer to the 20% range over time. Combined with 63-65% gross margin expectations support a long term operating margin assumption of 30-32%.LTM research & development of $314m represented 20.8% of LTM revenue of $1,506m, and was up from the LTM figure of $260m last year which represented 32.2% of LTM revenue of $1,047m. LTM R&D seems to be increasing $10-20m every quarter as its growth rate and percentage of sales declines.By our measure, ROIC has ranged 33.5%-41.2% over the last 12 quarters, with 38.4% in 3Q17 the highest level it has seen in 11 quarters. ROIC is benefitting from the growth of NOPLAT (net operating profit less adjusted taxes) faster than its underlying operating capital. Companies that maintain high ROIC tend to maintain high market multiples.Current consensus 2018 and 2019 revenue estimate are $2,096m and $2,559m, respectively, and consensus EBITDA estimates for the same years are $726m and $884m. When this report was first released in mid January, revenue estimates have been revised higher by approximately 4% over the last 3 months, and approximately 30% from last year. EBITDA estimates had been revised higher by 8-9% over the last three months and more than 50% over the last year. Current consensus as of February 14 is already significantly higher than the figures posted in mid January.If the company continues to beat quarterly estimates (it beat EBITDA consensus by 23% and 37% over the last two quarters, respectively) quarters), it is likely that consensus estimates will continue to be revised higher, supporting a sustainably high ROIC figure, which in turn supports a sustainably high market multiple.Below is a chart from Yahoo! Finance that we appended back on January 12. It illustrates how ANET shares have reacted to key news events over the past year.ANET shares seem sensitive to conflicting reports of market share. For example, on December 1, 2017 IDC indicated that Cisco’s market share in Ethernet switches increased sequentially to 56.7% in 3Q17 and Arista’s share only increased to 5.6%. This is a positive contrast to the market share chart by Crehan Research, which Arista uses in its presentations that shows declining market share for Cisco in the high speed data center switching market and a market share for Arista above 14%. The next trading day, December 4, ANET stock sold off by 8%.The stock price may be further impacted in by litigation events in 2018. On September 25, 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CFAC) denied a request to stay the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) ban on products that infringed on Cisco patents, it did allow Arista to resume importing redesigned products. As the market digested the news, the stock sold off by more than 5%. On January 19, 2018, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) in the ITC 945 modification proceeding will hold a hearing. In February 2018, the CFAC is expected to convene a hearing on Patent and Trial Appeal Board (PTAB) decision appeals in February 2018. More information on Arista’s legal proceedings may be found on its website.Our Base Case forecast for an 18% compound annual growth rate over ten years may seem fairly aggressive. It implies that Arista continues to gain market share but at a slowing rate over time as Cisco Systems and smaller competitors maintain a level of competitiveness.Over the last 12 months Arista has reported revenue growth of nearly 44%, while Cisco has reported a decline of more than 2%, Juniper Networks 5%, F5 Networks nearly 5%, and Palo Alto Networks a high 26%. Arista thinks a normalized revenue growth rate assumption of 20-30% is reasonable, but if we go back perhaps 20 years ago I think we might see similar expectations from the aforementioned companies.On the other hand, Arista has demonstrated its ability to consistently drive meaningful revenue and free cash flow growth. Its Extensible Operating System appears to be a real game changer. Based on my experience in financial technologies, simple and easy to use interfaces can quickly help a company rapidly gain and maintain market share. Therefore, assigning a 60% probability to this Base Case scenario seems reasonable.History has shown that fortunes in the technology space can change quickly. Our Best Case and Worst Case scenarios are not absurd possibilities. If competition falls behind Arista, the best case may occur. If Cisco succeeds with its legal hampering, or some flaw is revealed in Arista’s hardware, it can quickly lose steam. Therefore we are assigning 20% probabilities to each case.In summary, there is a good chance to assume that the fundamental momentum Arista is demonstrating is likely to continue. However at the current price of $265, the stock is not a huge bargain. In our opinion, long-term investors should wait for a better price. Recent history as shown the stock tends to sell off just prior to financial results or on litigation news. Given the stocks recently monthly volatility of about 11%, we suggest keeping ANET in mind for a down day in the market.For our Base Case, our revenue forecasts are more aggressive than consensus. Given a market research report that public spending on cloud infrastructure could grow more than 20% annually for the next five years, and CFO’s comments that normalized revenue growth could range 20-30%, in our opinion it is reasonable to assume at least 25% annual revenue growth through at least 2021. In contrast, consensus only assumes 21% revenue growth in 2019, 19% in 2020, and 5% in 2021. Thereafter, we assume annual revenue growth slows to 20% in 2022, 15% in 2025 and eventually to 8% in 2027. The 10-year compound annual growth rate forecast is a 18.0%.Our GAAP EBIT forecasts are lower than the consensus non-GAAP EBIT forecasts. For 2018 we estimate EBIT of $457m at a 27.8% margin. In contrast, the consensus 2018 EBIT figure is $700m at a 33.5% margin. The disparities between our margins assumptions and consensus lessen over time as we assume litigation expenses subside. By 2022 we assume EBIT margins settle in at 30% while the few consensus estimates available assumes a 32% margin.This scenario is conservative in light of the cash tax rate assumed. According to Capital IQ, cash taxes paid in the year 2016 totaled $39.6m, or 16% of EBIT. However, in our adjusted present value analysis we assume a cash tax rate at 24% of EBIT, moving down to 20% of EBIT for 2018 and subsequent years. Our adjusted present value analysis assumes cash taxes paid is in line with an effective tax rate of 20%. This is a conservative assumption given that cash payments on taxes tend to be significantly lower than the effective tax rate for companies in general.For our Base Case scenario, we forecast free cash flow grows from an estimated $372m in 2017 to $2,122m in 2027 – an compound annual growth rate of 18.0%.For this scenario we assume that revenue grows at 18% annually form 2019-2021, below an IDC cloud networking industry projection for 21% annual growth and the company’s 20-30% long term growth rate assumption. In addition, we assume that EBIT margins decline to 16% in 2018 and never again move above 19.5%. In this scenario, we forecast free cash flow moves from $372m to only $764m by 2027, a compound growth rate of 7.3%. This might be a reasonable scenario to envision if Cisco’s legal attack is successful in limiting some of the types of products that Arista might be able to sell.Arista does not quantify the potential risk associated with its litigation. However, according to Piper Jaffray in November 2017, “…several cases brought against the company by Cisco, which were temporarily resolved by Arista implementing workarounds, are going to be ongoing challenges in 2018.” With regards to Optomsoft, Piper Jaffray expects either Arista to win the case or reach a settlement.In my opinion, a legal setback could have a negative impact on the share price, but not to the extent that it would shut down the company. Arista has done a good job in keeping investors informed with its legal updates and recaps, and has shown it can implement workarounds.Our Best Case forecast assumes at least 30% sales growth through 2021, eventually declining to 13% by 2027, while EBIT margins expand to the level of 37.5%. This is not an inconceivable scenario if we find ourselves in a cloud networking spending spree that is accelerated by bandwidth intensive artificial intelligence applications. In this scenario we assume free cash flow grows from an estimated $372m in 2017 to $3,967m in 2027 at a 26.0% compound annual growth rate.For example, IDC has made a forecast that spending on cognitive and artificial intelligence systems AI infrastructure may grow from $12b in 2017 to $57.6b in 2021, representing a 50.1% CAGR. At the Barclays 2017 Tech Conference in December, CTO Kenneth Duda remarked that artificial intelligence might require 8x as more bandwidth than current cloud networking requirements: “We've heard of boxes where a standard server today with I think a server takes 50-gigabit connection, whereas the AI version of that box would have 8 of those 50-gig connections just to feed the box.”We make no guarantee on the accuracy of the data, estimates, assumptions or forecasts in this report.

4141019,101430,2018-01-29T15:15:34-05:00,Arista Networks has experienced excellent growth.Its EOS product is in demand.Several legal issues could be damaging.The stock has rewarded shareholders over the past 12 months.,"In one of the comments from my last article about Palo Alto Networks (PANW), I was asked about Arista Networks (ANET). Not knowing much about the company I thought I would research the company to see what investment opportunities it may hold. My research indicates that Arista Networks does have some fundamental reasons for investors to be optimistic about the future. Additionally the technical overview of the price action is bullish. Additionally, the article will cover some areas of concern that potential investors should be aware of moving forward. The bottom line is that Arista Networks seems to be fairly valued at this time. Investors looking for a profitable technology company, with a solid balance sheet, that is growing revenues and earnings should consider Arista Networks.Arista Networks is a cloud networking solutions provider. Its market is internet companies, cloud service providers, and data centers. Its bread and butter product is its extensible operating system or EOS. The competitive advantage of its EOS is that it works across multiple hardware platforms because the system was built on an open source model. Consequently, it adapts well to third-party applications that its customers may require. Arista Network also sells Gigabit Ethernet switches and routing platforms.Arista Networks competes with Juniper Networks (JNPR) and Cisco Systems (CSCO). Arista Networks’ market share is climbing compared to Cisco Systems. Arista Networks has about 14% of the high speed data center switching market compared to Cisco’s 53%. While still being far behind Cisco Systems, in 2012 Arista had 3.5% of that market and Cisco had 78%.Fundamentally, revenues are growing. The last six quarters have seen sequential revenue growth with $438M in revenue for the most recent quarter. Operating margin has been on the rise and was 38.6% in the most recent quarter. Arista Networks has been profitable for several years now and posted earnings of $1.62 per share in the most recent quarter. Free cash flow is positive at $454M over the past 12 months. International growth is impressive. Arista Networks received 70% of its revenues from the US in its most recent quarter. And that revenue growth is up 32% compared to same quarter a year ago. However, international growth is more robust. A year ago 80% of their revenues came from the US compared to 70% in the most recent quarter. The international growth is coming mostly from its Asia-Pacific segment which accounted for 11% of its most recent revenues, but that segment grew more than 200% year over year. The Europe, Middle East, and Africa segment accounted for 18% of its most recent revenues and that segment grew more than 100% year over year. It seems there is great potential for Arista Networks internationally in the years to come. I believe that international revenue growth will continue to outpace domestic revenue growth over the next several years as Arista Networks’ addressable market continues to grow.According to its most recent quarterly report, Arista Networks had $1.178B in revenues for the first nine months of its fiscal year. The vast majority of those revenues, 87%, were in product sales versus service sales. Its product sales consists of its EOS and Gigabit Ethernet switches and routing platforms. Generally speaking, service revenues are of a higher margin, so I would like to see a higher percentage of revenues involving service compared to product sales. That would help it grow its operating margins even higher.Investors can take comfort in its solid balance sheet. Its current ratio is a robust 3.67. Its debt to equity percentage is 0.51.Technically, Arista Networks looks bullish. See Chart 1 below.Chart 1 – Arista Networks Daily ChartChart 1 shows that Arista Networks is in a steady upward move going from roughly $93 to its current price of $283 in one year. That is a total gain of over 200% in one year. Not too bad. Both its 50 day moving average and its 200 day moving average are sloping upwards and are in bullish alignment. Bullish alignment means that the shorter term moving average is above the longer term moving average. In the past year pullbacks to the 50 day moving average have been excellent places to go long. That is where I would consider buying the stock.While the growth of Arista Networks has been impressive, the current stock price is considered too high for some analysts. Arista Networks has recently been downgraded by Deutsche Bank. On the other hand, Morgan Stanley recently raised its price target to $310 from $260.There are a few of reasons to be cautious however. First, Arista Networks has been on a great run rising in price over 200% in the past year. While Morgan Stanley does have a price target of $310, Morningstar considers Arista Networks to be overvalued and has a fair value estimate of $175. Arista Network does have growing revenues and earnings but it could be fair to say that all of that growth and near term growth could already be reflected in today’s stock price. That would make the stock fairly valued for the near term. Secondly, Cisco Systems is the major competitor to Arista Networks. Cisco Systems has resources and clout in this space and won’t just continue to willingly give up market share. Of course other competitors also want a larger percentage of the market. While Arista Networks has many clients in the cloud space, it is estimated that 10% of the Arista Network’s revenues come from Microsoft (MSFT). That would give Microsoft quite a bit leverage in terms of pricing power over Arista Networks. Lastly, Arista Networks is involved with several pending legal issues; several with Cisco Systems concerning patent and copyright infringement. If these cases go against Arista Networks, shareholders could see a large decline in the stock price.In conclusion, Arista Networks is a growing, profitable player in the cloud networking space. It has an open source EOS and an assortment of Gigabit Ethernet switches and routing platforms that are in demand both domestically and internationally. The international growth is robust and it has the potential to propel the stock higher. The company has a solid balance sheet and has very good margins. Those margins can even improve when Arista Networks revenue mix moves more towards service contracts versus hardware sales. Higher margins would improve earnings. On a technical basis the stock is bullish, recently making an all-time high. As for risk, potential investors should be aware that the company’s stock price could be considered stretched at today’s price. Additionally, the company operates in a competitive marketplace against Cisco Systems which has enormous resources at its disposal. As mentioned above there are several legal actions pending against Arista Networks and if those legal actions go against Arista Networks, then the share price would most likely decline. Investors today would be buying a company that is fairly valued in today’s market and that stock should move higher over time as Arista Networks continues to execute. More cautious investors like myself can wait for a pullback to its 50 day moving average, which has proven to be an excellent entry point in the past."
4129336,21815,2017-12-04T04:34:59-05:00,"The company has several tailwinds, most notably a growing market, a growing market share and plenty of opportunities to increase its TAM in other verticals and markets.However, further operational leverage and valuation multiple extension doesn't seem likely, although the company could start buying back shares.Most importantly, Arista's competitive advantage seems defensible, at least for the foreseeable future.","Yeah, that chart:For people like us, who have been lusting about this for a while, the chart of Arista Networks (ANET) is a beauty to behold. For those who were willing to jump in, only to be stopped by pesky thoughts that most of the money might already have been made, we have some good news.First, the good news is in the chart itself. The relentless march upwards seems to have been stalled, and indeed reversed a bit. There has been something of a rotation out of tech, the market's prime mover this year, and that opens an opportunity for investors who missed the boat.The second issue is whether there is anything fundamental going on that might warrant the shares falling back. The short answer is no, but below, we'll provide a longer answer.The third issue investors might have is one of valuation, or in this case, a possible overvaluation. We will deal with that issue as well.In essence, this is a very simple story. Arista provides cloud networking solutions especially designed for datacenters like for instance routers that can connect to thousands of servers to run distributed applications. This is a market that is still growing at lightning speed, from IDC:And this isn't even the most optimistic forecast. Apart from that, there are several forces that leverage this market growth for Arista.Growth leverage force no.1: Not only is the market that Arista serves growing very fast, Arista's revenue itself is growing faster still, as it is taking market share.And the reason it is winning market share is a simple one, it is a technological leader that has designed solutions for today's world of distributed cloud applications that scale, is more secure and more robust. From their Q3 slides:And the company isn't shy to point out the difference in fortunes with its biggest competitor, Cisco Networks (CSCO):Readers might want to look at the whole deck.Growth leverage no.2: The company has plenty of runway left, both in new verticals, internationally and additional markets and products.International revenue in Q3 was 29% of revenue, up from 25% in Q2. This is growing even considerably faster than overall revenue.The company has also moved beyond switches to cloud companies and is addressing other verticals like tier 1 and 2 service providers, cloud specialty providers and high-tech enterprises and financials.And look for instance how they're addressing additional segments, from the Q3CC:And since their software defined hardware is blurring the line between switches and routers, it is also moving in the latter market, with disruptively priced products (see slide above).Growth leverage no.3: The growth allows the company to attain operational leverage:The non-GAAP figures are considerably better, no surprise there:However, take notice that this operational leverage in the recent quarters was due to unprecedented revenue growth and this may not persist. In fact, during the Q3CC, management warned both for the long term and Q4 (Q3CC):To give you some reference, in Q2 these figures were:So both are considerably below their long-term target range. However, management also said this during the Q3CC:So for the time being, this higher margin phase looks sustainable.Growth leverage no.4: There are some forces working against the leverage described above, for instance this:This is the result of stock-based compensation, which ran at $20M or 4.5% of revenues ($438M) in Q3.However, we have a feeling that even this might soon slow down, or even reverse; look at the following figure:That is a steep increase in free cash flow, produced by operations. We've looked in filings and several earnings transcripts, but nothing on share buybacks. But if cash generation increases at this pace, it looks like a distinct possibility in the near future.With stock-based compensation running at 4%-5%% of revenue, we don't see buybacks as a way to halting the increase in share count (let alone reversing it) but slowing the growth is eminently feasible.The company already had $1.3B in cash, cash equivalent and investments in the books at the end of Q3, with negligible debt.Now to the third concern investors who missed the boat might have (and some who are in the boat but wondering whether to get out). Are these shares expensive?No, the shares are not cheap. But if anyone would have thought they were after a consistent performance like what we described above, they haven't been following the markets the last couple of years.Almost 12 times sales is really quite steep, even if sales are expanding at a blistering 35%-50% a year pace. The earnings multiple has moved up only gradually, a reflection of even steeper earnings growth.And one has to take on board that these are GAAP figures that are backward looking.This year analysts expect an EPS of $5.30, rising to $6.14 in 2018, which still gives a substantial multiple of 37.Perhaps the most important question is also the hardest to answer. How sustainable is Arista's competitive advantage? If it is sustainable, and especially if the company can continue to gain market share, these shares are still a good buy even at these fairly elevated levels, given the continued growth in the market.But if competition is a growing threat, Arista might not make significant further inroads in the market, and the threat could also very well impact margins.One thing one has to understand is that Arista's competitive advantage is not just based on better and/or cheaper gear. What Arista is offering is a whole new approach and architecture, and one that is considerably better than the old approaches and architecture.Much of it is based on software, its EOS operating system, which allows its clients to use cheaper off the shelf components. To counteract the big datacenter customers designing their own switches, Arista came up with its containerized version of EOS, which can run on these, from the PR:Even sceptics like James Faucette from Morgan Stanley are coming around, from Barron's:This is almost funny as the company already blew past that 32% operating margin (achieving 38.6%) and the $415M revenues and $1.15 EPS in Q3 (with Q3 results coming in at $437.6M and $1.62 EPS).The essence of what Faucette claims is that software is allowing the company a time to market advantage, allowing its customers to make easier technology generation transitions, so Arista can increase its market share with each one.For instance, Arista had a mid-teen market share in 40G sales, but this moved up to 26% for 100G sales, and with the move toward 400G, it will likely again show an increased share.Even skeptics are coming around, Arista's competitive advantage is sustainable and it will allow them to make further inroads in the markets, which are themselves growing rapidly.International sales and other verticals and adjacent markets still offer additional leverage.However, two other growth leverage forces are likely to have played out. It is unlikely that the company is able to extend even more operational leverage. In fact, the company is warning that the 38% operating margin in Q3 is likely to fall back.We also see little room for further valuation multiple expansion, at least not in a material way. What might very well happen in the future is that the company will use its growing cash flow generation to start buying back its own shares, which could slow the rise in share count.We think that to start accumulating at this pull-back in the shares is likely to still produce significant returns in the medium term."
4121025,103480,2017-11-06T08:00:00-05:00,"Arista Networks' performance keeps defying standard expectations, with the company posting 51% revenue growth and doubling its profits in its Q3 release.Results handily beat Wall Street consensus and sent shares flying above $200, touching all-time highs.With Arista positioned to continue taking share from Cisco and other legacy network infrastructure providers, its vertical stock climb isn't likely to abate.Customer feedback on the superior quality of Arista's product continue to cement its wide moat in the industry.","With Arista Networks (ANET), you really couldn't have expected anything other than a full-on earnings success. Investors who have been watching Arista for a while have noticed that it never seems to shy away from smashing consensus expectations and setting a higher bar for itself.Arista - the network hardware company that was designed with modern cloud architecture in mind - continues to deliver innovative data center solutions that put legacy vendors to shame. As I wrote in a prior deep-dive profile, Arista is led by a former Cisco (CSCO) executive and is now one of the network giant's biggest threats to incumbency.Hardware companies are rarely exciting in 2017. After all, the thinking these days is that it's not about the devices themselves, but what you can do with them. For this reason, software companies eat up the majority of the limelight and achieve soaring valuations. Arista, however, breaks this trend - it's probably the only company that sells seemingly standard datacenter equipment that is experiencing startup-like growth and has become a darling of Wall Street.Yet Arista's rise is supported by more than just hype. As Q3 has shown, Arista's solid fundamental profile and seemingly limitless growth trajectory keep positioning the company for further stock appreciation. As shown in the chart below, Arista has already returned >100% for lucky investors this year, including a 10% kick post-earnings.This rise, however, is well supported by earnings growth: year to date, the company's net income has grown more than double as well, from $125.4 million in the year-ago period to $319.4 million in the nine months year to date. This translates into GAAP EPS of $1.71 in the prior year-to-date and $4.06 in the current year - on track to more than double EPS this year.With profit growth driven by both revenue growth as well as margin expansion, Arista remains a solid long. It's true that at a consensus EPS of $4.71 for this fiscal year, Arista trades at a ~45x P/E ratio - but when considering ~100% earnings growth, its PEG ratio of ~0.5x actually screams value. While it's natural to not want to chase shares as they continue climbing higher, it's hard to imagine that Arista will be anything other than a Wall Street favorite for quite some time.Arista continued its trend of tremendous top line growth in Q3, with revenues of $437.6 million growing 50.8% y/y. Analysts had only expected $418.5 million in revenue, or 44.2% growth, making this quarter a 6-point top line beat for the company.Figure 1. Arista revenueAnother impressive fact to note is that Arista showed no top line deceleration from Q2, which was itself an acceleration from Q1. Arista's revenues grew 38.5% in Q1, 50.8% in Q2, and 50.8% again in Q3.Generally, at this juncture in a high-tech company's life, investors begin to worry about deceleration and how much longer growth can be sustained as a company begins to scale. Indeed, Arista is expected to scale to ~$1.5 billion in revenues for FY17, which makes it a fairly sizable company - companies at this scale typically aren't growing at 50% anymore. Yet Arista's ability to sustain its 50.8% growth rate is a hugely positive indicator of its traction in the market.The company's Q4 guidance range of $450-$464 million, at the midpoint of $457.0 million, represents 39.3% y/y growth over 4Q16's revenue of $328.0 million. This would imply Arista's first quarter of deceleration would happen in Q4 this year, but given Arista's own tendency to outdo its own expectations (as well as Wall Street's, which largely bases its consensus off of Arista's guidance), we could see plenty of upside in Q4.After all, Arista had guided to $405-$420 million of revenue for Q3, and its actual performance clocked in at $437.6 million - or 4% higher than the high end of its guidance. If Arista can again achieve 4% upside to its high end of Q4 guidance at $464 million, it would generate $482.6 million of revenue - or 47% growth.Given Arista's track record, ending up on the higher than the high end of guidance is the more likely scenario - especially as Q4 is typically a big quarter for enterprise IT spend.Arista's earnings and margin profile didn't disappoint either. Gross margins stayed constant y/y (but still high, for a hardware company) at 64%. Operating margin, however, made a huge leap forward - the company generated $140.8 million of operating profit on $437.6 million of revenues, indicating a 32% operating margin versus $63.0 million of operating profit on $290.3 million in revenues in 3Q16, indicating a historical 22% operating margin.Ten-point leaps in operating margin are extremely rare - especially in a company that's simultaneously growing the top line at 50%.Arista generated GAAP net income of $133.7 million, or $1.68 per share. This is up from $51.3 million and $0.69 per share, respectively, up 160% and 143%, respectively.Analysts, who base their earnings estimates off of Arista's pro forma numbers, had expected $1.19 in PF EPS; Arista achieved $1.62.No investor would rightfully classify Arista as a growth stock, and when looking at absolute numbers, Arista does look expensive:It's important to take into account Arista's superior growth, however. Arista has consistently achieved superior top and bottom line growth relative to its closest peers in the networking industry, a point made abundantly clear by this quarter's earnings and in the charts below. Arista is a market share story - it makes sense that its stock should continue to climb while others falter, as it's grabbing business from legacy hardware providers.Given Arista's rapid growth relative to its flat-lined peers, I again reiterate that a 22.5x forward P/E multiple on estimated FY18 EPS of $9-10 gives us a fairly comfortable price target of $225 (on the high end) for Arista, a scenario made even more likely with this quarter's massive beat. >100% earnings growth is certainly no easy feat, and is rightfully awarded a huge premium. At today's P/E of ~45x, and taking into account Arista's 137% year-to-date GAAP diluted EPS growth, the company's PEG ratio is approximately 0.33x. From this perspective, Arista looks like a downright steal.Momentum like Arista's is hard to break. The company's product innovation and popularity among its installed base have contributed to its phenomenal success within its relatively short lifespan in the networking industry.Q3 showed investors that Arista's growth isn't plateauing, and that the seemingly one-time acceleration in Q2 wasn't just a fluke - Arista's growth trajectory is long and sustained. The company has done something incredible in turning a staid, boring industry on its head and giving long-reigning Cisco a run for its money. Appropriately, Wall Street is lavishing Arista with its praises, and the beat-and-raise quarter followed by a massive stock jump is a pattern that's likely to repeat over the next year for Arista.Until Arista hits the ~$250 range, its stock isn't really expensive; $225 is almost a certain eventuality within the next year. Investors would be wise to tag along for the ride."

Actually, that’s an understatement, the stock has gained over 145% in the last year alone, mostly powered by rock-solid financial performance and attractive business prospects over the middle term.The company delivers software-driven cloud networking solutions for large datacenter and cloud computing companies. Arista Networks offers a wide variety of Gigabit Ethernet switches that significantly improve the price and performance equation of datacenter networks.According to management, the data center switching market is projected to grow to $13 billion in 2021, and Arista Networks is currently the number two player in terms of size and the fastest growing supplier of products to this market. The company has also entered the routing market with its R-Series platform, which could be an additional multi-billion dollar opportunity in the years ahead.Arista Networks competes against bigger companies with deeper pockets such as Cisco (CSCO), and this is an important risk factor to consider. However, Arista Networks is outgrowing Cisco and stealing market share from its larger rival, this speaks volumes about Arista’s technological prowess and its ability to successfully compete against all kinds of players.Arista is a relatively young company, and it has produced explosive financial performance over time. In 2012 the company made $140 million in revenue, fast forward five years, and Arista Networks is producing $1.5 billion in sales on a trailing 12 months basis. The increase in earnings has been downright exponential over time, earnings per share grew from $0.73 in 2013 to $4.84 per share in the last twelve months.ANET data by YChartsThe most recent earnings report from Arista Networks confirms that the business is booming. Total revenue during the third quarter of 2017 amounted to $437.6 million, an increase of 50.8% from the third quarter of 2016. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $1.62 during the third quarter of 2017 versus a much smaller 0.83 in the same quarter last year.The company is rapidly acquiring new customers, especially in international markets. From Arista’s most recent earnings conference call:The company is consistently delivering above expectations. The chart below shows earnings expectations, the actual reported number and the earnings surprise, both in absolute numbers and percentage terms over the past four quarters. Not only is the company consistently reporting above expectations, Arista is doing better than expected and by a wide margin.On the back of vigorous performance from the company and optimistic comments from management, Wall Street analysts have substantially increased their earnings estimates for Arista Networks in the past several months. The chart below shows how earnings forecasts and the stock price are clearly moving in the right direction.ANET data by YChartsA position in Arista Networks is not for the faint of heart. The company is relatively small in comparison to the competition, and it operates in a particularly dynamic and always changing industry. Besides, growth expectations for the company are quite aggressive, and rising bar is increasingly hard to beat.That acknowledged, Arista operates in a massively big market with plenty of room for growth, the company is proving to investors that it has what it takes to capitalize on such opportunities, and financial performance doesn’t leave much to be desired. Momentum is a powerful return driver for stocks, and Arista Networks is offering abundant momentum."

With a short history as a public company, ANET started trading on NYSE just about three years ago, on March 31, 2014. Since then the company offered an amazing financial result backed by a solid value proposition, a fascinating product line and even better growth opportunity for near future and long term.Arista Networks is focused on a single line of business and to be exact a very narrow type of product - ultra-high-speed Ethernet switches used in data centers providing cloud networking services.So, how can a small company with such a short lifetime compete with giants like Cisco (CSCO), EMC or Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE)?Probably the most distinguishing aspect of this company is its leadership team. Two founders, Andy Bechtolsheim and David Cheriton, founded Arista Networks in 2004.(Andy Bechtolsheim, Source: Arista Networks website)Andy is a co-founder of Sun Microsystems. Sun Microsystems was a well-established IT company focused on networking products which had been acquired by Oracle in 2010.

4111130,103480,2017-10-02T13:45:34-04:00,"Arista's 50% y/y revenue growth eclipses all other companies in the datacenter networking industry, highlighting its innovative vision and technology leadership versus legacy incumbent Cisco.Its networking and switch products are the first in the industry to be designed with cloud computing in mind.Arista now commands a 10% market share and has been named one of two Leaders in the space by Gartner, the other being Cisco (which is 10x larger by capitalization).Though shares have rallied this year, Arista's valuation is supported by superior earnings growth. In the first half of 2017, Arista's earnings grew nearly 2.5x over 1H16.","There's a reason Arista Networks' (NASDAQ: ANET) stock has doubled this year: the company's assault on the datacenter networking industry continues at a rapid pace. Until Arista started to steal more of the spotlight (it went public in 2014 at $43/share), the networking industry was stale and steady, churning out predictable, barely-refreshed products like routers and network switches. Cisco (NYSE: CSCO), the decades-long king of the industry, commanded the lion's share of profits without moving the needle too much on innovation.I first became interested in Arista when the Wall Street Journal released a story covering the rivalry between Cisco Chairman John Chambers and Arista CEO Jayshree Ullal. Ullal was a former protege of Chambers' at Cisco, overseeing major business units before being tapped in 2008 to lead Arista. At the time Cisco wasn't worried about its upstart rival - it had some $40 billion in sales and its brand was as synonymous with the networking industry as McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) was to fast food. Arista was then just a four-year-old startup, founded exactly thirty years after Cisco.And then suddenly, everything changed. The world's attention turned to cloud computing, with IT leaders praising the architecture of distributed applications and on-demand availability of everything. Concurrently with this tectonic shift in the computing landscape, Arista was promoting networking products that had been designed with the cloud in mind - routers that connected thousands of servers that hosted distributed applications, not just routers that handled point-to-point connections.Cisco started paying attention. Wall Street started paying attention. Recently, Morgan Stanley upgraded Arista from Neutral to Buy, reversing its prior position as the analyst predicted Arista would own 19% of the market by 2020 (up from 9.8% as estimated by Gartner today). Morgan Stanley's price target of $215 represents a ~15% premium to today's levels.Despite the breathtaking leap in Arista shares this year, I believe the stock still has a long runway ahead. Unlike many other growth names in technology, Arista is generating profits and growing them at astronomical rates. With the market marching toward record highs, technology and growth investors will likely rotate toward growth names that also have valuation support in earnings.ANET data by YChartsArista isn't a cheap stock to own, but its continued assertion into the networking industry is virtually guaranteed. It is a growth stock, after all, and investors who smartly build a position now are looking at years of double-digit returns despite fluctuations in the broader NASDAQ.As Arista describes in its 10-K, cloud computing has fundamentally changed how IT infrastructures need to be architected to handle the new flow of server traffic. In the pre-cloud era, specific applications were hosted by specific server clusters. Consider a standard on-premise financial reporting software application provided by SAP (NYSE: SAP), used by the accounting department of a corporation to manage the monthly close process.A typical legacy router would connect the application's dedicated server to the work terminals of the users who needed it - in this example, the accounting department. This is what Arista calls a ""north-south"" connection - a single link between two points, the application's dedicated server and the application's dedicated users.Today's modern cloud applications, however, are not hosted in single, dedicated servers. They might not even be hosted on a company's premises - they could be hosted in some faraway AWS datacenter that the IT department has never seen. Cloud applications run on distributed servers - meaning they possibly reside on thousands of servers, and can be accessed by anyone with an Internet-enabled device and the appropriate authentications.North-south connections don't work in this case. Arista's products, however, enable what it calls ""east-west"" connections, enabling the interlinking of thousands of server nodes and thousands of end-user access points.Arista calls this proprietary infrastructure a ""leaf-spine"" network design. This architecture can support hundreds of thousands of server connections, can scale up according to organizational needs, provides superior security, and has failover capabilities - because connections exist across thousands of servers in the system, the failure of one node in the system (hardware failures are almost guaranteed occurrences) doesn't threaten the uptime of the entire network.See below a comparison of Arista's architecture (two right columns) versus the legacy ""north-south"" approach in the left column:Figure 1. Arista leaf-spine architectureIn Gartner's July 2017 edition of its Magic Quadrant for Data Center Networking, it named Arista one of two Leaders, the other being Cisco. Arista's positioning as a Leader is impressive given Cisco has 10x the market capitalization and nearly 50x the revenue base of Arista across a variety of products, extending even beyond networking.In the quadrant, Gartner also awarded Arista a higher ranking in its technology vision than Cisco, but put Cisco further up on the ""ability to execute"" scale - due to its vastly larger resources than Arista. Gartner estimates Arista's market share in 2016 at 9.8%.Look no further than Arista's most recent quarter to validate the fruits of its technology leadership. In Q2, Arista posted $405 million in revenue, 20% q/q and 50% y/y. Q2's growth was a remarkable acceleration over Q1, with Q1 revenues growing only 39% y/y.Revenues for 1H17 grew an impressive 45%. See its results below:Figure 2. Arista Q2 top-line resultsAlso impressive was the fact that Arista had only guided to $354-$364 million in Q2 revenues (+34% y/y at the midpoint) and ended up outperforming by a wide margin. Analysts had only expected $361 million in revenues - so it's a small wonder that Wall Street research analysts like Morgan Stanley are revising their models and price targets upward.On the guidance perspective, Arista forecasted $405-$420 million in Q3 revenues. Even though this greatly exceeds analysts' Q3 consensus of $378 million, it implies nearly flat q/q revenue growth - relative to the 20% lift seen in Q2. Given Arista's masterful execution thus far, I'm more inclined to believe that growth will continue to outpace expectations in Q3, rather than pass off Q2's massive beat as a one-time event.Earnings, needless to say, have grown at a much faster clip than revenues, as the company captures greater operating leverage over a much larger revenue base. The company generated $185.6 million in net income in 1H17, up from only $74 million in 1H16. This translates to EPS of $2.59 in the first six months of the year, up 140% over EPS of $1.10 in 1H16.According to Yahoo Finance, analysts expect EPS of $5.06 in FY17 and $6.50 in FY18. I believe there's a large degree of conservatism in analysts' models for FY18 - EPS of $6.50 represents merely 28% y/y growth over FY17, which is a far cry from FY17's results to date. If Arista can keep doubling its earnings growth over the next few quarters, the stock isn't too expensive at all. Indeed, Arista hasAlso unique the fact that Arista has no debt on its balance sheet, and also has $1.1 billion in cash and marketable securities. Most technology hardware companies lean heavily on debt financing (Cisco has $33.7 billion of debt on its balance sheet, or a leverage ratio of approximately 2.4x debt/EBITDA). Arista's large net cash position actually makes its enterprise value cheaper than its current market cap of $13 billion, and the clean balance sheet also gives it future flexibility for debt financing if it chooses to pursue further growth opportunities (more on that shortly).Trading at approximately 45.8x TTM P/E (calculated from trailing twelve months' EPS of $4.15), Arista certainly doesn't look like a cheap stock without factoring in earnings growth.But with consensus EPS of $5.06 and $6.50 in FY17 and FY18, respectively, Arista is trading at only 37.5x FY17 earnings and 29.2x FY18 earnings. Also consider the high possibility of Arista achieving much higher than $6.50 EPS in FY18 - if its execution in 2018 mirrors that in 2017, Arista might see a near-doubling of EPS in FY18 to $9-$10 (implying a forward PE of only ~20x FY18 earnings).The charts below illustrates exactly why investors are willing to pay a steep premium for Arista: on both the earnings and revenue front, Arista (blue line) completely decimates its nearest peers in the networking industry, with Cisco and Brocade (NASDAQ: BRCD) actually showing y/y declines in both the top and bottom lines.ANET Normalized Basic EPS (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsANET Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsWith Arista's superior growth profile, I would be comfortable setting a price target at $225 for the stock - or 22.5x estimated FY18 EPS of $10.What drivers are going to support Arista's continued earnings growth? In addition to strengthening sales to its current installed base, Arista has access to growth opportunities in two primary areas:The first is international expansion. Now, almost every company can claim expected growth internationally, but with Arista this growth avenue is even more pertinent because the networking industry is more localized than other sectors. IT buyers prefer to purchase equipment from companies with a large presence in their region, because the need for customer service and support is almost ubiquitous. Because Arista is still a relatively smaller presence in EMEA and APAC, it has not yet fully cracked the market.Arista generated 77.5% of FY16 revenues in the U.S. With its presence still overshadowed by legacy players in Europe and Asia, it has a long runway for growth in those markets. Once the Arista brand becomes more firmly implanted and the company sets up a more robust sales and support organization in those regions, IT buyers will be more willing to switch to purchasing Arista products.Another area for growth is via product line extensions. Currently Arista focuses on datacenter networking, with no products addressing the markets for campus networking and wide-area networking (WAN). The cloud-based approach to IT networking is not just limited to datacenters, and Arista can further accelerate its growth by developing cloud-first products for those use cases as well.With the financial flexibility afforded by its $1.1 billion of cash and no debt, Arista certainly has the means to pursue capital-intensive growth strategies.Stay long on this fantastic growth name and don't be intimidated by the near-vertical ascension of its stock price. This is a company whose technology leadership has giant incumbents fighting to defend their turf. Prior to Arista arriving on the scene, nobody would have thought of the networking industry as a growth arena - but now, with Arista expanding aggressively,"

Here is the stock chart:Arista Networks was added to Top Picks on 22-Nov-16 for $94.50.Quickly, the story behind Arista:Why the CloudOf all the revolutionary trends that are coming our way that we look to, from artificial intelligence, machine learning, genomics, self-driving cars, the Internet of Things (IoT), streaming video on Demand (SVOD), and the rest - the enterprise cloud realm may be the largest of them all.The cloud is, generally speaking, just a cluster of computers and hardware sharing resources to power the Internet, apps, video, IoT and anything else that is connected and has data. I always search for the best way to demonstrate the explosion that is coming in data.I like charts, and I like stats, but it's hard to really convey the astounding growth in data we are about to see. So here's a chart, and then I'll try my best with a specific example:So that's just mobile and it shows the growth in traffic increasing 1,000% in six years. But here's how that translates into data.In 2012 the Library of Congress estimated that all printed, audio, and video material came in at 3 to 20 petabytes. That means that one exabyte could hold a hundred thousand times the printed, audio and video material, or 500 to 3000 times all content of the Library of Congress.By 2021, global traffic alone will generate 49 exabytes per month.That means that data that is the size of 14,700,000% of all the printed, audio and video material of all time will be generated in a month on just mobile devices. Yeah, that's just mobile and every month. And if we take that even further out, to say, 2025, the numbers reach billions of percent a day.The cloud is going to be a huge deal. Here is a chart of that growth:Why Arista Networks The old world where Cisco Systems built a wonderful empire was based on dedicated network systems - a fancy way of saying that Cisco provided all of the hardware and guts to the switches (and routers). But, Cisco has secularly lost market share in switching, today at 53%, versus 70% in 2010. The lost business has gone mainly in the Data Center switching side, where Arista Networks and do-it-yourself (DIY) white-label solutions have become more prevalent.First, the image we always reference of market share trends:Source: AristaBut the trend - that is, moving to white-label solutions - has been underreported by the media. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has created a gigantic cloud and has focused on something called the Open Compute Project. Microsoft and Google have joined the Project. These companies are looking to free themselves from the shackles and expenses of the ""old way.""Arista Networks is aware of the change; in fact, it has been a part of the change, even the catalyst to the change. Arista's strategy, which has been to take a more software-centric approach of networking called SDN, is working. The company's hardware is strong, it has exposure to the cloud platforms and generally appears to be more agile than Cisco.But now, onto a critical update that pushed the stock price to fresh all-time highs on Friday.History of a Legal FightArista and Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) have been embroiled in one of the most contentious intellectual property battles technology has ever seen. While Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo have gotten the juicy headlines, the guts of the cloud world have had their own heavyweight bout.Here's a quick primer before we get to the update. The primary source for much of this material can be found on Arista's site which also links out to relevant legalese.Cisco has filed a lawsuit claiming that Arista has infringed upon its patents and the accusation is a big one. Arista was founded by ex-Cisco employees and the lawsuit claims that essentially all of Arista's success is a patent rip-off. To restate clearly, this is not a small off-on-the-side lawsuit, this is a lawsuit of enormous proportions with respect to the accusations.In fact, for a moment, the International Trade Commission placed an import ban and cease and desist order covering all Arista products. The ITC determined that Arista wilfully and intentionally infringed three Cisco patents covering core Cisco-proprietary network functionality.For Arista's customers and partners, the cease and desist order blocks the marketing, sale or distribution of all inventory of imported infringing products. It also means that Arista is unable to honor the service and warranty contracts for any infringing products sold after the ITC's ruling date (of) June 23.For Arista's suppliers, the ITC orders mean that Arista cannot import parts or components to manufacture infringing products in the United States.Now, all that ended recently when Arista Networks got a vote of approval from U.S. customs authorities with the newest versions of its products.But, the risk isn't gone. While some will say Cisco is throwing up a last ditch effort to protect its technology which, as we saw in the chart at the top, is in full blown competitive free fall, others will say this is a legitimate case of intellectual property theft.Legal UpdateIt appears that Arista has yet again won the battle of old versus new. Here it is, straight from one of our favorite all-time journalists, Barron's Tiernan Ray:The Patent board wrote:We'll save the technical details and get to the conclusion, which is that, for now, the patent fight is finally over and Arista will not have to turn on its manufacturing plant in the United States, which would have taken a bite out of gross margins.We do note that it is quite possible that Cisco is not done yet, the company has been relentless in trying to defend itself and has used aggravated language declaring that Arista has blatantly infringed on its copyrighted command-line interface terms, noting direct copy-and-paste scenarios in which the firm neglected to fix Cisco's typos.Of course, Arista has argued that the commands aren't protected by copyright, suggesting Cisco is simply trying to thwart growth of the upcoming firm. It looks like Arista was right.What NowWe like Arista long-term, but the price is high and we don't believe any extra emphasis should be given to the company just because of this ruling. As always, in this toppy market we do see the potential for a correction, but when we look out 3-7 years, we see Arista continuing to take down Cisco's moat and growing rapidly into the cloud.The author has no position in Arista Networks at the time of this writing.Thanks for reading, friends.Legal The information contained on this site is provided for general informational purposes, as a convenience to the readers.

4002267,98236,2016-08-25T22:53:48-04:00,"The company's latest quarter was another noticeable beat, but guidance and expectations remain muted.The company appears to have developed a set of comprehensive alternatives to deal with unfavorable rulings with regards to Cisco's multiple infringement suits, but observers remain skeptical.Demand for the company's product has, in some cases, grown faster than potential supply leading to an underappreciated ""backlog"" of unfulfilled orders.The company appears to continue to enjoy market share gains due both to its technology and the concentration of its customers in the fastest growing segments of the networking space.While not anything like a bargain on the valuation front, this company has a far less ebullient set of valuation metrics when compared to many other hyper-growth companies.","Arista - In this corner, the market share champ and the loser at the ITCAbout 3 weeks ago, Arista (NYSE:ANET) reported the results for its second quarter. The results were yet another meaningful beat, including a revenue beat and the shares responded more or less as might have been anticipated and recently made a new high. I had originally written on the company back in March when the shares were at $62. So, over the last 5 months, the shares have appreciated by 24% while the IGV is up by 12%. Decent positive alpha. Over the course of the months since I published my initial article, the company has beaten consensus earnings expectations by reasonable amounts twice - it really has beaten earnings expectations for many quarters now. But earnings expectations haven't budged in the past several months, and there have been a couple of downgrades. And of course the other day, the International Trade Commission issued what is its seemingly the last judgement against this company and in favor of Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) in that company's on-going dispute alleged infringement of one or more Cisco patents.The purpose of this article is to lay out an updated positive case for the shares. Most simply put, the company continues to gain share because of product functionality issues that deliver more for the same cost based on the company's EOS operating system. EOS is the secret sauce Arista has, and at the moment, it remains without a peer. It allows the company to use merchant silicon as part of its manufacturing process, and that has given it a significant amount of flexibility in providing high performance products to the market at more than competitive prices. Because of the company's technology, it has been able to achieve faster than the market as a whole because its customers are in the hottest networking growth space. And while the issues in terms of infringement are non-trivial, they are unlikely to have more a glancing impact on the company financials and will sooner than later be in the rear-view mirror so to speak. I do not propose to consider the issue of bare metal switches versus branded products in this article, although it is a factor to consider for investors at some point.Users clearly do not seem perturbed by the dispute; revenues during the quarter increased by 37% year on year and 11% sequentially, and at this point, the company's revenue run rate has surpassed $1 billion. Just as a comparison point of interest, Cisco had total switching revenues in the quarter it reported last week of $3.8 billion, up 2% for the quarter and full-year switching revenues of $14.7 billion, flat with the switching revenues of the prior fiscal year.As I will review below, Arista compared to many hyper-growth companies is anything but expensive. Based on full-year consensus expectations, its shares have an EV/S of 4.2X and a P/E of 26X. Given that expected top-line growth is forecast to be 32% this year, these are reasonable numbers, particularly in the context of overall valuations in this market.But forecast growth for both revenues and earnings is expected to slow significantly next year and call for a far deeper dive than just talking about another strong quarter for the company. Are the workarounds required to comply with the ITC decree going to hurt gross margins? Is there something about the space or competition from Cisco that might cause growth to compress going forward? Company guidance is for 5% sequential growth in this quarter which is far less than the sequential growth that was achieved in 2015 during this period when sales rose by 11% sequentially.This is tech land and with that territory comes jargon that could bewilder the strongest of men; women too for that matter. I have neither the inclination nor the knowledge to propagate commentary about FlexRoute technology or value-driven leaf switches with multiple use cases that have been compressed into a compact form factor. It is probably lots easier to understand that this company has developed a technology that allows users to eliminate the need for separate routers and switches, which is obviously a pain point for users and a competitive differentiator for this company.The Cloud Titans!There was once a movie called the Clash of the Titans. The original movie was quite successful by the standards of the day (1981). The plot is… well the plot is one of those Hollywood meets classical Greek affairs that is perhaps a little wearing on those of us such as this writer that took a few or perhaps more than a few courses in college from a well-known professor in classical Greek literature and civilization. But the film had Lawrence Olivier, Maggie Smith and Burgess Meredith as leading players, so it wasn't all bad.As for the film that was released in 2010 - well it sold a lot of tickets I suppose, but whatever the plot line had been in the initial movie was mangled beyond belief into a non-stop compendium of grunts and gore. Not my kind of thing. Sadly, neither Sir Laurence or Burgess Meredith were available to reprise their roles and Maggie Smith was involved in Downton Abbey, a much better use of her talents. I keep hoping she will decide she wants to do another season - I do not want to be stuck in the limbo that was 1926.Fortunately, the movies in question have nothing whatsoever with the cloud titans of which Arista management likes to speak other than the name. As it happens, the cloud titans have been and continue to be the principal driving factor in Arista's growth although it also continues to enjoy success in the financial vertical, the high tech vertical, and the sub-titan service providers.Just How well is Arista actually performing as a companyArista CEO, Jayshree Ullal, when asked about seasonality observed that the many of the cloud titans had fiscal years that ended in June and then restarted their major acquisitions of hardware in what will be Q4 for Arista. I am not too sure how that works as both Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have calendar year quarters - but the key point is that management, regardless of the specifics of its Q3 guidance, maintains that it is going to achieve normal 2H seasonality which implies quite a bit more growth than portrayed by the consensus. Basically, management said that regardless of macro concerns, this company is seeing growth across the board and it expects that to continue through the second half, although the cloud titans have the biggest amount of dollars to spend and tend to drive the numbers. That is a comfortable place to be, at this point in the tech cycle and perhaps ought to be a point of focus on the part of investors.Because of the relative strength in business seen from the cloud titans this past quarter, gross margins were slightly lower than the prior quarter, but still near the upper end of the company's guidance range. Operating expense growth was clearly at levels that will need attention going forward. In particular, R&D spending, at nearly 23% of revenues is higher than might be considered reasonable. That being said, some of the spending relates to the development of workarounds from the intellectual property lawsuit. But overall, the rate of spending depicts a company very comfortable with the strength of its business and looking forward to seeing strong positive seasonality. The company excludes the expenses of its litigation from it non-GAAP presentation which is reasonable. Legal expenses are running at 10% of non-GAAP operating income.Like most tech vendors these days, ANET works with contract manufacturers and it has brought a new supplier, with factories in the US on-line. Production from its new supplier is slated to begin this quarter. Having suppliers located in different geos affords the company with more flexibility in sourcing its designs. It seems likely that depending on regulatory and legal processes, that using the US-based sourcing alternative will trim gross margins by some small amount going forward, which should prudently be incorporated into expectations. But more importantly, it will avoid some of the problems that have come from the present lawsuit and the potential that ANET's switches, or some cohort of them, could be banned from importation. While the company anticipates that its workarounds will be accepted by the tariff commission in short order, it is far from certain that this will be the case and having a domestic source of supply will be a comfort going forward. The introduction of the new source of supply has led to a significant increase in inventories and will, at least initially, result in some, although not huge pressure on gross margins. It would be hard to find any component of the company's business that isn't performing at optimal levels at this point - and that stands in stark contrast to the titan of the networking space, if I may be pardoned the pun, who delivered a quarter with 2% sales growth that has been described by some as exceptional. 37% sales growth at some scale is exceptional; 2% - not so much.Is it market share or customer concentration or what is it that keeps the Arista bunny hopping?While Arista's titan category has always been a focus for observers, the company also sells to the 2nd and 3rd tiers of service providers and overall, that has been a compelling sales opportunity set in which to be concentrated. Overall, the networking space remains growth challenged as can be seen from the forecast supplied by Cisco and the rather significant drop in orders in its service provider category. Perhaps of greater interest/concern were the comments of CEO Chuck Robbins that he saw nothing that might turn around that decline (in the service provider space) any time in the near future. Cisco's call was last week and Arista's comments antedated the call by more than 2 weeks, but there is something here of a horse, or some other kind of fanciful animal, going in two directions at the same time.One particular strength for Arista has been its focus on the channel. Everyone says it focuses on the channel and of course every company in the enterprise technology space always has a VP of channel marketing. That said, a company of this size has the potential to really mean that a channel focus is a principal part of its go-to-market strategy and to derive a noticeable comparative benefit because of its channel focus. Generally, the trade-off to focusing on partner contributions are gross margin pressures, but at the end of the day, using a partner to extend the reach of sales capacity makes better sense than the more direct approaches which frequently bog down.In terms of growth, most of the comments by the CEO and the CFO on the August 4th conference call really came down to the fact that they had seen nothing in order intake that would challenge normal seasonal patterns for this company's cloud customers. Basically, the demand chain is pretty solid in that Arista is designed into the networks being deployed by both the cloud titans and their less exalted relations, that cloud deployment rates continue to increase rapidly and that orders to Arista are tied to the requirements of its cloud customers. So, Arista is not seeing whatever market demand problems that Cisco has seen in its service provider revenue category and that the CEO is forecasting will continue into the future.I have noticed in writing articles, and reading those of other contributors, that there is a tendency to believe that bigger is better. It would be a turgid history review to try to go back and determine why Cisco missed the bus and permitted a company like Arista to grow up. Without question, much of the current Arista leadership team and many of its founders were employees of Cisco who grew impatient/frustrated with that company's hesitation to embrace the concepts of software defined networking (SDN) and to adopt a more open product strategy. This is not particularly uncommon in the tech world for various reasons that I won't discuss here. Often, the industry leader is an older company, growing more slowly that pays a dividend and reports earnings, and Arista does neither. But for a variety of reasons, not really having to do with the IP dispute, Arista has had and continues to have a better set of mousetraps and its most recent innovation, the switch/router is likely to continue that pattern for some time into the future. It is very hard to put the genie back in the bottle and while Arista shares will not appeal to all kinds of investors to be sure, the fact is that it continues to increase its market share and despite the advent of a competitive product that Cisco refers to as ACI, I would be surprised if Arista did not continue to outgrow Cisco in the switching area and in the SDN area for the foreseeable future based on the comments of various industry observers and its very deep relations with the cloud Titans and some of its other significant customers.One demand issue that is a nice problem to have is that the company is simply unable to meet customer requirements in a timely fashion at this point, and that as a result, lead times have gotten to a higher level than is normal in the networking space. It is a nice problem to have and many companies in this space would kill to have it, but it is a problem nonetheless, and is perhaps one reason why the company has been so conservative in its Q3 forecast. But those kinds of issues will certainly be worked out, and the fact is that there are opportunities for Q3 sequential growth to exceed the forecasted level of 5% and there are certainly opportunities for more rapid sequential growth than the 9% or $26 million currently forecast by the consensus for Q4.In 2015, the sequential growth between Q3 and Q4 was 13% or $28 million. I would be surprised given that demand is stretching normal delivery times, if sequential growth in Q4 was not, at the least, a little higher than the sequential increase that this company achieved in a year-earlier period in which it had fewer new products to sell and no ""backlog"" of unfulfilled orders to work through.I said earlier in this article that I wouldn't talk about specific products and I will stick to that promise, but the fact is that one of the stronger trends in networking at the moment is that service providers want to eliminate their current architectures that require both routers and switches, and they want to bring down the cost curve by using merchant silicon. Arista sits athwart that trend having products that are designed specifically to take advantage of the lower cost inherent in using merchant silicon and this has been a business driver for the company since its beginning and it has enabled the company to grow faster than Cisco by being able to sell enhanced functionality for a price that is very competitive if not less than the prices charged by Cisco and that trend is likely to continue going forward. The specific products in question are both in trials for Arista, and the CEO said they were being received well. Of course, no one imagines she might have said that they (the products) were being received poorly. The CEO then went on to talk about flexible spines and I thought about our leading presidential candidates and wondered if the man was thinking of taking Arista into the political arena.But one way that Arista might beat estimates in a visible fashion would be through the success that its switch/router could have in replacing currently standard technology, and of course that is not something that can be readily forecast in prospect since such a solution has never existed heretofore. Quantifying that kind of opportunity is really not possible in advance, but it is surely a large opportunity that is not in current forecasts. And of course the other way is for this company to develop a software revenue stream that self-evidently has much higher gross margins. Some of the terms that are used to describe the software in this area are not overly descriptive, but the fact is that the success of the switch/router and to more spine solutions based on software could lead to gross margin improvements to offset the costs of complying with the requirements the company will face in terms of importing its workarounds. Certainly, our political leadership has massive experience in getting flexible spines to pay - so maybe taking a ""leaf"" from our political leadership is not such a far-fetched idea after all for a company like Arista.How does the stock work from here?I think it is time to try to tie some of the components of this article together to see if the case for a higher share price for ANET makes sense after its relative share price strength in recent months.My case for the shares continuing to deliver positive alpha is something like this:I think that Arista shares will continue to provide investors with positive Alpha and that the resolution of the IP disputes will be happening sooner rather than later."
3964486,71085,2016-04-11T15:19:23-04:00,"This Seeking Alpha Eye on Tech column looks at an IDC report forecasting a gradual decline in traditional data center hardware sales, as spending shifts towards cloud infrastructures.HP Enterprise, EMC, and NetApp are among the publicly-traded hardware firms especially at risk. IBM and Cisco are also vulnerable.Private cloud growth provides both opportunities and challenges for IT giants. Cisco,  for its part, is hoping new ASICs will win over public and private cloud providers.Companies positioned to benefit from growing cloud-related IT hardware spend include Arista, Super Micro, Infinera, and Oclaro.","46% of all spending on ""IT infrastructure"" (referred to as servers, storage, and switches) will go towards cloud infrastructures by 2020, predicts IDC. A lot of that growth will come at the expense of traditional data center infrastructure gear, whose spending share is expected to drop to 54% from 69.8% in 2015.IDC sees spending on traditional gear declining at a 1.3% CAGR from 2015-2020. That estimate might be conservative, given a 4% drop is expected in 2016. Forex is admittedly a 2016 headwind. Gartner has forecast total 2016 IT spend (whether on-premise or cloud) will drop 0.5% in 2016, with forex and international macro pressures weighing on sales.Meanwhile, spending on cloud infrastructure gear is expected to see a 12.5% CAGR, with public and private cloud spending respectively growing at 13.8% and 10.2% compound annual rates. 30.2% of 2020 server/storage/switch spend is expected to go towards public clouds, and 15.8% towards private clouds. A lot of that spending will go to contract manufacturers of white-box hardware, such as Quanta, Wistron, and Compal. They've been doing brisk business selling to the likes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).IT giants at riskLooking at the list of publicly-traded enterprise hardware firms at risk from a long-term decline in traditional enterprise data center spending, HP Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), EMC (EMC), and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) stand out. The business units that became HPE following the old HP's Nov. 2015 breakup received 51% of their FY15 (ended Oct. 2015) revenue from the Enterprise Group, which provides IT hardware and related services. HPE's IT outsourcing business (25% of FY15 revenue, has been seeing declining sales) is also exposed to on-premise hardware spend. The company has partnered with Taiwanese contract manufacturers Foxconn and Accton to provide the kind of cheap white-box hardware many cloud service providers are partial to.EMC, meanwhile, received 66% of its 2015 revenue from its Information Storage business, and another 27% from VMware (NYSE:VMW), whose server virtualization software sales are being pressured by the migration of workloads previously running on VMware's software to public clouds. However, with Dell set to acquire EMC (and the payout consisting of cash and a VMware tracking stock), EMC investors only need to concern themselves with VMware's exposure, assuming the acquisition closes. VMware is trying to lower its exposure to standalone server virtualization sales by growing sales of cloud/data center management, network virtualization/SDN, and storage virtualization software.NetApp's business consists almost entirely of selling storage systems and related software/services. The company is hoping its $870M purchase of flash storage array vendor SolidFire will help it better target cloud service providers. SolidFire's systems have won praise for their scalability, as well as their clustering and high-endurance features.IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) are also vulnerable, but their direct exposure to on-premise data center hardware is lower than that of the aforementioned companies. IBM received 9% of its revenue from its Systems Hardware unit, and 37% from a Global Technology Services unit that partly depends on outsourcing deals featuring IT hardware. Some of Big Blue's software sales (for example, database sales) are also tied to on-premise hardware deployments.Excluding its divested set-top unit, Cisco received 31% of its revenue for the six months ending Jan. 23 from switching, and 7% from its Data Center (UCS server) unit. And some of Cisco's services revenue (23% of total revenue) was tied to services related to its switching and server ops. However, a decent portion of the switching business involves campus switches, which (unlike data center switches) have limited cloud risk.IT hardware giants could compensate for lower traditional data center sales by growing private cloud-related sales. However, a lot depends on how much these private clouds are run by enterprises, or by managed service providers such as Rackspace (NYSE:RAX) - the latter group is often willing to use white-box hardware. The IT giants also have to deal with upstarts such as converged infrastructure (integrated server/storage) provider Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX), which is targeting enterprises who want Google/Facebook-like infrastructures but lack the IT resources to manage white-box gear, and companies releasing cheap hardware based on the open-source designs provided by the Facebook-led Open Compute Project (""OCP"").A low-power server design created by Facebook's Open Compute Project.Companies that stand to gainCisco rival Arista (NYSE:ANET), meanwhile, could have much to gain as public cloud-related IT hardware spending continues growing rapidly. Facebook and Microsoft are believed to be large buyers of Arista's high-speed data center switches, and there's speculation Google is one as well. IDC estimates cloud-related spending on Ethernet switches will rise 26.8% this year.Cisco is trying to counter Arista and win over cloud giants via switches based on its just-launched Cloud Scale ASICs, which the company claims gives it a 2-year lead on rivals thanks to advantages over merchant switching chips in fields such as throughput, buffering, and latency. Arista, meanwhile, is hoping to grab a chunk of Cisco's router sales for the first time via switches based on Broadcom's (NASDAQ:AVGO) next-gen Jericho switching chip, which supports routing features.Other potential winners as cloud-related spending keeps growing:"
4084175,98236,2017-06-27T10:28:11-04:00,"Arista has recently introduced a suite of significant new products that reenforce its lead in the fast growing space of high-performance switches and routers.The company also has recently emerged from the cloud of litigation with arch-rival Cisco.Earlier this year, the company took a significant step to offer solutions that include ""white-box"" hardware.The company has achieved major penetration of most of the so-called Cloud Titans.It also has a significant and growing distribution arrangement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise.","Arista-Can anyone see their dust?It has been 10 months since I last wrote about Arista (ANET). Since that time the shares have doubled. Part of that performance relates to the fact that the company has grown by almost 40% in terms of both revenues and earnings. The other piece of the company's share price appreciation is that the risk of its IP litigation with Cisco (CSCO) has dramatically subsided in the wake of victories before the various courts and panels who adjudicate these kinds of cases. And of course, over that same span the IGV index has increased by 26%, which highlights the level of positive alpha the company has been able to sustain.I do not intend to try to write any further in this article about the results of all of the lawsuits. It seems fair to say that from a business standpoint Arista won and it will not be subject to any additional business impediments. That is about all that is necessary to understand in assessing the investment merits of this company.I must confess that I have not chosen to hold the shares I had initially bought for the entire run. Those things are hard enough to do, even in conversation and harder still to do in real life. Recently, a reader asked me to take a look at the name to see if it was still a decent investment. Part of the cause of the question related to the company's new product cycle which seemingly is putting more dust between what Arista is offering and what Cisco - and the other competitors in the space - have on offer.Investors should realize that Arista is not just another hardware vendor. It is thought by many investors that hardware vendors hit walls based on commoditization. In addition, since the advent of the cloud, and the impact the cloud has had on the market for both servers and for storage, many investors feel that this is an issue that makes it difficult to invest in IT hardware vendors. I think that the concept, as a whole, is a gross oversimplification. When it comes to Arista, while the company does sell switches of course, and now routers, the fundamental ""stuff"" that differentiates this company from its competitors, and of course, particularly Cisco, is the massive differentiation it has been able to achieve based on its operating system, EOS and ancillary software solutions. As will be highlighted below, that differentiation has seemingly taken another step forward with a series of product releases that offer users a dramatic enhancement in performance for the same price per port as prior Arista solutions.Arista shares have appreciated another 11% in the last month. And they are at an all-time high. But given the environment in which this company competes and the competitive advantages it brings to the table, I think it has a number of years of hyper-growth visible. I think current First Call consensus estimates are basically not realistic in their reversion to the mean-particularly the current estimate for 20% top line growth next year. I expect the company will continue to beat and raise and to see reported percentage revenue growth continue to re-accelerate. While it is hard to believe that the shares will increase by more than 100% over the next 10 months as they have just done, I do thing they will continue to generate positive alpha.What's the big new thing at Arista?Arista has just announced a major new product refresh for its ""R"" series of what are called Spine and Leaf network switches. According to the article linked above, these switches really are the high-performance champions of the space. The introduction seemingly widens the competitive gap it enjoys between its competitors, yet again. Hardware vendors do introduce new products all of the time - it is sort of like the Geico Gecko saying, ""this is what we do."" And industry magazines typically write complementary pieces regarding new product introductions-there is somewhat of a symbiosis in that finding out about new products is a main reason readers click on these articles. And an announcement such as this is not a huge surprise.But after years of reading articles of this genre, it is reasonable, I think, to suggest, that the writer here is a bit more impressed with the scope and magnitude of this announcement than is usually the case. Without attempting to try to write the equivalent of a product brochure for the company's new products, besides the very high-performance hardware, one of the major innovations of the refreshed range is something called AlgoMatch. I hope no readers feel the need to tax my knowledge regarding the details of the AlgoMatch architecture-I do not pretend to have detailed knowledge on the subject. For those with some further interest in the subject, the architecture allows users to define their own filters in terms of what are called packet classification. In addition, the architecture allows for advanced counters which are often part of an overall security solution. And the architecture allows for what is described as a richer network policy that does not exhaust physical resources.At the end of the day, while perhaps over-simplistic, it seems that being able to offer AlgoMatch on the ""R"" series of switches is a big deal and enhances the differentiation that this company can offer.I am not about to attempt to evaluate the new set of hardware products that include various models, new line cards and upgrades for the company's leaf platform the 7280R2. The new cards are basically designed to provide existing customers with investment protection so they can take advantage of the new capabilities without changing out their switches. Overall, the article says that the new capabilities allow an Arista network to handle 3X the Internet routing table, 10X the number of ACL' s that can be processed (no, it is isn't the injury that frequently ends athletic careers but it stands for Access Control Lists which provide insight into the type of traffic going across a network-processing ACL's is usually thought to be a significant bottleneck in terms of network performance), and 100X what is called the sFlow rate of previous generations.These are features that that are tailored to the customers that Arista targets, i.e. cloud providers, service providers and large enterprises that need the ability to scale up and out quickly. The new set of capabilities apparently has some implications for the company's network security capabilities. Again, I rapidly run out of bandwidth in understanding the details, but apparently the new R series can be used for better DDoS protection because of the high rate sFlow. Arista is not following Cisco in attempting to become a security vendor, but it is allowing networks built on Arista technology to be more secure.Again, I think it is important for investors to understand/accept a couple of things. One is the belief that in the cloud era, everything having to do with hardware is commoditized. And the second belief is that there is no differentiation for all of the hardware products that are now based on merchant silicon. Those two misconceptions have led to a 3rd misconception that posits that the only way to compete in the hardware world in this cloud era is through price because ""good enough"" becomes the norm.I think that the article makes clear that there are substantial differentiators between the various vendors in the data center switch space. And the article makes clear that users are able to derive substantial and quantifiable benefits by selecting a network architecture that is built with the greatest capacity and performance. And finally, the article makes clear, that at least so far as the author is concerned, Arista has a substantial advantage in terms of the capabilities that are most valued by Cloud Titans and other large network users.Why is Arista winning the battle of the switches?Arista was founded to build switches optimized for what is turning out to be the largest class of users, the so-called Cloud Titans. The basic reasons that Cisco continues to gain market share in the overall switching space is that it focuses it energy and strategy on appealing to the segments of the market that are growing the most rapidly. The company has a modest share of the overall market and an outsize share of the market for the most powerful switches. And, it appears that its lead in this category is getting larger. ANET's growth is tied to the growth of the only part of the switching market that is growing rapidly and that seems likely to persist into the future.While the article I have linked here is about 6 months old, the points that it illuminates are even more relevant when it comes to evaluating the competition between Cisco and ANET in the wake of the latter's latest product announcements. Arista has tailored its solution set to the needs of the largest and most demanding users which include Cloud Titans, what it calls Cloud Specialty & Hosting Providers, the largest Service providers and the largest Financial Services vendors. What is very striking, and really important to consider is that while Arista has a market share overall of just 5%, it has a market share of 28% in the 100GB market segment. While the 100 GB segment is new, it is showing dramatic increases. That is basically why Arista's market share is rising. Put another way, Arista has a dramatically disproportionate share of the 100 GB market and the 100 GB market is exploding as it becomes necessary to support the performance requirements for the Cloud Titans and other larger users.It is also worth noting that while the overall switch market is showing minimal growth, the market is growing at very high rates where Arista has its highest penetration rates. Arista has and will continue to make its living, ""focusing on the needs of a group of data center customers. Arista has a very big position with the hyper-scalers, the cloud Titans. Arista is one of the few hardware vendors that recognized the opportunity in the cloud and has built its business around focusing on the part of the market showing outsize growth.Why is Arista doing so well in the market segments that are growing so fast.? I don't think I am really qualified to answer that question with a huge amount of authority. But here are some thoughts.One of these is that Arista has developed what is called a containerized EOS. This, again, is a relatively recent announcement (March 7) that will likely have a significant impact for the company going forward. The CEO has described it (the new product announcement) as a game changer, and based on prior discussion amongst both industry analysts and brokerage research arguing about the potential impact on the rise of ""white-box hardware for data networking"", it seems that Arista is essentially co-opting the threat and riding with the wave.. The announcement essentially means that the company now provides its customers with the software capabilities inherent in its operating system without the need to buy Arista hardware. The trend toward using white box switches, while not enormous yet, has been thought to be a significant risk to this company's growth. That concern will be substantially less, going forward.Another announcement of some interest, although hardly game-changing, was the availability from Arista of a set of capabilities that is called DANZ. This is a relatively sophisticated data analysis offering that offers material performance advantages when compared to other offerings in the analytics spaceANET has what it describes as 5 A principles of differentiation. I am sure there are no readers who want to receive a commercial about what those are, but the fact is that the hype is real, and it is working. Just to name the principles or attributes: 1) Availability; 2) Agility; 3) Automation; 4) Analytics and 5) Open API's. There are obviously discussions, nuances and interpretations associated with all of these attributes, and I am sure that there are reader/users who are likely to dispute ANET's claims-but at the end of the day, the proof is in the results, and those results have seen growth at a cadence that is actually re-accelerating.Another factor that is helping growth rates has been the advent of this company's router solutions which have grown to be 20% of revenues in a very short space of time. The set of routing products has been on the market for a bit over a year now and has received very favorable reviews. I have linked to a Barron's piece here. There isn't too much new to say about routing other what was discussed earlier in this article. It is always nice to have multiple legs underneath a growth stool - Arista finds itself in that positionIt is almost time for Q2 to be finished-Any thoughtsAbout all I can do is to revert to Q1 and the guidance that was provided during the last conference call. The company provided guidance for revenue to reach $360 million in the current quarter. That is still the current consensus. Revenue of $360 million would be 34% growth. I am inclined to think that given the product announcements of substance made in the past few months, top-line growth is going to be stronger than that. And I would think that the current First Call consensus estimates for the full year which shows growth to be 31% are significantly less than the most likely results-there has been a clear trend for top-line growth rates to re-accelerate and I think that is likely to continue for the next several quarters..The company has seen deferred revenues almost double in the past 6 months. The CFO said that trend is unlikely to continue although she was also unwilling to forecast where deferred revenue would actually wind up. Short term deferred revenue grew by 40% in just the first quarter. That might suggest a significant tail-wind to reported revenue, although the CFO really declined to discuss the matter. Further, DSO fell from 62 days to 45 days. Often, a change of that magnitude in DSO suggest a very linear quarter and can set the stage for an upside revenue event. So, I look at product cycle impacts, a rapid rise in deferred revenue and a substantial fall in DSO and imagine that the odds of this being a strong quarter in terms of outsize revenue growth compared to the forecast and the current consensus is pretty high.In the wake of guidance for the current quarter, the consensus EPS forecast increased noticeably. The First Call consensus for this year now calls for EPS of just shy of $4. The consensus for 2018 calls for EPS of $4.73 and is substantially greater than it was prior to the earnings release. Still, I think the published consensus is not accurate as it calls for minimum margin growth. Last quarter, operating expense grew by 33% on a GAAP basis, 500 bps below the growth in revenues.In particular, the company's research and development spend is now more than 24% of revenue, while the company's sales and marketing spend is 11%. The company is obviously focused on enhancing its solutions and its go to market strategy, to focus on the customers with whom its offering have the greatest value and where its solutions enjoy the maximum level of differentiation. The company is the quintessential land and expand vendor (see the company's chart in its investor presentation which shows 15 of the company's 15 largest customers have all purchased every quarter except for one outlier at the end of 2016). This is one of the principle factors that has allowed this company to spend so much less on sales and marketing compared to its competitors and yet to achieve such substantial gains in market share.I expect that the company will be able to achieve a moderate improvement in the ratio of its operating expenses, particularly in general and administrative costs.At the time of the earnings conference call, the legal situation for the company still had risks and uncertainties which may have led the company to forecast pressures on gross margins in a consistent range. In a given quarter, for a company like this, which has such a substantial new product component in its shipments, forecasting gross margins can be tricky. It is possible that the initial shipments of the products that were announced last week are at the start of a typical manufacturing ramp. I think that modeling for 64% gross margins is a reasonably conservative component, of building an EPS model for this company.ANET, almost uniquely uses a relatively minor amount of stock based comp and the stock based comp ratio continues to fall. Last quarter, stock based comp was 4.8% of revenues compared to 5.4% of revenues the same quarter the prior year. Of the non-GAAP EPS reported last quarter, stock based comp was 22% of the amount. That compared to a 26.5% stock based comp ratio in the prior year in the prior year. Overall, I am hard pressed to see that ANET any valuation premium for having a much higher quality of earnings in terms of stock based comp when compared to many other hyper growth companies. But it is a factor to bear in mind when evaluating a longer-term investment decisionI expect that the fall in the stock based comp percentage is likely to trim 200+ bps from the percentage growth in EPS for the next several years.Overall, the company's forecast which is embedded in the consensus shown by First Call, is that operating margins will decline by 200 basis points sequentially. That is unlikely to happen, I believe, and certainly will not happen if revenue attainment exceeds the current published forecast.The company adopted a FASB regulation relating to the tax benefit from the diluted share calculation. This increased the company's reported outstanding share count by more than 2 million. This was basically a one-time event that reduced reported EPS by $.02 last quarter. That factor will not burden future quarters. It is one of the reasons why I believe that the current consensus EPS forecast, which still shows outstanding shares increasing this quarter, may prove to be conservative.ValuationIn April, ANET shares were downgraded by 3 analysts, primarily based on valuation back in April. That has left the shares rated between buy and hold, overall with a price target lower than the current share price.One analyst from Credit Suisse has made a call that contends that Cisco has more percentage upside than does ANET. I don't wish to pursue that discussion in this article. I will simply say that when it comes to fast switches and perhaps high-performance routers as well, the market share gains that ANET has been making seem more likely than not to continue. Now that the lawsuit has concluded without Cisco gaining much, if anything at all, the company is going to need to recast its strategy in terms of competing with Arista. That is not likely to be an overnight process.I think it is also worth mentioning that the company CEO, Jayshree Ullal has an automatic share sale program and that she recently sold a total of 80,000 shares.The company currently has a market capitalization of $12.2 billion. The company has a bit more than $1 billion of net cash and that yields an enterprise value of $11.2 billion. The revenue forecast for the next 12 months, is currently about $1.6 billion. That yields an EV/S on a forward basis of about 7X. As mentioned, I am inclined to believe that the top-line growth estimates are quite understated and I think it more likely that the company will achieve 10% or more growth than is forecast. 7X EV/S is not a particular bargain…unless the company winds up achieving several years of 30%+ growth. Since that is what I am looking for, I find the current valuation quite attractive for longer-term investors.The company is forecast to have non-GAAP earnings this year of just less than $4. That is expected to grow to $4.73 in 2018. So, that is EPS of around $4.20 looking forward 12 months. That computes to a P/E of about 38X. For a hyper growth company, that is clearly a bargain. And looking at the company's far lower level of stock based comp when compared to most other hyper-growth equities, accentuates the difference further.Arista saw a dramatic improvement in its cash flow last quarter which more than doubled. That was mainly driven by strong GAAP profits coupled with a dramatic increase in the growth of the deferred revenue balance. But the company was also able to trim inventory balances and as mentioned earlier, it saw a significant contraction in receivables. The prior year, the company saw CFFO fall noticeably, mainly a function of inventory investments and other prepaid expenses that were likely related to the ongoing lawsuit.Without some substantive commentary by the commentary about the trend in deferred revenues the past two quarters, I really have no accurate way of even trying to handicap cash flow for the balance of the year. But excluding balance sheet items and further changes in deferred revenue balance, some estimate for CFFO would be about $390-$410 million. CapEx is running at under $20 million a year so free cash flow estimates of about $380 million seem reasonable. That would be a free cash flow yield of around 3.4%. That is not a bargain yield, to be sure, but to reiterate the point, the cash flow is not benefitting nearly as much because of stock based comp compared to many other hyper-growth companies. With that in mind, its current free cash flow yield compares quite favorably to other hyper-growth companies - although it certainly hasn't attained the level of Palo Alto (PANW).No one has in the last 6 months has described this company's shares as cheap or falling into some bargain category. It is not some dusty corner of the IT investment firmament. That said, Arista continues to differentiate itself significantly from its many competitors and to execute on its overall strategy. No, it isn't likely to double again in the next 10 months and I would be hard-put to feel that the company might be acquired-although it would be a better acquisition for some software vendors than many other names that have been suggested.I personally do not own the shares after my misguided sale. I will look for an entry point that isn't a spike, although I might establish a position before earnings simply because of the strong likelihood of a beat of the size that makes a difference. The company has a significant short interest ratio at 9% and a relatively small float because of the high percentage of shares still held by insiders. I think it is a great longer-term commitment but I want to be careful on re-entering the name. I think Arista shares will produce significant positive alpha over the next year."
4023047,62963,2016-11-14T07:42:47-05:00,Arista’s Cloud Solutions are more open and programmable than competitors.This has seen Arista take significant share from Cisco.Arista’s is expanding into additional use cases.Litigation and execution risks remain.,"If you can't innovate, litigate. Here lies the innovators dilemma for Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) as Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) switches are more open, programmable and cheaper. Although with $40B in Net Cash and a PE ratio of 14 times the super tanker is going to be around for a while.As the below chart demonstrates ANET is gaining share in the High-Speed Data centre switching market. This market is dominated by cloud providers where open and programmable gear is important. Being open and programmable is why ANET has a competitive advantage in this segment.As the below table illustrates, CSCO switching, Routing and Data centre revenue growth is either slowing or negative for the period to July 30 2016. Expect this trend to continue as ANET continues to gain share. Expect CSCO to invest in growth areas such as security and collaboration to offset declines in switches and routers. Clearly the litigation hasn't slowed ANET or the market share gains.Additional Use Cases to improve customer Loyalty and create stickinessANET new 7500R series is off to a good start with customers and will provide additional use cases for ANET. Combined with the ANET EOS, the 7500R will provide Routing functionality to customers. As it stands at least a dozen customers have certified the product and are using Routing, and this number is expected to grow to over 100 next year. As the chart below shows the economics of the 7500R stacks up well when compared to traditional routers. We're expecting significant customer loyalty, additional use cases for cloud provider customers and ultimately a more resilient business model for ANET. ANET is already a Billion-dollar business, and this will aid ANET on the path to becoming multi-billion-dollar business.Litigation and execution risks remainThe presidential review period ended on the 22 nd August 2016 for the ITC 944 case. ANET believes the new version of the EOS addresses the ITC's infringement findings in the case. It could be up to 12 months before Customs approves the recently submitted EOS software workaround. In the meantime, ANET is serving US customers out of the US manufacturing plant. Depending on the timeframe on the work around approval, expect Gross Margins to be in lower end of the 60-65% range. If the workaround is approved ANET may then serve US customers from the overseas facilities and Gross Margins will gravitate to the upper end of the range.Additionally, ANET is currently experiencing some generally supply shortages, which has increased lead times by 20-25%. ANET believes the supply shortages will be rectified within the next two quarters. If the supply shortages persist this may affect customers and ANET ability to execute.Inventory at Hand has shot up by $70m as ANET prepared for the forced move to serve US customers out the US manufacturing plant. Expect a short-term drag on some key operating metrics such as free cash flow. This should be temporary as ANET will improve production at the US manufacturing plant in the next couple of quarters.Valuation looks attractiveCSCO Year end is July and we have used actuals for CSCO, whereas ANET year-end is Dec and we have used conservative estimates. ANET free cash flow estimates are conservative and will be weighed down by ongoing litigation and the decision to ramp up inventory last quarter.CSCO grew 3% last year and currently trades at 13 times free cash flow. Given CSCO massive free cash generation we wouldn't short CSCO anytime soon, even as it struggles to grow. ANET is leveraging its leadership role in the cloud and is growing at over 30% and trades at 26 times free cash flow. Earlier we argued ANET growth can continue as they have adopted additional use cases, improved customer loyalty and are creating a business with more revenue stickiness. Also, if we normalised for litigation expenses and the increase in inventory then the free cash flow multiple would be closer to 20 times.Litigation will slow ANET, but won't stop them on the march forward as they increase market share from 14.9%. We recommend buying at current levels."
3963017,71085,2016-04-04T14:33:44-04:00,"This Seeking Alpha Eye on Tech column looks at the potential implications of Brocade’s $1.2B deal to buy Wi-Fi hardware firm Ruckus Wireless, the latest in a string of networking M&A transactions.With Brocade looking to better compete against Cisco and profit from the Wi-Fi market’s growth, the deal has much in common with HP Enterprise’s 2015 acquisition of Aruba Networks.While rivals consolidate, Cisco has been focused on lowering its hardware dependence via M&A and new products/services. That could give competitors an opening to gain share.Extreme Networks, Ubiquiti Networks, and Arista Networks are among the independent networking firms that could draw buyout interest. Meanwhile, there’s speculation Ruckus could get a higher bid.","Brocade's (NASDAQ:BRCD) $1.2B deal (announced this morning) to acquire Ruckus Wireless (NYSE:RKUS) is the most recent of several large mergers/acquisitions to hit the networking/telecom hardware space over the last 12 months. The others:Similarities with HP/ArubaThe Brocade/Ruckus deal has the most in common with the HPE/Aruba deal: It involves the purchase of a Wi-Fi equipment provider by a larger, more diversified, networking hardware firm. Two differences: 1) Compared with Aruba, Ruckus' Wi-Fi sales skew more towards carriers and other service providers. 2) While HPE's networking business (prior to the Aruba deal) depended heavily on Ethernet switch and Wi-Fi hardware sales, Brocade currently gets the majority of its hardware revenue from storage networking gear (predominantly Fibre Channel). IP networking - Ethernet switches, IP routers, and other products - accounted for 28% of the company's January quarter product revenue.Regardless, both deals feel like attempts to gain more scale and reap M&A cost synergies in a networking hardware market where Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) remains the 800-lb. gorilla, where growth is already pressured by a mix shift in global IT spend towards Internet/cloud giants who often use white-box hardware produced by contract manufacturers, and where growth could be pressured in the future by software-defined networking (""SDN"") and network functions virtualization (""NFV""), which between them will make it easier for enterprises and carriers to replace proprietary networking hardware with commodity boxes running on off-the-shelf processors.Both deals also show the Wi-Fi market's strategic value - it's expected to see healthy (though not spectacular) growth as carriers and enterprises keep building out their Wi-Fi infrastructures - mobile carriers are often turning to Wi-Fi to offload traffic from 3G/4G networks - and is seen as relatively immune to the SDN/NFV threat, given the value of proprietary radio systems and management software.Deal synergiesBrocade and Ruckus naturally talk up the potential for the combined company to cross-sell to the pre-merger companies' respective customer bases: Brocade is stronger with large enterprises and federal agencies; Ruckus is stronger with service providers and hospitality firms.Source: Brocade-Ruckus presentation slidesThe companies also highlight their combined clout within enterprise networking and the data center. Notably, Brocade argues Ruckus' offerings will help it pursue (in addition to traditional Wi-Fi markets) opportunities related to 5G, IoT services, smart cities, in-building wireless (OpenG), and converged 4G/Wi-Fi networks.In addition, Brocade argues Ruckus will strengthen its efforts to grow its SDN/NFV software business - Brocade's Vyatta unit is a leading player in the young market for virtual (software-based) routers, and has also released SDN controller software based on the open-source OpenDaylight platform.Cisco in the crosshairsThough never mentioned by name in the merger announcement or related presentation (.pdf), Cisco is the elephant in the drawing room for Brocade and Ruckus … just as it was for HPE and Aruba. Cisco is Brocade's biggest rival in Fibre Channel switching, Ethernet switching, and routing, Ruckus' biggest rival in enterprise Wi-Fi, and also a major player in service provider Wi-Fi. IDC estimates Cisco had 47% of the 2015 enterprise Wi-Fi market, HPE/Aruba 15.9%, and Ruckus 6.7%.Brocade is easily the top player in Fibre Channel, but Cisco is firmly in second place.Brocade/Ruckus are betting their combined sales/marketing and R&D clout will help them better compete against Cisco, that cost synergies will help them compete more effectively on price, and that offering a more expansive product line will help them land more large deals. HPE and Aruba had similar motivations. So did Nokia and Alcatel-Lucent … though that tie-up was aimed as much as Ericsson, Huawei, and ZTE as it was at Cisco.Notably, while its hardware rivals consolidate, Cisco has been trying hard to lower its hardware dependence by making numerous software and services acquisitions - a look at its recent M&A activity shows purchases in areas such as IoT services, collaboration software, and security analytics - as well as by launching new offerings in fields such as IoT, SDN software, and managed security. And the company responded to the Nokia/Alcatel not by making a hardware acquisition, but by partnering with mobile infrastructure giant Ericsson.The moves come with the SDN/NFV threat to Cisco's switch/router sales gradually increasing, and the likes of Google, Facebook, and Amazon continuing to heavily rely on white-box switches. With more and more of Cisco's attention focused on software/services, hardware rivals adding scale and resources via M&A might have an opportunity to gain share.Who gets acquired next?Looking at the smaller publicly-traded networking hardware firms still out there, Extreme Networks (NASDAQ:EXTR) might be the most plausible buyout candidate … provided someone is interested. Extreme, whose product line includes switches, routers, and Wi-Fi hardware, is two months removed from plummeting due to weak guidance, and carried out big layoffs last year. But it has a low valuation (less than 1x trailing and forward sales), and would be easy for a larger player to digest - the company's current market cap is only $321M).Ubiquiti Networks (UBNT), which is trading higher today, is another possibility. The company is currently worth $2.8B, and its product line includes SMB-focused Wi-Fi hardware and wireless broadband infrastructure gear. With Ubiquiti having gone with a reseller-focused sales strategy to date, a buyer might see an opportunity to significantly grow Ubiquiti's sales by offering its products through the buyer's salesforce. However, founder/CEO Robert Pera maintains a large stake in Ubiquiti, and hasn't shown any interest in selling.Data center switch vendor Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) is also higher today. Arista's rapid growth - sales rose 41.5% Y/Y in Q4 - differentiated switches, and strong exposure to Internet giants could appeal to suitors. However, the company sports a relatively high valuation (~4x forward sales), and with a current market cap of $4.3B, the list of potential buyers may be limited to Nokia, Ericsson, Juniper, HPE, and (provided regulators don't object) Cisco itself. Moreover, management might demand a large premium given Arista's recent momentum.Could Ruckus get a higher bid?Brocade has tumbled following the deal announcement, as markets give a thumbs-down to the price tag involved. Brocade, which closed on Friday trading at ~1.9x forward sales, is paying nearly 3x forward sales for Ruckus, after backing out net cash. With much of Brocade's payout consisting of stock, its selloff has lowered the deal's value to ~$13.30/share from an original $14.43/share. Ruckus currently trades slightly above $13.Meanwhile, there's speculation Ruckus could receive a higher bid. BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk:"
4008623,92076,2016-09-27T07:31:59-04:00,Arista is rapidly taking market share from Cisco.Litigation with Cisco and Optumsoft is keeping the stock at undervalued levels.ANET is worth at least 20-50% more based on conservative assumptions.,"Basic informationMarket cap: $5.94 bil. P/E: 39.7 ROE: 17.7% EV/EBITDA: 29.7Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) is a supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of large-scale Internet companies, cloud service providers and next-generation data centers for enterprises. Cloud networking solutions consist of Extensible operating system (called EOS), network applications and 10/25/40/50/100 Gigabit Ethernet switches. Arista sells its products mostly to US (77.3% of revenue), then EMEA (15.3%) and Asia Pacific (7.4%).In cloud networking, traditional network functions and services including connectivity, security, management and control, are pushed to the cloud and delivered as a service. Compared to legacy networks, where companies had to purchase extensive hardware, current networks can be managed easily over the cloud with lower fixed and operating costs.Arista was started in 2004 by Andy Bechtolsheim, David Cheriton and Kenneth Duda. Bechtolsheim co-founded Sun Microsystems in 1982 (later sold to Oracle for $7.4 bil.) and also founded Granite Systems with Cheriton (sold to Cisco in 1996). Larry Page and Sergey Brin approached Cheriton with their search engine idea at Stanford because the rumor was, that he knew a ""thing or two"" about the internet. Cheriton arranged a meeting with Bechtolsheim and both wrote checks to Brin and Page, becoming the earliest investors in Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and billionaires.Both of them along with Kenneth Duda occupied several executive positions at Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) before founding Arista. Bechtolsheim was convinced, that the huge computing needs of giants like Google and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) would require a new computing architecture. It took them around four years to develop the first product, which was sold to banks involved in high-frequency trading. Their first customer was actually Lehman Brothers, which went bankrupt shortly thereafter.The company now has over 3,700 customers (up from 1,100 in 2011) and sells products directly or through partner channels.Source: ANET stock price by Stockrow.comIndustry backgroundCloud computing is fundamentally changing the way IT infrastructure is built and how applications are delivered. Nearly all consumer applications today are delivered through cloud. Enterprises are also moving to a cloud-based infrastructure, as it is more cost efficient, easier to deploy and also scales better. The aggregate network bandwidth in the cloud can be multiple times higher than in traditional legacy networks and as a result requires a different architecture.Arista basically delivers the hardware (network switches) and the software (EOS). The company claims that EOS is the world's most advanced network operating system, and that they are ahead of competition. Among their main competitive strengths are:ANET serves the data center switching market, which reached $8.3 bil. in 2015 and is expected to grow to $13 bil. by the end of 2019.Cisco is the industry juggernaut with an estimated 61% market share at the end of 2015. Its dominance is challenged by Arista and Huawei, which are growing much faster and taking share from Cisco:ANET financialsAs a result, Arista's revenues grew from $200 mil. to $800 mil. and profits are up more than tenfold from $9 mil. to $120 mil.Source: ANET revenue by Stockrow.comOperating cash flows exploded as well, growing to $200 mil. at the end of 2015, while capex remains very low at only $20 mil.Source: ANET snapshot by Stockrow.comBalance sheet remains clean with $1.1 bil. in current assets ($530 mil. in cash) and $420 mil. in total liabilities.Unfortunately, not everything is bright. Gross margins have been in a steady downtrend and reached 64.1% over the last 12 months, compared to 68% in 2013. This is mainly due to 2 factors: Arista is trying to take market share from Cisco, and as a smaller company has to offer a more competitive price.Secondly, Arista's customers are usually large internet companies like Microsoft, that have significant pricing power over ANET and demand discounts. Arista is sacrificing short-term profits to capture a larger part of the market and develop a strong brand and hopefully pricing power. Yet, their gross margins are still higher than Cisco's or Juniper's (NYSE:JNPR). At present, Arista does not have a moat and is winning customers thanks to superior technology.Source: ANET gross margin by Stockrow.comThe bright spot is that they don't need to spend that much on marketing thanks to a better product. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue have declined to 19%, lowest since 2014. As a result, operating margins have expanded to 20% despite decreasing product prices.Source: ANET EBIT margin by Stockrow.comIt also leaves more money for R&D, which is the ultimate driver of sales and profits for the company. Their spending in this regard relative to revenue is already much higher than at competitors Cisco and Juniper Networks. Arista spends 25.7% of revenue on R&D, compared to 20.3% at JNPR and 12.6% at CSCO.Source: ANET R&D by Stockrow.comCisco vs. Arista lawsuitIn December 2014, Cisco filed two lawsuits against Arista in California, as well as two complaints in USITC, claiming that Arista infringed on Cisco's patents. Arista lost both and ITC issued a statement that the company has to stop importing all products that use technology patented by Cisco.Arista's CEO Jayshree Ullal released a blog post and informed investors on the last quarterly call, that the company has already developed solutions that do not infringe on Cisco's patents and were released with the latest update of EOS software.The issue is that ITC has to approve these new ""workarounds,"" but Arista continues importing the products in the meantime. If ITC rules that they are still violating Cisco's patents, they could be subject to significant penalties, including royalty payments to Cisco. Both companies are still involved in litigation and the process can take months and years. Cisco seems to have the upper hand though.Cheriton vs. Arista lawsuitIn April 2014, Optumsoft, a company owned by Arista co-founder David Cheriton filed a lawsuit against the company due to unlicensed use of its software. Parts of EOS were developed in collaboration with Optumsoft, and the company claimed ownership of certain software files. The judge rejected Optumsoft's claims, but the court battle is ongoing.David Cheriton stepped down from Arista's board in 2014 but a trust he established for his children still owns around 12.5% of ANET stock, making him one of the largest shareholders. The lawsuit created significant tension between Cheriton and Bechtolsheim, but according to some sources, they still remain friends.Cheriton is the driving force behind startup Apstra, which delivers automation software to cloud data centers. His ideas and companies are viewed as contrarian but he is usually proven correct after some time. Therefore, it's certainly not a good thing that he separated from Arista, as he is another possible competitor in the field. And a very smart one.Lawsuits are nothing extraordinary in Silicon Valley. All major tech firms are involved in litigation and patent battles between themselves. Companies with significant resources like Cisco will always use patents to protect market share and stop new technologies from gaining acceptance.It's a natural process and if Arista continues on building great products, they will prevail eventually. Settlement payments will probably reduce margins and net income in the coming periods, but it won't fundamentally damage their business.ManagementThe CEO of Arista is Jayshree Ullal, the Chief development officer and Chairman of the board of directors is Andreas Bechtolsheim and Kenneth Duda is the CTO. The three of them owned 31.2% of shares outstanding, either directly or through trusts. David Cheriton owns another 12.5%.Their total compensation for 2015 was very low compared to peer companies, as all of them hold significant equity interests in Arista. Jayshree Ullal received $734k, Bechtolsheim $722k and Duda $1.2 mil. Management seems to be more interested in building long-term value instead of generating short-term profits, a rare feat in today's corporate world. Their interests are aligned with those of minority shareholders which makes the stock more attractive.ValuationHigh growth companies like Arista are hard to value, because future cash flows are impossible to estimate. However, I can present a few scenarios and see how the value of ANET stock in each one compares to the current price.Since 2014, ANET free cash flow has grown from $120 mil. to $230 mil. (2016 TTM). I have used a lower number that reflects an average of the past 2.5 years. Future growth and cash flows are highly uncertain, but analysts at Morningstar expect that Arista's revenue growth rate will decelerate to only 7% by 2019.I have constructed a DCF model with the following assumptions:- Revenue growth rate of 5-20% for the next 5 years, then 2.5-10% for another 5.- Terminal growth rate of 2%.- Discount rates 7-9%.- Free cash flow of $200 mil.Under these scenarios, Arista is worth anywhere from $3-10 bil. In my opinion, the bear case is highly unlikely but I have included it here as an illustration.I believe ANET can achieve 5-year growth rates of 15-20%, and using a discount rate of 8%, the value of the company is between $6.3 and $8.4 billion. Current enterprise value is around $5.4 billion, implying upside of 20-50%.If Arista can manage to grow revenues and free cash flow faster, its value is much higher.Valuation multiples have declined significantly since the IPO due to high growth. The P/E ratio is down to 42 from 80, EV/EBITDA is now at 29, compared to 69 in July 2014.Source: ANET P/E ratio by Stockrow.comIt can seem that valuation multiples for ANET are quite steep compared to JNPR or CSCO, but their growth is on a different level. Arista grew revenues by 37% in the last quarter, compared to 0% at Juniper and -1.6% at Cisco.Source: ANET revenue growth by Stockrow.comInvestment risksThe greatest threat to long-term growth are ongoing lawsuits with Cisco and Optumsoft. Arista will most probably have to settle them with a lump sum payment (best case) or will have to pay royalties to Cisco (worst case). If ITC bans again imports on Arista's products, their revenue would significantly decline. It is exactly this uncertainty around lawsuits and their outcome that keeps the stock at undervalued levels.The departure of David Cheriton from the company is a negative sign, and his companies (current or future ones) could be formidable opponents to Arista.Competition risks are always present, Cisco and Juniper have increased their efforts in the data center market and Cisco has also targeted high-frequency trading firms, which is Arista's niche.SummaryI'm certainly not an expert on cloud networks or Gigabit Ethernet switches, but I think that Arista Networks is a company with great management, significant engineering capabilities, clean balance sheet and high potential. They recently signed a big deal with Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), enabling them to distribute products directly to HPE customers.This is another proof that customers and partners are not deterred by ongoing lawsuits and their products are truly superior to competition. I believe ANET's intrinsic value is at least 50% higher than current market price.By buying Arista's stock today, I am not betting on the outcome of a lawsuit or their next earnings release. I buy it because I believe that when the next fundamental shift in the industry occurs, and it will, their management will be among the first to recognize it and navigate the company through the storm successfully.Philip Fisher, my favorite investment author and the advocate of buying stocks with high growth potential once said: ""Constant leadership in innovation, not patents is the fundamental source of protection."" I believe that Arista's deep expertise and engineering skills will be the key drivers of further growth."
4001610,52382,2016-08-23T15:05:13-04:00,"Arista's stock is underperforming Cisco's, partly due to relative valuation and adverse ITC ruling, but fundamentals suggest otherwise.New products and penetration in the routing market should help shrug off some of the recent setbacks, besides growing the addressable market.Clarity on the margin trends, post manufacturing and supply chain changes, should help improve the sentiment over the coming months.","Arista Networks' (NYSE:ANET) stock is up barely 4-5% from a year ago level whereas Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) is up more than double over the same period. Looking at the valuation difference between the two that still favors Cisco, especially among the value cautious investors, and the recent adverse ruling from the International Trade Commission for Arista, the argument for CSCO closing the valuation premium is bound to gain ground, but the fundamentals suggest otherwise.The valuation difference is definitely large, but looking at the fundamentals, especially the promise of consistently strong top-line growth combined with potential to improve margins over time offered by Arista, the premium may even increase. Arista's product leadership and market share gains in the switching market are finally acknowledged by customers and investors while opportunities in routing equipment, etc. are just shaping up, promising long-term edge over leaders in the space. In the meantime, Cisco continues to struggle, whether one looks at the recent layoffs or Juniper's (NYSE:JNPR) efforts to eat into the company's routing market via its updated switching products.No doubt, Arista will have to grow into the current rich valuation and execute flawlessly to remove investors' doubt over the potential risks born out of the manufacturing transition underway. From an earnings standpoint, the business is clearly in an investment phase, and investors are hardly expecting earnings growth if they come at a cost of top-line growth. The recent ITC ruling in favor of Cisco has raised fears, but the judgment and the resulting ramifications for the business do not seem to be big enough to have a lasting impression on the fundamentals or alter the growth story in any significant way. A couple of patent infringement may lead to some temporary margin pressure, but given the workarounds developed by the company, the issue may get sorted out over the next few months.Continues to gain market share and the train may not stop any time soonThe company is aggressively growing and taking share from Cisco in the switching products, thanks to the differentiated platform leveraging its Extensible Operating System on top of merchant silicon designed by the likes of Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), helping to keep the developmental costs low.More than the market share gains, it's the pockets where Arista is gaining share that suggest acceleration of the current market share shifts over the coming quarters. The company is gaining in the data center market and 10GbE plus speeds, among the fastest growing segments. Technologically too, given the market's increased focus on cost, flexibility, power efficiency, open-source modular design and use of software to improve the longevity of hardware, the edge may last a while.Beyond the data center switching marketAlthough never a done deal, the success in the switching market should help in the routing market as well, given the strong customer base using existing solutions and the cost advantage offered by the use of merchant silicon, and expected to help the company price its 100GbE per port solution at one-third the price of a traditional router. The recent launch of 7280R, combined with the previous launch of the 7500R platform, should position the company as a leader in the market for combined router and switching solutions besides growing the TAM by more than $13 billion.Expanded offerings should also help address the revenue concentration issue since the current growth is mostly concentrated among large customers, having advanced networking needs and resources for using best-of-breed solutions, in the U.S. Longer term, one can see the company going for optical transport and campus switching markets."
3775426,74905,2016-01-23T07:17:00-05:00,"Arista Networks' stock has been volatile since the announcement of Cisco's lawsuit in late 2014.The end of the first, and most important, round of litigation is coming in January 2016.After the announcement, expect ANET to recover a significant portion of its value during the rest of 2016.","IntroductionArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) is a stock I have been bullish on for a long time. ANET has a strong, experienced management team with a clear vision. The company has disruptive software, and is rapidly stealing market share in the growing cloud networking industry. Further, 2015 has been a strong year for the firm, and they continue to show investors great financials. Despite all that ANET has going for it, the market continues to undervalue it, for one clear reason.The continuing patent infringement lawsuits between ANET and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), its much bigger rival, have cast major doubts on the company's long-term prospects. These lawsuits have been adeptly covered by a few SA contributors, including myself, and for those interested, ANET has posted a timetable for these lawsuits on their investor page. However, Markman Advisors has done the best job of reporting the happenings with the litigation, and I recommend all those interested in ANET to catch up on the lawsuit by reading their articles.Not surprisingly, the ongoing legal battle has created much bearish sentiment and general volatility in ANET. Anytime news on the progress of the litigation breaks, the stock moves dramatically in one direction or another. This volatility means that ANET has the potential to vastly outperform the market in 2016, regardless of how the litigation is settled. Should ANET win the lawsuits, the upside is obvious - ANET shares will prosper without the lawsuit hanging over their heads. Should ANET lose the lawsuits, any further downside would quickly be recovered as quarterly results show the lawsuit results had no further effect on the business.Catalyst: Cisco LawsuitsAs laid out by Markman Advisors in their most recent article, the most important decision will come first, in January 2016. Here, 5 crucial patents will be decided upon by the ITC, and while there is a small chance the decision could be reversed, it is likely this decision will eventually be binding. The preliminary rulings seem to assure that at least 3 of the 5 patents will be decided in Cisco's favor, all of which revolve around Arista's switches and routers. In the event of a negative ruling, Cisco has requested a permanent limited exclusion order and a permanent cease and desist order directed at Arista, although no monetary compensation for damages has been requested.What this means is, if a negative ruling is passed, ANET would be blocked from importing or selling any products that include the patents in the United States. This sounds like a nail in the coffin for the company, but as Markman Advisors points out, ANET would be allowed to redesign switches so they don't violate the patent and continue business as usual. In fact, this has already happened, as discussed by ANET's General Council in the Q3 Conference call:This isn't just something that management is saying on the conference call, either. There is tangible evidence ANET is implementing workarounds, such as the release of new switches in September. What does this mean to investors? Frankly, it means that regardless of the outcome of the litigation, ANET won't miss a beat. Cisco is not requesting monetary compensation for damages, and Arista is already implementing workarounds for all the patents.The ITC ruling will be irrelevant for the future of Arista. Cisco's main goal of this lawsuit was almost certainly to slow down a smaller rival through forcing them to take on massive litigation costs, product redesigns, and worrying investors. They have succeeded in this, but that slowdown is already over. Litigation costs, as mentioned in the conference call, have already peaked, and the workarounds have already been created. The market has not seemed to realize this yet.Financial ReviewDespite Cisco's attempts to slow down ANET, the company is continuing to deliver phenomenal results. One highlight from the most recent quarter's investment presentation was that ANET continues to gain market share in the cloud networking space over the first half of 2015, despite the lawsuits. The market share for ANET was 3.4% in 2011, started 2015 at 9.3%, and is now up to 11.8%. For Cisco, these numbers were 73.3%, 66.1%, and 61.5%, respectively. Not only is ANET rapidly grabbing market share, it still has a lot more to gobble up. It's no wonder Cisco is so scared of this little upstart.The earnings release showed that this increasing market share continues to result in massive revenue growth - 11% gain quarter over quarter and 40% year over year. Unlike many growing companies, this revenue growth is falling to the bottom line, with a reported 40% growth in year-over-year earnings. Revenue and earnings have grown at about this pace consistently since 2011 as ANET continuously grows its market share. It also has a strong balance sheet. Its cash and cash equivalents sit at $569 Million, versus short-term liabilities of $225 Million and total liabilities of $350 Million.This strong balance sheet minimizes risk if the Cisco litigation results in a surprise monetary related ruling or the economic situation deteriorates in 2016. ANET also continues to innovate through products and services such as making its EOS available as a subscription and the release of Cloudvision. Although specific numbers weren't broken out this quarter, ANET management did note on the conference call that during Q3, these two products generated meaningful revenue in the ""10 to 12%"" range, and that they expect them to continue growing significantly.ValuationI have created two different discounted cash flow models to estimate ANET's intrinsic value - the first is based on free cash flow and the second on Earnings. I used a slow deceleration in growth rate over a 15-year period, with a 10% discount rate. I consistently use a 10% discount rate for DCF modeling because I consider that to be my targeted yearly rate of return over the long term. Because of the extremely strong balance sheet, I did not factor debt into the model.My assumptions are admittedly bullish - 40% growth over the next 3 years. It may be hard for readers to imagine either earnings or free cash flow to grow at 40% for the next 3 years, but if ANET is able to overcome the lawsuits and continue to steal market share in this rapidly expanding sector, it will happen. Indeed, according to the above referenced presentations, revenue has grown at a compound rate of 68% since 2011, and earnings have grown in lock step.These DCF models can give an idea to investors about how much upside there is to ANET, and how much these lawsuits are unfairly dragging down the value of shares. By Q3 2016, strong results post-ruling will have taken all of the lawsuit uncertainty out of the stock, and it will be trading more in line with the intrinsic value noted in these charts - which is in the range it had been trading prior to Cisco's litigation announcement in 2014. Given the current share price of 72.75, I project the upside for this stock in 2016 to be as little as 15%, or as much as 40%. On either end of this range, it would almost certainly outperform the market.Conclusions and When to BuyOver the next 12 months, I expect ANET to be one of the top performing stocks, and outperform the market, as 2016 should be the year shares recover from Cisco's attacks and investors finally realize even if the rulings go against Arista, it won't materially affect business. Given my outlook on the company, I would argue the time to buy is now.On the flipside, the lawsuits could still provide short-term headwinds. If they do lose the litigation on January 26, I expect the market to push ANET down further. I could see ANET losing as much as 15% of its value in a market overreaction. Considering ANET already has workarounds, this could make for the greatest buying opportunity of any stock in 2016, as quarterly earnings after the lawsuit show no ill effects from the ruling.I am already preparing a war chest should this happen. Conversely, a favorable ruling in January could send the stock higher 5-10% and make many feel like they ""missed out"" (a ridiculous notion if you take the long-term view). Given these precarious circumstances, investors need to analyze the upside in Arista networks and decide if they can take the volatility that will likely play out between now and February 2016. Investors could initiate a position, then add to it later should the stock drop, or they could stand on the sidelines completely until after the ruling.A third option, for more experienced investors, is to sell cash secured puts that are 10-15% out-of-the-money and expire after January 26, 2016. This would especially be viable if volatility pushes the stock downward prior to the ruling. Previous volatility swings have pushed these type of contract values to close to 10% of the underlying cash that would be necessary for a purchase at the strike.If the stock ends up falling below your strike, you can allow the contract to execute and receive shares at your strike price minus the premium received. You may still be in the red, but you would still have a cheaper cost basis than purchasing outright, and could end up in the green even after the drop. If not, then you can pocket the cash and buy the shares knowing you didn't ""miss out.""The table below shows trade outcomes based on a strike of $55, dated for expiry Jun 17, 2016 with a current ask quote of 2.10, according to E-Trade (NASDAQ:ETFC). I will say that 2.10 is a bit low of a price to sell these puts at, in my opinion. Investors could likely get a better deal if they wait for a day when there is more volatility in the market or in ANET specifically.In conclusion, I believe Arista Networks is primed to deliver phenomenal returns for 2016. I continue to hold it and will add to my position on dips. Please feel free to ask me any questions or concerns regarding my thesis, or voice your own opinions on the company, in the comments."
3962099,98236,2016-03-30T16:58:07-04:00,"Arista was founded by two of the leading figures in the Silicon Valley world and those men still hold 30% of the outstanding shares.Arista's technology approach in which it differentiates its switches by the use of its proprietary EOS software is considered by many observers to set the company's offering apart.The company has enjoyed substantial and profitable growth for several years and while crossing the billion dollar revenue milepost, its operating margin is 25%.Arista shares have been mired at modest valuations since the company was sued by Cisco Systems for patent infringements.","A couple of weeks ago, I wrote an article about Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and its role in the SDN space. SDN is a concept with a long history that is just now finding broad acceptance. Part of the promise of SDN is that it would be the harbinger of an open networking world and that it would significantly ameliorate network bottlenecks. But along the way, Cisco has seemingly hijacked some of the concepts of the SDN paradigm. Cisco's version of SDN is totally proprietary and really does little to mitigate costs in a modern data center. Good for Cisco, not so great for users!Despite Cisco's seemingly successful defense of its heartland in terms of selling more and more network switches, the company has basically been in a very slow growth mode for some years. These days, Cisco has more than 20 different operating systems deployed across multiple platforms and multiple generations of hardware. Whether it is a strategic decision on the part of Cisco or just a byproduct of nature, Cisco's ability to really innovate is hobbled by the requirements of supporting so many different operating systems.And yet the world is rapidly changing as the scale of data centers reaches proportions undreamed of just a few years ago. There are articles that tell of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) building data centers that are populated by more than 1 million servers and many of these servers have their own combinations of virtual machines as well. And there are far more instructions that have to be processed. Just consider what happens when a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) user wants to update his/her homepage. It might seem as though something as basic as that would be a simple problem in terms of network capacity but, of course, it isn't. Each FB update typically generates literally hundreds of ancillary transactions in its wake.Hyper-scale users like FB and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) simply could not and cannot sustain the cost of traditional network architectures. Currently, Gartner says that network overhead, i.e. the switches, the servers and the like represent more than 50% of the cost of modern networks. Further, given the number of transactions generated by many hyper-scale users, using a legacy architecture with what are described as ""over-subscribed"" switches is not really an option either.Cisco may have been successful in staving off some type of calamitous assault on its market share, but it is clearly not capturing all of the available growth in modern data centers. During the course of my research into Cisco's relationship to the SDN paradigm, I came across a name that was new to me and perhaps to many readers, Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET). Gartner had written a glowing evaluation of the company's products and prospects and so, I thought a deeper dive might be in order. If Cisco's relation to SDN is primarily defensive, Arista seems to have developed a strategy that embraces the new architecture and appears to afford users a clearer path toward building the type of efficient networks that are required because of the current demands of hyper-scalers.Arista is not without its controversies to be sure - anytime your principle competitor is Cisco, investment controversies are almost certain to arise. Arista is the defendant in a significant patent infringement case brought by Cisco, that could take up to 50% of the company's current cash balance of $700 million. Arista generates a substantial amount of cash flow. Last year, its free cash flow grew by more than 50% to $180 million. I think some scenarios that have been published regarding the company's liability and how it might impact operations are more than a bit overblown. I will discuss the case below although I make no representation that I am a patent attorney or have any particular expertise.Arista shares are currently trading toward the bottom of their 52-week range, primarily because the concerns primarily regarding the lawsuit have sparked investor fears. Usually, companies that are achieving 25%+ revenue growth and are said to be leaders in cloud-based networking sell for valuations that make little sense to many readers. Here, using the basic valuation metric of price to sales of about 4x ratio seems to compensate for significant fears and risks.Arista does have broad analyst coverage. 27 analysts provide estimates and the average of their forecasts calls 27% revenue growth in the current year. Arista is a company of some size and a relatively long operating history and revenues are likely to cross the $1 billion mark this year. That being said, there have been relatively few articles on Seeking Alpha discussing the name. About half of the company's shares are held by insiders and most of the balance (42%) is owned by institutions. And its short interest is 23% of the float. If the investment thesis is accurate, then the shares have significant runway. I will try to touch on a few highlights of what the company does, how it does it, and why that is better. I will avoid commenting on the specifics of what makes up Arista's product family. It will not help most readers in evaluating the shares and the material is incredibly dense. That being said, the new 7500 switch/router that the company announced the other day is another clear disrupter. The capabilities of the new product can replace the routing layer in many networks. There are major implications in terms of performance and the elimination of network bottlenecks and it will certainly enlarge the size of Arista's TAM. Arista these days really does have the best and the brightest in the networking space. It is always interesting to consider a new name.OK - What is Arista's secret sauce? This is a company that makes large Ethernet switches - there are plenty of competitors and potential competitors.Yes, there are. This is the hardware business after all and vendors have been making Ethernet switches for eons. But not all Ethernet switches are created equal. In the latest Gartner review of the space, the consultant's write that ""unlike in the past, vendor differentiation is shifting toward software - including management, automation and orchestration - compared with hardware."" Gartner's Research Director in this space, Andrew Lerner, writes that ""Arista has a scalable architecture, tight integration with a variety of orchestration and SDN products and flexible software."" Mr. Lerner also writes that ""Arista has taken a very open and agnostic approach that's cost-effective so it's a very compelling story for the enterprise… that doesn't lock you into a specific architecture."" Of equal interest is the fact that Arista jumped several places from the 2014 Gartner survey to the current position it enjoys as the absolute leader of the 11 vendors.The secret sauce that Arista has developed is its EOS operating system that runs on its switches. To the extent that Arista is said to have the best software out there and that software has become the most important differentiator, it is hardly surprising that Arista is by far the fastest growing vendor in the space. They just seem to have what most users say they want: flexibility, scalability, reasonable price points and an open/agnostic platform that works with devices from most other vendors.While there will always be a market for whatever it is that Cisco sells, and in point of fact Cisco is ranked #2 in the leader quadrant by Gartner, many users are going to reject Cisco's ACI with its relatively rigid architecture and relatively high price points. That isn't to say that Cisco will not be successful with ACI regardless of how closed it may be. Cisco may lose market share to Arista. That has been going on for a few years, but it has a huge amount of market share that it could lose before anything became too noticeable because few investors are looking for Cisco to provide much growth.At the other end of the market, there is a category called White Box Switching. White Box Switching is the ability to use off-the-shelf, generic components in the forwarding plane of an SDN. Gartner's report said that particularly in the market for hyper-scale data centers, white box switching is becoming more acceptable given that proof points as to its efficacy are proliferating. Some white box switches come pre-loaded with minimal software while many are simply ""bare metal"" devices. There seem to be two camps regarding white box switching. One camp says that generic switches, because of their lower cost will find a broad market and will hurt those vendors who offer a more proprietary hardware/software platform. On the other hand, some observers argue that users are going to want a network composed of vendors who are responsible for overall performance and are willing to pay extra for proprietary software. It seems likely that the benefits of white box switches are not distributed evenly. Most SMB's will never be able to reap the advantages of using white box switches when compared to hyperscale users such as Facebook and Microsoft. I don't purport to have second sight regarding these trends but white box switches are hardly a new phenomenon. I think they are getting more publicity now than in the past because they are part of the data centers that the 7 large hyper-scale vendors are putting together. That is not an insubstantial market to be sure, but again according to Arista's market research, the real sweet spot these days and projected through 2020 is for all other cloud deployments + service providers outside of the top tier. In any event, all is hardly lost for Arista even within the cloud titan (their words not mine) space.At the moment, according to ANET's own market research, Cisco holds a market share of around 61% compared to ANET's 12% market share in the classification called high speed data center. As the market itself is said to be growing in the mid to high teens, it seems quite likely that white box vendors will continue to increase and take share without significantly impinging on the ability of Arista to continue its growth trajectory. Indeed, Arista's growth in what it calls the Cloud Titan market has been exceptionally strong even through the end of last year. Microsoft represented 12% of Arista revenues which is down in percentage and up in absolute dollars. I think that the most likely scenario is that some of the Cloud Titans will introduce more and more white box switches into more of their data centers but will also continue to expand their deployments of Arista switches in a co-existence fashion. So white box phenomenon or not, Arista is getting its share of switch deployments in the public cloud.I think that overall, part of Arista's success is having a product that hits most of the right buttons in terms of its appeal to users and part of its success is based on addressing the fastest growth component of the data center Ethernet switch market in terms of the service providers and the enterprise. But the TAM of the data center Ethernet switch market is huge and Arista has 12% of it suggesting it has plenty of leeway in which to grow.I think it is self-evident that the moat here is Arista's EOS. It is simply far more difficult to recreate software than to go down the hardware cost/performance curve. I also think that it is evident that within the high speed Ethernet switch market the hyper-scale vendors are growing but the tier just below that of the hyper-scale users is growing most rapidly. while demand for public cloud providers continues to expand, the expansion beyond the hyper-scale users. It is the hyper-scale users who might try to recreate the functionality of Arista's EOS and some will doubtless go down that path. But for even slightly smaller users, even contemplating trying to build an EOS is something quite beyond the pale.To use an analogy that comes to mind, NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) first developed its OnTap operating system as long ago as 2000. OnTap in its various implementations was the single bit of technology that distinguished the company from all of the other storage vendors that abounded in the first decade of this century. Everyone knew that OnTap allowed users of those years to do the same things that operators of data centers want to do today. And yet it took more than a dozen years until a company with 4 times the market share of NetApp, EMC was able to catch up and offer its own operating system. I don't suggest that the analogy is perfect and some will argue, I imagine, that either the white box phenomenon or some other unexpected competition will prevent Arista from continuing to take market share. But there really is nothing visible at this point and some competitors such as HPE (NYSE:HPE) that actually are thought of as competitors, are actually partnering with Arista and OEMing their switches for use in a unified solution that will be offered by SIs and other value added resellers.Arista has had a consistent history of significantly surpassing earnings estimates and not by a small amount. In its last reported quarter, the beat was 31%. Operating expense growth overall was 38% year on year although a quarter of that growth came from the litigation expense that Arista is incurring at this time. Most of the beat was simply related to stronger than planned revenue growth. Revenues had been forecast to be $240 million and they actually were $254 million. With many opex categories more or less fixed in the short term, most of the additional gross margin dropped to the bottom line.Like some vendors in the networking space, this company does not believe that it has visibility to forecast results for more than one quarter. The company has a history of some seasonality with its Q1 quarter typically down from the prior year Q4. The company forecast that this Q1 would follow a similar pattern and would show growth of 33% down quite a bit from the growth of 42% seen in Q4. In 2015, Q1 revenues increased 3% from the 2014 Q4. So, forecasting that Q1 revenues will decline by 7% sequentially seems to be an exercise in conservatism that has been typical of Arista. Management commentary during its last conference call suggests that it sees macro conditions as favorable for demand and that it has not seen any decline in the enterprise space that Cisco spoke about when it presented its results for what was fiscal Q2 in the middle of February. There is no indication that either the competitive situation or the demand picture has changed materially. It would not be surprising given the difference between the prior seasonal pattern and the results forecast for Q1 '16 to see a significant upside.The consensus estimate for the full year is for revenue growth of 27%, far below the 42% growth achieved last year and for EPS growth of 13%. Try as I might, I find it more than a bit difficult to believe that non-GAAP margins will decline significantly during the course of the current year, and I also find it really tough to believe that a company that will just cross the $1 billion revenue mark in the current year is likely to see a significant revenue growth slowdown. As mentioned above, this company has a relatively long history of beats and raises. The current $2.76 EPS projection is up from $2.60 90 days ago and last year the company beat its projections every quarter by amounts ranging from 35% to 11%. I think that it is more than likely that a similar pattern will set up in 2016 and that strictly looked at from a business perspective, the potential for a significant and continuous series of quarters that are both beats and raises is the set up for significant share price appreciation.While the overhang of the Cisco lawsuit is no trivial matter, that overhang has persisted now for some period of time and the fact is that the company both on its latest call and before spoke to having workarounds should the lawsuit result in an adverse ruling. Given Q4 results that were achieved under the litigation cloud, and given company assurances of a practical and timely workaround, I think that the lawsuit contingency would primarily be on the damages to which Arista could be liable. I think analyst opinions from several major brokerages advising investors to steer clear of this name until after the settlement of the litigation are quite misplaced.I understand the EOS differentiator and that software rather than hardware is driving more and more cloud networking decisions - but how did Arista get to where it is today? It couldn't have just been that!It really is not a useful exercise to discuss the details of this company's product line-up. It is really hard finding clever and interesting things to say about the specifics of large Ethernet switches. Perhaps I ought to seek assistance from the people on Saturday Night Live because on my own, I am just stumped.There really have been two basic factors driving the success of Arista besides the EOS software. One of these is partnerships. This company has had a consistent strategy of not attempting to develop all the components of a complete data center solution itself. In that regard, it casts itself as the ""anti-Cisco"" which these days competes for all most all of the necessary components of modern large scale data centers.Arista partners with all of the major security vendors including Checkpoint and Palo Alto. It partners with the storage vendors; it partners with Dell even though Dell is perhaps a leader in white box switches. One of its newest and apparently most successful partnerships is with HPE. The offering utilizes Hewlett's converged architecture and storage in conjunction with Arista's programmable network platforms to deliver optimized data center solutions. At the moment, Arista has no fewer than 50 technology partners and it is the openness and flexibility of its operating system that allow it to integrate so easily with so many partners. Many, many IT vendors talk about partnerships which are announced and then disappear almost like the dew on a summer morning. It is partnerships that have enabled this company to grow rapidly with a very controlled sales and marketing spend.The other major component of the company's success of its technology strategy which involves leveraging commodity silicon in conjunction with its EOS. I don't think it is necessary or useful to discuss the details of the strategy and in any event, those kinds of overarching pronouncements are often just that, pronouncements not realized in practice. Over the years, many companies have articulated similar technology strategies but far fewer have been successful in achieving the goal of using commodity silicon to drive costs down the curve while maintaining functional differentiation.So far, at least, the company has been doing better than many would have forecast in getting the benefits from its technology strategy. The company has maintained gross margins just below 65% and net margins last year surpassed the company goal at 26%. Stock-based comp, at just over 5% of revenues, is quite modest especially given the company's emphasis on attracting ""star"" quality engineers from Cisco. Again, while the company's technology strategy is far from unique, its ability to execute that strategy and to enjoy the benefits from using commodity silicon as opposed to custom chips, is hard to execute. This company seems to have been able to pull it off to this point and its emphasis on EOS is providing the differentiation it needs to achieve decent margins and rapid top line growth.Why oh Why do I have to discuss patent litigation?Patent suits are hardly unique in the IT space. By its nature, technology invites claims as to what is unique and patentable and what is in the public domain. I really don't purport to be a world expert on the topic, but I think that if one simply goes through the background of what this matter is all about, there are some tentative investment conclusions that can be drawn.Arista started as a company in 2004. The founders were Andy Bechtolsheim and David Cheriton. For those unfamiliar with the names, Bechtolsheim was a founder of Sun and its chief hardware designer in that company's glory days. Cheriton is one of the leading technology intellectuals in the Silicon Valley where he teaches at Stanford and has become very wealthy investing in names such as Google and VMware. But a significant portion of his wealth came from selling Granite Systems to Cisco in 1996. He is said to be a renowned expert on distributed systems and networking. Jayshree Ullal was recruited by the founders of Arista in 2008 to come and run Arista. Her background: she was Cisco's VP of Data Center & Switching reporting directly to John Chambers. Her career at Cisco spanned more than 15 years and she was a talent whose loss Cisco and John Chambers found hard to swallow.Not terribly surprisingly, Ms. Ullal, over time, recruited loads of star talent from Cisco. Mid-level engineers at Cisco these days are very unlikely to get rich and many of them had worked for Ms. Ullal. Cisco management hates and fears Arista and its key employees at least as much as a spurned lover might hate an ex-paramour. Some kind of litigation was probably inevitable.The lawsuit was filed in December 2014 in the last months of John Chambers' tenure as Cisco CEO. The lawsuit alleges that Arista had stolen its intellectual property and copied what is called the Command Line Interface commands. The commands in question are certainly embodied in Arista's products. The issue is whether or not the commands are within the public domain. When the lawsuit started, it covered 12 Cisco features covered by 14 Cisco patents. According to Cisco, the patents were granted to former Cisco employees who now work at Arista.There appears to be a convergence of opinion that Cisco filed its infringement suit when it did because of Arista's success. It is not really possible for this writer to say, even after 15 months, if Arista is using some Cisco features illegally. The mechanics of the suit relate to attempts by Cisco to bar importation of Arista switches that are said to infringe on patents involved in creating the CLI. So, perhaps the biggest concern to both investors and Arista customers is that Arista will be cut off from the supply of products it sells and that Cisco could claim damages from all of the Arista customers using switches that incorporate the stolen technology.In early February, the International Trade Commission made an initial determination that Arista infringed on 3 Cisco patents and did not infringe on 3 others. At about the same time, Arista filed a counterclaim against Cisco alleging antitrust violations under the Sherman Act. The heart of that allegation is that ""Cisco uses a bait and switch strategy"" where Cisco claims that its command line interface (CLI) is an industry standard and then attempts to penalize competitors who use it. Arista also claims that Cisco raises the prices of what is called Cisco's SMARTnet service and support offering for customers who deploy competitive networking equipment alongside their Cisco infrastructure. It is almost certain that the latter allegation is true. The question is whether or not discriminatory pricing alone is enough to sustain an anti-trust complaint.At this point, Arista has said on numerous occasions and before many different audiences that it has developed workarounds that will not infringe on the Cisco patents in question. Ms. Ullal has stated that the workarounds are ready to ship and customers will not notice any difference in performance or functionality of the new switches. In some cases, Arista has apparently started shipping switches with the workarounds incorporated.This is still a lengthy process which is nowhere near the finish line. I think it is self-evident from Arista's performance to conclude that its customers are not too concerned about the litigation. Billion dollar companies growing 40% must have customers who think the litigation will have no impact on their purchases. On the other hand, investors are quite concerned and have valued the shares at modest levels based mainly on concerns about what might happen if the case is decided against Arista.I have no reason to disbelieve that Arista has not developed workarounds and thus, regardless of the outcome of the suit, its business will continue unabated. If that is really the case, then it is all about damages. The courts have thrown out some of Cisco's damage arguments to this point. The company has about $700 million in cash and generates lots of cash each year. I would be surprised if any damage award might be so high as to endanger the financial stability of this company or deter prospective customers from continuing to buy Arista products. And that is about all I can usefully say about this litigation other than to add that most of these conflicts are settled before they are decided and that John Chambers, who probably was angrier about the personalities involved in this matter than anyone else is now retired and Chuck Robbins is running the company.How to figure the appropriate valuation for a company whose franchise is under legal challenge.Arista only became a public company in June 2014 so there is not much valuation history from before the lawsuit was filed. It obviously commanded significantly higher valuations before the filing of the lawsuit than it has since. Its all-time high was $93 and that occurred at the end of September 2014. In the wake of the lawsuit, the shares reached a trough of just over $56/share back on February 8th of last year. During the tech panic earlier this year, the shares reached a low of $53 before rebounding modestly to about $61.The shares have been subject to wild gyrations depending on analyst commentary either about the company's competitive positioning or about the state of the lawsuit. In the middle of March, brokerage firm Jefferies sent out a note to the effect that suggested that the company's hyper-scale customers are migrating away from the kind of branded hardware that is sold by Arista. I have discussed that trend before. It really doesn't worry me that much. There will be mixed networks at hyper-scale customers for many years to come. I think that it is rather illogical for the Jefferies analyst to have lowered his 2016 revenue forecast for Arista in the wake of a lively discussion regarding the specifics of the migration held on the last conference call. The CEO said what she said and one can either believe her or not. I tend to believe her.Arista has a current enterprise value of $4.3 billion. Revenues this year are estimated to be a bit greater than $1 billion. The company's P/E is 22X this year's estimate. In 2015, the company generated $180 million of free cash flow. Using estimates for consensus, revenue growth and consistent cash flow margin yields free cash flow of $230 million. Fee cash flow of $230 million provides free cash flow yield of greater than 5%. Obviously, with those valuations, the company's shares are not deep value. But does anyone imagine that absent the lawsuit a company growing as fast as this, with sustained and relatively high levels of profitability and clearly a leader in what it describes as ""software cloud networking"" wouldn't command much higher valuation. Who really can tell - double, I think so. Maybe triple. Trying to answer hypotheticals is simply not something at which I am any good. No omniscience here, I am afraid - I leave all that to the politicians.My contention, for what it is worth, is that an investor is being paid an enormous sum to wait out a lawsuit whose settlement, one way or the other, is highly unlikely to damage this company except from a liquidity standpoint. That really isn't that hard to bear when a company generates a sizeable amount of free cash-flow as Arista does. It is a bet - of that I am aware - and some readers are going to throw up their hands and declare they don't want to be involved in a name with an overhang - but Arista really does have the leading solutions in its space and that has nothing to do with the CLI. The company has loads of partners and it will continue to thrive in the future.Some Final ThoughtsArista is a relatively large company that may not be known by many Seeking Alpha readers. It history as a public company dates back little more than 2 years. The company was founded by two of the best known and most widely respected names in the IT space and they still own more than 20 million out of the 68 million shares currently outstanding. Other insiders including the company's CEO and its CTO own an additional 12 million shares. The company is run by the best and brightest networking minds in the world and I think it is reasonable to assume that in its specific field the company will remain the technology leader for years to come.The company makes high capacity Ethernet switches but its secret sauce is really its enterprise operating system that allows users high levels of flexibility and the ability to readily change configurations and to more readily manage networks. As such, Arista products enjoy some significant TCO advantages. The company sells into 4 major verticals including hyper-scale cloud companies such as Microsoft, it sells to a host of service providers and it sells to other tech companies. In the past, Microsoft had accounted for as much as 25% of revenues, but as the company has grown that percentage is likely to be less than 10% this year.Management has taken a consistently conservative approach to guidance and it seems likely that such is the case for estimates regarding 2016 as well.Clearly the 600-pound gorilla in the Arista room is the patent infringement lawsuit filed by Cisco. I can really not offer any dispositive commentary as to the suit's merits or demerits. I think I can say that Arista has and will have workarounds such that its operations will not be materially impacted.In my opinion, the shares are selling for far less than would be the case, absent the overhang from the litigation. The short interest, at 23% of the float is quite high and the shares are subject to significant volatility as both the lawsuit and concerns about its strategy surface from time to time. I think the preponderance of the data points suggest that Arista shares are significantly undervalued."
3122296,49101,2015-04-30T11:43:29-04:00,Cisco initiates a multi-front IP war against Arista.The first key battle will be held at the ITC with Arista facing exclusionary remedies against its entire product line.Arista's early IPR defense strategy may not be enough.,"""If you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the results of a hundred battles."" Sun Tzu, the Art of War.Certainly nobody knows Arista (NYSE:ANET) better than Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), which used to employ Arista's founders, president, CEO, CDO, CTO, as well as numerous VPs and other officers. And clearly Cisco is not afraid to start ""a hundred battles"" to protect itself from Arista's competitive challenge. Cisco has indicated its intent to crush Arista by initiating two District Court actions and two separate actions in the International Trade Commission (ITC) - spanning 12 patents and numerous copyrights. Arista is doing its best to fight back by challenging the validity of some of those patents at the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO), but Cisco's strategic choice to assert the patents in the ITC in parallel with the District Court cases should get it to at least an ITC trial date regardless of what happens at the USPTO.Founded in 2004 and based out of Santa Clara, California, Arista Networks is a network switches company that has become a powerhouse in the cloud networking industry. ANET provides software-driven multi-layer network switches for large data center, cloud computing, high-performance computing and high-frequency trading environments. Arista's products include 10/40/100 Gigabit Ethernet switches driven by its proprietary network Extensible Operating System (EOS).The company has been profitable, with an operating margin of 26% for 2014, 61.7% growth, and annual revenue of $584.1 million. It is not surprising that the company had a very successful initial public offering on June 6, 2014, with the stock going as high as $59.72 ($3.8 billion market cap), up 39% from its list price of $43. Arista is expected to report its Q1 2015 quarterly earnings on May 5, 2015, after the market close. The consensus EPS forecast for the first quarter of 2015 is $0.31.Needless to say, the company competes directly with Cisco and is gradually eating into Cisco's market share - from 6.7% in 2013 to 9.3% in 2014 per the Crehan Data Center Switch Market report. According to Arista, the explanation is simple: customers are transitioning away from legacy proprietary networking solutions to Arista's cloud networking architecture. The modern cloud data centers demand a more agile and economical standard-based solution with ""unparalleled scale, availability and open programmability.""Eighty-three percent of Arista's revenue to date has been generated from the Americas, substantially all from the United States. (Form S-1, Amendment no. 3, May 27, 2014). Arista's customers include six of the largest cloud services providers including eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Yahoo (YAHOO); financial services organizations such as Barclays (OTCPK:BCLYF) (NYSE:BCS), Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS); and a number of media and service providers, including AOL (NYSE:AOL), Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (CMCSK), Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX), ESPN, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Rackspace (NYSE:RAX).Such success is especially noteworthy since the networking industry is a highly competitive market. Suppliers such as Cisco, HP (NYSE:HPQ), Alcatel-Lucent (ALU), Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) aggressively compete for the same customers, and Arista is, relatively speaking, a new kid on the block fighting to get some attention.Lately, Arista's success and growth has been so strong that Cisco could not, presumably, ignore its deteriorating market share. To fight back, Cisco has declared a full out intellectual property-based legal war on Arista. In total, Cisco has commenced four lawsuits. Two lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and two additional lawsuits were filed in the ITC. In all four lawsuits, Cisco has alleged that Arista's success is based upon its infringement of numerous patents or copyrights owned by Cisco. In other words, Cisco has essentially claimed that Arista stole Cisco's ideas.The two District Court actions can be distinguished by their primary allegations. One action primarily asserts copyright infringement, whereas the other primarily asserts patent infringement. In the action asserting primarily patent infringement, the scope of infringement allegations is vast, including hardware, such as switches and routers, and their physical components and software, such as operating systems and other applications running on these platforms. Arista's accused products may be deployed in data centers or dedicated computing center environments in connection with an organization's servers, associated data and/or IT applications, which use the accused products to transport data, voice and video over networks. The asserted patents accuse the bulk of Arista's primary product offering.In the action asserting copyright infringement, Cisco is accusing Arista of ""verbatim copying"" of Cisco's operating system software. Cisco claims that Arista has essentially replicated Cisco's own command-line interface (CLI), which is used by Cisco's customers to communicate with its products as well as to configure and manage them. More specifically, Cisco's products use its operating system, known as the Internetwork Operating System (IOS). The IOS itself uses a widely-acclaimed command-line-interface (CLI). The purpose of the CLI is to allow users to ""talk to"" and configure Cisco's products. To achieve this, CLI includes hundreds of multi-word commands specifically developed by Cisco for its products. (An example of such commands would be ""copy,"" ""paste,"" ""delete,"" etc.) Importantly, Cisco alleges that Arista copied more than 500 of Cisco's CLI commands. Cisco also points to verbatim copying from Cisco user manuals. The Copyright Action also asserts infringement of two patents that are related to implementing CLI commands. See Complaint, DCT-5344.Investors should be mindful of the differences between a District Court action and an ITC action, and how Cisco has leveraged those differences to put pressure on Arista. Cisco is alleging that Arista has infringed its patents in both the District Court and the ITC. However, the remedies for those two forums are different. In the District Court actions, Cisco is seeking monetary damages and potentially an injunction against Arista's future sales of infringing products. By contrast, in the ITC action, Cisco is seeking to bar Arista from importing its products into the U.S. The ITC was a smart choice for Cisco to use against Arista since most, if not all, of the Arista's products are not made in the United States, but actually imported from overseas, countries such as Malaysia and China.What is interesting about these cases are Cisco's allegations that Arista is unlawfully using a number of critical networking technologies that were developed by Arista's own founders while they worked at Cisco. Specifically, Arista's founders, Andreas Bechtolsheim and David Cheriton, previously worked at Cisco and are the named inventors on two of the asserted patents - the '853 and the '577 patents. (Investors who followed last year's patent case between Juniper and Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) may recall a similar issue where Juniper claimed that its former employees stole ideas developed at Juniper to found Palo Alto).Cisco's allegations don't stop there. It claims that scores of Arista's employees previously worked at Cisco prior to joining Arista. This includes Arista's: 1) founders, 2) president and CEO, 3) chief development officer, 4) chief technology officer, 5) senior vice president for customer engineering, 6) vice president of business alliances, 7) former vice president for global operations and marketing, 8) vice president of systems engineering and technology marketing, 9) vice president of hardware engineering, 10) vice president of software engineering, and 11) vice president of manufacturing and platform engineering. Moreover, four out of the seven members of Arista's Board of Directors were previously employed by Cisco. See Complaint, DCT-5344 at Par. 2.Why are these allegations potentially damaging to Arista? Because they expose Arista to claims of willful infringement. Under patent law, if infringement is proven to be willful (or intentional), the patent-holder can be entitled to treble damages. Often, the most difficult obstacle to proving willful infringement is proof that the accused infringer actually knew about the patents. In this case, the proof is in the pudding. Arista's executives and board are filled with people previously employed by Cisco. Moreover, Arista's founders are named inventors on two of Cisco's asserted patents. It will be nearly impossible for Arista to deny that it did not know about Cisco's patents in the course of developing its technology.Separate from the possibility of trebled damages, Arista's damages exposure is still significant. Arista was founded in 2004 and launched in 2008. If Cisco prevails on proving infringement, it will be entitled to damages going back six years - almost the entirety of Arista's existence. (This will depend on the asserted patents, which issued at different times. The youngest patent issued in 2013, which affords only two years of past damages, whereas many of the other patents will afford six years. In any event, most of these patents will not expire anytime soon, and the potential for future damages is significant).There is another important issue that arises from the fact that Cisco's patents were, in some cases, invented by Arista's founders. This issue is assignor estoppel. Under the doctrine of assignor estoppel, a party that assigns his/her patent to another is subsequently estopped from challenging the validity of that patent. Here, Arista executives appear to be named inventors on several of the patents. This may bar Arista from challenging the validity of Cisco's patents if the doctrine of assignor estoppel is deemed to apply. This could potentially be a big setback for Arista. In most patent cases, an accused infringer (Arista) has two primary avenues of escaping liability - proving it does not infringe the patents, or proving the asserted patents are invalid. If Arista cannot avail itself of proving the patents are potentially invalid, then its chances are defeating Cisco's claims are substantially weakened.In-Depth Look at the Pending CasesOn December 5th, 2014, Cisco brought two separate cases in the Northern District of California:(1) Cisco Systems, Inc. v. Arista Networks, Inc., 3:14-cv-5343 (December 5, 2014)(2) Cisco Systems, Inc. v. Arista Networks, Inc., 3:14-cv-5344 (December 5, 2014)The first case, DCT-5343, is a strictly patent infringement case spanning 12 U.S. patents. The case has been stayed pending the resolution of the ITC investigations, further discussed below. The second case, DCT-5344, alleges infringement of two additional patents as well as allegations of copyright infringement. The case is ongoing with the initial case management conference scheduled for May 14, 2015, at 1:30pm in San Jose, CA before Judge Beth Labson Freeman. Arista has yet to answer, but it will be important to observe what counter-claims it intends to assert and what early motions to dismiss, if any, it intends to file.The table below provides a brief overview of all of the patents that are the subject of the District Court and ITC cases:The above listed patents are asserted to cover almost the entire line of Arista's networking products, including the Arista 7010, 7048, 7050, 7050X, 7100, 7150, 7200, 7250X, 7280E, 7300, 7300X, 7500, and 7500E series of switches and CloudVision, as well as those devices' implementations of functionality underlying Arista's command-line interface and implementations of Arista's CloudVision and eAPI functionality.With respect to the copyright infringement allegations, Cisco claims that ""by simply copying numerous networking technologies developed by Cisco, Arista avoided hiring the thousands of engineers and making the substantial investments that would otherwise have been needed to legitimately develop its own technologies."" In other words, Arista allegedly took a shortcut to directly compete with Cisco using Cisco's own technologies, thus in effect saving money and time necessary to develop products based on new technologies. According to the complaint:See Complaint, DCT-5344 at Par. 6.In addition to alleging infringement of its copyrighted works, Cisco has also alleged infringement of 14 home-grown patents, which we summarize below to demonstrate the sheer scope of the inventions allegedly practiced by Arista's accused products.The Asserted PatentsThe technology disclosed in the '853 and '577 patent improves the speed of processing access control lists by a network device to provide for higher throughput. The idea is to maintain access control patterns in an associative memory, match information to the access control patterns stored in the associative memory in parallel to generate matches having priority information, select one of the results, and make a routing decision.The technology taught by Cisco's '492 and '875 patents improves the performance of a network by preventing the formation of loops that are not detected by spanning tree protocols (STP). The invention transitions ports among a plurality of port sales and a loop guard engine to cooperate with a spanning tree protocol engine. The loop guard can prevent a port from transitioning to a forwarding state, thereby preventing the formation of loops.The '668 patent teaches improved immunity to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and improved Quality of Service (QoS) for networking devices. By using a control plane port entity and providing control plane port services for packets destined for the control plane, the invention improves security of a networking device while potentially minimizing any impact on transit traffic and system performance.The '211 patent relates to a multi-bridge LAN aggregated system and method for use by a device in a computer network. The technology taught in the '211 patent can improve the reliability and availability of data transmitted to and from a switching device. The invention aggregates a plurality of LANs coupling a host to a first and a second network device, thus enabling link aggregation to be used on redundant physical connections between a host and multiple network devices.The technology of the '537 patent improves the performance and increases resiliency of switching devices by providing an apparatus and method for externally managing networking data in conjunction with a database system called ""sysDB."" The sysDB allows for a centralized storage and retrieval facility for configuration data that is used by subsystems of a networking operating system. For example, certain configuration data can be managed externally from the sysDB by one of the client subsystems.The '296 patent teaches improvements in the availability and reduction of downtime of a network device during a software upgrade. The invention provides novel methods that copy certain data to a predetermined region of memory, temporarily suspend software operations associated with one or more data plane components of a network device during a software reset, and then, before the communication session is terminated, recover execution of the software operations. Thus, the '296 patent allows network devices to maintain the continuity of communication sessions and be upgraded with minimal delays or network effects.The '164 patent is directed to a system and method for provisioning network devices and to improved capabilities for changing the configuration of network devices. The technology disclosed enables changing the configuration of network devices that include a recovery configuration for a network device to revert to in case the device loses connectivity resulting from the configuration change.The invention taught by the '597 patent improves the security of a networking device by providing a logging module coupled to a subsystem of the device which detects and communicates configuration changes of the subsystem.The '592 and '145 patents relate to networking devices and Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs). The technology disclosed in both patents allows for improved protection and privacy of traffic through the network device by separating packet traffic using a switch by defining three new types of ports, ""promiscuous"" ports, ""isolated"" ports, and ""community"" ports, and three new types of VLANs internal to the switch - ""primary"" VLANs, ""isolated"" VLANs, and ""community"" VLANs. This enables separation of the packet traffic of different ports and assists in scalability to a larger number of ports in the network.The ITC casesShortly after the filing of the two District Court cases, on December 19, 2014, Cisco filed two complaints under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, with the United States International Trade Commission (""ITC"" or ""Commission""), requesting that the ITC institute conduct investigations into alleged infringement by Arista of the same patents as those at issue in the DCT-5343 case.On January 21, 2015, naming Arista as Respondent, the Commission voted to institute two investigations entitled:(1) In the Matter of Certain Network Devices, Related Software and Components Thereof (I), ITC Investigation No. 337-TA-944 (the ""944 Investigation""); and(2) In the Matter of Certain Network Devices, Related Software and Components Thereof (II), ITC Investigation No. 337-TA-945 (the ""945 Investigation"").The '944 Investigation commenced as a result of Cisco's allegations that Arista infringes certain claims of Cisco's Patent Nos. 7,200,145; 7,162,537; 8,356,296; 7,290,164; 7,340,597; and 6,741,592. The '945 Investigation commenced as a result of Cisco's allegations that Arista infringes certain claims of Cisco's Patent Nos. 7,023,853; 6,377,577; 7,460,492; 7,061,874; 7,224,668; and 8,051,211.Thus, Cisco decided to apply maximum pressure by initiating not one, but two separate ITC investigations spanning the same 12 patents as in the DCT-5343 case. Arista did attempt to consolidate them; arguing inefficiency with respect to public and private resources as well as making a point that Cisco is ""gaming the system."" The Administrative Law Judge, or ALJ, however, denied Arista's motion because consolidation ""would create an investigation of such large scope that it would be burdensome to complete the investigation within the previously set 16-month target date."" The ALJ was even skeptical that the 22-month target date suggested by Arista could be realized.The 944 and 945 Investigations will determine whether there is a violation of Section 337 in the importation into the United States, sale for importation, and/or sale within the United States after importation of Arista's networking products and related software including components by reason of infringement of certain claims of Cisco patents.As relief, Cisco seeks a permanent limited exclusion order barring from entry into the United States networking equipment and/or their components and software that directly and/or indirectly infringes the asserted patents. Cisco is also seeking a permanent cease and desist order prohibiting Arista from selling such products in the United States.The critical deadlines for the two ITC actions are as follows:ITC-944 schedule:ITC-945 schedule:General Information About ITC Investigations.The International Trade Commission (ITC) investigation under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 is the most frequently used administrative mechanism for enforcing U.S. intellectual property rights against imported items. The investigation is typically based on a complaint requesting an investigation and it is filed by a U.S. or a foreign company that qualifies for protection under Section 337. The Commission may also conduct Section 337 investigations on its own initiative.Unlike patent-infringement cases in federal District Courts, where the only parties are the patent-holder and the accused infringer, in an ITC action, there are three parties to every investigation - the complainant alleging a violation, the respondents who are accused of violating Section 337 and the ITC's investigative attorney (IA) who investigates on the Commission's behalf. The administrative law judge (ALJ) presides over the proceedings, hears the evidence, and may recommend action to the Commission by issuing an initial determination. The Commissioners conclude the investigation and report to Congress and the President of the United States.While Section 337, as a trade statute, was intended to provide broad relief against all forms of unfair practices in international trade (other than unfair dumping and subsidies), the majority of Section 337 investigations have focused on either patent, unregistered trademark, or trade secret claims. The ITC has become the go-to venue for patent holders seeking remedies such as general exclusion orders, limited exclusion orders, and cease and desist orders. It is a powerful remedy because if a company, which manufactures all of its products abroad, cannot import them into the U.S., then that effectively acts as an injunction against doing business in the U.S. The ITC has become particularly important for patent infringement cases between competitors since the Supreme Court's 2006 holder in eBay Inc. v. MercExchange LLC, which weakened a patent-holder's ability to obtain permanent injunctive relief in District Court actions.Some other important distinctions between Section 337 and District Court actions include: (1) complainant must demonstrate an actual or prospective ""domestic industry"" dedicated to the exploitation of IP rights; (2) all investigations must be completed within a short time frame (12-18 months); (3) the Commission can issue ""general"" exclusion orders barring importation of infringing products irrespective of their source; (4) the remedies are not monetary in nature and are limited to injunctive relief; (5) there are no counterclaims in Section 337 investigations, and if asserted, they may be removed to a U.S. district court; (6) the relief issued by the Commission is subject to a veto by the President of the United States.With respect to the Cisco cases against Arista, the two ITC investigations were initiated in parallel with the District Court actions. In such circumstances, known as ""dual-track litigation,"" Section 337 gives respondents, Arista, the right to stay the parallel litigation in the Northern District of California. That is precisely what Arista has done with respect to the DCT-5343 case, which was limited to patent infringement allegations of the 12 Cisco patents, which overlapped with the same patents in the two ITC investigations. The DCT-5344 case, however, is not stayed since it includes additional patents as well as copyright infringement claims related to Cisco's proprietary command-line interface.Arista Fights BackFacing such onslaught of infringement claims, Arista is not sitting back. Instead, it has gone on the offensive. Rather than being content to defend itself against Cisco's chosen venues (*the District Court and the ITC), Arista has attacked Cisco's patents in a third venue. To date, Arista has filed seven petitions for Inter Partes Review (IPR) with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board at the USPTO covering five out of twelve Cisco patents, in an attempt to eventually pick them off one by one. The case-numbers for these IPRs are listed below.IPR2015-00978 (7,340,597) filed April 1, 2015;IPR2015-00975 (8,051,211) filed April 1, 2015;IPR2015-00974 (7,224,668) filed April 1, 2015;IPR2015-00976 (7,023,853) filed April 10, 2015;IPR2015-00973 (6,377,577) filed April 10, 2015;IPR2015-01049 (6,377,577) filed April 16, 2015; andIPR2015-01050 (7,023,853) filed April 16, 2015.We discussed the nature and the technicalities of these petitions in our prior article, found here. As an example, we also present a timeline for those IPR petitions filed on April 1, 2015, which looks like this:Given that Arista and Cisco are now battling in three separate venues, with each venue operating under its own procedures and its own timeline, how will these respective proceeding affect each other. Importantly, in all three venues - the District Court, the ITC, and the USPTO - Arista will be challenging the validity of Cisco's patents. Therefore, what happens if one venue decides validity before the others?Based on the schedule above, it looks like the Final Written Decision in the USPTO will likely be issued well after the Initial Determinations in both ITC investigations. This exposes Arista to significant risk of having its entire product line stopped at the U.S. border and never reaching its customers before the patents can be invalidated at the USPTO. We anticipate, however, that if Arista is successful in getting some or all of its IPRs instituted by the USPTO, that it will try to argue to the ITC to either delay its final decision, or at least execution of any exclusionary order if entered, pending final decision in the USPTO. Both parties will be able to appeal any decision on the merits, whether in the ITC, District Court, or USPTO, to the same Court of Appeals for the Federal District Court. This complex situation is just beginning to unfold, and investors need to realize that absent settlement, these multiple tracks of legal proceedings could take years to develop. Accordingly, it will be critical for investors in Arista and Cisco to closely monitor the developments at the ITC, District Court and PTAB to better assess the risks associated with litigation events that may affect both companies going forward."
3769396,49101,2015-12-21T15:42:56-05:00,"ALJ's Initial Determination is due in January 2016.ITC will have 60 days to review the ID and issue an exclusion order.Arista has limited options, with the best option to redesign their products.","What happens after the ALJ issues his Initial Determination in the Cisco v. Arista ITC investigation?The US International Trade Commission (ITC) is growing popular among those IP owners who seek to exert maximum pressure on the infringing parties by blocking their products from the US market. This is precisely what Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) has done by filing two separate ITC complaints against Arista (NYSE:ANET) in addition to the district court actions. Those familiar with the ongoing and never ending Apple/Samsung legal battles may be aware of the advantages of ITC, including speed of the proceedings, ITC's broad jurisdiction, lack of jury trials, ITC general exclusion orders, and Customs enforcement of ITC remedial orders, among others.With respect to the speed of the proceedings, ITC is not just faster, but it is also much more certain. Once the notice that the ITC has instituted a Section 337 investigation in the US Federal Register is published, the ITC sets a target date, typically between 12 and 15 months, for its final determination. In more complicated cases, the target date may be 18 months after publication of the notice. The ALJ must typically render his initial determination three months before the ITC target date. This means that cases may get their ALJ decisions in as early as nine months, which is much faster than at a district court level.Courtesy of kirkland.comWe won't go into the intricacies of the entire ITC proceeding here and if any readers are interested, please contact us and we will arrange a conference call to discuss whatever questions you may have. Our team at Markman Advisors has litigated numerous cases in front of the ITC over the years, and we would be happy to share our extensive knowledge with investors.On to the Cisco v. Arista situation. We covered it in articles here and here. Since then, the ITC held two evidentiary hearings in the 337-TA-944 and 337-TA-945 cases in September and November of 2015, respectively. The first 944 Final Initial Determination is due by January 27, 2016, and the second 945 Final Initial Determination is due by April 26, 2016. But then what happens?After issuance of the Initial Determinations, the ITC will have 60 calendar days to review ALJ's Initial Determination of whether there is a violation of Sec. 337 of the Tariff Act by virtue of patent infringement. If the ITC determines that there has been a violation of Section 337, it will issue an exclusion order barring the entry of the infringing goods into the U.S. The ITC exclusion orders are enforced by the U.S. Customs Service at the border. That means an exclusion order in the 944 case could be issued by March 27, 2016, and in the 945 case by June 25, 2016.Thus, following the ITC's Final Determination, the exclusion process begins with the ITC transmitting a copy of the exclusion order to Customs, which develops highly detailed instructions regarding the technical scope of the order to field agents. ITC also would transmit Cease and Desist orders to the respondent (Arista) whose inventory of infringing articles is implicated by the order. The order will require the respondent (Arista) to submit an annual report to the Commission regarding the number and value of infringing goods in its domestic inventory.Can Arista appeal? How? When?Pursuant to Sec. 1295(a)(6) of Title 28 of the United States Code, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC) has jurisdiction over final actions by the ITC. Thus, following the ITC exclusion order, Arista would be able to file an appeal after the 60-day Presidential review period. The President can veto the exclusion order in some rare circumstances, but most likely would not do so in this case. During this period, Arista could still import the infringing good under bond. Typically Presidential vetoes are extremely rare, yet very recently, in 2013, President Obama did opt to veto the ban against the import of the iPhone 4 and some iPad models that infringed standards-essential patents owned by Samsung (OTC:SSNLF). Ironically, President Obama also declined to veto the ban against Samsung smartphones and tablets infringing certain Apple patents. Apple had home field advantage? Maybe. That's not the case here though.Arista could potentially file for a stay of the remedial order pending CAFC appeal, but that also is rarely granted.If the ITC did not issue an exclusion order, a notice of appeal can be filed immediately by any party adversely affected by the ITC's final determination. For example, Cisco would be able to appeal specific final determinations by the ITC - e.g., non-infringement, no invalidity, no domestic industry, etc. The appeal has to be filed within 60 days from when the ITC's decision becomes final.What else can Arista do?(1) ADVISORY OPINION - Any party also can request the ITC issue an advisory opinion on whether a respondent's new product would violate an existing ITC order. 19 C.F.R. § 210.79(a). Such a request cannot be a hypothetical situation. The request must demonstrate a compelling business need for the advice sought.(2) RESCISSION or MODIFICATION - The ITC (on its own or when petitioned) can revisit any order it issued and either modify or revoke that order under 19 C.F.R. § 210.76(a). For example, the respondent (Arista) could argue that the ITC should modify its limited exclusion and cease and desist orders because new evidence establishes that the facts on which they were based have substantially changed - e.g., products have changed or the way the products operate has changed - thus they are no longer in violation of Sec. 337. The Commission will conduct public hearings and permit the implicated parties the opportunity to be heard.The ITC also may use more formal enforcement proceedings under 210.75(b) to address the above issues. As a result of formal enforcement proceedings, ITC may modify a remedial order, revoke a remedial order, or file suit in US district court to recover civil penalties for breach of a remedial order. ITC also may order seizure and forfeiture to the US of any article imported in violation of an exclusion order.(3) CUSTOMS - Finally, a party importing an article subject to an ITC exclusion order can approach Customs by (1) requesting a ruling prior to important from Customs under 19 CFR 177 that the exclusion order does not apply; or (2) after importation attempt with Customs excluding the article, filing a protest under 19 CFR 174.So Arista will certainly have plenty of options with the most prudent option to redesign their infringing products, stamp some new model numbers on them and ask for an advisory opinion followed by revocation of the ban. That will take time, however, and will be very costly.Will Arista be able to overcome Cisco?Not according to the ITC's Staff attorneys. For purposes of this publication, we will limit our discussion only to the 944 investigation for now.As discussed above, the Initial Determination due by January 27, 2016, will address the infringement and validity of the following five patents:7,162,537 (Claims 1, 2, 8-11, 17-19)7,290,164 (Claims 1, 5, 6, 9, 18)7,340,597 (Claims 1, 14, 15, 29, 39, 63, 64, 71-73)6,741,592 (Claims 6, 7, 20, 21,)7,200,145 (Claims 5, 7, 45, 46)The staff, Mr. Beverina, is of the opinion that there is a violation of Sec. 337 in this investigation with respect to three out of five remaining patents (one was dropped), namely '537, '592 and '145 patents.The '537 patent relates to the operating system of a router and specifically to a method of managing a router's own configuration data. The Staff believes there is infringement of all asserted claims and that Arista will not be able to show invalidity.Infringing Products - Arista switches, including at least the 7010, 7048, 7050, 7050X, 7150, 7250X, 7280E, 7300, 7300X, and 7500E series models, and/or Arista EOS, including at least version 4.13.5F, perform the claimed method.The '597 patent relates to a method and apparatus for securing the communications device using a module that is coupled to the communications device. Arista devices do not detect a change in configuration, rather they detect a status - thus, no infringement. Staff believes that Arista is estopped from arguing invalidity because Dr. Cheriton's involvement in Arista gives rise to privity (assignor estoppel).The '164 patent relates to a mechanism of re-provisioning a network device in response to a device fault. The Staff believes there is no infringement because Arista devices do not perform ""re-provisioning,"" but instead use provisioning. Also, ""zero-touch provisioning"" performed by Arista devices is not in response to a device fault which is understood in the art as unplanned loss of conductivity.The '592 and '145 patents relate to private LANs. According to the Staff, all of the accused Arista devices practice the asserted claims of these patents and Arista will not be able to prove any of its equitable defenses.Accused products - The Arista switches, including at least the 7150, 7010, 7050, 7050X, 7250X, 7300 and 7300X models, and/or Arista EOS, including at least version 4.14.3F, include a switch comprising the claimed elements.Stay tuned for our updates on the IPR front…"
3632726,95616,2015-11-02T10:44:12-05:00,"ANET has been sued by CSCO on several accounts of patent/copyright infringement. A large portion of ANET executives and other employees came from CSCO when ANET was founded.The common consensus is that CSCO is only filing suit to dampen the growth of Arista. However, current events indicate that ANET may be culpable to more than perceived.CSCO is waging a dual-pronged attack against ANET through two fronts: The District Court to seek past damages, and the International Trade Commission to prevent future damages.","By Colin Brady, Sean Brady, Aakash Pai and Tyler SarnaInvestment ThesisWe believe that the general consensus is that Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) is a fast-growing tech firm that has all of the motivation it needs to excel and eventually take more market share. Despite this, they are still overvalued and there is a large risk looming overhead we believe the market is not giving proper consideration. ANET stands to lose a significant amount in the upcoming proceedings and, regardless of the outcome, a short position has the potential to be very profitable.Business DescriptionArista Networks, Inc. provides cloud network solutions to address the needs of large-scale Internet companies, cloud service providers, and high-performance computing environments. ANET operates in a highly competitive market characterized by rapidly changing technology, resulting in constant introductions of new products and services. Historically, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) has dominated the data center networking market, capturing a revenue market share of 69.3% in 2014, while ANET's revenue market share was 7.7%, according to Crehan Data Center Switch Market report. However, the competition for cloud networking is fierce and will continue to expand due to the high demands of customers. This demand led a number of CSCO employees to break off and found ANET. Consequently, current ANET employees are named inventors on CSCO's networking patents. Furthermore, ANET's founders, three Chief Executives, and seven Vice Presidents, and four out of seven members of ANET's Board of Directors were previously employed by CSCO prior to joining ANET.LitigationOn December 5, 2014, CSCO filed suit against ANET for the violation of fourteen individual patents. ANET is also being sued by OptumSoft, Inc. for ownership of confidential documents of the EOS network operating system. In 2014, ANET faced a lawsuit from Optumsoft founder (and ANET founder) David Cheriton, who, oddly enough, is also ANET's largest shareholder. Cheriton alleged that ANET was illegally using technology that had been licensed to them by Optumsoft. Furthermore, CSCO alleges that the infringing technology is used in the 7000 series of switches made by ANET. Based on this, CSCO is seeking damages for lost profits through the California District Court, and an import ban on these switches through the ITC. This series comprises the majority of ANET's product revenues and is equivalent to 90% of ANET's total revenue. Patent law indicates that if the ANET willfully infringed on CSCO's patents, then CSCO would be entitled to treble damages. It would be hard to argue that they did not know about the patents they were infringing, seeing that ANET employees were named inventors on two of them. CSCO accompanied this suit with a statement that they were filing this suit because they are obligated to do so to protect the interests of their shareholders and the innovations of their company.In response, ANET claimed that both CSCO and Optumsoft were jealous and that CSCO was a patent troll. This claim may be refuted by the evidence that, in the past thirteen years, CSCO has filed suit on a competitor, customer, or supplier less than five times. Based on the current situation, the suit should be resolved by mid-2016 in both the ITC and the federal court system.To go through all of the patents presented by CSCO and ANET, and to accurately quantify the potential outcomes, would prove to be an extensive and prolonged task. In this report, however, we will seek to only put bounds on the potential damages and examine their implications on the firm's future. The future of ANET depends largely on the aftermath of the upcoming legal proceedings. Below, we will specify three different outcomes based on the bounds of the legal costs. The 'bull case' represents a worst-case-scenario for ANET based on the current news surrounding both court and ITC proceedings. (This would be the best-case-scenario for our short position.) It would be the actualization of all of the potential damages that both CSCO and OptumSoft are seeking against ANET, the implications of an ITC ruling to bar ANET's imports if the ruling is in CSCO's favor, as well as the base costs for simply fighting back on all of these fronts. On the other hand, the 'bear case' represents the best-case-scenario for ANET, and the base case would represent the middle ground of these two extremes.Bull caseOther analysts seem to indicate that the only reason that CSCO is suing ANET is because CSCO is intimidated by ANET's recent surge in market share, and they are just trying to slow down the company that essentially broke off of them ten years ago is now a major player in their sector. This is entirely possible, but it is worth consideration that if ANET, either intentionally or unintentionally, infringed upon CSCO patents and/or copyrighted material, then CSCO management would be obligated to seek both legal intervention in ANET's use of CSCO's intellectual property as well as compensation for the resulting revenue gain. This scenario would also explain the events that have transpired thus far. In the US District Court, ""[CSCO] seeks… lost profits and/or reasonable royalty damages in an unspecified amount, including treble damages, attorney's fees, and associated costs"" (Link). All of the alleged patent infringements are concerning ANET's 7000-series of switches which make up ""substantially all of [CSCO's] product revenue.""In an attempt to quantify what ANET would stand to lose if the ruling is completely in CSCO's favor, we approximate that at least 80% of ANET's total revenues are covered by these patents. Additionally, the majority of the patents allow for the possibility of seeking damages on lost profits six years back. That, along with the possibility of trebled damages, has the potential to bring the relief to anywhere upwards of $3 billion. This is significant because ANET's current market cap is $4.4 billion. In addition to the battle going on in the courtroom, CSCO has also waged war through the ITC, desiring to bar from import any ANET products deemed an infringement on CSCO's patents and/or copyright. In 2014, approximately 78.19% (US Revenues/Total Revenues) of ANET's revenue was generated in the United States. As of September 9, 2015, the ITC has already released preliminary findings that at least three of the twelve patents that ANET has allegedly infringed upon are actionable. The ITC decision can still result in either side's favor, but it appears it is not as favorable to ANET as the common sentiment would seem to convey. Common sentiment appears to be based on the hope that the judge will overrule the preliminary findings; however, the judges often base their opinions off of the preliminary ruling.ANET's short interest has also drawn our attention. It is at 18% of float, which is notably high. Further investigation revealed that many of ANET's employees have recently been selling off their shares. In the last six months, insiders have sold 2,591,786 shares of ANET, and purchased none. Seeing as the 180-day lockup period expired December 3, 2014, this could be an indication of poor insider sentiment, and a lack of faith in the company. Still, there are several reasons why an employee might liquidate for other reasons.Moreover, within the industry, it seems it would be wise to draw a parallel to the recent trial between Juniper and Palo Alto. There is a key difference, however, which makes it less likely that the overall proceedings will simply result in a settlement. The fact that ANET directly ""copied entire sections of [CSCO's] copyrighted user manuals, complete with grammatical errors"" (Link) acts as a smoking gun. This is something that Palo Alto did not have to deal with. Although the copyright lawsuit concerning the manuals has been abandoned, it still does not help ANET's case. In the mind of a juror, (CSCO is indeed seeking a jury trial) if ANET was willing to infringe on CSCO's copyrighted material in order to avoid having to write their own manuals, it is not outlandish to think that ANET would use the same practice in other areas. To quote ANET's CEO, Jayshree Ullal, ""[A] Cisco CCIE expert would be able to use Arista right away, because we have a similar command line interface and operational look and feel. Where we don't have to invent, we don't.""Bear CaseHowever, ANET does not intend to sit back and watch its company get dismantled. ANET is a relatively young company with a strong track record. Their earnings consistently beat Wall Street predictions, and they continue to grow even with the lawsuit looming overhead. This would explain why the general consensus of analysts rate this stock ""BUY"". We believe that they are underestimating the inherent risks posed by a company embroiled in legal troubles and bad press. Even if CSCO is patent trolling (which CSCO indicates and even ANET's CEO and former CSCO exec, Jayshree Ullal, has admitted is by no means a common CSCO practice) it does not mean that CSCO will come out empty handed. This will make for a very difficult couple of years for ANET, seeing as a win for CSCO on even one of these patents could pose an enormous setback for ANET.As mentioned above, CSCO is also pursuing the case through the ITC, and three have been preliminarily ruled in favor of CSCO. In the worst case scenario, CSCO would win none of these. Based on preliminary rulings, this is unlikely. An import ban is something that must be taken very seriously. At worst, ANET will have millions of dollars poured into litigation expenses, and will have their time and resources drawn away from the focus of innovation and growth. In order to mitigate the possibility of this worst-case scenario, CSCO launched a dual pronged attack on the fronts of both future and past revenues.Based on the preliminary rulings, it is likely that CSCO will either win one of their patent suits at a minimum or force ANET will settle out of court. Either one of these scenarios has serious implications for ANET beyond the cash costs. ANET stock is very sensitive to the attention it receives in the press, and because of this, bad news often leads to falls in stock prices. ANET has seen dips in share price each time they encounter a legal setback in this case, such as when the ITC refused to consolidate the suits. Either a settlement or a finding in CSCO's favor would be reported widely in the industry news and would have extremely negative implications for ANET's stock price. Even outside of the conclusion to the legal dispute, the continued bad news in court will have negative implications for the stock price.Even if ANET proves to be mostly correct in the long term, the immediate effects of these combined factors will force down the stock price in the short term. When looking at the size difference between ANET and CSCO, it would be in ANET's best interests to end this quickly as to not prolong the trial duration, because CSCO's pockets are much deeper. The overall effect of the press, legal fees, possible damages and possible ITC import bans cannot simply be ignored.Base CaseHowever, in all likelihood, the final outcome can be expected to lie somewhere in between these two bounds. As both parties are keeping their legal strategies behind-closed-doors, (which is prudent for them both) it makes it difficult to accurately forecast who will be awarded what. But looking at the events that have already transpired and simply how easy it would have been for an ANET employee/executive to inadvertently infringe on one of CSCO's patents, we feel that results are likely to be weighted in favor of CSCO.ValuationBefore considering the potential effects of the suits in which ANET is involved, we wanted to use some preliminary valuation techniques and fundamental data points in order to determine the current value of the company with respect to its closest competitors.First off, looking at the P/E ratios in the above table, it is evident that ANET is relatively expensive compared to the listed competitors. This may not be very telling, however, considering the incredible revenue growth rates that ANET has been experiencing. In order to get a better picture of the fair value of the firm, we proceeded with the discounted cash flows (NYSE:DCF) method. Instead of estimating the cost of capital using CAPM, we decided to use the three-factor Fama-French Model, regressing daily premiums because of the short time period since ANET went public. We decided to use this model because of ANET's presumed sensitivity to size and growth premium. Using data available on French's website, we estimated that the required cost of equity is 16.9% and therefore a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (OTC:WACC) of 16.8%, due to being financed almost entirely by equity. In the data table below, we are able to compare the different fair values depending on the changes in the WACC or terminal perpetuity growth rate used in the DCF model.Here, the colors indicate value relative to ANET's current price; where green indicates undervalued and red indicates overvalued. The preliminary findings are that, at reasonable levels of WACC and perpetual growth, ANET is overvalued - even after their stock price has been adversely affected by news of the recent proceedings.When considering the monetary relief that ANET would potentially have to pay out to CSCO, the upper bound of $3B+ (our bull case), compared to ANET's market cap of $4.6B, would void all predictions and assumptions made in the DCF model. Also any rulings by the ITC in CSCO's favor would prove detrimental for future earnings. If this scenario were to come true, bankruptcy would be a likely outcome.For our bear case, a settlement would be much more probable and would give ANET an opportunity to recover. We expect the settlement to be a minimum of $500M. This calculation was made by assuming that CSCO would seek 20% of the sum of the trailing five years of gross profit. The implications of this type of settlement would further decrease the fair value estimate of the stock by $8.ConclusionConsidering the current state of the legislation against ANET: including the preliminary ITC rulings leaning in favor of CSCO, the ""smoking gun"" that has yet to come into play and the risk of trebled damages from the District court; we believe that the analysts are not fully accounting for the legal troubles of ANET. These troubles should have an overall negative impact on the company, and pressure the stock price downward, thus making a short position profitable."
3499966,49101,2015-09-11T08:15:00-04:00,Cisco's patent campaign against Arista is heating up.The 944 ITC investigation is leading the way.Arista's defenses to date have been unsuccessful and insufficient to resolve the disputes quickly.Cisco has the advantage with respect to the copyright infringement claims based on CAFC precedent.Possibility of an ITC exclusion order presents a significant risk to Arista's sales within the U.S.,"Cisco's (NASDAQ:CSCO) multi-front patent campaign against Arista Networks, Inc. (NYSE:ANET) is heating up and, unfortunately for Arista, the end is nowhere in sight. As we reported in our earlier article here, Cisco is pulling out all the stops by running two different District Court actions and two separate ITC investigations spanning fourteen (14) patents and scores of copyrights. Arista, in turn, is attempting to short-circuit the lawsuits by filing petitions for Inter Partes Reviews (IPRs) and early summary determination motions to invalidate the patents. However, ANET's responses to date are simply not sufficient to stop Cisco's patent locomotive.First, the filed IPRs only challenge five of the 14 patents. Second, the District Court 5344 case includes additional allegations of copyright infringement which is why that case, as opposed to the 5343 case, was not stayed. Third, Arista's early summary determination motions in the ITC proceedings related to Sec. 101 and assignor estoppel issues were all denied. As a result, a critical hearing in the 944 ITC investigation is starting September 9th, 2015, which could potentially result in an Initial Determination of violation of Sec. 337 leading to an exclusion order barring all Arista's infringing products from importation into the United States. To ignore this existential risk to Arista would be a mistake for any investor.Case StatusCisco brought two separate district court actions in the Northern District of California:(1) Cisco Systems, Inc. v. Arista Networks, Inc., 3:14-cv-5343 (December 5, 2014)The 5343 patent infringement case spanning 12 U.S. patents has been stayed as of February 10, 2015, pending the resolution of the ITC investigations.(2) Cisco Systems, Inc. v. Arista Networks, Inc., 3:14-cv-5344 (December 5, 2014)The 5344 case brings in two additional U.S. patents (7,953,886 and 7,047,526) and includes separate allegations of copyright infringement. Nothing has really happened in this case so far other than Arista moving to dismiss under FRCP 12(b)6, two portions of Cisco's First Amended Complaint - (1) allegations of pre-suit indirect patent infringement, and (2) allegations of post-complaint willful patent infringement. Because Cisco conceded that it is not seeking damages for pre-suit indirect infringement, the Court granted Arista's motion and gave Cisco leave to amend to clarify that the damages it seeks for indirect infringement are based only on conduct occurring after the initial complaint was filed.With respect to the allegations of post-suit willful patent infringement, Cisco asked the court to consider its willfulness allegations in view of Arista's public marketing of the new version of its EOS, called EOS+, right after the complaint was filed and despite having been put on notice of its infringing conduct. The Court held that the allegations summarizing Arista's puffery in sales and marketing materials is not enough and ordered Cisco to plead in more detail that Arista's conduct did more than continue selling the alleged infringing product. On July 23rd, 2015, Cisco filed its Second Amended Complaint, in which it provided additional factual support for its indirect infringement and willfulness allegations. Arista answered on August 10, 2015.After the parties complete their respective claim construction briefings, the Court will hold a Markman hearing following which Judge Freeman will issue her Markman ruling. Depending on how she interprets certain claim terms, the parties may move for summary judgment motions of infringement/non-infringement and/or invalidity to simplify the case for trial.Important dates from the Scheduling Order:The 5344 case is not just limited to patent infringement, however. Cisco also alleged copying of Cisco's technologies and copyrighted materials, including Cisco's operating system software (including its Internetwork Operating System (""IOS"", ""IOS XR"", and ""IOS XE"") and its Nexus Operating System (""NX-OS"")). Cisco also alleged copying of Cisco's operating system documentation into Arista's documentation. Furthermore, Cisco claims that Arista copied verbatim over 500 commands from the command line interface (""CLI"") which is a set of commands employed by a user in operating the products running the Cisco's OS. In its complaint, to show how flagrant the copying really was, Cisco quotes Arista's current President and CEO, Ms. Ullal saying: ""[A] Cisco CCIE expert would be able to use Arista right away, because we have a similar command-line interface and operational look and feel. Where we don't have to invent, we don't."" (Emphasis added.)Not surprisingly, the timing of these cases coincides with the Supreme Court's denial of Google's petition for a writ of certiorari in its case against Oracle. Why is that important? The widely reported ""$1 Billion"" Oracle v. Google case started out in August of 2010 in the Northern District of California with Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) suing Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) for patent and copyright infringement. That case dealt with copyrightability issues relating Oracle's Java API (Application Programming Interface) packages which are essentially sets of routines, protocols and tools for building Java software applications. On a high level, these packages inevitably encompass well-known commands and common function calls composed of verbs and nouns - the same type of commands at issue in the Cisco case.While Oracle's patents were tossed aside by the California jury as not infringed, the copyright infringement allegations resulted in a verdict of 37 Java API packages and a specific computer routine called ""rangeCheck"" being infringed by Google. The Court also granted Oracle's JMOL motion of infringement with respect to eight decompiled security files. Notably, the 37 API Packages at issue contained thousands of individual elements, including classes, subclasses, methods and interfaces.Easy win for Oracle, right? Not so fast. The California District Court swiftly followed the verdict by issuing its decision on copyrightability, finding that the blatantly copied elements of the 37 API packages - including the declaring code and the structure, sequence, and organization - were NOT subject to copyrightability. Oracle Am., Inc. v. Google Inc., 872 F. Supp. 2d 974 (N.D. Cal. 2012). Needless to say, Oracle appealed.The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the District Court's decision on copyrightability and concluded that ""the declaring code and the structure, sequence, and organization of the API packages are entitled to copyright protection."" The significance of this decision cannot be underestimated for Cisco's case against Anet. Google attempted to invoke the ""merger doctrine"" based on the theory that there was only one way to write (or express) the declaring code to achieve the same function, thus resulting in a merger of ""idea and expression"" which would effectively bar anyone from claiming exclusive copyright ownership of that expression.Yet, the Federal Circuit rejected Google's argument that it had only one way to write those API declarations. On the contrary, Google limited its own choice by intentionally choosing to be similar to Java - it could have created from scratch new APIs for its Android OS. The copyrightability issue doesn't depend on whether Google, the plagiarist, had choices, but on whether the creator of the original material had options. And in this case, Sun, original developer of Java, had ""a vast range of options"" when creating its original work. That's why Java APIs are creative and original and that's why they are protected.Furthermore, Google's argument that using short phrases in declaring code renders that code uncopyrightable was also rejected. ""The question is not whether a short phrase or series of short phrases can be extracted from the work, but whether the manner in which they are used or strung together exhibits creativity."" See Oracle CAFC Opinion. After all, any creative work can be broken up into small pieces that are not copyrightable on their own.Why is this Oracle case so important for Cisco? Simply put, it provides a very strong precedent from the Federal Circuit favoring Cisco's copyright allegations against Anet. Cisco's cases will also be appealed to the Federal Circuit by virtue of Cisco coupling its copyright allegations with patent-infringement allegations. Oracle used the same structure and instead of the Ninth Circuit (West Coast), it ended up in the Federal Circuit. One reason to avoid the Ninth Circuit is because of its well-established case law that functional requirements for compatibility between computer programs are not protected by copyright. See Sega Enters., Ltd., v. Accolade, Inc., 977 F.2d 1510, 1522 (9th Cir. 1992); see also Sony Computer Ent'mt, Inc. v. Connectix Corp., F.3d 596, 599-600 (9th Cir. 2000). Google of course cited those cases, and the Federal Circuit, of course, dismissed them as inapplicable: ""We disagree with Google's suggestion that Sony and Sega created an 'interoperability exception' to copyrightability.""Google friendly groups, e.g, EFF, are of course up in arms about the Federal Circuit decision and the Supreme Court's refusal to grant certiorari and believe it sets the wrong precedent threatening ""innovative developers."" The jury is literally still out on the Oracle case with the ""fair use"" defense remanded for a new trial which will also address damages.ITC InvestigationsAs we reported in our earlier article, Cisco also initiated two ITC actions against Arista:(1) ITC Investigation No. 337-TA-944 (the ""944 Investigation"");(2) ITC Investigation No. 337-TA-945 (the ""945 Investigation"").Cisco is using these ITC investigations to seek a permanent limited exclusion order barring from entry into the United States all of Arista's infringing networking equipment. In other words, these cases, if drawn to their ultimate conclusion, present an existential threat to Arista. For more information on the ITC proceedings, you can read our prior article covering this matter here.The earlier '944 Investigation is moving at a faster pace with the Hearing starting on September 9th and running through the 17th with the Final Initial Determination due by January 27, 2016. Arista tried to cut short the investigation by taking two shots at Cisco's patents, both missing the target. Cisco, in turn, attempted to neuter Arista's invalidity defenses prior to the Hearing, but also unsuccessfully.First, as is very popular these days following the Supreme Court's decision on Sec. 101 patentability in the Alice v. CLS Bank case, Arista moved for summary determination that the asserted claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,340,597 are invalid under 35 U.S.C. 101 because they are drawn to patent-ineligible subject matter. The implicit exception to Section 101 is that laws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas are not patentable. This exception is important because we don't want a patent to preempt the use of an abstract concept in all fields, thereby granting a monopoly over an abstract idea. However, ""extending this exception too far could 'eviscerate patent law,' inasmuch as 'all inventions … embody, use, reflect, rest upon, or apply laws of nature, natural phenomena or abstract ideas.'"" See ITC 101 Order. To balance these critical policies, the Supreme Court came up with a two-part test to determine whether the claims at issue are patentable, which have been applied for the most part in the context of computer patents. First, it must be determined whether the claims are directed to patent-ineligible concepts, and second, if so, considering the elements of each claim individually and in combination to determine whether there is ""something more"" to transform the nature of the claim into something other than just a claim to an age-old abstract concept applied on a computer. The second step is what's called ""a search for an inventive concept"" - an element or combination of elements that is sufficient to ensure that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the ineligible concept itself. The Administrative Law Judge (ALJ), David P. Shaw, denied the motion because there remains genuine issues of material fact as to what a person of ordinary skill in the art would consider the scope of the asserted claims to be, especially since the asserted claims have yet to be construed. Undoubtedly, this issue will be resolved at the Hearing.Second, Arista filed a motion for summary determination that Claims 6-9 of U.S. Patent No. 6,741,592 are indefinite and therefore invalid under 35 U.S.C. 112 because they recite a mixed method-apparatus claim. Arista cited the IPXL Holdings, LLC v. Amazon, Inc. case for the proposition that a claim reciting both an apparatus and a method of using that apparatus is indefinite because it ""is not sufficiently precise to provide competitors with an accurate determination of the meets and bounds of protection involved."" According to Arista, claim 6 requires a networking device - a switch - having various elements, and it also requires using the switch to perform various steps, including 'receiving,' 'transmitting' and 'exchanging' packets. Cisco countered by arguing that the challenged claims do not call for method step to be performed by a user, but are instead directed to an apparatus describing capabilities or configuration of the claimed inventions using functional language. Similar to the prior motion, the ALJ punted on this motion due to genuine issues of material fact as to whether or not a person of ordinary skill in the art would find the claims to be indefinite.For its part, Cisco filed a motion for summary determination that Arista should be precluded by the doctrine of assignor estoppel from invalidating U.S. Patent No. 7,340,597 that its founder, David Cheriton, invented and assigned while employed by Cisco. This is a very similar argument we've seen in a recent Palo Alto Networks case which proved to be successful for the plaintiff in that case, Juniper Networks. Here, however, the ALJ denied the motion, holding that Cisco has failed to show it is entitled to summary determination as a matter of law because there is conflicting evidence as to whether or not the relevant facts show that Dr. Cheriton is in privity with Arista for purposes of applying assignor estoppel. This issue, along with many others, will be resolved at the Hearing.With all the prehearing briefs submitted by August 13th, the parties are ready for the climactic Hearing in front of the ALJ starting September 9th and ending on September 17th of 2015. Since the ALJ decided to deny all of the pending dispositive motions, those same issues will be dealt with at the Hearing in addition to the customary issues of infringement and invalidity for the 6 asserted patents.The later '945 Investigation had its Claim Construction hearing on June 15-16 of 2015 with both parties submitting their respective bullet point summaries of claim construction positions as requested by the ALJ. The Hearing is scheduled for November 9-20, 2015 with the Initial Determination due by April 26, 2016.Inter Partes ReviewsThe following IPR petitions filed by Arista are currently pending in front of the PTAB:The first institution decision is expected in the first week of October.ConclusionAt Markman Advisors, we closely follow all of the developments of this case, and while the intricacies of a multi-forum patent litigation may be beyond the interest of the investors in both companies, at stake in those intricacies are Arista's business, whose products may be stopped at the U.S. border if an exclusion order is issued."
3305485,24063,2015-07-06T14:33:13-04:00,Insider selling not necessarily a negative sign.Hedge fund interest grew in latest filings but so has short interest.Valuation suggests price and value may not be aligned.,"By Andrew SebastianInsiders were heavy sellers of Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) in June. Insiders sold close to 185,000 shares in the month and previously sold about 258,000 shares in the last week of May. One insider - Ita Brennan, Arista's CFO, did acquire 100,000 shares of the company in non-open market transactions and did not sell any in the month. Brennan is new to Arista, being appointed CFO in just May of this year. Jayshree Ullal, the company's CEO, was responsible for most of the selling in the last week of May and in June as she sold close to 163,000 shares in June. It turns out that these sales are related to trusts set up for her children and other family members and not necessarily direct sales on her behalf. Therefore, the sales are not necessarily a cause for concern, but at first glance can appear worrisome.We scrutinize insider trading because studies show that certain insider purchases have outperformed the market by an average of 7 percentage points per year. While there are many reasons why an insider would sell as is the case with Arista's CEO, there is only one reason why an insider would buy. We also analyze hedge fund activity because following the small-cap stock picks of hedge funds can generate outsize returns. Our research shows that the 15 most popular small-cap stocks among hedge funds have outperformed the market by nearly a percentage point per month between 1999 and 2012. We have been forward testing the performance of these stock picks since the end of August 2012. These stocks managed to return more than 132% over the ensuing 2.5 years and outperformed the S&P 500 Index by nearly 80 percentage points (read the details here). Arista's market cap puts it in mid-cap territory, but it turns out that hedge funds are bullish on the stock according to their latest filings.Thirteen funds entered new positions in the shares of ANET and six funds raised their previous stakes. In sharp contrast, only three funds reduced their positions and the same number exited their stakes. Lone Pine Capital was ANET's top shareholder among hedge funds after it raised its position by 13% to 1.49 million shares with a value just over $105 million. Lone Pine by far had the largest interest in ANET as the second largest shareholder among funds was Marble Arch Investments with a new stake worth $17.6 million. Polar Capital had a $13.7 million stake after increasing it by 14%, and McKinley Capital had a new $12.9 million position. Special situations investor Joel Greenblatt had a $7.9 million stake through Gotham Asset Management after more than quintupling the fund's previous stake. Other funds with stakes in ANET included Marshall Wace, Oz Management and Citadel. Cadian Capital, Renaissance Technologies and Platinum Asset Management were the three funds dumping their positions, but their stakes were relatively small with the sum of all three under 360,000 shares. In a more negative sign, ANET's short interest has been on the rise since April, increasing from 4.5% to 8% currently. It is likely some hedge funds are on the short end of the trade. Moreover, the 8% short interest is significant as ANET's short interest was virtually zero just a year ago according to S&P Capital IQ.ANET has had a nice 2015 appreciating 35% year-to-date, but its valuation may suggest why the short interest has been on the rise. ANET's trailing and forward P/E ratios currently stand at 59.5 and 40.9, respectively. Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR), in comparison, trades at a forward P/E of 14.5. Juniper has not been profitable over the last 12 months as it recorded a little over $1 billion in charges mostly related to goodwill impairment and somewhat from restructuring. Juniper also trades at a P/FCF multiple of 16 while ANET trades at 77.4. Looking out even further, ANET's five-year PEG ratio is 1.7 and Juniper's is 1.35, so Juniper looks cheaper on this basis as well even though both companies are relatively expensive on this front as PEG ratios over one indicate.ANET is priced for perfection and the long holdings by hedge funds may have been more of a momentum play than strictly a value play. The creeping short interest also is an ominous sign and may indicate that hedge funds are turning on ANET on a net basis. The company has done a good job the past couple of years with superb returns on equity and capital, but the price may exceed the value in this instance. Investors should look for a better time to get in on Arista or invest in similar companies such as Juniper or Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), which offers a nice 3% dividend yield for the income-minded investor."
3416126,74905,2015-08-08T16:57:27-04:00,Arista Networks reported earnings on Thursday.The report showed strong revenue and earnings growth.Arista Networks is still a buy.,"IntroductionArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) reported earnings yesterday (Press Release, Conference Call, Investor Presentation), and the results confirmed my bullish stance on the stock. Numbers were strong, and guidance was equally strong. Although the stock has had a strong run for 2015, up 30% YTD, I think there is still plenty of room to grow and that the company is a buy here.Earnings HighlightsFinancially, investors will be hard pressed to complain about this quarter. Revenue growth came in at 41.8% year over year ((YoY)), and next quarter's guidance of between $208 and $212 million in revenue is healthy. Non-GAAP net income of $0.54 per share is a 54% increase year over year. Although the company didn't give specifics for next quarter's EPS, I made my own calculations given the revenue guidance and Q2's EPS as a percentage of revenue. This calculation gave me an EPS in the range of $0.54 and $0.56. Investors should also remember, when looking at these numbers, that the company has consistently given low guidance in the past and that these numbers will likely easily be surpassed.Comparing ANET's balance sheet and financial strength to companies with similar sales growth makes these numbers even more impressive, in my opinion. Unlike many of the popular aggressive growth companies in the market today, ANET is not sacrificing earnings for growth, nor is it taking on massive debt to finance growth. It has strong free cash flow and an impressive trailing twelve month return on equity of 24%. ANET is also beginning to build a significant cash position. On the 10Q, ANET reported $551.8 million in cash and marketable securities on the balance sheet- versus only $202 million in current liabilities and $325 million in long term liabilities. Arista Networks balance sheet shows a company that is creating long term, sustainable profitability.The release of the ""Cloudvision: Network Wide Cloud Automation"" subscription service was a big focus of management during the conference call. Management expects this new service to begin to generate meaningful subscription revenue by 2017. This is not the first subscription service that ANET has released, and management's attitude on the conference call gave me the impression that these subscriptions will be a big part of ANET's growth story going forward. In the last quarter, ANET derived only 10% of its revenue from services, around $21.4 million. Investors should anticipate that this number increases significantly in absolute dollars by 2017. Other notes investors may be interested in from the conference call include: Arista sold their 5 millionth networking port for the quarter, the company is averaging 1-2 new customers a day, and approximately 25% of their revenue was international.There are still some concerns with Arista networks. First, there are noticeable margin fluctuations from quarter to quarter. On the conference call, the new CFO stated investors should expect that this margin volatility continue as a result of the company's varying customer mix each quarter. Regardless, margins are still strong with this company and long term management does expect them to stabilize. Outside of margins, I think the biggest question investors are still asking themselves about ANET is how the lawsuits will affect the company's business. I do not want to go into too much detail regarding the ongoing lawsuits. As a refresher, ANET is currently facing three lawsuits- one with Optumsoft, and two with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). The CSCO lawsuits, one over patents and one over copyright infringement, are much more important to investors. They have been covered at length by myself and others and frankly there isn't much new to report. It was mentioned briefly in the Conference Call QandA Portion, and essentially ANET's lawyers laid out the schedule for the hearings (The ITC investigation will be running from Sept-Nov of this year, with the copyright case slated for August 2016) and stated that they are confident in their defensive strategy. Personally, I believe that ANET's long term business and my investment thesis will remain unaffected regardless of the outcome of these lawsuits.ConclusionsPerhaps because of the lawsuits, ANET is still the subject of a lot of bearish sentiment on wall street. Its most recently reported short interest was 15%, indicating a surprising amount of bearish sentiment considering the massive sales growth numbers and strong profitability of the company. I think that, despite its YTD return of 30%, ANET is still a great investment here. The long term market potential of ANET is huge, and I believe in the vision and leadership ability of management. Over the next 5-10 years, Arista Networks will continue to innovate and steal market share from Cisco, and shareholders with a long term outlook will reap the benefits"
3227056,86786,2015-06-02T12:28:55-04:00,The company's current situation makes it seemingly a poor investment choice.A deeper look shows strong financials and growth.The company's current negatives will be soon forgotten by the market.,"IntroductionAnyone signing up for my investment courses begins with my introduction on what makes the successful investor successful: Not following the herd. Thus, I often recommend stocks that seem to be undesirable, at least for the moment. This includes:Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) fits all criteria. Of course, I'm not recommending anyone be stupid and invest in such a stock just to be contrarian. There are several good reasons to invest in ANET. Here, I present my thesis.Company BackgroundArista Networks supplies Internet companies, cloud service providers, and forward-thinking tech companies with cloud networking software. Its clients range from universities to media asset management companies - these are companies that often already have cloud networking providers but have increasing performance requirements, thus making the switch to Arista. The company was founded in 2004, hit the 1,000-client mark in 2011, and completed its IPO in 2014.In our analysis of ANET as a stock, we primarily care about the post-IPO period. ANET's stock resembles a Seattle street; it looks more like a roller-coaster than a stock. The IPO began at $43 per share. Within four months of trading, it had its peak, $94.84. With comparatively little news exposure, ANET still managed to double its IPO price (in September 2014), a phenomenon driven mainly by fundamental analysts delving into the company's financials, not by news and sentiment. These analysts were comparing the stock price to the future sales estimates relative to other stocks in the industry (e.g., Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), which was trading at 20 times its 2015 projected sales numbers; ANET was trading at only four times its 2015 sales figures). The belief that ANET was grossly undervalued held, leading to the following stock price trend:ANET's IPO success was short-lived, and many analysts are still confused as to why. Despite consistently reporting good earnings and beating their projections, Wall Street didn't show ANET support. With the job market hurting the stock market in late 2014, the tide receded, bringing down all the ships, ANET included. In addition, ANET's mention of reneging on its IPO lockup (WSJ subscription required at link) promise worried many investors. So, in spite of nearly every analyst being bullish on the stock from a fundamental viewpoint, the company's investors began to sell. Three weeks later, positive earnings estimates hit the news, yet the stock continued its decline; it had already dropped 30%.Finally, in mid-February, things started to change. ANET, under the threat of a lawsuit filed by Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) (ANET was formed by ex-Cisco employees), began firing back, justifying its company's uniqueness of intellectual property. Later in the month, its Q4 earnings came out, completely smashing estimates. Finally, things have been looking up. Investors are finally beginning to respond to ANET's strong financials, weighting the fundamentals more heavily than the drama (CSCO lawsuit and a steady rotation of CFOs - a new one just came in this May - probably due to an insufferable CEO - I'll get back to this later).In summary, in the history of ANET, the problems lie in three places: weak investor reactions to strong financial reports, constant harassment from CSCO, and possible management problems (a CFO shouldn't leave a company after only one year - and when four do it, you know there must be some problem with the management). But this article's thesis is bullish on ANET because I believe that the company's current problems are fixable. This is where the opportunity for the contrarian investor lies. But a contrarian investor should consider industry before stock, especially when the company itself seems to be having problems (possibly it's just a commonality of the industry), so let's take a look at the diversified computer industry systems.The Diversified Computer IndustryThe diversified computer industry is highly unbalanced. Of those listed by Yahoo, we find one huge player, one big play, three mid-sized players, and a clear laggard. ANET falls in the mid-sized player category, and its revenue pales in comparison to the leader, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) ($584.1 M ttm vs. $110.1 B ttm). With few realistic options and a need for reliability, clients choose the company they can trust the most. Moreover, the industry leader typically can offer better prices, better service, and better installation/management consultants. But the downside to being big in a tech industry is that you move slowly. The big boys simply aren't as innovative as the smaller, faster-moving, younger companies. In addition, novel technology frees these companies from having to compete on price - instead they can compete on speed, innovation, customization, and so on. When you're looking for a cloud computing provider, you probably have a solution in mind and aren't so sensitive to the price of that solution - especially when your choices are limited.The industry is also a growing one. As Seeking Alpha contributor Joseph Cafariello pointed out, the industry is expected to significantly outperform in 2015 and beyond. Currently, the average five-year growth rate for the five biggest companies in this industry (ANET included) is 20%. Several client types have spurred this type of growth. There are the social media companies who are seeing their data storage requirements grow exponentially (ANET client example: StumbleUpon and Mixi - previously the largest social networking sites in Japan). There are financial organizations that require fast data storage for low-latency trading (ANET client example: the Chicago Board Options Exchange). Then there are the research companies who use cloud services to reliably store and retrieve vast amounts of data (ANET client example: Laboratory of Molecular Biology and the Atomic Weapons Establishment). These are companies that are doing their due-diligence of comparing cloud computing services, without much emphasis on price - speed, yes; energy savings, yes; but overall price of setup, unlikely to be a defining factor. And the fact that ANET's clients are big names worldwide, especially in countries where brand recognition is a defining purchasing decision, shows that more technical evaluations went into the client selection process.To shed more light on this industry's growth, it's worth taking a look at the 2014 Survey of the Future of Cloud Computing. A few interesting results: Half of the respondents have or are planning to run their businesses from the cloud, making cloud networking software a must-have. Two-thirds of the respondents will at least be storing their data in the cloud. These results stem from the low cost of cloud networking, the ease of scalability, and the ability to adapt more easily to increased workloads.These factors give the industry a positive outlook for the near and far-future (unless some sort of disruptive technology comes along). The numbers alone show that this industry is set for long-term gains. The pie is getting bigger, and ANET undoubtedly is looking to cut a larger slice.Why Invest in ANET?Okay, so we've established that ANET has problems, that it's suitable as a competitor in its industry, and that the industry itself is a good investment. Now we need to ask ourselves why ANET? Why not HPQ or a mid-sized ANET alternative?First, despite ANET's drama with CSCO and its management team (another CFO change occurred this month), the fundamentals of the business remain resilient. With a 125% year-over-year growth in deferred revenue, it will not remain invisible to growth investors for long. ANET's growth is faster than that of the market, both in revenue and in customers, making it perhaps the most attractive stock to fundamental investors already considering gaining some exposure to this industry.Second, let's not talk about the stock but the software itself. I'm not a huge tech guy, but the numbers speak for themselves. To have beaten CSCO in market share means that they have a hot product on their hand - and it's in B2B transactions where the technical benefits behind the product/service matter most (as opposed to emotional or status sentiments that drive B2C transactions):Okay, so ANET has good revenue growth, customer growth, and a killer product. What about margins? Q2 GMs were at 65.77%, higher than the market average. So too were the OMs at 21.6%, significantly higher than the industry average of 6%. With margins like these, ANET can increase its net profits merely by contributing more of its revenue to customer acquisition.In short, my recommendation of ANET lies in its superiority within its market: superior growth, superior product, and superior margins.A Contrarian InvestmentNevertheless, ANET is a contrarian investment. And this is possibly why ANET doesn't react well to good financials. Despite the good company status as outlined above, ANET has a few obstacles keeping it from being an attractive investment.First, the stock is at a relative high. It's also overvalued as per several financial ratios. Its P/E is 53.6, compared to the industry average of 16.8. These two items alone imply that now might not be the best time to invest; ANET might be overvalued.But realize that ANET is not at an all-time high. In fact, it's at a considerable discount compared to its all-time high, which came at a time when the company was not nearly as strong as it is now. If ANET continues its uptrend, we will look back at today and see ANET as undervalued.Second, insider selling at high levels is likely to make investor confidence waver. Many of the insiders - including the CEO - are cashing out, and investors are asking why.But realize that much of this selling is a result of the end of the lockup period of the IPO. The lockup expired as we entered 2015. You can interpret this selling in two ways. The average investor would likely interpret it as a lack of confidence in the company's management; that management is selling because it sees gloomy prospects. But a more logical explanation is that the selloff is due to having so much invested in a single company. After all, if you had the majority of your wealth locked up in a single company, wouldn't you want to liquidate some of it and diversify?Finally, the CEO seems more focused on the technology of the company than its profitability and investment value. In a recent conference call with investors, the CEO fielded questions about the company's future. To summarize the entire call in one sentence: This CEO is not a businessperson but a techie. The reason for the constant changing of CFOs might have to do with the CEO's ignorance of how to run a public company for the sake of its investors.But this phenomenon cannot possibly hold. Too many people have vested interests in this company to let it be ruined by an ignorant CEO. Either the CEO will come around to putting on his businessperson cap or he will be voted out and replaced with someone who can get investors excited in the company - not just the products.If you agree with these facts, we are looking at a strong contrarian investment: buy high, sell higher.My PredictionBased on how the company has been going so far, I am considerably bullish on this stock. I believe ANET will continue to gain market share and that its stock price will slowly rise, causing the EPS to naturally outpace the stock price as demand for the company's services accelerate. Though I do not believe ANET will hit its all-time high of $95 within 2015, I do believe it will easily hit $80 by the year's end. Other bullish analysis are giving ANET price targets in the $90 to $95 range, but I believe these price targets to be a bit too generous until the CEO makes some changes with how he relates to his investors.For the sake of objectivity, I've run a linear regression model on the important financials of ANET to get a prediction for the end of the year. I've included the TTM in the regression model to make the model more conservative. Here are the results:Should I be correct in my price target, and you invest now, you would reap over 14% in this investment. Remember that I'm giving one of the more conservative bullish price targets; others are predicting gains of over 35%.ConclusionANET's quick rise after its IPO and equally quick fall has put it in an awkward place. The stock seems to be uncorrelated with positive earnings reports, though the rise in the past couple weeks after the May 14th earnings report might imply that the company's stock is finally getting on track with its financials. The market is a Markov chain; it has no memory. Thus, we should be optimistic going forward; eyes from the future would look back at this point as insignificant: ""the stock price wasn't too high, and insider selling didn't matter in the end."" With a stronger CEO and a stable CFO, ANET can really blast forward. But even now, it already has the financials and outlook to make it a great addition to your portfolio, whether you're a contrarian investor or not."
2986126,74905,2015-03-10T16:04:29-04:00,"Arista Networks has been a volatile and unpredictable stock over the short term.The long-term market opportunity, coupled with an innovative product and strong management, makes ANET an interesting growth story.I recommend buying shares of ANET and holding long term.","IntroductionSince its IPO in 2014, Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) has been an extremely volatile stock. Negative news items such as the expiration of the post-IPO lockup and the Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) lawsuits accusing ANET of stealing patents and code, coupled with positives such as the IPO itself and continuous revenue and earnings beats, have kept the price of ANET fluid and unpredictable. While this volatility can be unsettling for an investor, the company itself should give investors faith in the stock. The volatility is a reflection of Arista's status as a disruptive high growth company with an innovative product offering. Despite a high-risk profile, ANET is leading the way in a new phase of networking development, cloud computing and SDN (software-defined networking). With disruptive products, a management team with the vision to lead the company, and strong financials, ANET is poised to give investors willing to hold through short-term volatility big gains over the long term.Disruptive TechnologyArista Networks is a computer networking company that specializes in providing cloud-based networking solutions to its customers. They sell a number of network switches, but what makes the company innovative is the network design and their EOS software. They are most famous for their leaf-spine network design and trademarked ""Spline"" network design (Link 1, Link 2 explaining the design). This designs allow for networks to handle more East-West traffic, a shift in traffic patterns that has come with cloud computing. It also helps minimize the cost of connectivity for customers. Their Extensible Operating System (EOS) comes with all network routers. The Linux-based system is fully programmable to each customer, allowing for an amazing degree of customization. While Arista does offer EOS consulting services for customers to help build and operate software-driven cloud networks, its software comes with pre-installed apps and can be utilized directly by the customer with little to no oversight from Arista Networks. When you compare this to traditional networking companies, such as Cisco, it is easy to understand why ANET can be so disruptive in the space. For more information on how the company has successfully implemented scalable cloud-based networking solutions to customers, I encourage all investors to read some of the case studies on the Arista website. The network design and operating systems utilized by Arista Networks have allowed it to become an emerging leader in a new wave of networking development-cloud computing and software defined networking, or SDN. It's worth noting that ANET has extensive partnerships with the other major companies in the cloud networking space, such as Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), which provide security and firewall integration for ANET projects.Strong ManagementThe management team at Arista Networks has a clear vision with the experience and knowledge in the industry to succeed. The CEO, Ms. Jayshree Ullal, was a key player at Cisco before moving to Arista Networks, rising to the position of Senior Vice President. Ms. Ullal has the type of confidence and vision investors should look for when trying to find a promising growth company. Her blog post regarding ""Pioneers vs. Protectors"" summarizes her vision of Arista Networks leading the third phase of network innovation, and she's not afraid to challenge the ""protectors"" in the industry. Similar to the way that Under Armor's (NYSE:UA) CEO openly challenges his competitors, Ms. Ullal and the rest of the management team are not afraid to take on Cisco. They believe that their product is disruptive, and they see themselves taking considerable market share from Cisco in the next 5-10 years. In their 2014 highlights, management shows how much market share they are stealing from Cisco, and they are consistently heard in interviews and press releases comparing themselves to Cisco.Beyond Ms. Ullal, the company includes its founder as chairman and Chief Development Officer Mr. Andy Bechtolsheim. Mr. Bechtolsheim founded Arista Networks in 2004 after working with Cisco for seven years and serving in a high level role there. Mr. Bechtolsheim is well known for his August 1998 investment in Google, and his investment in Google provided his Arista Networks project with necessary capital to develop its EOS. Mr. Bechtolsheim's vision when founding Arista Networks was to create a better networking solution than that of Cisco's and that was always in mind while developing EOS. The fact that he's still an active member of the company should give investors confidence that Arista will continue to innovate and grow well into the future. Mr. Bechtolsheim, along with Ms. Ullal and other members of the board, continue to own a considerable interest in the company. Combined with the CFO, the three major executives own about 31% of the total shares of ANET (data taken from ETRADE). Their high level of ownership and continued involvement in the company post IPO show that they have a high level of commitment to seeing that the company continues to execute on its vision.FinancialsThe financials of ANET indicate the company is executing on its plans. In Q4, ANET reported a 51% increase in revenue YoY. They also beat earnings estimates by $0.15 with an EPS of $0.53, representing growth over 100%. Gross margins for the quarter were 67.4%, although management has indicated that long-term margins will be closer to 60%. Next quarter's estimates were above expectations, and ANET management is known to low-ball their forward-looking projections. Full-year revenue also looked strong, coming in at 584.1 for an increase of 61% YoY. Although they did not forecast for the full-year of 2015, in their FY 2014 review referenced above, they forecasted increasing their serviced market 20%, from $6.9 billion to $8.3 billion. This would actually be a larger increase in market share than what they produced in 2014 (from $5.9 Bn to $ 6.9 BN), so I believe it is safe to project another year of 50-60% revenue growth. It is clear that ANET is delivering both revenue and earnings growth that demands a premium valuation, and they are poised to continue doing so well into the future. The balance sheet at ANET is strong as well. According to Yahoo Finance, ANET is returning 27.42% on equity, showing that they are making good use of their invested capital and another vote of confidence for management. They have a decent cash position, with little debt, and their free cash flow is strong and growing.Red FlagsThe main red flags against ANET that the street is focusing on right now revolve around the Cisco lawsuits. I wrote an article summarizing this situation, which can be found here. To summarize, it has not made a material impact on the company, and management does not expect it to make an impact in the future. They addressed the issue on the recent conference call as well, easing analyst concerns that the lawsuit could affect their business relationship with their customers. Management is adamant that has not been the case. I personally do not think that Cisco's legal case holds much water, but it could become a huge drag on ANET if the legal system sides with Cisco, especially if it affects the patent portfolio of ANET.In my opinion, the lawsuit that ANET shareholders should really be concerned with is the one between ANET and their former co-founder's company, Optumsoft. Mr. David Cheriton founded Optumsoft after leaving ANET prior to the IPO in 2014 and sued the company over intellectual property. Ironically, Mr. Cheriton still owns a substantial stake of ANET. However, if Optumsoft wins the lawsuit, it could force ANET to abandon its EOS software and cause a huge setback in the company and the stock. Again, this seems to be an unlikely outcome, but something that investors need to be cognizant of.Valuation of the stock could be seen as a serious concern with the company. With a forward PE of 31.72 and PS of 7.67, traditional value metrics make ANET look expensive. However, this is a high growth company with a disruptive product, and I don't think that these metrics tell the whole story. If we look at the company's projected total addressable market and serviced addressable market, given in the above referenced 2014 highlights, it's easy to see why the company can demand this valuation. The company projects to have captured approximately $13 billion in market share by 2019. With a current market cap of only $4.39 billion, it is plausible that if the company can execute on its long-term goals it will be able to support a valuation around $12bn. Thus, if you believe management can hit its long-term goals then it is likely the company will outperform the market significantly in the next five years. Perhaps this is why the five-year PEG of 1.39 makes the valuation sound a little more reasonable. Furthermore, if we dive deeper into the stock history, an argument could even be made that the stock is currently oversold. The short interest in mid February was reported at 15.10%. The rising short interest could cause a short squeeze next earnings report. Also, more concern has come up due to small sales by insiders of stock. The insider transactions were marginal when compared to total insider stake in the company, but the stock price has seen a selloff this week anyways.Another real concern for the company is new startups coming into the space and poaching talent from ANET. There's a huge precedence for this in the industry, and in fact this is essentially exactly what ANET did to Cisco. Two functional Vice Presidents left the company pre-IPO in 2014, and Ms. Ullal stated in the Q3 conference call that she expects at least one to reappear in the industry with a new project (she expects the other to retire). For now, I believe that the culture, success and innovation of Arista Networks is attractive enough to help the company retain its top talent. However, if we start to see this happen it could be a sign that the company is losing its innovative edge.The last red flag that many analysts have pointed to is that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) makes up a disproportionate amount of revenue for the company. The largest customer of Arista Networks makes up about 10% of its quarterly revenue. However, we have seen that number drop each quarter, as ANET adds new customers at a rapid pace. With now over 3,000 customers at the end of FY 14, I believe ANET's dependence on Microsoft is marginal and decreasing rapidly.ConclusionsThough it commands a premium valuation and has been volatile, investors should not be afraid to buy Arista Networks. The company is a disruptive leader in the networking industry. They already have major customers in Microsoft, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Yahoo (YHOO), among others. Management is talented, experienced and dedicated to taking on and beating Cisco at their own game. The financial situation of the company looks strong, and ANET should continue to deliver phenomenal growth numbers well into the future. I'm initiating a long position in ANET and will use the volatility of the stock to add to my position on dips. I believe that ANET is a company that investors can add to their portfolio and hold for the next 5-10 years while seeing great returns. Considering the risks in the company, many investors may feel they should pass on this company. While I think it is a mistake, the company should at least be one for investors to follow, as their war against Cisco will continue to bring intrigue to this story. I will continue to submit articles to Seeking Alpha covering the ANET story and earnings releases, updating my investment thesis as needed."
3051386,74905,2015-04-05T16:06:56-04:00,"Arista Networks' CFO announced she would step down, and the stock dropped 5%.Despite losing the CFO, I believe my long-term thesis is still intact.Investors should continue to use the volatility of the stock to add to their position.","The NewsArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) announced that their CFO, Kelyn Brannon, is leaving the company for ""personal reasons."" Ms. Brannon has been with the company since 2013. Co-Founder Andy Bechtolsheim will serve as interim CFO while the company searches for a replacement. ANET is down almost 5% on the news today, and as a shareholder, it is important to review this and other recent developments to see how it affects my investment thesis.Market ReactionI believe that Ms. Brannon stepping down was an expected move, and I don't think it will have any long-term effect on Arista Networks' business. Ms. Brannon has only been with the company since 2013, and looking through her LinkedIn profile, her departure from Arista Networks is consistent with her previous career moves. She has a history of working with companies on a relatively short-term basis to help them through financially irregular situations- Mergers, VC funding rounds, etc.Considering the timing of her hire & departure with ANET, I believe Ms. Brannon was brought on specifically to help the company get prepared for & successfully execute their IPO. With the IPO over, and the lockup period expired, it was time for Ms. Brannon to move on to her next challenge. As long as the replacement CFO is competent, investors shouldn't be concerned with this move. Personally, I am confident in this management team as long as Mr. Bechtolsheim & Ms. Ullal stay involved in the company.Given the volatility of the stock since its IPO, it is not surprising to see a dip on news like this. In fact, I was expecting a larger downward move when I read the initial press report. The 5% dip in reaction to the news is a decent buying opportunity for long-term investors looking to add to or initiate a position in ANET. With that being said, it is likely the volatility of ANET will continue as long as the pending lawsuits cast uncertainty on the company's future. Investors should expect ANET to continue to have big swings in daily trading, and more bad news could give a better opportunity for investors to enter ANET.In Other News There have been a few other developments with ANET since I published my investment thesis, which I would like to touch on. Last week, a huge insider transaction sent the stock down 3%. The sale came from David Cheriton, a co-founder of ANET whose tenuous situation with Arista Networks I mentioned in my original thesis. To summarize, Mr. Cheriton left Arista Networks to start Optumsoft. Optumsoft is now suing Arista Networks, although Mr. Cheriton still owns over 10 million shares of ANET (including the recent sale). Considering the legal situation between Optumsoft and ANET, any sale of ANET by Mr. Cheriton shouldn't be particularly surprising to investors. The link above also mentions some other developments at Arista Networks. First, it mentions the possibility of EMC (EMC) making a play to buy ANET. Personally, I doubt this is likely. Arista Networks has an extremely huge level of insider ownership, and I believe the insiders are committed to continuing ANET's success as its own company. The other announcement was of Juniper (NYSE:JNPR) launching a line of leaf-spine network architecture to compete with ANET. I don't think investors should be concerned with this development, because the software that ANET uses on the network architecture are what really sets the company apart from its competition.A positive development recently announced at ANET is the implementation of a subscription-based model for customers. This change should help improve the affordability of the ANET EOS to end customers, and will only serve to increase ANET's customer base and revenue streams. It also speaks to the ability of ANET to continue leading innovation and evolution in the industry. ANET also announced earlier in the week that they will be partnering with Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI).ConclusionThere is a lot going on with Arista Networks, and I expect management to touch on most of these developments during the next conference call. After analyzing the conference call, I will submit another write-up covering the current quarter's results and update my thesis as needed. For now, I am still confident in ANET's long-term prospects, and recommend long-term investors continue to take advantage of the stock's volatility to build a position in the company."
2939846,47691,2015-02-23T06:48:45-05:00,,"By Carly ForsterShares of Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) jumped 5% in after-hours trading on Thursday, February 19th after the company beat analysts' expectations for the fourth quarter of 2014 and forecasted higher revenue for the current quarter.Highlights from the report include GAAP earnings of $0.43 per share, exceeding analysts' estimates of $0.32 and increasing 87% year-over-year. The company also beat analysts' revenue consensus of $166.77 million, posting a total of $173.51 million in revenue and marking a 51% increase from the same quarter a year prior. Revenue for the full fiscal year of 2014 came in at $584.1 million, representing a 61.7% year-over-year increase.Jayshree Ullal, Arista President and CEO stated, ""We are pleased with our annual revenue growth in 2014 of 61.7% over 2013, with broad customer momentum across our key verticals…Our pioneering innovations in EOS+, in combination with our flagship 7000 series spine and spline models have made cloud networking transition a reality.""Arista Networks has forecasted revenue for the first quarter of 2015 to range between $164-172 million, while analysts expect $165.95 million. Analysts also expect the company to post earnings of $34 per share.Arista Network's stellar fourth quarter came as a surprise to analysts and investors alike who believed the company's legal expenses from its lawsuit with Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO) would take a toll on its profits. In December 2014, Cisco Systems announced plans to file two lawsuits against Arista Networks for copyright infringement and violating 14 patents. Cisco claimed that Arista even egregiously plagiarized user manuals, down to the last grammatical error.A handful of analysts' weighed in on Arista Networks on February 19th following the company's Q4 results with ratings all across the board.Credit Suisse analyst Kulbinder Garcha reiterated an Outperform rating on Arista Networks with a $90 price target, highlighting the company's growth opportunity potential ""in the IT Hardware and Networking landscape."" In addition, the analyst listed three reasons Arista has a competitive edge: ""(1) it allows the company to ride the commodity curve and Moore's Law; (2) it provides customers the agility needed for today's networking environments; and (3) it makes the TCO price competitive by enabling not only lower capex but opex as well."" Garcha concluded, ""These factors should drive share gains, which are supported by Arista's strong and broadening customer traction …""Overall, Kulbinder Garcha has a 50% success rate recommending stocks and a +8.5% average return per recommendation.On the other hand, Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski reiterated a Neutral rating on Arista Networks, but raised her price target from $69 to $75. She noted, ""Given record short interest heading into the print (7% of shares short), we are not surprised by the sharp move higher, though we remain Neutral due to the valuation and risks.""Simona Jankowski has an overall success rate of 63% recommending stocks and a +13.8% average return per recommendation.Similarly, Raymond James analyst Simon Leopold reiterated a Market Perform rating on Arista Networks but did not issue a price target. He noted, """"We suspect sentiment had turned more cautious ahead of the report with worry fueled by Cisco's lawsuit and white box competition, neither of which seems to be affecting sales. With higher estimates and a pull back from the highs, we see the shares fairly valued with a 2016 PEG of 1.9x.""Overall, Simon Leopold has a 67% success rate recommending stocks and a +9.4% average return per recommendation.On average, the top analysts' consensus for Arista Networks on TipRanks is Hold."
2826826,74905,2015-01-17T12:39:48-05:00,Lawsuits filed by Cisco against Arista Networks in December have helped depress shares of Arista Networks.The lawsuits seem to be stalling tactics as Cisco knows it is losing market share to Arista.This litigation proves that Arista is indeed a disruptive business.,"IntroductionA recent, well-written article was published on Seeking Alpha that goes into great detail regarding the bull case for Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET). I agree with the article, and believe that ANET is a disruptive business that represents a tremendous growth opportunity for investors as it is poised to steal market share from Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) going forward. Indeed, Cisco has become so threatened by Arista's growth that it has filed a series of lawsuits claiming copyright infringement. Investors can view these lawsuits at the following links: Link 1, Link 2, Link 3, and Link 4. These lawsuits have driven the price of ANET down over the last month and given investors a good buying opportunity. The above article mentions that these lawsuits are frivolous and unlikely to stop Arista Networks, however some in the comments section seem unconvinced that this will be the case. I would like to expound on the nature of these lawsuits and help demonstrate to investors why they are not only unlikely to hurt Arista Networks, but that they actually show that Cisco is scared of its newest competitor.The Claims Leveled by CiscoThe major claim by Cisco in the lawsuits seem to be that Arista stole approximately 500 lines of programming and integrated it directly into their software for their command-line interface. There are a few problems with this claim. The first issue I have with this is the timing of the claim. ANET CEO Jayshee Ullal is on record as early as February 2013 as admitting to this. In an interview with Network World during that time, Ms. Ullal makes the following statement regarding Arista's software:""The training is very easy and a Cisco CCIE expert would be able to use Arista right away, because we have similar command-line interfaces and operational look and feel. Where we don't have to invent, we don't. Where we had to invent for these specific use cases we do, so most often it's a use case or a project.""Considering that this statement was published in February 2013, why didn't Cisco take legal action then? It essentially states the exact claims that Cisco is now leveling against Arista. I believe it is because Arista has now proven it is a true threat to Cisco. Arista has created innovative enterprise software that is not only stealing market share from Cisco, but also stealing some of Cisco's best employees - according to this statement this is intentional.Ms. Ullal also made a statement regarding these accusations at the Barclays Global Tech Conference, essentially stating that the CLI in question had been in use before Cisco in many programs and has been used by many other programs since Cisco started using it. If this is the case, then even if this lawsuit does end up being argued in court, it sounds to me like Arista has some legal ground to stand on, either arguing that the work borrowed was minimal (De Minimus) or arguing that work borrowed falls under fair use.In the same Barclays Global Tech Conference statement, Ms. Ullal also addressed the other aspects of the legal battle. First, she admitted that some of the manuals were copied from Cisco, stating that it was less than 1% of the manual and that it was a mistake that the company would address in the coming week. Second, she stated that the patent portfolio of Cisco, which numbers over 13,000, makes it hard for Arista to currently know exactly which 14 patents Cisco is accusing Arista of stealing. This was clearly more of a deflection than an argument against the lawsuit, and the patent stealing aspect of the accusations will probably see more clarity come to light in the coming months.How Investors Should ReactCommentators are drawing parallels between these lawsuits and many historical examples of large companies trying to stop small competitors with similar lawsuits. Most interestingly Arista Chairman Dan Scheinman points toward the string of lawsuits that Cisco faced in the 90s when it was gaining market share; lawsuits from IBM, Lucent, and Nortel that were strikingly similar to the current lawsuits Cisco itself is leveling against Arista. Like most of the historical legal cases, Cisco's lawsuits will likely take years to resolve, and seem to clearly be stalling tactics from Cisco to slow the innovation and disruption from Arista. This has become an emotional, personal battle for both companies, as all the major players have strong ties to both sides. As such, it is even more likely to take a long time to play out and bring a lot of drama to light with it. Already, we have seen both sides make veiled insults at each other, such as Ms. Ullal's recent blog post insinuating that Cisco has become a ""protector"" fighting off ""Pioneers"" such as Arista in the third phase of network innovation.Based on historical examples and the information above, investors should expect a protracted and emotional legal battle, which will likely end without any serious damage to Arista's business. More importantly, investors should view these lawsuits as validation that Arista is a disruptor. Cisco is scared of Arista. They are scared that Arista is taking market share, taking their best workers and taking their reputation as leaders and innovators in the sector. These lawsuits validate the bull thesis for investors to buy ANET and take the drop in share price as a buying opportunity for a disruptive and innovative business that will deliver strong returns in the next 3-5 years."
2813935,80015,2015-01-13T12:48:58-05:00,Cisco litigation has made Arista's stock more appealing.The current stock sell-off creates great buying point.Target Price of $85 = 28% upside.,"Founded a decade ago by ex-Cisco employees, Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) is a leading supplier of 10/40/100G Ethernet Switching, using software and open-architecture to address the needs of large-scale Internet companies, cloud service providers and next-generation data centers for enterprises. From 2010 to 2013, their cumulative end-customers base grew from ~ 570 to 2,340 and the customers include six of largest cloud service providers including Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo!, financial service organization such as Barclays, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley, and some media and service providers, including Comcast, Equinix, ESPN and Rackspace.According to Crehan Research, Arista achieved the second largest market share in data center 10/40/100 Gigabit Ethernet switch ports, excluding blade switching, sold in 2013. In addition, this market will grow from approximately $6 billion in 2013 to $12 billion in 2017, representing a 19% compound annual growth rate.In December 2014, Cisco filed the suit in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California, claiming Arista is violating 14 patents and copying some specific Cisco technologies including the System Database (""SysDB""), Zero-Touch Provisioning (""ZTP""), and Cisco's implementation of the generic command line interface and CLI command data translation. It didn't disclose how much money Cisco was seeking in damages. Since then, Arista stock price had a maximum drawdown of 42% as the financial community viewed this event as a negative one for Arista. Arista board member, Dan Scheinman, posted a blog, indicating that the Cisco suit is an ""attempt by a legacy vendor that is falling behind in the marketplace to use the legal system to try and slow a competitor who is innovating and winning.""Before diving into my investment thesis and explaining why Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) lawsuit is making Arista more attractive, I'd like to walk you through the networking technology evolution and potential market size, which will help you understand the real reasons for the lawsuit.Evolution from Traditional Network to Software Driven Cloud NetworkThe current traditional network architecture space is dominated by Cisco. It uses silo-ed hardware and proprietary silicon chips, and the architecture is not open to customers who have a very high OpEx/CapEx to maintain/expand their networking. The networking is evolving to a new era where cloud, big data and virtualization are key drivers. These new technologies use software to define the network (SDN), to manage massive data flows with a much lower expenses, and to interconnect large number of servers, up to hundreds of thousands, with predictable network bandwidth. The whole network is based on open protocols and be programmable to enable integration with leading applications and management and data analysis tools.Cisco hasn't faced a disruptive competitor like Arista in probably two decades. Cisco was using PowerPoint to fight against new vendors like Arista in the past, and finally launched Nexus 9K series switches operating in Cisco NX-OS software mode or in Application Centric Infrastructure (NYSE:ACI) mode, 10 years after Arista was founded. Juniper also launched their SDN switches in 2014, and tried to keep in pace with Arista.Market Size and GrowthAccording to Dell'Oro and Crehan resarch 2014, the total Switching market size will grow at a very slow pace from $22.7B in 2014 to $24.5B in 2017; however the Data Center Switching market (10/40/100G) will experience a rapid growth in the next 3 years from $7.7B in 2014 to $12B in 2017, representing 19% of CAGR as more enterprises are moving their data centers to public/hybrid clouds. Given the decoupled market growth, vendors leading the data center software driven switching will gain significant market share from the existing legacy vendors like Cisco, HP and Dell.Why Cisco Litigation makes Arista more AttractiveFrom here, you probably have understood the real reason behind the lawsuit: shaking down the future biggest rival in the infant stage. However disruptive technology is always invented by new vendors instead of legacy providers. Two decades ago, Lucent, IBM and Nortel sued rising star Cisco in order to stop Cisco's disruptive IP technology at that time. These attempts couldn't stop Cisco growing to be a success company in the past 20 years. In 2013, Cisco sued Huawei over intellectual property and dropped the lawsuit last year. These attempts couldn't stop Huawei beating Cisco in many markets. Similarly, Juniper's litigation against Palo Alto Networks cannot stop Palo Alto shining in the application firewall market.I don't have a crystal ball to predict the lawsuit outcome and it may take 1-2 years to settle between this two companies. Juniper/Palo Alto Networks suit would be a good reference for Cisco/Arista's. Palo Alto Networks was founded by ex-Juniper employees. In 2011, Juniper accused them in a lawsuit of infringing 6 patents for firewall technology and these two companies agreed to settle this lawsuit in 2014 with $175M in cash and equity.Currently, Arista is deeply undervalued, and the current stock sell-off creates great buying point for this stock for a long term investor. Now it is the time to present my investment thesis.Investment Rationale:Rapid Revenue and Market Share Gaining: Arista has a solid track record for the revenue growth and market share gaining. As illustrated in below tables, Arista the fastest growing company in the switching industry. Excluding Cisco, Arista owns 6.7% of global switching market share. Ironically, all the legacy vendors such as Cisco, HP Networking and Brocade have all been suffering from slow revenue growth.Data Source:1: All companies FY12 and FY13 actual revenue: Annual Reports2: FY14E revenue figures: Hunter Research estimates3: Total Market Size: Dell'Oro and Crehan resarch 2014Based on my model, Arista revenue will be above $1.2B by FY16, representing 11.7% of global data center switching market share.Data Source:1: FY13 Actual Revenue: Annual Reports2: FY14E-FY17E revenue figures: Hunter Research estimates3: Total Data Center Market Size: Dell'Oro and Crehan resarch 2014Differentiated Platform and Echo-System: At the core of Arista cloud networking platform is EOS+, which was purpose-built to be fully programmable and highly modular. EOS+ supports leading cloud and virtualization solutions, including VMware NSX, Microsoft System Center, OpenStack and other cloud management frameworks. The SDN is driven by Cloud, Big Data as well as Virtualization. Arista have developed strategic relationships with a number of technology ecosystem participants including Aruba Networks, F5 Networks, Microsoft, Palo Alto Networks, Riverbed, Splunk and VMware, to allow integration of Arista's cloud networking solutions with their offerings and enable an integrated experience for customers.The ecosystem enables the new networking architecture more open and programmable, and creates unique competitive advantage for these participants against legacy vendors. Furthermore, Arista's EOS+ Platform is using single binary image software and Linux operating system, which enables them to integrate more software applications into their system and to make the networking software upgrade easier than traditional networking. For instance, if a customer needs to upgrade a Cisco switch, he/she has to upgrade the Cisco IOS from version to version; meaning he/she cannot skip some old patches and install the latest version.Investing in Research & Development for Growth: Compared to other switching vendors, Arista is investing heavily in R&D. After netting out stock option expenses, Arista is pouring 22% of its revenue to R&D, the highest percentage among all the vendors. For a new IT company, the consistent R&D investment is critical for its future growth. I have no doubt that Cisco will milk all its cash cow before it is dry; however I cannot see their strategy embracing the new technology. What Cisco has done is to reduce their operating expense via cutting employees, to boost EPS via shares buyback, and to make existing shareholders happy via returning cash. A high-tech company will either succeed or fail and it cannot just be hanging there forever.Data Source:1: FY12, FY13 Actual R&D Expense: Annual Reports, adjusted by stock option expenses2: FY14E Expense: Hunter Research estimates3: % of Revenue: Annual Report and Hunter Research estimatesIncreasing Adoption of Cloud Networks: according to Arista's investor presentation, early adopters are Internet companies (100+ customers), High-tech (310+ customers), Financial Services (490+) and Service Provider/Cloud/Hosting (300+). The early adopters are usually large spenders for the cloud networking. There are also many followers such as manufacturing, government, energy, healthcare and education etc. The Cloud Networking is still in the early stage and we can expect more and more enterprises to adopt the new technology in the next 3 years.In 1991, I enjoyed reading Geoffrey A. Moore's book Crossing the Chasm, and after many re-reads, this book is still one of my all-time favorites. I do believe the most difficult step is making the transition between visionaries and pragmatists. For the Cloud Networking, the chasm is the costs switching from traditional networks to cloud-based architecture, just as from the mainframe to modern computing systems. Nobody knows how long they can cross the chasm, but I do know the adoption is inevitable.Strong Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Generation: Arista is free of debt, and will keep half billion cash on their balance sheet. Like other IT vendors, when Arista sold a device to a customer, Arista can also earn the annual service revenue, usually 15%-20% of total sales. Arista's healthy cash flow generation enables them to invest the future and grow the core business.Data Source:1: FY13 Actual: Arista Annual Report2: All the estimates: Hunter Research ModelExpanding Sales to Existing Customer Base and New End Customers: Arista sells their products through both direct sales force as well as channel partners. Their sales force and channel partners are still in the developing stage. The increasing brand awareness will definitely help Arista expand their distribution channel and customer base. In addition, Arista has huge potential to acquire new customers and increase penetration in existing customers. In FY13, ~ 85% of revenue was received from their existing end customers. The beauty of this business is that for data center customers, they are very sticky business and Arista can consistently generate new revenue from those customers.Furthermore, Arista hasn't expanded aggressive into their international business. During FY13, 84% of Arista revenue was generated from the Americas, 11% from Europe, the Middle East and Africa and 5% from the Asia-Pacific region. Once Arista gains enough in U.S., it is the timing to expand international distribution channels that will generate substantial additional revenue for Arista.Strong Management Team and Engineering Team: Arista's management and engineering team consists of networking veterans with extensive data center networking expertise.- The President and CEO, Jayshree Ullal, previously served as SVP and general manager of Cisco's Data Center Business.- Andy Bechtolsheim, the founder and Chief Development Officer, was previously a founder and chief system architect at Sun Microsystems and from 1996 to 2003 served as VP/GM of the Gigabit Systems Business Unit at Cisco.- Kenneth Duda, the founder, Chief Technology Officer and SVP Software Engineering, led the software development effort of the Gigabit Systems Business Unit at Cisco from 1996 to 2000.On the VP level, 8 out 9 VPs used to work for Cisco. Arista employed over 750 employees at the end of 2013.Key RisksValuationUsing DCF model, Arista's one year target price is $85, or 28% upside at current price $66.42 representing 44x fwd.

I do find the risks serious, which is the prime reason for me to hold off making an investment at the moment.The Public OfferingArista Networks solutions are based on the Extensible Operating System, or EOS, a set of network applications, as well as 10/40/100-Gigabit Ethernet switches. The company's core EOS is fully programmable and flexible, addressing the different requirements of users, including reliability, automation, analytics and visibility, among others.Arista was founded in 2004, and shipped its first products in 2008. Growth has been spectacular in recent years, as the company grew the cumulative end-customer base from 570 in 2010 to 2,340 by the end of 2013.Arista sold 5.25 million shares for $43 apiece, thereby raising $226 million in gross proceeds. As far as the press release reveals, all shares were offered by the company, with no shares of selling shareholders being offered.The pricing of the offering has been strong, taking place above the high end of the preliminary offering range of $36 to $42 per share set by the firm and its bankers. At $43 per share, the offering valued Arista at $2.7 billion. Following the successful debut in which shares have risen to current levels at $55 per share, this valuation has risen to $3.5 billion.The major banks that brought the company public were Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, Barclays, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and RBC Capital Markets, among many others.ValuationArista is focused on its EOS offering, which supports leading virtualization and cloud solutions, including offerings from VMware (NYSE:VMW), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) System Center and OpenStack, among others. The company has gained many prominent customers in recent years, which include cloud service providers like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft, Yahoo (YHOO) and large bulge-bracket banks.Cloud networking has many advantages over legacy networks, including better performance, better availability, programmability and flexibility, and lower costs. The company's EOS solution is set to address the scale needs of customers in the cloud. The company's target market, data centers with switching markets for 10-Gigabit Ethernet or more, is expected to double between 2013 and 2017 to become a $12 billion market. This is according to research firm Crehan Research.For 2013, Arista generated revenues of $361.2 million, which is up by 86.8% on the year before. The company doubled its net income to $42.5 million.The company operated with $113.7 million in cash and equivalents before the offering took place. On a pro forma basis, Arista will operate with roughly $44.3 million in debt and $289.1 million in cash, resulting in a $250 million net cash position. Given the strong offering, the net cash position might actually come in above this estimate.This values operating assets of the business at roughly $3.25 billion, which values Arista at a little over 9 times annual revenues and a little over 75 times GAAP earnings.Investment ThesisAs noted above, the public offering of Arista Networks has been a huge success. Shares were offered some 10.3% above the midpoint of the offering range, after which they rose by 27.9% on their first trading day.Valuations are very steep, based on the 2013 results, despite the rapid and profitable growth. Therefore, forward-looking metrics might be more appropriate, with revenues for the first quarter increasing by more than 91% to $117.2 million. Net earnings were up by 86.5% to $12.3 million.The strong, accelerating and profitable growth are huge pros for this public offering. Extrapolating first-quarter earnings of $12.3 million, Arista should be able to post earnings north of $50 million this year, which still results in a valuation north of 60 times earnings. This obviously does not make it a bargain.Besides the valuation risks, there are the usual risks for these kinds of offerings. This includes a limited operating history, and large and resource-rich competitors like Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR), among others. Furthermore, note that Arista's top 10 customers make up 43% of total revenues, and that this percentage has been on the increase recently.Perhaps the biggest risk is the lawsuit which the company has seen filed against it by OptumSoft. The latter states that ownership of components of the EOS systems belong to the company, after OptumSoft and Arista worked together in their start-up phase. Following the major disagreement between both companies, David Cheriton, who is one of Arista's founders, resigned in March of this year and is actually suing Arista. He seems very motivated given that his trust holds 22% of Arista shares, making it the largest shareholder in the company.Despite the great growth, profitability and successful initial public offering, the risks outweigh the opportunities, in my opinion. Notably the high valuation, potential tougher competition and the lawsuit are risks which make me cautious.I remain on the cautious side, but keep the stock on my radar in case a big post-IPO sell-off might occur in the coming months.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The researcher estimates that the Ethernet data center switch market will be worth $14 billion in 2018. The growth is expected to be driven by the continuing adoption of 10 Gigabit Ethernet for data center server access, and 40 and 100 Gigabit Ethernet for data center uplink, aggregation and core deployments. Crehan Research believes that 10 Gigabit Ethernet will soon become the biggest contributor to Ethernet Switch shipments.Arista Networks's OfferingsFounded in 2005, Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) is a leading provider of cloud networking solutions. The company was created when entrepreneurs David Cheriton and Andy Bechtolsheim got together with Ken Duda to build a product that would deliver cloud networking solutions for large data center and high-performance computing environments. Their cloud networking equipment would help companies manage data traffic between Internet users and data centers of big customers. Their portfolio includes 1/10/40 and 100 GbE products that help make them the manufacturers of one of the fastest switching equipment technologies in the world.The core networking platform product - the Extensible Operating System (EOS) - has been developed as a highly programmable and modular solution. The platform's programmability has helped create a suite of software applications that are able to meet the various needs of cloud networking ranging from workflow automation to network visibility and analytics. EOS also supports the capability to integrate third-party applications for virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services.EOS supports most leading cloud and virtualization solutions including VMware NSX, Microsoft System Center and OpenStack. EOS uses Linux as its underlying operating system that also helps with integrating it with off-the-shelf Linux applications and other open source management tools.Arista Networks's FinancialsThe company's client list includes Internet giants like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Yahoo (YHOO), financial companies such as Barclays (NYSE:BCS), Citigroup (NYSE:C) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), and media and service providers including Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) (CMCSK), Equinix (NASDAQ:EQIX), ESPN and Rackspace (NYSE:RAX).Revenues have improved 71% annually over the period 2010 to 2013, growing from $71.7 million to $361.2 million. Over the same period, net income has improved from $2.4 million to $42.5 million.For the recently ended quarter, Arista Networks reported growth of 65% in revenues to $137.9 million with an EPS of $0.35. The market was looking for revenues of $125.3 million with an EPS of $0.13.Arista has not relied on venture funding and instead was created using its founder's funds. In June this year, Arista went public and raised $226 million by selling 5.3 million shares at $43 each on the NYSE. Since listing, the stock touched a high of $94.84 in September this year. Their stock is trading at $77.51 with a market capitalization of $5 billion.Disclosure: None."

The stock posted a strong first-day return of 27.9%, and has since continued to see steady growth; the stock closed at $65.67 per share on June 19.Source: Nasdaq.comUnderwritingANET's many IPO underwriters, including Citigroup Global Markets Inc; Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC; BofA Merrill Lynch; Barclays Capital, Inc.; Cowen and Company, LLC; Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.; Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC; JMP Securities LLC; Needham & Company, LLC; Pacific Crest Securities LLC; Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.; Raymond James and Associates, Inc.; Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated; RBC Capital Markets, LLC; The Juda Group; William Blair and Co., LLC; and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, will attempt to spur ANET's share prices to even greater heights through the release of positive reports beginning at the expiration of the quiet period.Evidence That Quiet Period Expirations Can Open Buying OpportunitiesThe Journal of Finance (VOL. LVIII, NO. 1; 2003) describes how an increase in share price typically emerges several days ahead of the quiet period expiration as experienced investors anticipate positive analyst reports and begin to buy up shares.Lead author Dan Bradley, PhD, CFA, affiliated with the University of South Florida, and colleagues note that analyst coverage is immediately initiated for 76% of firms at the quiet period expiration, nearly always with a 'Buy' or 'Strong Buy' rating. Firms with coverage initiated experience abnormal positive returns of 4.1% in the two days before and two days after the date of initiation.In support of this, Carter, Piwowar, and Strader (2001) also find that the mean analyst rating at the time of the quiet period expiration is a ""Buy,"" with higher returns correlated to higher ratings.The early purchases generate the perception of rising demand, and cause share prices to rise before the expiration of the quiet period, creating a short-term buying opportunity.Bradley et al also find a significant correlation between the reputation and number of IPO underwriters and an increase in the price of shares at the conclusion of the quiet period. The data generated through our past three years of research align with the academic publications.Returns have been found to increase significantly when initiated by more than one analyst - to 6.4%.BusinessFor a detailed overview of ANET's business, see our article on ANET's IPO.OptumSoft LawsuitDespite much internet chatter about a pending lawsuit filed against ANET by OptumSoft, a company founded by ANET's co-founder and largest shareholder, there has been little apparent effect on ANET's fortunes in the market thus far.OptumSoft claims that ANET has not maintained its end of an agreement through which it uses OptumSoft's software development platform for free in exchange for providing OptumSoft with any improvements it makes to the platform. The suit is due to be argued in court in August, at which point investors should keep a wary eye on the stock, but the outcome will have little long-term effect on ANET.CompetitorsANET competes with similar equipment and system vendors, including the likes of Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR), Dell, Cisco Systems, Inc (NASDAQ:CSCO), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), and Brocade Communications Systems (NASDAQ:BRCD).

2259193,21654,2014-06-09T12:04:07-04:00,"ANET went public on Friday and despite the warm reception, may actually be cheap. The company has been profitable for 4 years with average annual growth of 71%.Cloud computing is the fastest growing segment of the tech universe and Arista has the switches to meet the demand.The software allows for seamless integration for other software providers and constant monitoring of each individual switch.","Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET), a maker of high-speed switches for big data, went public last Friday and although the stock priced above the range and closed up 27% on the first day of trading, I actually thought the stock would open much higher. Arista could be the best small technology company to go public in many years in my opinion and I came up with a list of 10 reasons why.#1 Unlike almost all the hot IPOs over the last two years, Arista is not only profitable now but has been profitable since 2010. The company also has not only been growing quickly at an average annual pace of 71% since 2010, but this growth is actually accelerating. Revenue growth in 2013 was 83% over 2012 and in the first quarter of this year (2014) was 91%. This was all done while Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) spent much time and effort on its own ""Arista killer"", called the Nexus 9000, but so far it has not made a dent in Arista's growth.#2 What is helping Arista is the migration to the cloud on the corporate, government, education and consumer levels. Cloud computing needs seamless instant integration of thousands of servers which can only be done with high-speed switches with low power consumption and virtually no latency, similar to technology that Arista provides. According to Crehan Research (from the company's S-1), the demand of high-speed data switches will double from $6 billion last year to $12 billion in just four years time. The data center switching market will grow to $16 billion.(here)#3 Also, according to Crehan research, Arista has only a 6% share of the market to Cisco's 71%. If Arista can double its share in the next four years in a market that will double, the company's revenue can grow four-fold over that time span.#4 Arista has several advantages over Cisco that has enabled the company to gain a foothold in the space. The first is its software platform called EOS. EOS enables companies to rapidly deploy new features as they become available. At the same time it allows the monitoring, handling repair and patching of each switch individually if needed, which reduces latency and downtime in the case of failure. The openness of the software also allows the network software to be tailored specifically to each customer's needs.#5 The open system of EOS allows for partnerships with the biggest names in cloud software and management. VMware (NYSE:VMW), Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Aruba (NASDAQ:ARUN), F5 (NASDAQ:FFIV) SAP (NYSE:SAP) and others are all strategic partners. You can see the full list on the company's website. (here)#6 Speaking of Microsoft, it has become Arista's biggest customer as it builds its own cloud network. New CEO Satya Nadella has made the company's migration to the cloud his No. 1 priority which should mean a lot of revenue for Arista.#7 Without getting too technical, Arista's switches are very scalable and modular and they are set up in a way that makes it easier for companies to use them efficiently. It was the first company to enable a two-layer network - called a leaf spine network - it is very efficient with all nodes equidistant and no stranded ports. This has since been copied by Cisco. Several months ago, the company went a step further and launched what is called a ""spline"" network. This network allows up to 2,000 servers to be directly connected via one tier. What this does is virtually eliminate latency in the network. This new ""spline"" system could give the company a new leg up on Cisco and push the company to gain share above and beyond what it has already taken from the market leader.#8 The management team is excellent with the co-founder and Chairman Andreas Bechtolsheim being one of the founders of Sun Microsystems and was among the first investors in Google. CEO Jayshree Ullal was the VP of data center switching at Cisco. Both the VP of engineering and VP of manufacturing were also top execs at Cisco which were lured away. I have heard that Arista is one of the favorite companies for engineers to work in Silicon Valley, as it is an engineering company at its core and the majority of its employees are engineers.(As an aside the other co-founder David Cheriton is the biggest shareholder, but is actually suing his own company because he feels another company he owns which was a sister company to Arista did not get its share of an agreement to share improvement in each other's software. Arista is countersuing. This is most likely going to be settled before it goes to court in the summer. However, even if somehow Arista loses the suit, it poses no threat to the company itself. The lawsuit does not involve the company's core technology.)#8.5 There is not one dollar of VC money invested in Arista. All the non-IPO shares are owned by the founders or employees and that means they are invested in making the company and its stock grow.#9 Post IPO, the company now has more than $300 million in cash and no debt. Since it is profitable, the company will actually be growing its war chest, which could be used to make small acquisitions or be spent on R&D.#10 The company may actually be cheap on a PEG (price/earnings to growth) basis. Arista earned $.77 last year and could earn around $1.40-$1.50 this year (non GAAP), even if revenue growth slows back to 80% from the 90% in the first quarter. At $1.40 in earnings, the company is selling for under 40X earnings at a growth rate double that, giving it a PEG of 0.5. You will be hard pressed to find any company growing at this rate with a PEG of under 1, much less half the growth rate. Say Arista grows EPS only 50% in 2015, we can get to $2.10-$2.25 which gives it a P/E of only in the 20s on 2015 numbers.My guess is if Arista can get to over $1.40 in earnings with a good outlook for next year, the stock can easily hit $100 by year's end.Disclosure: I am long ANET.

        ANET targets high-frequency traders with its lineup of software-based cloud networking solutions.
        Recent and historical research has supported the correlation between price declines (approximately 2%-5%) and lockup expirations.","Arista Network - (NYSE:ANET) - Sell Recommendation - $PT $69.50December 3, 2014 concludes the 180-day lockup period on Arista Networks .According to the SEC, a lockup period ""prohibits company insiders-including employees, their friends and family, and venture capitalists-from selling shares for a set period of time"" after the pricing of an initial public offering. Prior to the IPO, the underwriters and company will enter into an agreement to keep shares owned by insiders from flooding the marketplace immediately after the first days of public trading. Typically, these periods last 180 days; however, this may vary.When the lockup period ends for Arista Network, its pre-IPO shareholders, directors and executives will have the chance to sell their ~53 million shares. The potential for a sudden increase in shares available in the open market may cause a significant decrease in ANET shares.Currently, Arista trades at $74.56 (midday, December 1,2014), well above its IPO price of $43 and its first day opening price of $55.25.Business Summary: Software-based Cloud Networking Solutions for High-performance Computer Systems and large Data NetworksBased in Santa Clara, California, Arista Networks provides computer networking by designing and selling multilayer network switches that offer software-defined-networking (SDN).

With The 2010 David R. Cheriton Trust and the Bechtolsheim Family Trust each holding over 12 million shares, The 2000 Ulal Trust holding ~4 million shares, and eleven individuals holding over 24 million shares, if some or all of these players choose to sell, it could send ANET's price into significant declines.ANET offered a total of 5.3 million shares initially.Recent and historical research has supported the correlation between price declines and lockup expirations; a study from Duke University and Harvard University reported decreases of about two percent, while our own research shows abnormal negative returns around -5.5 percent in the days preceding and following the event.Investors might consider selling ANET ahead of its lockup expirations to take full advantage of the impending decline.We invite readers wishing to join the discussion on IPOs to click the +FOLLOW button above the title of this article, and those looking for the latest updates to click +Get real-time alerts."

As the company announced a nice bolt-on deal, it is time to update the investment case on this company, which continues to have very rosy prospects, although a great deal of good news has been priced in here.Ansys is the market leader in simulation which is a rapidly growing industry used in a wide range of industries and applications. Its applications are used by industry leaders across a very wide range of sectors including aerospace, industry, phones, cars, windmills, food and healthcare, among others.The company offers an integrated simulation platform including autonomy, electrification, 5G, IoT, cloud platform, materials, etc. The comprehensive offerings make it very hard for competitors or other players to invade this markets.Operating with a leadership position in this growing market, the company sees huge potential with its addressable market set to nearly triple from less than $7 billion in 2018 to a midpoint of $18 billion in 2026. This is driven by new adjacent markets, with further growth seen beyond 2026, notably in adjacent industries such as additive manufacturing, digital exploration, and many other applications.The company has already delivered on great growth over the past decade as this is a predictable, steady growing business with very fat margins. Between 2010 and 2019, revenues have essentially tripled to $1.5 billion as operating profits are very fat, just over half a billion! Thanks to interest expenses having fallen quite a bit, while the company managed to reduce the share count by 5%, this has boosted earnings per share quite a bit.These achievements have been more than reflected in the share price. Shares traded around the $40 mark in 2010 and have risen a factor of 7-8 times to $320 at the moment of writing, actually down 10% from recent highs around $350 per share.In the year 2019, the company reported a 17% increase in revenues to $1.53 billion. While GAAP operating profit margins at 34% are sky-high already, the company even reports adjusted operating margins around 45%! The reported net earnings of $5.25 per share provide a solid base to the earnings numbers, with adjusted earnings reported at $6.58 per share. Unfortunately, the company guided for flattish adjusted earnings in 2020, ahead of Covid-19 already.Unfortunately, the vast majority of the discrepancy between both earnings metrics stems from stock-based compensation expenses, and only to a smaller extent amortization charges on past acquisitions. This makes that I attach most weight to the GAAP earnings, pegging realistic earnings around $5.50 per share.With shares approaching the $300 mark when the results were released in February, expectations were sky-high at a 55 times multiple! While the first quarter results showed a shortfall, for obvious reasons, it was good to see the company return to annual revenue growth already in the second quarter. Second quarter sales rose 5% and with the company initially expecting stronger growth, earnings fell modestly. Based on the conditions the company guided for revenues to surpass the $1.6 billion mark with adjusted earnings seen around $6 per share this year.Net cash balances have grown to $321 million by the end of the second quarter, or nearly $4 per share with 87 million shares outstanding! With shares having risen to $320 per share, multiples remain very elevated at nearly 60 times economic earnings. This is very high by all means of course as investors recognize the great growth prospects for the company with the addressable market set to increase by nearly 3 times in the coming 5-6 years.At $320 per share, equity of the company is valued at $27.8 billion, or about $27.5 billion if we adjust for net cash. This values the company at around 17 times sales seen this year.With Covid-19 casting a real shadow on the reported growth this year, the company resorted to M&A to accelerate growth and further unleash the potential of the business.The good thing is that if you are valued at a very high multiple is that any deal looks accretive, certainly on a relative basis. Ansys is spending $700 million to acquire Analytical Graphics in a deal set to close in the fourth quarter.Analytical is a provider of mission-driven simulation, modeling, testing and analysis software for aerospace, defense, telecommunications and intelligence applications. Roughly two/thirds of the deal tag will be paid for in terms of cash, making that the entire net cash position will be eliminated. The remaining third will be paid for by issuing stock. This $233 million equity component implies that just over 0.7 million shares will be issued.The deal will have a meaningful impact to the 2021 results, with the revenue contribution pegged at $75-$85 million, being modestly accretive to adjusted earnings per share. Based on that multiple, Analytical is valued at around 9 times sales, roughly half the sales multiple at which the company trades itself. That said the deal is based on next year's expected revenue base, with expected growth not being specified.Nonetheless, it is a true bolt-on deal, adding about 5% to pro-forma sales while the purchase price is equivalent to just 2-3% of the own valuation, looking quite compelling in my eyes.Obviously, the latest deal looks nice based on relative valuations and allows a company like Ansys to further accelerate growth, as critical expertise can be acquired and cross-selling across the customer base can take place. Hence, I am generally a big fan of such deals, yet it does not move the needle for the investment case in a big way.The real investment case to play out is that of the secular trends and the projections made, with addressable markets and thus revenue targets tripling between now and let's say a year or 6 from here.So let's do some math. Based on Ansys' projections of its end markets nearly tripling by 2027, I see potential for earnings to triple as well, let's say by 2027/2028. In such a scenario, earnings per share might improve to about $20, or perhaps $22 if we assume that retained earnings allows for continuation of reduction in the share count.Assuming valuation multiples narrow, with the premium dissolving to some extent, as the law of large numbers will probably put some pressure on the growth rate of the business, I value this earnings power at a 20-25 times multiple at such a point in time, for a valuation between $440 and $550 per share.Compared to a current value of $320, this leaves a potential annual return of around 4-7%, perhaps interesting, but not interesting enough to create a compelling risk-reward, in my book."
4373999,21702,2020-09-13T22:32:21-04:00,"Ansys is a leader in the fast-growing engineering simulation market: automotive, aerospace, electromagnetics, and oil & gas - just to name a few.The company recently announced two large sales wins - including the biggest in company history - that bode well for the future.However, the Q2 EPS report was rather tepid.Has the stock price gotten ahead of its revenue growth and earnings potential?","ANSYS (Ansys) (ANSS) is an industry leader (arguably the leader) in simulation software across a wide variety of engineering applications - from automotive to aerospace, to oil & gas, and from fluid-dynamics to electromagnetics to finite element analysis. During the most recent quarter, the company announced a number of large new contracts that bode well for the future. Let's take a look at how the company has been performing during the new era of Covid-19.The Q2 EPS report was released on August 5th:Source: Q2 EPS ReportAs can be seen from the graphic above, 6-month revenues were flat yoy while cost-of-sales and total operating expenses increased significantly. As a result, earnings per share fell 28.4% over the first six months of 2020 as compared to 2019. Although these results were likely negatively affected by Covid-19, and generally beat expectations, they were certainly nothing to get overly excited about.The GAAP operating profit margin was 29.3% in Q2 and the company announced a backlog of $846.5 million as of June 30, 2020 - that's an 18% increase over Q2 of 2019.In the earnings release, Ansys president and CEO Ajei Gopal said:Indeed, on the Q2 conference call CEO Ajei Gopal gave more information about two significant and large-scale contract wins:The size and scale of these developments certainly bode well for the future. The second contract was like with Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) - see this announcement. Note that Ansys also counts companies like Apple (AAPL), Qualcomm (QCOM), and Boeing (BA) among its clientele.Q3 and full-year guidance were given in the Q2 EPS report and is shown below:Source: Q2 EPS ReportThe midpoint of the earnings guidance - GAAP=$4.36/share and Non-GAAP=$6.05/share, compares to GAAP=$5.25/share and Non-GAAP=$6.58/share for full-year 2019. That equates to a change of -17% and -8.1%, respectively.No doubt Covid-19 had a big impact on a company that does a lot of employee/customer interfacing when it comes to sales and training of its complex simulation tools. Ansys also has a thriving relationship with the academic world and is widely used by engineering programs around the world. Obviously, the current global pandemic has had a big impact on college campuses and that likely also impacted ANSS's recent results.As can be seen from the slide below, Ansys already has a slew of tier-1 customers across a multitude of industries and engineering disciplines:Source: Q2 PresentationAnd according to a research report by Allied Market Research, the global software simulation market - which was only $5.13 billion in 2017 - is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8.9% from 2018 to 2025 to over $10 billion by 2025.Source: Allied Market ResearchSo the future looks excellent for Ansys when it comes to opportunities for growth. Note from the graphic above that two of the largest growth sectors are automotive and electrical, which just happen to correspond to the two big new sales wins described earlier.But, like most of the software companies I have written about lately, my issue is with the company's current valuation. The current P/E=69. Based on the midpoint of full-year 2020 guidance, the forward P/E=73 (GAAP) or P/E=53 (non-GAAP). Take your pick, but either way that seems extremely stretched for a company that is expected to show a significant earnings decline in 2020 as compared to 2019. Covid-19 or no Covid-19.With a market cap of $27.5 billion, ANSS is trading at 56.5x full-year 2019 revenue.In comparison, Synopsys has a PE=50 on TTM earnings and with a market cap of $30.9 billion, is trading at only 9.2x revenue and has better last 6-month revenue growth.And of course the risks are that Covid-19 and the lingering global economic malaise could last longer than many analysts believe, and that the somewhat more ""discretionary"" expense of simulation software may be under pressure. In the meantime, companies like Synopsys (SNPS) and Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) are likely to provide increasing competition in the simulation arena (see Synopsys: On The Leading Edge Of Technology).Engineering tools can save companies a lot of time and money, and Ansys is certainly an industry leader in the field and is well respected in engineering colleges around the world. As those students continue into corporations and into management roles, Ansys likely goes with them. And the overall total addressable market is large and growing as technology becomes more complex and more important in our lives and the products we use. All that said, Ansys is not just priced to perfection, it has an astonishing high valuation in comparison to its near- and mid-term revenue and earnings growth rates (in terms of earnings, it's a negative growth rate).As can be seen from the chart below, ANSS has traded as high as $354 as the market has raced higher, and closed at $316 Thursday. But that doesn't mean it's a bargain. The stock is still up 24% YTD and I would put the fair value at something closer to $181. Note that's still a generous P/E=30 on the midpoint of the 2020 non-GAAP full-year earnings estimate of $6.05/share. That said, and looking from the chart below, ANSS never broke the $200 level even during the March sell-off. From that perspective, my $180 fair value would appear off-base. But I'll wait to see a couple more (and significantly better...) earnings reports before I'll modify it.Source: Seeking Alpha"

(ANSS) is a leading company in simulation software in all physics areas with revenues three times larger than its nearest competitor. The shares recovered strongly from a broad market sell-off in late 2018. After its 1Q earnings release early May, shares fell about 10% as the company reported its Annual Contract Value (""ACV""), a key metric to measure its revenues, only grew about 7% yoy in constant currency terms, below its 9-12% top line growth target. But sentiment on global trade has improved and the ban on Huawei has eased, allowing the stock to resume its upward trend. We've reached a level where valuations are beginning to be stretched and it is better to take profits.Data by YChartsExcept for an exceptionally strong Q4, which the management has described to be pulled forward demand as customers tend to lump order to spend their budgets at the end of the year, revenue growth sits comfortably around in the low teens and is projected to grow at a similar rate in the coming quarters.(Source: Bloomberg)Since 2018, the company has adopted the new ASC 606 accounting standard, and 1Q2019 is the first quarter when yearly comparisons become available. Under ASC 606, certain multi-year deals have larger upfront revenue recognition, so 1Q19 non-GAAP revenue growth of 13% over 1Q18 may have been overstated, if we look at the new ACV metric.(Source: Ansys)The company created a new measure, ACV, to help measure the health of its growth. The purpose of the ACV is to smooth bookings.(Source: Ansys)ACV only grew at 3.3% yoy (or 7% yoy in constant currency terms), which is considerably weaker than the 9-12% ACV growth target and diverges from the stronger revenue figure.1Q operating margin was at 42.9%, which is still lower than the 43-44% target, because both R&D and SG&A expenses were higher as a percentage of revenue year over year. Ansys is undergoing a sales force transformation, as the company is dealing with a differentiated go-to market where it tries to have a direct sales force for large territory deals.(Source: Ansys)A couple months ago, Cadence announced the new Clarity 3D Solver, which aims to compete against HFSS in the electromagnetic simulation space. Since this simulation aims to solve problems in high-growth areas, which vary from radar in autonomous vehicles to phased array antenna for 5G telecom, it is naturally attractive for players to enter this market. But the company believes that its 30 years of experience is what builds confidence for customers to choose HFSS.Even though Ansys is a strong, leading player in engineering simulation, recent key metrics like ACV have shown a bit of a slowing trend. Geographically, EMEA is a weak region for the company, especially for Germany, but North America is really strong.So, it is a bit mixed, as strength is not all-rounded, and both ACV and operating margin have yet to meet their full-year target ranges.Here, we have Ansys trading at 33x forward earnings compared to its mean of ~27.5x, and with potential slowing growth and a new competitor against its key product, HFSS, it is better to take profits and wait for a better entry point.(Source: Bloomberg)"
4327365,104720,2020-02-26T11:07:45-05:00,"ANSYS has multiple growth drivers which are pushing its stock upwards.However, the company is expensive compared to its competitors.Long-term investors should wait for a pullback to buy the stock.","ANSYS (ANSS) is a technology company with multiple growth drivers. In the last five years, the company’s revenue has increased at a CAGR of 9.07%. I expect revenue will continue to increase around this rate in the next five years. However, the company’s stock is expensive compared to its competitors’ stocks. Long-term investors can buy this stock during pullbacks to maximize their gain.ANSYS develops and markets engineering simulation software and services. The company serves the following end markets: automotive, electronics, semiconductors, aerospace and defense, energy, healthcare, and consumer products. The company’s products are used by designers, engineers, researchers and students.Image Source: PixabayANSYS' simulation platform ANSYS workbench is one of its major growth drivers. On this platform the company’s advanced engineering simulation technologies are built. This platform allows engineers and designers to incorporate the compounding effects of physics into a virtual place of their design. Then the platform allows the users to simulate the operation under real-world conditions. With product architectures becoming more complex, ANSYS is modifying the platform so that it can adjust with real-world environments. The company’s ANSYS ACT allows end users to modify the user interface as required so that the simulation platform remains flexible. According to a report, “The simulation software market predicted to grow from $5.51 Billion in 2016 to $13.45 Billion by 2022, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (OTC:CAGR) of 16.5% during forecast period. The base year considered for the study is 2016 and the forecast period is 2017–2022.” ANSYS' simulation software revenue is expected to grow at a similar rate.The company's structural analysis product suite is its another growth driver. This product suite provides simulation tools for product design and optimization. It helps product designers deliver innovative products in less time. For understanding and solving complex design problems, this software suite has capabilities that cover a wide range of analysis types. In addition, the software suite provides a complete simulation workflow for additive manufacturing that can perform reliable 3D printing. According to a report, “The global 3D printing market size was valued at USD 11.58 billion in 2019 and is expected to expand at a CAGR exceeding 14% from 2020 to 2027.” ANSYS' structural analysis product revenue will grow at a similar rate.The company recently launched a couple of new products, which are its future growth drivers. For the autonomous vehicles market, the company launched ANSYS Autonomy, which allows engineers to develop safer autonomous vehicles. The company also launched ANSYS Minerva, which offers engineers the ability to improve productivity by providing newer capabilities. These newer capabilities include simulation process, data management, process integration and design optimization.The market for simulation software is highly competitive and subject to rapid change. ANSYS' competitors include PTC (PTC), Autodesk (ADSK), Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), Dassault Systèmes (OTCPK:DASTY) and Synopsys (SNPS).The software industry has limited barriers to entry, and as a result, competition continues to intensify. ANSYS' competitive advantages include ease of use of its products, flexibility and quality of its products, file compatibility across computer platforms, range of supported computer platforms, and customer service and support. The company strives to increase its competitive strength by investing in research and development, which allows it to bring new products more frequently to the market. Some of its competitors have greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, and other resources, which help them compete favorably with ANSYS.For the third quarter of 2019, ANSYS reported non-GAAP revenue of $345.5 million, up 18% YoY. Deferred revenue and backlog grew to $650 million, an increase of 19% YoY. Total operating cash flow came in at $120 million, an increase of 9% YoY. ACV (annual contract value) in constant currency grew 11% for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share came in at $1.42, up 8.4% YoY. Overall, the company reported strong results, which is impressive. Ajei Gopal, ANSYS President and CEO, said:In the third quarter, the company closed the acquisitions of Livermore Software Technology Corporation for $779.9 million, and Dynardo for €30.0 million. The acquisition of Livermore will strengthen the automotive segment of ANSYS by combining the simulation technologies of the two companies for autonomous and electric vehicles. The acquisition of Dynardo will strengthen ANSYS’ new product ANSYS Minerva, which will offer customers advanced process integration and design capabilities.ANSYS' competitors include PTC, Autodesk, Cadence Design Systems, Dassault Systèmes and Synopsys. ANSYS' GAAP forward PE ratio is 59.78x, compared to PTC’s 86.23x, Autodesk’s 249.73x, Cadence’s 49.94x, Dassault’s 47.58x and Synopsys’ 43.82x. ANSYS' trailing 12-month price to sales ratio is 17.19x, compared to PTC’s 8.10x, Autodesk’s 14.87x, Cadence’s 9.36x, Dassault’s 9.71x and Synopsys’ 7.36x. ANSYS' trailing 12-month price to cash flow ratio is 51.36x, compared to PTC’s 37.63x, Autodesk’s 45.09x, Cadence’s 30.77x, Dassault’s 32.98x and Synopsys’ 30.96x (at the time of writing).ANSYS is richly valued compared to its competitors. The company has a strong balance sheet with total cash of $732.90 million and total debt of $107.83 million. The company is richly valued because of its growth opportunities. The company is a highly innovative company. Its simulation platform ANSYS workbench coupled with its structural analysis product suite helps engineers and designers develop next generation products. Therefore the demand for the company’s ANSYS workbench and its structural analysis product suite is very high in the market.In the last five years the company’s revenue has grown at a CAGR of 9.07%, and EBITDA has grown at a CAGR of 5.78%. I believe revenue will continue to grow around a CAGR of 9% in the next five years. The company’s trailing 12-month revenue is $1,445.1 million. At a CAGR of 9%, its 2024-end revenue will be $2,223 million, or $25.98 per share. In the last five years, the company’s stock has traded between the price to sales ratio of 9x and 17x. Applying a price to sales ratio of 17x on the company’s 2024-end revenue per share, I get $441.66 as the company’s 2024-end share price. Long-term investors can buy the share during pullbacks to maximize their profit.ANSYS belongs to an industry which is characterized by rapidly changing technology and frequent launch of new products. As a result, existing products can become unmarketable sooner than expected. In order to avoid this, the company must be able to anticipate technological changes, and develop new products or product enhancements, or acquire new technologies in a timely manner. If the company fails to do so, its revenue growth could be negatively impacted.The company invests substantial amount of money for research and development. However, emergence of new competitors, technological advancements in the industry, the company’s entry into new markets and other such factors may require the company to invest more money for research and development than it currently invests. If the company can not do this, its operating results could be negatively impacted.ANSYS is a medium-growth company. Over the past year, the company's stock has rallied significantly. If the momentum continues, the stock could scale higher even from here. However, the chance is low. I believe the company’s near-term growth opportunities are already built into the price of the stock. Going forward, the stock is expected to stay in a range-bound movement, when long-term investors would get ample opportunities to buy the stock. For the long-term, ANSYS is a good business to own.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4348656,105096,2020-05-19T08:40:09-04:00,"We are downgrading Ansys from Buy to Neutral on valuation grounds, after an approx. 50% gain since our initial Buy rating last February.
        Ansys shares have re-rated upwards significantly since our initiation, and now trade on a P/E of 40.7x and a Free Cash Flow Yield of 1.5%.
        While Ansys' revenue CAGR will likely be 10%+ over time, falling margins from continuing investments will limit EPS CAGR to less than 10%.
        COVID-19 creates additional near-term headwinds on important verticals including commercial aerospace, automotive, industrials and energy.
        At $263.51, no upward re-rating is likely, and investor return will likely be in line with EPS growth, i.e. less than 10%. Downgrade to Neutral.","(We previously wrote about Ansys as ""Blue Sky Capital"")We initiated our coverage on Ansys (ANSS) with a Buy rating last February, when the share price was $176.83, and reiterated it in August. Since our initiation the shares have returned approx. 50%, far outperforming the S&P 500 index, which has returned a low-single-digit percentage:With this article, we are downgrading our rating to Neutral on valuation grounds. At the current valuation, with EPS likely to grow at a CAGR of less than 10%, we believe investor returns will also likely be less than 10% and insufficiently attractive.At $263.51, relative to 2019 financials, Ansys shares are trading on a 40.7x P/E and an 1.5% Free Cash Flow (""FCF"") Yield; there is no dividend:The current valuation multiples represent a significant upward re-rating since our initiation last February, when the shares were trading on a 31.1x P/E (relative to 2019E consensus EPS) and 2.7% FCF Yield (relative to FCF for the last-twelve-months to 18Q3). We believe a further upward re-rating is unlikely.With Ansys historically spending a material portion of its FCF on acquisitions, the effect of buybacks on EPS growth will likely be limited to less than 1% (compared to 1.5% if all FCF was spent on buybacks).Ansys EPS CAGR will depend on its revenue CAGR and EBIT margin (share buybacks discussed above). We look at each of these in turn. Revenue CAGR will likely be above 10% but not much more. Prior to 2020, management in fact had an explicit revenue CAGR target of 10%+, which it has largely achieved (10.5% in 2017 and 10.8% in 2018, both non-GAAP and on constant currency). Since 2017 Ansys has focused on Annual Contract Value (""ACV"") as a metric, and this basically reflects the annualised value of bookings that start in each time period, but unlike revenues is not artificially inflated by the upfront recognition of long-term revenues. And ACV has been on a steady trend, generally converging on 10% year-on-year growth each year, apart from one large contract in 18Q4 that pushed 2018 growth to 17%: EBIT margin is shrinking, partially offsetting revenue growth. Continued increases in investments in R&D and sales, and the shrinking EBIT margin that results from these, has also been explicit management targets, and can be seen materialising in the P&L over time: For the current medium-term plan (up to 2022), management is targeting an ACV CAGR of 11%+ (implying a similar revenue CAGR) but an EBIT margin that falls from 45% to 42-44%, which imply an EBIT CAGR of 7.6-9.2%: Ansys faces further near-term headwinds to its EPS growth from COVID-19. As Ansys's CEO explained on the 20Q1 earnings call:The impacted verticals are among the most important ones in Ansys' customer base, with automotive, industrial equipment and energy all being among the top 5 verticals and together contributing 36% of Ansys' ACV. Commercial aerospace is part of aerospace & defense, the second largest vertical with 17% of ACV (an undisclosed part of this being commercial aerospace): COVID-19's negative impact was already visible in 20Q1 results, with ACV flat year-on-year excluding currency, and EBIT as well as EPS suffering large declines due to continuing increases in cost investments: COVID-19's negative impact fed into full-year 2020 outlook, which has been revised downwards, with ACV now expected to grow of 3-9% ex. currency, and full-year EBIT, EPS and operating cashflows all declining from 2019: While Ansys continues to be a high-quality business with a revenues CAGR exceeding 10%, continuing cost investments and near-term headwinds from COVID-19 mean that the medium-term EBIT CAGR is likely to be less than 10%. With buybacks adding less than 1% a year to EPS growth, EPS CAGR is also likely to be less than 10%.At $263.51, Ansys is now on a P/E of 40.7x and a FCF Yield of 1.5%, significantly higher than last February (31.1x and 2.7% respectively), and we believe a further upward re-rating is unlikely.Investor returns from Ansys shares are thus likely to come solely from the share price growing in line with EPS, i.e. at less than 10% annualised.This is an insufficient level of return in our view and is lower than that available from other Technology stocks that trade on similar valuation but have faster growth. We downgrade our rating on Ansys from Buy to Neutral.Note: A track record of my past recommendations can be found here."
4283112,105096,2019-08-08T08:15:10-04:00,"Ansys shares have returned 14.2% in the 6 months since our Buy recommendation in February.Q2 results released on Monday (Aug 5) showed another strong quarter, with 14% year-on-year growth in Annualized Contract Value (ACV).Management raised FY19 outlook and now expects 10-13% ACV growth (ex. FX), despite a weaker China; long-term outlook was unchanged.At$201.80, Ansys is on track to deliver a sustainable 10% p.a. earnings growth and deserves its premium valuation. We reiterate Buy.We also take the opportunity to look at Ansys' historic ACV and share buybacks in more detail to address some investor concerns.","Ansys (ANSS) shares have returned 14.2% in the 6 months since our Buy recommendation (""Ansys: Unique Software Asset With 10-20% Upside"") in February, outperforming the S&P 500 index by 1,100 bps, as shown below:Shares have been more volatile lately, falling 12% from their late July peak but rebounding 4.3% on the day after Q2 results this week (Aug 5). Our investment case is based on Ansys being a high-quality asset with long-term revenue growth rate of near 10% p.a. The 10% annual revenue growth is part of a structural trend in the “democratisation” of simulation software, and also helped by Ansys' expansion of its sales channels. While EBIT growth has lagged revenue growth in the last few years due to investments, we believe operational leverage will eventually materialize, and allow earnings to grow sustainably at approx. 10% p.a.We believe Ansys' 19Q2 results are in line with our investment case, as we will explain below. We also take this opportunity to look at Ansys's historic Annualized Contract Value (""ACV"") and share buybacks in more detail.The key figures for Ansys' Q2 results are as follows:As a reminder, we believe ACV to be the most important metric for Ansys, basically reflecting the annualized value of its bookings. ACV grew +14% year-on-year (in constant currency) in Q2, taking the growth rate for H1 to +10%.Contract wins were the most notable in the high-tech, automotive and aerospace & defence sectors. They included a $49m multi-year deal with a “South Korea high tech leader”, which was the largest single-physics deal in Ansys' history and its third largest deal overall. Partnerships with SAP (SAP) and PTC (PTC) are progressing well.Ansys' P&L figures were more volatile, because the ASC 606 accounting standard means that lease revenues of large contracts are now recognised upfront, rather than spread over time. Ansys' revenues and EBIT showed double-digit growth rates, in both Q1 and H1, due to large contract wins.EBIT margin contracted as expected, due to ongoing investments, including new hires in R&D and sales.As part of the Q2 results announcement, management revised its full-year 2019 outlook slightly upwards, increasing its guidance for revenue, EBIT and EPS (but not cashflows), with the new outlook as shown below:ACV growth for FY19 is now expected to be 10-13% year-on-year (in constant currency), including a 3% contribution from acquisitions, while revenue growth to expected to be 14-17%. EBIT margin for FY19 is to expected to be 43.5-44.5%, compared to 47.4% in 2018, and in the middle of the FY20 target range of 43-45%.The revised outlook includes lower expectations for China, which was less than 5% of Ansys' revenues in 2018 (i.e. less than c. $65m). Management had factored in a $5-10m reduction in their expectations for China in 19H2, but this is offset by greater momentum elsewhere.Management also reiterated their 2020 financial outlook, which includes explicitly targeting revenue growth of at least 10% p.a.:We take the opportunity to look at historic ACV performance, and shows how volatility in quarterly figures are structural and should not worry investors.As mentioned above, ACV is the most important metric for Ansys' growth , reflecting the annualized value of bookings that start in each time period:Management has stated the company looks at ACV targets on a full-year basis, as quarterly figures will be volatile, with Q4 being seasonally the heaviest:The actual ACV figures since 2017 (below) shows that quarter-on-quarter volatility in their dollar value is frequent and not meaningful, especially with Q4 being heavy for seasonality reasons:Similarly, year-on-year growth rates in ACV are also inherently volatile - as shown below, 18Q2 and 19Q1 each supposedly showed a “slowdown” in the year-on-year growth in ACV, only for it to accelerate again later in the year:We take the opportunity to look at historic share buybacks, given some investors are concerned that they have become smaller in size.Ansys has been spending much less in share buyback this year, with only $59m repurchased in 19H1, compared to $117.8m for 18H1. However, as shown below, this appears to be due to a desire to maintain a prudent cash balance of at least $600m, after $285m of cash has been spent on acquisitions year-to-date. A similar pause in buybacks was seen in 18Q2 last year:While Ansys' share buybacks this year have so far been done at an average price of just below $180, this does not seem to reflect any management view on the shares' fair value; instead it may be due to coincidental timing as cash became available at the company. Our evidence for this (as shown below) is that the average price of $179.42 for 19Q1 buybacks implies that most of them were done towards the end of the quarter, despite the share price being much lower at the earlier part of the quarter:Ansys' share buyback authorisation is based on a number shares, not a dollar amount; and 3.5m shares (4% of outstanding shares) remains in the program.Our definition of Free Cash Flow (""FCF"") removes the benefit of working capital inflows and also subtracts share-based compensation as a cost. We only subtract working capital inflows, but do not add back the outflows in 2018, as these are likely lease revenues that are booked early base on ASC 606.Under our definition, Ansys had LTM FCF of $358.0m, implying a FCF yield of 2.1%; P/E is 31.2x (on non-GAAP EPS, which excludes share-based compensation). Details are shown below:We believe Ansys' current valuation multiples are fair, given the company's resilient earnings and structural growth potential.Ansys continues to deliver strong ACV growth, in line with our assumption of a long-term sustainable revenue growth of 10% p.a. EBIT margin has been shrinking due to investments as expected, but it will have reached its target level in 2019 and likely to stabilise thereafter. We believe Ansys is on track to deliver a sustainable earnings growth of 10% p.a. At $201.89, Ansys' shares are on 31.2x P/E and 2.1% FCF Yield, reflective of the company's resilient earnings and structural growth potential. Ansys likely to deliver long-term investor return of 10% p.a., based on earnings growing 10% p.a. and valuation multiples remaining stable. As an unique asset in enterprise software, it may have further upside from strategic or private equity interest. We reiterate our Buy recommendation."
4309171,24361,2019-11-26T09:30:55-05:00,"ANSYS is building on its strong legacy position in simulation software with leading partners to extend its reach into new customer, market, and product opportunities.Management believes its addressable market opportunity could triple in less than a decade, with strong core market growth boosted by markets like auto electrification/automation, 5G, IoT, and additive manufacturing.ANSYS doesn't look cheap, or even reasonably-priced by conventional metrics, but that's par for this course, and there are few real comps in terms of growth and margins.","I'm a big believer in paying for quality, but it's hard not to pause at the 12x-plus revenue and 39x-plus PE multiples on ANSYS (NASDAQ:ANSS) shares today. While ANSYS is an exceptional software company and is likely to see well-above-average revenue growth and operating margins over the next decade, it's tough to comfortably model the growth it will take to justify that level of expectation - that's not saying that ANSYS can't do it, but not many software companies have lived up to that level of expectation.What should investors do with the stock, then? If you're a growth or momentum investor, you probably don't care that much about valuation anyway, so carry on with whatever metrics you like. If you're more value-conscious, though, the best I can offer now is to note that ANSYS shares have had relatively frequent double-digit pullbacks over the years, so there will likely be an opportunity to pay in at a slightly better price, though I'd never expect ANSYS to look conventionally ""cheap"" unless something went massively wrong in the economy and/or stock market.While ANSYS has built a leading position in simulation software (roughly 20% share) largely on its own steam, management has nevertheless shown a willingness to use partnerships to open up even more growth opportunities. The company works with SAP (SAP) to provide its digital twinning capabilities for SAP's Predictive Engineering Insights, and SAP has been looking at this as an opportunity to leverage its large existing footprint into the predictive maintenance automation niche.More recent partnerships are likewise promising. ANSYS partnered with PTC (NASDAQ:PTC) to integrate its Discovery Live simulation offerings with PTC's Creo platform. With ANSYS looking at Discovery Live as a means of increasing its penetration of simulation earlier in the design process, and PTC not having much in the way of its own simulation capabilities, this should be a win-win, particularly if ANSYS can also reap some benefit from PTC's early move into industrial IoT markets.ANSYS also recently struck a partnership agreement with Rockwell (ROK). Under this agreement, the two companies will work together to provide a digital twinning solution for factory automation. In essence, the companies will work on products that will allow customers to model factory automation in real time - optimizing process flow, the arrangement of production lines, and so on. While ANSYS hasn't done much of this on their own (to the best of my knowledge), it's a logical extension of its capabilities, and Rockwell is a great partner to have (and for Rockwell, it could prove to be an invaluable tool in securing more long-term service revenue).There wasn't much to fault in ANSYS's third quarter results earlier this month. Revenue rose about 18%, with strong growth in ""lease"" license revenue offsetting minimal growth in perpetual licenses and complementing mid-teens growth in maintenance and service. While operating margin contracted a bit, 43%-plus operating margin is still exceptional in the sector.ACV growth lagged, though, at 14% yoy, and ACV missed expectations for the quarter. Moreover, guidance for ACV in the fourth quarter wasn't particularly strong. I don't think this is signaling an imminent downturn, a diverge between revenue and ACV is worth watching.Part of what impresses me about ANSYS's current growth is that it is coming despite downturns in a lot of important end-markets. Auto companies contribute a mid-teens percentage of ANSYS's revenue, but the downturn that has hit many auto suppliers hasn't really impacted ANSYS - auto OEMs are still spending on simulation products, particularly those focused on vehicle electrification and autonomous driving. Likewise, while many companies with significant exposure to ""electronics"" have seen sharper downturns, 5G and IoT demand has been quite robust for ANSYS.Between my own outlook for ANSYS's core markets and the company's September Analyst Day, there's a lot to look forward to with this company. ANSYS already has about 20% market share in a market that the company estimates is worth about $6.6 billion a year (in 2018), and rivals like Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) and Dassault (OTCPK:DASTY) really haven't gained meaningful ground on ANSYS despite both companies turning to M&A to build out their simulation software capabilities.In fact, the biggest ""competition"" ANSYS seems to face is traditional ways of doing things - about 70% of product simulation budgets still go to physical modeling, and even among companies that use software simulation, ANSYS estimates that software simulation penetration is under 20% in many cases. With engineering challenges becoming increasingly complex (electrifying cars adds a host of challenges, to say nothing of autonomous driving, for just one example), and ANSYS actively working to offer more affordable solutions for early stages of the design process, this is a significant growth opportunity.ANSYS believes its addressable market could triple over the next seven years, with high single-digit growth in its core market, and 20% to 30%-plus growth in new high-growth opportunities like auto electrification/automation, 5G, and industrial IoT, as well as ""ancillary"" opportunities like additive manufacturing and digital twinning.I don't expect ANSYS to triple its revenue over the next three years, but I do believe ANSYS will deliver exceptional growth over the next five and 10 years. ANSYS has an unmatched capability set across structural/mechanical simulation, fluid flow, electromagnetics, multiphysics, electronics, and circuit design, and with customer retention rates of over 90%, the company should be a major beneficiary of increasing design complexity across markets in aerospace, energy, autos, electronics, semiconductors, materials, industrial equipment, and perhaps healthcare (an area where ANSYS ""punches below its weight"" due to low industrywide adoption).I expect mid-teens revenue growth from ANSYS over the next five years and low double-digit growth over the next decade. Growth in autos, 5G, IoT, additive manufacturing, and twinning could drive even faster revenue growth, but I'm already expecting the coming decade to see greater growth than the trailing decade, and that's typically an aggressive outlook. Although ANSYS's cash flow has been a little lackluster lately (relative to its own history), I expect an eventual recovery into the mid-30%'s and mid-teens long-term FCF growth.The biggest risk I see, beyond the market deciding to pay less for growth stories, is that companies adopt a significantly different approach to product design and simulation. It would be very difficult and expensive to replicate all of the physical modeling knowhow within ANSYS's offerings, but I suppose a future competitor could combine machine learning/AI and cloud-based distribution into a more formidable offering.Forget trying to make ANSYS work from a conventional valuation approach - that's just not going to work. The shares are expensive on an FCF basis unless you're comfortable with a high-teens long-term FCF growth rate, and likewise, the shares trade above historical norms for software companies with this sort of growth and margin profile - though admittedly, there are so few companies like ANSYS that I'd use ""historical norms"" with some caution. In any case, while ANSYS is an excellent company, it doesn't really fit into my core approach; I'd be tempted to buy a small position on a pullback just because I like the company so much, but the valuation is in its own world."
4275334,102547,2019-07-17T01:14:29-04:00,"ANSYS operates within a mission-critical niche;This growing niche has a disproportionate influence on the future of technology;Since its IPO in 1996, ANSYS has outperformed the S&P 500 by a very wide margin;What qualitative and quantitative factors explain ANSYS’ outstanding performance?Will such factors persist in the future? And is the company good value at the present?","Image Source: freerangestock.com - Free Commercial ImagesPlease skip the following introduction if you have read my previous articles.- Warren BuffettWhat is a wonderful company, and what is 'quality merchandise' from an investing standpoint? The most constructive definition to address this question is Warren Buffett's concept of ""economic moat"", a long-lasting competitive advantage that allows a given company to harvest above-average returns on its capital, even when faced with economic downturns or powerful competitors.A quality investing strategy should, therefore, capture the fundamental nature of Buffett's philosophy. Here, the aim is to identify high-quality stocks - or ""compounders"" - trading at reasonable prices by calculating a simple Quality Score based on 12 fundamental factors related to the actual business and to its intrinsic economic characteristics. These are (possibly) the qualitative and quantitative factors that best capture the elusive 'quality dimension' of a specific company, at least according to Buffett and to other investors in these best-of-breed companies like Charlie Munger, Chuck Akre, and Joel Greenblatt. The intention is not to discuss fleeting quarterly results (far from it) but rather to analyze and find superior companies and business models capable of compounding value for many years into the future. To calculate the Quality Score, the following questions will be addressed:1) Presence of strong and enduring competitive advantages; 2) Favorable market dynamics and relative positioning; 3) Presence of multiple and complementary cash flow generators; 4) Resilience to technological disruption and to obsolescence; 5) Presence of market leadership; 6) Presence of pricing power; 7) Presence of high and persistent Cash Returns on Invested Capital; 8) Strong cash-generation ability; 9) Presence of superior gross profitability; 10) Presence of superior revenue growth, with improving sales momentum; 11) Presence of solid risk management and capital allocation policies; 12) Presence of a solid financial position, with little debt.To calculate the Quality Score, one (1) point is awarded when the answer is fundamentally positive (""Yes""); minus one (-1) point is subtracted when the answer is essentially negative (""No""); no points are added or subtracted (0) when there is too much uncertainty or when negative and positive factors are essentially in equilibrium. 'High-quality companies' are the ones with a Quality Score of ""6"" or above. Let us then calculate the Quality Score for ANSYS Inc. (ANSS).The history of ANSYS Inc. starts at Westinghouse Astronuclear Laboratory (WANL), a futuristic division of Westinghouse established in 1959 with the aim of developing innovative technologies such as nuclear space propulsion (once classified as a secret) and even nuclear-powered artificial hearts. Both these technologies were quietly shelved in the Seventies; however, it was at the now-extinct WANL that a young John Swanson, the division's head of structural design, pioneered the application of Finite Element Methods (FEM) to engineering.A numerical technique, FEM allows the implementation of Finite Element Analysis (FEA), which in turn can be used to predict how a physical entity - like a bridge or a propeller blade - behaves under certain real-world conditions. Recognizing its future worth as a computational tool for performing engineering simulations, Swanson then suggested the development of general-purpose FEA software to Westinghouse. But the company refused to implement the suggestion, and so he decided to leave his employer to start Swanson Analysis System in 1970. Later called 'ANSYS' (from 'ANalysis SYStem'), this firm benefited from a first-mover advantage that enabled it to steadily build a strong market presence over the decades.ANSYS Competitive Advantages | A Highly Favorable Benefit to Cost RatioIndeed, Swanson anticipated that prospective customers could save a substantial amount of resources if they could employ a general-purpose software code to perform the complex and time-consuming calculations which engineers were then either doing manually or were unable to do. And in this value proposition lies ANSYS' foundational competitive advantage, as the costs of employing its software were (and still are) greatly offset by the tangible benefits derived during the development of a given product - clearly, it is much faster and cheaper to run a computer simulation to design, validate and test a product than to build a prototype in order to test it under an immense variety of scenarios (nowadays, for instance, automakers are able to reduce the time needed to validate their autonomous vehicles from 10.000 years down to just 2 or 3 years by utilizing ANSYS' broad range of offerings).ANSYS Competitive Advantages | A Broad and Complementary Set of ApplicationsAmassed through organic and inorganic investments over the decades, ANSYS does, in fact, have a very comprehensive set of CAE (Computer-aided Engineering) software offerings that distinguishes it from most direct rivals. This also serves as a barrier to new entrants, because it would take years to develop all the distinct codes necessary to compete effectively with ANSYS across multiple fronts.Within this space, some smaller players sell Computational Fluid Dynamics software (CFD), while others sell multiphysics simulation or structural analysis software. However, within its core markets, ANSYS is able to offer these 3 distinct applications - and many others - in a more cohesive and complete manner (please note that larger competitors are also able to provide cohesive, cross-domain solutions; however, this area of the market still functions essentially as an oligopoly). (Update, July 18, 2019, 1:30 p.m.: The preceding paragraph has been edited to remove incorrect references to Computer Aided Design (CAD) software.)Through Workbench, for example, some of ANSYS' programs can interact with each other within a single environment, a fact that results in higher productivity by tying together the entire simulation process. Another example is given by ANSYS AIM, a more user-friendly, workflow-driven advanced simulation tool that provides multiphysics problem-solving by combining fluids, thermal, structures and electromagnetics (i.e. the distinct 'physics') in a single-window design.All these different solutions ensure that both the lower- and the high-end of the market are being covered by ANSYS. The company is also reaching new audiences by establishing partnerships with players such as PTC (PTC), SAP (SAP) and Synopsis (SNPS) that complement and bring superior simulation capabilities to these firms' solutions. Of course, the fact that potential competitors are using ANSYS' software is also a testament to the company's technological prowess. (Update, July 18, 2019, 1:30 p.m.: The preceding paragraph has been corrected to reflect that Siemens is a client, not a partner, of ANSYS.)ANSYS Competitive Advantages | Strong Switching BarriersThrough the years, these broad and integrated offerings became deeply embedded in the daily workflow of ANSYS' numerous customers, making them an indispensable part of their operations. The company spearheaded the application of multiprocessing techniques to FEA computation and was also recognized as one of the leaders in the area of multiphysics problem-solving, a fact that extended its appeal to more markets.As a result of this expertise, the company now enjoys entrenched industry relationships generated both by its specialized know-how and by the high switching barriers imposed on customers: indeed, from the customers' point of view, the problem with this kind of complex software is that it requires a steep and long learning curve to be fully mastered; once mastered, clients become very reluctant to switch providers because of the financial costs and downtime risk to their businesses and, in particular, because of the sheer time it takes to learn how to use alternative solutions.And these switching barriers are carefully cultivated from an early stage by ANSYS, as the company now has thousands of students and academic institutions throughout the world utilizing its software for a discounted price, or even for free. This guarantees that students and academics become familiar with ANSYS' set of solutions, which in turn all but ensures future demand. For designers, engineers and researchers, ANSYS is also a valuable tool to learn and master because it improves their employability and career prospects across different domains, hierarchies, and industries.Indeed, the company's solutions have wide application across many domains and industries. As mentioned by ANSYS, ""If you've ever seen a rocket launch, flown on an airplane, driven a car, used a computer, touched a mobile device, crossed a bridge, or put on wearable technology, chances are you've used a product where ANSYS software played a critical role in its creation"".From Boeing (BA) to Caterpillar (CAT), and from NVIDIA (NVDA), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Medtronic (MDT), to Nestlé (OTCPK:NSRGY) and General Electric (GE), the company's customers form a sizable selection of some of the most influential manufacturers in the world. This extraordinary omnipresence, extremely varied customer base, and ANSYS' complementary sources of cash flow, all mitigate the cyclicality inherent to its end markets and dilute the risks associated with excessive concentration, as no single customer accounts for more than 5% of the firm's revenue.For most solutions, customers may acquire a perpetual license (with the right to purchase ongoing maintenance, support, and upgrades on an annual basis), or they may lease products on a fixed-term basis for a fee that comprises the license, maintenance, support, and upgrades. For some products, like ANSYS' Discovery Product Suite, clients can acquire an annual subscription for a specific number of named users that also includes the license, maintenance, support, and upgrades.Lease licenses and maintenance services account for 80% of the revenues. The company's leading expertise, integrated and complementary offerings, and the presence of strong switching barriers all contribute to high renewal rates of around 95%; together with its large installed base of about 45.000 customers distributed throughout the globe, this fact ensures that ANSYS enjoys the benefits of recurring and predictable revenues (currently, around 75% of the company's revenue is recurring).On average, each customer acquired 3 or more solutions and contributed with approximately USD $29.500 to ANSYS' top-line in 2018; however, because it serves customers fluctuating in scale from minute consulting firms to the world's major industrial conglomerates, these numbers have a high variance. The company's sources of revenue by geography are not very diversified, though (please see image below). This is to be expected, as most industrial manufacturers with a truly global footprint are mostly concentrated in just 9 countries (India, China, Japan, Italy, France, Germany, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States). China remains somewhat underpenetrated, but the country is a promising arena posting strong double-digit growth thanks to its investments in 5G, Artificial Intelligence, and Semiconductor technologies.The scenario changes slightly by end market, as no single industry was responsible for more than a third of the company's Annual Contract Value (ACV); however, High Tech is right at this threshold as it contributed 33% to ANSYS' ACV in the first quarter of 2019. But this is equally to be expected, as the all-embracing High Tech basket encompasses everything from telecommunications to chipmakers and to computer networking companies. All in all, ANSYS' has in fact diversified sources of cash flow that provide both optionality and new runways for growth.And runways for growth should be wide and long going forward. At the moment, we are arriving at a brave new world of technological advancement thanks to the rise of digital-industrial technologies. This transformational wave is being fuelled by ground-breaking innovations* that are unleashing massive change in the way products are developed, assembled and operated - and ANSYS, through its comprehensive offerings, seems well-positioned to take advantage of this change of paradigm from 'Industry 3.0' to 'Industry 4.0'.* These technologies are Simulation; Big Data and Analytics; Autonomous Robots; The Internet of Things; Cybersecurity; The Cloud; Additive Manufacturing; Horizontal & Vertical System Integration; and Augmented Reality.ANSYS | Simulation Software in the New Industrial ParadigmThis is because simulation will become an imperative for manufacturers dealing with heightened competitive forces and extremely complicated products - indeed, as products become faster, smaller, greener, smarter and increasingly connected, the engineering complexities brought by this new paradigm are also becoming astounding. To tame this extreme complexity, mitigate risks, reduce expenses and increase performance, the company intends to make simulation truly pervasive by advancing it beyond its traditional use case as a tool utilized only in the prototyping, validation, and testing phases.Within this novel and demanding context, ANSYS foresees that simulation will be used throughout a product's lifecycle, from the ideation phase as a digital exploration tool (before decisions and costs are locked in) all the way to its operational stage by the use of the so-called 'digital twins'*, for instance. Imbued with many obvious benefits, a digital twin is a real-time digital replica of a physical entity (such as an aircraft engine or even a whole country: now, Singapore has its own digital twin) that can be employed, for example, to perform real-time optimization or to diagnose, detect and predict faults occurring during a physical product's operation; depending on its design and purposes, more advanced digital twins can also learn continuously through machine learning and update themselves to characterize or improve the current and future status of the physical twin. Considering its immense potential, Gartner (IT) has recently included digital twin technology on its Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends.* Digital twin technology is a descendant of the so-called 'pairing technology', which was used by NASA since the dawn of space exploration to control, maintain and even repair complex systems located far beyond the Earth's atmosphere. In a vivid example of its usefulness, pairing technology (and duct tape) was used to rescue the astronauts of the Apollo 13 mission in 1970 - sure, the great Jim Lovell would be capable of safely ""landing a washing machine"", let alone a spaceship, but that washing machine would have had to be working as designed.Simulation is thus becoming the method of choice to understand and act upon the multiphysical intricacies generated by this emerging generation of smart components, assets, systems, and processes. And, of course, ANSYS is bound to profit as simulation becomes a differentiator or even a necessity for companies of all sizes, from mega- to micro-cap - indeed, through the Microsoft (MSFT) Azure platform, the new ANSYS Cloud solution is now being aimed at small and medium-sized businesses without the internal resources required to run High-performance Computing (HPC) applications. Clearly, this new offering has the potential to open up a large and forsaken segment of the market for the benefit of ANSYS.ANSYS | Providing Engineering Simulation for AllFrom the smaller customers' standpoint, the main benefits of adopting Cloud-based Design [and Manufacturing] (CBDM) solutions such as ANSYS Cloud are (as expected) improved scalability, shorter times to market and lower cost barriers: first, features like SaaS, virtualization, multi-tenancy and pay-per-use can only be fully attainable through such cloud-based solutions, a fact that will start to 'democratize' the access to HPC for product design; second, because it provides access to dozens or even hundreds of CPU cores in parallel (up from the 4-8 cores typically available on conventional workstations), CBDM also has the potential to execute simulations hundreds of times faster than the ones running on single engineering workstations; and third, thanks to its capacity to pool computing resources from data centers, CBDM will enable customers to swiftly scale-up or down computing requirements so as to respond in a more resonant manner to the ever-changing market demands - in fact, since in-house HPC servers are not always fully loaded over the lifetime of a project, many CPU cores are regularly unused and wasted.ANSYS | Expected Market Value and Growth RatesDepending on the sources, the global simulation software market is now expected to expand at a CAGR of 8.9% - 16% up to 2025; this market is also anticipated to reach a value between USD 10.0 and 16.7 billion over the same period (please note that such wildly different estimates are a reflection of the uncertainty surrounding this space). More broadly, the Boston Consulting Group expects that 'Industry 4.0' will add a staggering USD 11.0 billion in incremental global GDP over the next few years. Within this setting, the megatrends surrounding 5G, Electrification and Autonomous Engineering will be especially important to ANSYS.The shift from 4G to 5G is expected to have a metamorphic effect on connectivity, and it will pave the way for the evolution of numerous technologies ranging from industrial IoT to holographic videos, and to driverless cars, among countless others. However, 5G systems present formidable design and verification challenges that can only be addressed with powerful simulation tools.The same heightened demands also occur with Electrification and with Autonomous Engineering, as it is not possible to put an autonomous aircraft in the air or a driverless vehicle on the road, for instance, without satisfying a multitude of safety and other standards, and without developing complex technologies such as new radars or propulsion systems; integrated engineering simulation tools, like the ones provided by ANSYS, are now fundamental to fast-track the introduction of these disruptive solutions, to reduce R&D costs, and to deliver safe and dependable products. ANSYS will certainly grow along with these transformative changes.With approximately 25% market share, ANSYS is currently the uncontested leader in engineering simulation software. Nowadays, its wide-ranging suite of solutions gives it unequaled dominance in a very fragmented arena characterized by the presence of numerous competitors of various sizes, both public and private, like COMSOL and Dassault Systèmes (OTCPK:DASTY).Despite not being 'like-for-like companies', other peers include the aforementioned Siemens, Altair (ALTR), Cadence (CDNS) and Autodesk (ADSK). According to the firm, 98 of the top 'Fortune 100' industrial companies are now using solutions provided by ANSYS; however, some of ANSYS' potential, partial, and present competitors are also industry consolidators endowed with the technical resources and the financial muscle necessary to disrupt the company's leading position in its main markets.In this time of unprecedented transformation, the average life expectancy for any given S&P 500 company is only 20 years or so, down from 60 years in the Fifties; what's more, the average tenure of companies integrating the S&P 500 is expected to contract to only 12 years by 2027, which means that turnover is becoming faster and faster. But tech companies can be even more ephemeral, as attested by the litany of victims within the sector over the past decades - of course, such death rate takes place because high-tech companies like ANSYS are those engaged in securing sales from high-attrition areas characterized by the emergence of disruptive markets and technologies.Specifically, disruption for ANSYS can come from competitors offering faster results, significantly lower costs or better and wider simulation capabilities. Indeed, while no rival can really match the current breadth of ANSYS' solutions, many competing firms may deliver faster or more accurate solutions for specific applications (such as meshing a complicated design or implementing nonlinear structural analysis).As mentioned above, other consolidators like Siemens and Dassault (or even Autodesk) are gobbling up these niche firms, and one of their purposes might well be to challenge ANSYS on its own turf. These are larger, formidable, and resourceful opponents. In particular, Siemens has made a strong statement not long ago saying that it wishes to become one of the main players within this space and contest both ANSYS and Dassault's SIMULIA. Siemens is a competitor of ANSYS, but it is also a significant customer. Awkwardly for the German conglomerate, ANSYS' software is deeply integrated into its business processes, and it will take time to replace it in favor of Siemens' own solutions.While the market for simulation software remains attractive, this tougher competitive attrition might exert pricing pressure over the long-term in this lucrative area of enterprise software. However, the portfolios of these competitors do not perfectly overlap ANSYS' unique portfolio, at least for the time being. Furthermore, disruption won't happen overnight for the company because its collection of state-of-the-art solutions is both hard to emulate and hard to displace.But the firm also needs to invest significant resources on a continual basis to keep up with the challenges imposed by increasingly demanding customers and by increasingly complex products; being so, the company will certainly struggle to remain competitive if it fails to keep up with today's short-cycle, fast-changing technological landscape. Another threat is posed by smaller rivals opting to compete with ANSYS by means of open source licensing, which is an option growing in popularity - despite being much weaker and remoter, its widespread acceptance could have an impact both on ANSYS' sales and on its capacity to generate returns and excess cash.And, without a doubt, cash flow is one of the most accurate yardsticks for gauging the performance of well-established companies. In spite of Wall Street's fixation on earnings, a firm's cash-generative ability - or the lack of it - is what really determines its continuing capacity both to return money to shareholders and to reinvest cash back into the business (or to pay down debt). This is the reason why Warren Buffett says that ""Cash is to a business as oxygen is to an individual: never thought about when it is present; the only thing in mind when it is absent."" Here, by scrutinizing the following parameters, the purpose is to assess how well ANSYS has been translating inputs and sales into hard cash.ANSYS | Positive Free Cash Flow Generation & FCF per ShareANSYS has always been Free Cash Flow-positive over the past decade, a period through which cash flow generation increased by 191% (from USD 165 million in 2009 to USD 480 million currently, using TTM figures). On a per share basis, FCF has improved by 183% over the same period. Among its chosen peer group*, only Cadence performed better, as its FCF per share increased by a staggering 3100% over the past 10 years.However, Cadence started out from a very depressed basis in 2010-2011. Dassault increased FCF per share by 143% and Autodesk actually saw its FCF per share decline by -45% during the period. However, it should be mentioned that Autodesk's FCF, as well as ADSK's cash flow-based parameters, were severely impacted by its restructuring as it transitioned to the cloud. In the future, ADSK's cash-generative ability will certainly recover.*Again, due to their different portfolios and markets, it is not possible to establish a suitable like-for-like comparison between these companies. With the exception of Siemens, which is a vast conglomerate of industrial businesses, Cadence, Dassault, and Autodesk are the firm's largest peers (as stated by ANSYS) by market cap.ANSYS | Free Cash Flow to Sales (5-year average)Generating plentiful and growing FCF is always desirable but the amount should be placed in context: in this situation, FCF margins above 10% usually indicate a very high ability to turn sales into true liquidity. ANSYS current FCF/Sales (TTM) ratio is 36%, a truly exceptional percentage that translates a very healthy conversion of sales into FCF; on average, this number has been around the 36.8% mark during the last 5 years of activity. Here, ANSYS clearly tops its peer group, as shown by the image below.ANSYS | Cash Conversion Rate (5-year average)As measured by Free Cash Flow/Net Income, ANSYS' CCR averaged 136% between 2014 and 2018. Again, this reflects a healthy conversion rate, since ratios above 100% usually translate excellent liquidity. ANSYS does not top its peer group in this example, but the absolute percentage is still very strong. There is a relationship between the CCR and the accrual ratio. Calculated as (Net Income - FCF)/Total Assets, the accrual ratio provides a means to recognize companies with low non-cash earnings relative to their cash flow. When FCF is larger than Net Income (translated in a CCR > 1 in any given year), cash earnings are higher than accrual earnings, which usually means that earnings quality is high. As showed by Sloan and others, over extended periods of time, companies with low accrual ratios like ANSYS, Dassault or Cadence tend to outperform companies with high accrual ratios.ANSYS | CapEx/Operating Cash Flow (5-year average)As demonstrated by this ratio, ANSYS does not need to reinvest a large chunk of the cash generated by operations just to keep on functioning: making ANSYS an exceedingly capital-light business, on average, CapEx only consumed 4.6% of the company's OCF over the past 5 years, which indicates that the company is capable of generating surplus capital with relative ease. Naturally, lower intra-industry average ratios are in general better than higher ratios; however, its long-term trend needs to be monitored because a low and falling ratio can signal lethargic demand, heightened competition or absence of reinvestment opportunities. Nowadays, none of these situations seems to be affecting ANSYS (Note: ADSK's CapEx/OCF was not considered because the ratio was heavily distorted by the company's restructuring).ANSYS | CapEx/Sales (5-year average)This ratio also gauges investment intensity by showing how many dollars of CapEx a firm spends per each dollar of Sales. Without surprise, the investment intensity of ANSYS is extraordinarily low even amongst its capital-light cohort: over the last 5 years, ANSYS only had capital expenditures of USD 1.8 dollars per USD 100 dollars of sales. All in all, it seems that ANSYS is, in fact, a very cash-generative company. But how good is the company at converting invested capital into cash?""While early valuation models emphasized the relationship between growth and value - higher growth firms were assigned higher values - more recent iterations of these models have noted that growth unaccompanied by excess returns creates no value."" (Aswath Damodaran)Indeed, too many investors are focused on sales and on EPS growth while ignoring that such growth is inconsequential, or even harmful, unless it generates a positive return on invested capital. As a corollary, the above quote also suggests that the greater the excess returns generated through time, the greater the value generated by a business. In this context, and because it shows how much actual cash a company generates based on each dollar it invests into operations, a particularly important metric is the Cash Return On Invested Capital (CROIC).So, is ANSYS creating tangible value for shareholders? For practical purposes - and to err on the side of caution - let's then use Damodaran's data and assume that ANSYS' average cost of capital hovered around 9.0% and 9.5% between 2009 and 2018. As shown below, ANSYS' cash returns have always exceeded its cost of capital by a large margin except in 2009 and 2010*.* Returns on invested capital were calculated as proposed by Michael Mauboussin, but NOPAT was replaced by FCF in the numerator.This indicates that, on balance, capital allocation at ANSYS has been highly accretive to long-term value creation - even when goodwill is included, the company's CROIC has averaged approximately 20% over the past decade of operations (without goodwill, CROIC would have reached an average of 30%). For the vast majority of businesses, both intense competition and management's missteps* gradually erode the returns on capital down toward the cost of capital; however, companies with strong competitive advantages like ANSYS tend to enjoy higher returns for many years, or even for many decades.The image below corroborates ANSYS' positive performance, as it shows a wide and largely favorable spread (illustrated by the yellow polygons) between the year-over-year growth rate of free cash flow and the year-over-year growth rate of invested capital over the last few years. Most of the time, FCF generation increased faster or much faster than ANSYS' reinvestment rate (please note: caution is needed when interpreting this graph, because investments can take several years to bear fruit; this graph is only useful as a possible indicator of the trend and magnitude of the spread between IC and FCF).This is also confirmed by the company's stellar performance against the S&P 500: between 1996 (when it IPO'ed) and the present day, an investment of USD 10.000 in ANSYS would have grown at a CAGR of about 20.0% to reach a value of USD 606.800; in glaring contrast, the same amount invested in the S&P 500 would have yielded approximately USD 59.300.* Of course, management can make or break any business. That's the reason why Buffet said that he tries ""to invest in businesses that are so wonderful that an idiot can run them. Because sooner or later, one will."" The quality of a business often compensates for bad management, at least for a time.Without revenue growth, though, a high-return business behaves essentially like a bond. Value is compounded much faster when high returns on capital are combined with high revenue growth. That's the sweet spot for any company but it is also an elusive target, as firms growing faster than 20% in real terms typically grow sales at only 8% within 5 years, and at only 5% within 10 years.However, ANSYS seems to be defying this typical rate of decay, as the company has been, in general, delivering relatively strong year-over-year revenue expansion throughout the past decade (2015 was a weaker year, though, with revenues growing only 0.72% YoY). Over that period, ANSYS never posted negative sales growth. Driven by the High Tech, Automotive, and Aerospace & Defense industry verticals, the company's latest results were again encouraging: beating expectations, first quarter 2019 GAAP revenue expanded by 12% (or 15% in constant currency) to USD 317 million, an amount that was translated in record quarterly operating cash flows of USD 152 million.On their part, year-over-year lease license revenue grew by about 45% as a result of higher multiyear contracts; services revenue also improved by approximately the same percentage, while maintenance revenue grew by 15%. However, perpetual revenues decreased by 9%.Thanks in large measure to sizable investments in 5G, AI, Electrification, Semiconductors and Autonomous Vehicles, revenues expanded by 13% and by 42% in the Americas and in Asia-Pacific, respectively. Yet, due mainly to sluggish demand in Germany, EMEA sales contracted by about 7%. ANSYS now expects revenues of approximately USD 1422 - 1472 million for the current fiscal year, an amount that would indicate an expansion of about 12% relative to 2018 results.But not all types of expansion produce excess returns, as a vast body of research concludes that ""corporate events associated with asset expansion (i.e., acquisitions, public equity offerings, public debt offerings, and bank loan initiations) tend to be followed by periods of abnormally low returns, whereas events associated with asset contraction (i.e., spinoffs, share repurchases, debt prepayments, and dividend initiations) tend to be followed by periods of abnormally high returns"" (Cooper et al, 2008).For U.S. firms, much of this asset expansion is fueled by acquisitions. Regrettably, despite all the hype surrounding acquisitive moves, M&A activity is often a source of medium- or long-term underperformance. One example of how asset inflation impacts performance is provided by Medtronic, which was a company subjected to this same quality assessment back in 2017: despite fulfilling the criteria of a high-quality company, this consummate Dividend Aristocrat meaningfully underperformed the S&P 500 after the massive acquisition of Covidien which transformed MDT into the world's largest medical device maker. This is the reason why, when evaluating the quality dimension of an acquisitive company like ANSYS, an important aspect to consider is the business' gross profitability.For this calculation, gross profits are preferably used instead of bottom-line results because they are not usually affected by accounting tricks; moreover, gross profits are also not impacted by R&D and Advertising expenses, or by other capital expenditures incurred to improve a company's competitive positioning. In general, the most productive firms are able to exceed a consistent year-over-year ratio of 1:3 (33%) between their gross profits and their total assets.There's no hard-and-fast rule to analyze a given company along this dimension, but the calculation should be made both with and without goodwill just to make sure the firm is not overpaying for unproductive acquisitions over time. In ANSYS' case, goodwill has been responsible for about 50% of the company's total assets throughout the last decade, showing that ANSYS has indeed been a very acquisitive company.In some cases, the calculation should also adjust for the presence of a large percentage of cash and short-term investments in the balance sheet - for instance, when 'excess' cash is included in the calculation, companies like Microsoft and Alphabet (GOOG) fail to reach the minimum 33% threshold of gross profitability; however, after adjusting for its presence, it is possible to verify that these two cash-rich firms (cash in both cases comprise about 50% of their total assets) are in fact quite productive and profitable relative to their assets. In ANSYS' case, cash and short-term investments currently account for 23.8% of assets.As shown by the image, relative to its total assets, ANSYS is the least productive company among its peer group (the calculations included both cash and goodwill, but ANSYS remains the worst performer even after adjusting for the existence of those entries). On average, the firm's gross profitability hovered around 24.5% during the past decade, which is a manifestly low percentage for a software provider. Nevertheless, it is encouraging to verify that the company is evolving in the right direction and that it has, at long last, breached the minimum 33% threshold of asset productivity in 2018. And, of course, financial markets tend to reward companies moving in the right direction.However, despite being a valuable metric, gross profitability only indicates how productive a company is before subtracting all expenses apart from COGS. By discarding both SG&A and the all-important R&D investments, such an approach fails to deliver a more complete view of ANSYS' operating parameters. And this is why the best method is to decompose these parameters into gross and operating profitability and then evaluate then together to assess the relationship between expense and income: when operating income is deflated by the book value of assets, the situation changes in favor of ANSYS as only Cadence reached a similar average operating profitability over the past few years (but only between 2011 and 2018, when Cadence was actually operating income-positive). Indeed, ANSYS operating profitability has averaged 12.6% during the last 8 years, whereas Cadence and Dassault averaged 11% and 7.8%, respectively, over the same period (Autodesk was operating income-negative in 2015, 2016 and 2017).""You can determine the strength of a business over time by the amount of agony they go through in raising prices"" (Warren Buffett).Judging by the premium prices it has been able to charge over the years, ANSYS surely seems to be a strong business: by comparing different issues of the Federal Acquisition Service Authorized Information Technology Schedule Price List, it is possible to verify that ANSYS Multiphysics' price, for instance, increased by almost 41% between 2013 and the present day. For ANSYS, a price hike of this magnitude is nothing to agonize over or feel insecure about.Moreover, if pricing power is the capacity to raise prices over time without losing customers, then ANSYS' power is likely to be substantial - as mentioned above, the company is not losing sales or competitiveness, as revealed both by its market share gains (which are roughly reflected on ANSYS' growing revenues) and by its sizable returns on capital (which demonstrate that rivals are not eroding its profits).In a more conventional sense, though, gross margins are still the most used indicator of a firm's pricing power. As shown further down, ANSYS 5-year average gross margins are not the highest among its peer group and yet, on an absolute sense, they are still impressive; but, on the other hand, the company has been able to expand them slightly faster than competitors' margins over the past 5 years - now standing at 88.6% according to TTM data, ANSYS gross margins have dilated by 5% during the last half decade, whereas Dassault, Cadence, and Autodesk were able to expand their margins by 0.7%, 2.2% and 4.5%, respectively, over the same interval.However, as an indicator of pricing power and to use Toffler's terminology, gross margins are probably more applicable to 'second wave' companies manufacturing physical products (like cars or beer, for example) than to 'third wave' software firms like ANSYS. And that's because software providers do not have to buy raw materials such as barley or aluminum to transform them so a certain markup can be extracted.Instead, software providers' pricing power arises primarily from the explicit markup between charged price and knowledge/intellectual property (which are immaterial and obtained mainly via R&D, an item included in the assessment of operating margins), and not from the markup between charged price and undifferentiated labor, raw materials and so on (which are variables included in the calculation of gross margins). If that is the case, then ANSYS' operating margins actually paint a much prettier picture concerning its pricing power (please verify the image below).One reason for the staggering difference in operating profit margins between ANSYS and the other companies is that ANSYS does not sell the more commoditized drafting software that the other companies do. In fact, because it competes with fragmented competitors in a highly lucrative arena, ANSYS has been afforded the luxury of maintaining high levels of pricing power, and all without really compromising growth or market share.However, real pricing power is actually one of the main symptoms of inefficiency within a given market. As a consequence, charging a higher price than competitors is always a double-edged sword: on the bright side, it obviously leads to better profitability over the short- and medium-terms; yet, because capital always chases the best returns available, it also creates a fertile soil over which nascent competitors can grow and flourish to ultimately disrupt an incumbents' profit pool. After all, as the Über-Disruptor Jeff Bezos famously remarked, ""Your margin is my opportunity"". And this is also one of the reasons why ANSYS can become vulnerable to disruption as discussed in question 5.Risk Factors | CyclicalityBecause it sells mainly to industrial companies, ANSYS revenues can be susceptible to the economic and business cycles. However, during the Financial Crisis of 2007-2008, the company was in fact able to deliver solid earnings and revenues on account of its strong and varied portfolio of solutions - even as automakers buckled under the pressure, for instance, ANSYS still managed to profit from other growing spaces such as High Tech. In fact, because its software reduces R&D costs and time-to-market, ANSYS can exhibit a somewhat countercyclical nature during economic downturns.Nevertheless, and since each downturn has its particular challenges and characteristics, it is not possible to estimate the impact even a mild recession would have on ANSYS' operations and financial results. To protect market share during a long slump, ANSYS would need to offer flexible pricing solutions and to focus on the financial aptitude of customers to absorb increasing costs. And the company is, in fact, doing just that through its 'Elastic Licensing', a pay-per-use licensing model that allows customers to optimize their license utilization while giving them the flexibility to adapt to the changing business environment. Moreover, the company has been doing a solid job at keeping customers locked in to their proprietary solutions and, remarkably, at making sensible acquisitions with the capacity to sustain growth in times of uncertainty (in 2008, as the Financial Crisis unfolded, for example, total revenue growth was 27% thanks in large measure to the acquisition of Ansoft).Risk Factors | Serial AcquisitionsANSYS is the second most acquisitive company in the simulation software space, behind only Dassault. As mentioned before, many acquisitions are not accretive to returns and in truth between 50% and 90% of mergers and acquisitions fail to meet financial and operational expectations. However, smaller (tuck-in) acquisitions can be an appropriate strategy to obtain new technologies or to enter nascent spaces by first letting start-ups or niche players to do the de-risking, particularly in unconsolidated, growing markets.Fortunately, this description fits ANSYS' core markets and overall buyout policies; moreover, the company has not been acquiring targets too far outside its own core competencies (quite the opposite), a fact that increases its chances of continuing success. This acquisitive nature is expected to persist, as the company claims a very loyal customer base that allows it to invest ample funds in the development of newer solutions via both M&A and R&D. But, at a time when all classes of assets are (apparently) overvalued, ANSYS can be compelled to make expensive acquisitions that later fail to show positive ROI.Risk Factors | Retaining Top TalentAccording to McKinsey, in very complex occupations, high performers are an astonishing 800% more productive than average ones. This means that having a workforce composed of high performers can dramatically speed up a project's smooth conclusion, and all with better outcomes and less execution and other errors. In skills-based organizations such as ANSYS, the only way to stay competitive is to retain highly skilled personnel and to attract a new generation of talent.In fact, talent attraction and retention are probably the most critical long-term determinants of success for any company in today's business landscape. Yet, even companies known for their high salaries and lavish perks, like Alphabet and Facebook (FB), are only able to retain their most sought-after employees for less than a couple of years, on average. This job-hopping is great news for Microsoft's LinkedIn business but it is also a serious problem for smaller tech companies like ANSYS, as pointed out by its CFO during the company's latest earnings conference call (""We also saw the continuation of a tighter labor market, particularly for highly skilled positions""). So, is ANSYS doing a good job at enticing talent?Unless you are an insider, it is not possible to provide an answer to this question but, according to Glassdoor reviews,* ANSYS and Cadence are the best-rated companies within the selected peer group. The difference to Autodesk and Dassault is minimal, though, which means that ANSYS cannot let its guard down across this decisive front. What is not minimal is the difference in revenues per employee between these firms, as ANSYS generates about USD 391.000 per employee, whereas Cadence, Autodesk, and Dassault only generate about USD 293.000, USD 286.000 and USD 254.000, respectively, per head - along this metric, ANSYS is 40% more efficient than the peer group average. In this sense, the ANSYS' employees are truly high performers.* There are reasons to take such reviews with a grain of salt: job search engines and review websites like Glassdoor arguably draw a disproportionate amount of negative outpourings both from resentful employees and from former employees. But the reviews still matter for two reasons: first, they provide a sense of the magnitude and direction of morale; and second, because prospective candidates are turning to such sites in increasing numbers to choose their new jobs.Financially, the company seems to be in good shape as it has no short- or long-term debt obligations. This is rather unusual at a time when scores of acquisitive companies are trying to trim their bloated balance sheets in order to face the troubles possibly lying ahead - indeed, more than one-sixth of publicly-traded American corporations were having difficulties meeting interest obligations at the end of last year, according to the Institute of International Finance.Fortunately for its shareholders, ANSYS saw no need to gorge on cheap debt, which is great news if economic conditions start to deteriorate. Furthermore, by being the most financially-sound company among its peer group (as shown below by their respective Piotroski F-scores*) this will also enable ANSYS to follow a countercyclical, more inexpensive acquisition strategy. ANSYS' F-score would reach a perfect 9 if not for a lower year-over-year current ratio, which now stands at a still healthy 2.11; the company's current Altman Z-Score of 17.5 is also extremely high, and shows that ANSYS is nowhere near bankruptcy (here too, the company tops its peer group by a comfortable margin).Relative Valuation: With a free cash yield of only 2.85% and an earnings yield of 2.38%, ANSYS valuation certainly looks full and about to overflow. The company's EV/EBITDA is also very high at 31.14 - in fact, ANSYS is now exhibiting its highest price multiples of the past decade. Paying up for high-quality companies sometimes makes sense, but paying too much is seldom a good idea: as implied by ANSYS' PEG ratio of 3 (for a Price/Forward Earnings of 35.4), the market at large seems to be projecting an overly enthusiastic earnings growth rate on the part of the company. In order for ANSYS to re-rate, either growth has to accelerate meaningfully (unlikely) or multiples need to compress.Absolute Valuation (Discounted Cash Flow Analysis)Estimation of Operating Cash Profits | Main AssumptionsRevenues: On average, the model expects revenues to grow at about 9.0%-12.0% per year over the next 5 years, ahead of the lower end of the expected growth rate for the engineering simulation software market. Reasons: The model expects ANSYS to remain a solid performer and a market share-gainer over the forecast period by considering its strong positioning within growing areas; it also expects the company to continue its acquisitive policy. Recent initiatives, such as the development of simplified versions of software (which attract a larger audience), as well as ANSYS' partnerships and deeper integrations with other leading software providers, should also have a positive impact on sales going forward. The same applies to ANSYS Cloud, a solution that will offer much-coveted HPC capabilities to multitudes of smaller firms. This was a largely untapped market for ANSYS.The evolution and higher usage of complex, cutting-edge technologies (such as Additive Manufacturing and Autonomous Vehicles), will certainly act as the most important tailwind, though, but growth expectations must be tempered by the fact that industrial activity is decelerating throughout a large part of the world: according to the latest J.P. Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI, ""The performance of the global manufacturing sector continued to weaken at the end of the second quarter. Production fell for the first time since October 2012, as new order contracted at the fastest pace for almost seven years."" It is then added that ""Of the 30 nations for which a June PMI reading was available, the majority (18) signaled contraction. China, Japan, Germany, the UK, Taiwan, South Korea, Italy, and Russia were among those countries experiencing downturns. The US, India, Brazil and Australia were some of the larger industrial nations to register an expansion.""The United States is still healthy but Germany - a country that accounts for a significant percentage of ANSYS' revenues - is now preparing itself for an 'inevitable' recession. Jörg Kramer, the chief economist at Commerzbank (OTCPK:CRZBF), has recently reiterated that view by saying that ""In addition to weak demand for cars, the reason for this (Germany's impending recession) is the global downturn in the industry"". Of course, such an event would have a domino effect on most other European Union countries, which are already struggling with their own stalling economies and with the reservations surrounding Brexit. Granted, ANSYS possesses a countercyclical streak, but this attribute may not be enough to offset the effects of a systemic downturn.Gross Margins and Operating Margins: ANSYS' profit margins are probably climaxing in this mature stage of the industrial life cycle. At this ripe juncture, companies like ANSYS typically realize maximum sales, profits, and cash flows because customer demand remains high and consistent (the model is assuming that ANSYS is not entering the decline stage just yet); frequently, this period also coincides with peak valuation, which was what happened with 3M (MMM) not long ago.The low magnitude of growth and inflation has prolonged this phase of the cycle in the United States, but these conditions should not persist indefinitely. Being so, and considering a forthcoming deceleration, the model expects COGS to be equivalent to 15.5% - 16.0% of revenues, up from an average of 14.5% of revenues over the past 5 years. As a consequence, the numbers also imply gross margins within the 84.0%-84.5% interval throughout the forecast period.On average, SG&A expenses were equal to 28.7% of revenues over the past half-decade. But now, with a tighter market and heightened competition coming from the likes of Siemens and Dassault - and maybe Autodesk - these expenses will probably increase further (in fact, for ANSYS, SG&A expenses enlarged by 24.2% since 2009). The model also assumes that R&D investments will augment from a 10-year average of 17.3% up to 18.5%, as a reflection of the needed development of more complex and integrated solutions. Being so, the numbers imply operating margins within the 35.5%-36.0% range. All these assumptions might be too optimistic, however, since labor costs will probably increase in the future due to the shortage of talent tech companies are facing.Estimation of Operating Cash Investments: The model assumes that the sum of capital expenditures investments with the changes in working capital will reach a level equivalent to 9%-14% of operating income, on average, per year. ANSYS' capital-light structure, as well as its ability to scale and its operating leverage, do not require much in the way of CapEx. With the exception of 2018, during the last decade, cumulative invested capital as a proportion of free cash flow has been decreasing gradually since 2011 (from 84.2% in that year, down to only 4% of FCF in 2017).Terminal Growth Rate, Estimation of Cost of Capital and Fair Value: To keep assumptions conservative, the DCF model assumes a WACC within the 9.0% + [± 1.5%] range. The model also assumes a terminal growth rate between 2% and 3%. Consequent to a sensitivity analysis, the valuation model delivers a present-day fair value estimate range between USD 132 and 162 per share, implying that ANSYS is currently overvalued.Making it one of the highest-quality names within the tech sector, the Quality Score for ANSYS is 9 out of 12 possible points. To paraphrase the matchless Damodaran one last time, ""There are more 'bad' businesses in the world than most people realize. In fact, it is the 'good' business that is unusual, not the 'bad' one.""ANSYS is one of those unusual and unusually 'good' businesses, of which there are probably less than 100 on a global basis. As argued above, ANSYS is a compelling blend of growth, profitability, pricing power, able management, market leadership, and competitive advantages. Considering its quality and systemic importance, this company deserves much more attention from investors at large (institutions know ANSYS well) - but that's obviously an advantage for those among us who recognize its worth.While ANSYS is not a household name, the company operates behind the scenes to ensure that our collective future is truly deserving of the adjective 'futuristic'. In many instances, ANSYS' software is also omnipresent and mission-critical. So do not be surprised if one day, someday, the technologies WANL aimed to develop back in the Fifties (including those bizarre nuclear-powered artificial hearts) finally see the daylight with a helping hand from its offspring: ANSYS. And do not be surprised if biological systems (like yourself) end up having an AI-powered digital twin in a not-so-distant future - disquieting to some, this is already becoming a reality. Unfortunately, the company's valuation seems to be way too exuberant right now, a fact that precludes an investment in this outstanding American firm - for now. But who knows what the future will bring?"

        Significant growth opportunities in the automotive and autonomous vehicle industries with the latest release of ANSYS 19.2.","ANSYS, Inc. (ANSS) is a leader in engineering simulation software & services and offers a great business model with diversified recurring revenue, strong cash generation and a significant growth opportunity driven by the digital revolution. There is an increased market demand for engineering simulation solutions, as companies face intensified pressures like increased product complexity, reduced time to market and lower sales cycles. ANSYS’s engineering simulation products offer a strong competitive advantage based on technology leadership and reputation for simulating products across multiple physics with the highest accuracy. The company is a best-in-class leader in its niche industry and consistently maintains a double-digit revenue growth rate combined with industry-leading operating margin. I expect from the company to scale its business with the go-to-market strategy across large enterprises, important partnerships, and acquisitions of best-in-class technologies. That can drive further shareholder value-creation by achieving Target 2020 double-digit organic revenue growth rate, together with maintaining best-in-class operating margins and returning excess capital through share buybacks over the next 3 - 5 years.ANSYS started its operations in 1970 and has over 45,000 customers worldwide engaged in various industries like energy, healthcare, industrial, automotive, high-tech engineering, and construction, etc. The current CEO is Ajei Gopal, who has been running the company since January 2017 and has previously served in leadership roles at Symantec, Hewlett-Packard, CA Technologies and IBM. One of the key products is the ANSYS Workbench industry-leading platform that enables pervasive engineering simulation. It helps customers to analyze the effects of physics into a virtual prototype based on real-world operating conditions. Digital revolution is putting a lot of pressure on companies to reduce time to market, lower cycle times, manage increased complexity of products and increase new product rollouts. Engineering simulation enables companies to address these issues and realize productivity gains combined with lower total operational costs, lower risk and more innovative products.Source: Investor Presentation, September 2017Companies can discover design flows early in the process, and any future changes during manufacturing phase require additions to physical products or new sophisticated tools. That is why simulation leads to lower operational costs and also to better unit cost optimization as most of the product cost occurs during the design process. The simulation also offers customers to test various product designs alternatives in a faster way than building physical prototypes. For instance, if the aerospace company wants to test several instances of their propeller design they can do it in two hours using simulation software. If they want to build several physical prototypes and test them under real-world operational conditions that could take several weeks or months. The key growth product that addresses all of these issues and offers a simple user-interface is ANSYS Discovery Line that was released in 2018.Source: Investor Presentation, November 2018ANSYS Discovery line provides a simple 3D simulation combined with direct geometry modeling that enables users to manipulate various parameters and see real-time changes in the performance. Customers are satisfied with the recent release of ANSYS Discovery line and the company expects it to contribute higher revenues next year. ANSYS is not a consumer company, so it takes a while for the market to adopt their new technologies. However, once the customers experience their newly released solutions, they usually purchase them and some of them stay loyal for decades. Because Discovery line is so simple to use like a video game, it offers a great competitive advantage over more traditional and complex solutions from competitors. Customers can now easily build next-generation products and bring them to market even faster.The company implemented over the last couple of years a go-to-market strategy that allows it to focus on different segments of the market, what leads to a improved performance and double-digit growth.Source: Investor Presentation, November 2018The go-to-market strategy consists of five important phases. First, the company must set a clear value proposition and with ANSYS, that is its best-in-class pervasive simulation solution, as, for example, Tesla couldn’t do what they do without ANSYS simulation capabilities. The second is the target market, and ANSYS divides them into the enterprise, strategic, territory or channel accounts based upon their size and segment.Third, it is important to build an awareness and create leads, whether through social media, conferences, white papers or direct contact with the customers.Fourth is about demand generation, what is the key thing in the whole process and partnerships are a great example, while the final stage is pure sales execution. Sales reps and technical experts are using higher touch sales model, to build a deeper relationship with existing clients.That way ANSYS informs customers about the importance of simulation to gain the competitive edge and offers them training and consulting services combined with strong cross-sell opportunities. This leads to a very strong growth opportunity for services revenues and they represent a small share of total revenues at the moment. As the company engages with larger customers and presents them with their broad portfolio combined with benefits of deeper use of simulation, customers usually pay for ANSYS service offerings to help them implement advanced simulation solutions. In Q3 18, services revenues were $8.8 million or up 32% Y/Y what makes it around 3% share of total revenues. In case of services revenue CAGR of ~30% over the next couple of years, they can achieve peak revenues of more than $100 million, what would represent around 10% share of total revenues.Source: Investor Presentation, November 2018Partnerships are another key component of growth strategy as through collaborations ANSYS provides customers with greater value in solving complex problems and expands addressable market through partners channel. The recent collaboration between PTC and ANSYS, PTC now offers a 3D CAD solution called Creo integrated with ANSYS Discovery line, so designers can use real-time simulation during their modelling process. From a business perspective, such a collaboration offers strong selling opportunities and increased brand awareness, as designers might need other ANSYS flagship products, to become even more effective throughout the product development process.ANSYS is the only company on the market that offers an integrated platform with multi-physics solutions, what makes a great competitive advantage over peers. The key competitors are Autodesk, PTC, Cadence Design Systems, and Synopsys, but open source licensing providers are the biggest threat. While competitors improve their existing tools and technologies organically or through acquisitions, ANSYS has still the most technically advanced pipeline of products on the market and has set the bar very high. For instance, market-leading ANSYS Discovery Line has an architecture that’s based on GPUs and is several times faster than the traditional 3D method used by competitors. ANSYS has large R&D investments, so it can stay ahead of the competition with several new products releases a year or by expanding the capabilities of existing products. The company reported during 2014 analyst day that total addressable market might grow to ~$20 billion in 2019, what makes it currently ~6% penetrated in the reported TAM. Source: Form 10-Q, November 2018The company reported, total revenue of $289.4 million in Q3 18, compared to $275.6 million in Q3 17, beating the analyst estimates of ~$280.0 million. Increase in revenue growth rate was driven by the successful investments in sales & marketing, strong consumer demand for ANSYS solutions and attributable revenue to the acquisition of OPTIS in May 2018. Sales & Marketing expense was $27.7 million or 41.7% of total revenues, compared to $19.2 million or 44.1% of total revenues in Q3 17. An increase in staff-related expenses drove an increase of $8.4 million Y/Y, as the company invests a lot in Sales & Marketing due to go-to-market strategy.Gross margin and operating margin changed +60bps to ~87.5% and -660bps to ~7%, respectively. Increased licenses and subscription revenue growth drove gross margin expansion while operating margin contraction was driven by higher operating expenses due to OPTIS acquisition-related expenses and increased staff-related costs. The company reported Q3 18 GAAP earnings and EPS increased $15.7 million y/y to $89.3 million and $0.19 y/y to $1.06, respectively, beating the consensus EPS estimate. Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $729.2 million in Q3 18 as compared to $881.5 million at December 31, 2017.In Q3, there were various high figure deals across core verticals due to positive global macro headwinds and industry demand. There was a 20% increase Y/Y in orders of over $1 million and 80% of these customers purchased three physics or more what shows deeper customer relationships with strong cross-selling opportunities. I believe cross-selling will be a major growth driver over the next several quarters, as the company releases new products and breakthrough technologies. Top 100 customers also represent over 40% of total sales, what highlights deeper market penetration of the largest customers and effective go-to-market strategy. Most of these customers license several product lines and use ANSYS core solutions, so they can reduce their time to market and speed up innovation.The automotive sector is investing in ANSYS market-leading capabilities of electrification and autonomy and automotive market transformation represents a significant growth opportunity. There is an ongoing industry shift from the combustion engine to an electric solution and simulation will be crucial for all the testing required for autonomous vehicles. Therefore, the recent acquisition of OPTIS enables the company to deliver a comprehensive solution ANSYS VRXPERIENCE for simulating autonomous vehicles using real-world conditions. It offers capabilities like the simulation of all sensors, the multi-physics simulation of various components and also the analysis of systems functional safety. I believe ANSYS will continue with M&A activities to expand their portfolio of automotive solutions and its technical capabilities. There is also an increased demand from leading global communications companies, that are developing the 5G network and seek for multi-physics design capabilities, especially for RFID antenna design and layout. It has also signed deals with healthcare leaders like Medtronic that produces medical devices for various indications. Medtronic uses modelling and simulation to pick the most optimal product design and mimic use conditions that the patient experiences, like the recharging of the device.The company also provided its full-year 2018 Revenue under ASC 606 and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $1,227.6 million - $1,247.6 million and $5.18 - $5.24, respectively. The analyst consensus estimate for FY 18 is revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $1,249.1 million and $5.34, respectively. Shares are now trading at trailing P/E and EV/REV multiple of ~41.5 and 10.2x, respectively. Both forward P/E and EV/REV multiples are trading at a high premium compared to the peer group, what makes current stock price overvalued on the relative basis. In case of any correction in the stock market, I would “buy the dip” and slowly build up the position. The company has also the best-in-class gross and operating margins among its direct peers. That showcases its market-leading position and is well positioned to maintain non-GAAP operating margin 2020 target range of 43-45%. In the case of a next recession, the company maintained strong margins during the 2009 crisis, what shows a strong resilient business model as 77% of total revenues are recurring and evenly distributed across industries and geographies. ANSYS is still an interesting buy even though the stock has strongly outperformed S&P 500 over the last several years. I firmly believe the stock has still room to grow as the company has reported exceptional Q3 18 earnings results and has a strong business model, with diverse revenue source and strong cash generation. The key bullish catalysts are the leadership position, positive industry tailwinds and strong competitive advantage with the most technically advanced pipeline of products. Another important catalyst is a further market penetration with the go-to-market strategy across large enterprises and important strategic acquisitions. The company has attractive opportunities for growth in the automotive, autonomous vehicles, healthcare and 5G infrastructure industries. Key risks to my thesis are intensified competition in the engineering simulation software market combined with rapid technological changes."
4244462,105096,2019-02-27T09:15:09-05:00,"Ansys shares have risen 22.8% YTD and are again approaching their all-time high, and are now trading at a Free Cash Flow Yield of 2.7%.
        It is a high-quality asset with attractive characteristics such as highly resilient revenues and long-term revenue growth rate of near 10% p.a.
        However, EBIT growth has lagged revenue growth in recent years as management invests in R&D and sales costs ahead of revenues.
        We believe operational leverage will eventually materialise, as is typical in enterprise software, allowing earnings to grow at near 10% p.a.
        We recommend Ansys as a long-term holding and believe it can deliver 10-20% upside in the next 12-18 months.","Ansys (ANSS) shares have performed strongly year-to-date, rebounding 22.8% and again approaching the all-time high of around $190 reached last September. Over the last 12 months (LTM), the stock has moved strongly in line with the wider Technology sector. Ahead of full-year results on February 28th, this article will examine whether Ansys shares are still an attractive investment based on its business fundamentals and valuation. Ansys is a U.S. software company (headquartered at Canonsburg, PA), providing engineering simulation software used by customers to simulate “physics” effects such as fluid flows and light changes. Simulations are often used in place of prototypes or actual constructs to test out ""physics"" effects as part of design and engineering processes.Customers can be found in a variety of different industries, but the highest concentrations are in High Tech, Aerospace & Defense and Automotive (as shown in the first chart below). The actual users of Ansys software include engineers, designers, researchers and students.The customer base is global, with North America being the largest market (with 41% of revenues), followed by Europe (31%) and Asia Pacific (29%). Countries such as Japan (12% of revenues) and Germany (11%) are particularly important due to their manufacturing capabilities.Ansys' customer base includes many global giants which are leaders in their fields (see examples below) - and their usage of Ansys solutions over their own in-house offerings is a sign of Ansys' unique quality and value-add. Ansys has a high-quality business model which displays several favourable characteristics, including: We believe the strength of Ansys’ business model is a nature consequence of the purpose of its products and their high level of value-add:Ansys has managed to maintain a track record of growing recurring revenues at around 10% each year (in constant currency), mostly from strong organic revenue growth but also bolt-on acquisitions (usually small in scale):(Note 1: In 2009, the Ansoft acquisition contributed about 20% to revenue growth. In 2012, the acquisitions of Apache and Esterel contributed approx. +9.5% to total revenue growth.)(Note 2: Recurring revenue growth (constant currency) figures are estimated, by assuming they were under the same currency impact as total revenues were. Revenues figures are GAAP figures and include acquisitions.)Going forward, Ansys management explicitly targets revenue growth of 10%+ each year in the period to 2020:Ansys evenues are also entering a new phase of structural growth, from a “democratisation” of simulation software and an expansion of sales channels:As the strength of Ansys' business model and its growth potential becomes increasingly recognised, shares have become more expensive. At the current share price of $175.48, Ansys shares are trading at a Free Cash Flow (NYSE:FCF) Yield of 2.7%, based on LTM FCF of $372m and Ansys' Enterprise Value of $13.9bn (from market capitalisation of $14.6bn and $729m of net cash).Our definition of FCF is different from many investors', in that we remove the benefit of working capital to cashflows, and also subtract share-based compensation costs (as reported in the P&L), as shown below:We remove the benefit of working capital, because it is generally a positive cashflow for Ansys (as customers pay Ansys upfront before revenues are recognised over time, they create deferred revenues), but it is only a temporary benefit. We subtract share-based compensation because this is a real cost to shareholders that we believe should be accounted for. In addition, we have excluded the $14.5m one-off Transaction Tax related to U.S. tax reform, accrued in 2017 and paid during 2018. (Without these adjustments, the LTM FCF figure would be $470m.)Whether Ansys represents an attractive investment at 2.7% FCF yield depends on how fast its earnings are growing, and here our investment case depends on the confidence that operational leverage will eventually materialise.Ansys has not shown operational leverage in the last few years. In fact, EBIT growth has been lagging revenue growth, with revenue growing at a CAGR of +6.3% during 2012-17 while EBIT only grew at a CAGR at +4.7%. (Both CAGR figures reduced by the strengthening of the US dollar; in constant currency, revenue CAGR was +8.6%.)A key part of the Ansys investment case is that operational leverage will eventually materialise, enabling EBIT to grow in line with or even faster than the 10% p.a. revenue growth. (Note: Both revenues and EBIT shown above are non-GAAP. Non-GAAP revenues have been adjusted to include revenue not reported in GAAP due to acquisition accounting. Non-GAAP EBIT is primarily different from GAAP EBIT in having adjusted for the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and stock-based compensation, as well as restructuring costs.)The lack of operational leverage is also obvious in Ansys' shrinking EBIT margins, as shown in the chart below. (""Non-GAAP, Less SBC"" EBIT margin is the most meaningful measure, having adjusted to exclude one-off costs but include stock-based compensation.)The decline in EBIT margin has been due entirely to ""investment"" in R&D & sales costs, with Costs of Goods Sold margin (COGS) actually falling over time, as shown in the chart below. R&D costs grew at a CAGR of +8.9% in 2012-17, while SG&A costs grew even faster with CAGR of +10.5%. Such high ""investments"" are the reason why R&D and SG&A both rose as a percentage of revenues even as revenues were growing at approx. 10% a year. The increase in R&D and sales costs has been the result of an intentional ""investment"" strategy, and accelerated from 2016 when current CEO (Ajei Gopal) joined Ansys as COO (he became CEO in January 2017). As he said on the 16Q4 earnings call in February 2017:A key part of our investment case is that (1) such investments will continue to drive strong revenue growth; (2) EBIT margin will eventually stabilise and expand again as the investment phase is completed. Otherwise, EBIT growth would remain at or near mid-single-digits and the current 2.7% FCF Yield is too low (only giving a high-single-digit annual return).Our confidence in future operational leverage comes from our experience with other enterprise software companies. We believe software companies tend to be platform businesses where the cost of incremental revenue is low, there are tremendous economies of scale in R&D and sales, and operational leverage tends to follow naturally. Ansys management is targeting a non-GAAP EBIT margin of 43-45% in 2020 (comparable to 46.4% in 2017), implying some further investment. Ansys is thus likely to be a 3-year investment story where cost growth will eventually slow after “investment phase”, likely to be in 2020 in our opinion.With its unique value-add in products and customer relationships, Ansys could be of interest to large software conglomerates such as SAP (already a partner with Ansys). Such strategic buyers tend pay large premiums, because of potential cost synergies and likely benefits from cross-selling.Similarly, with its resilient and highly recurring revenues, and its net cash balance sheet, Ansys could be of interest to private equity. Private equity tends to focus more on cost cuts, and may see potential in Ansys's currently elevated R&D and SG&A cost margins. They would be a logical alternative should the current ""investment phase"" fail to create real shareholder value.We believe Ansys is a unique asset that justifies its current 2.7% FCF Yield. With strong revenue growth at 10% a year, and the potential for earnings to start growing in line with revenues after 2020, we believe the stock can deliver 10-20% upside over the next 12-18 months. Further upside could come from strategic or private interest. Buy."
4137859,98236,2018-01-16T17:26:10-05:00,"Ansys is the undisputed global leader in the market for simulation software.Simulation software is used by engineers and product designers to improve the performance and reliability of new products.The company is seeing its customer engagement deepen significantly, and recently signed the largest deal in its history: a $45 million, 3-year renewal/expansion.Ansys reported 11% growth last quarter, but overall bookings growth was 18%, significantly enhancing visibility.The company is likely to be a major beneficiary of the new tax laws, which could add as much as 15% to reported EPS.","The market has continued its run this past week, although perhaps the run was not centered in the IT/Tech area (QQQ is up about 1.6% and the Dow is up 2.0% over the past 5 trading days). Obviously, as the market continues to work higher, it becomes important to be particularly selective in choosing commitments. One of my strategies for dealing with the strong market performance of the past 18 months or so is to look for names that will be uniquely benefited by the recent tax reform legislation.While there are those who believe that the market has discounted the impact of the tax reform law, I do not really believe that this has been the case. Very few companies have yet to forecast their earnings based on the new tax laws, and that means those enterprises with tax rate accruals at close to statutory levels will see rather significant increases in reported earnings. In addition, the impact of both the tax rate reduction and 100% expensing is likely to produce a substantial demand for those companies that sell solutions to capital-intensive industries - an increase that is not totally encompassed by many projections for the next couple of years. Companies that sell software that is primarily used in industrial processes are likely to be unique beneficiaries of this trend.One of the companies that fulfilled my criteria for consideration was Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS). Ansys is a company that provides a very specialized set of solutions that are considered essential in product design. Its products are used by engineers, designers, researchers and students in the aerospace and defense, automotive, electronic, biomedical and energy industries. The software allows these professionals to simulate processes and data management challenges, and it offers geometry handling solutions. OK, the specifics of the company’s set of solutions are way too complex for my poor brain to really comprehend at any level of detail. Ansys has been around a long time (since 1970) and has come to dominate its space. It is headquartered in a town called Canonsburg, PA, a suburb of Pittsburgh.From an economic perspective, ANSS might be considered to belong in a group that includes the major CAD/PLM vendors, such as PTC (PTC), Autodesk (ADSK), Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) and Dassault Systemes (OTCPK:DASTY). These are all companies whose business is correlated with the manufacturing economy. I expect that the tax law changes will have a palpable impact on these businesses because of both faster overall growth and 100% expensing. I also believe that the current economic trends in the EU, and most particularly in Germany, will translate into better demand for software geared to product development.ANSS technology, while used by the same group of designers and engineers who buy PLM solutions, is quite different than CAD, and the company does not really compete with the PLM vendors to any significant extent. Competition is very hot in the PLM space and includes competitive entries from both Oracle (ORCL) and SAP AG (SAP). In addition, the PLM space includes a couple of newer, totally cloud vendors who offer disruptive solutions that might upend the historical competitive patterns. Public cloud adoption has been far slower in the simulation space. This is a different structure than is the case in the simulation market, where the competitors faced by ANSS are quite small and really niche players. So to a certain extent, in trying to identify a company that might benefit from the effects of the tax reform legislation, I have concluded that Ansys most closely fits my specifications.ANSS is a name whose share price evolution has apparently befuddled the analysts who try to cover it - which is something in its favor, from my perspective. There are 17 analysts who cover the name, including a couple of analysts who recently initiated coverage with Hold ratings. Of those 17 analysts, 2 rate it as a Buy, 2 rate it as a Sell and 13 rate it as a Hold. This level of sentiment is not new, despite the fact that the shares have appreciated by 64% over the last year. I guess it is self-evident that the analysts covering the name, on balance, have not figured out what might be driving the shares.Part of the issue for analysts is that the company has what might be viewed as an insane EV/S ratio. At the moment, and using the First Call consensus estimate for 2018 revenue, ANSS has an EV/S ratio of more than 10X. Many observers simply can’t reconcile that level of EV/S with a company that is growing at around 8-9%. Of course, one reason for the EV/S valuation is ANSS is insanely profitable. Last quarter, it achieved non-GAAP operating margins of just shy of 49% - and that is not an outlier for this company. The prior year, it achieved non-GAAP margins of just less than 50%. And this is not mainly a function of stock-based comp which was 15% of operating income this year and 11% of operating income in the year-earlier period.In addition, ANSS generates a very substantial cash flow margin. Cash flow from operations is up 22% this year, and is 158% of reported GAAP net income. That ratio has been driven both by depreciation and stock-based comp, but also by balance sheet items, including receivables. Through 9 months, its CFFO margin has been over 41%. The company increased its guidance for CFFO to the range of $400-425 million.I estimate that free cash flow yield for 2017 will have been about 3.5%, and based on current trends, its free cash flow yield for 2018 should be above 4%. The question of whether a free cash flow yield of 4% or a bit higher is a suitable valuation metric for sustained double-digit growth is not one that is totally determinable. I think the issues in terms of an appropriate share price valuation are the future trajectory of growth, coupled with the sustainability of margins. As mentioned, I think the specific tailwinds coming from the tax reform legislation will bend these specific metrics upward and justify higher valuation than has heretofore been the case.In addition to tailwinds from macro considerations, there are a couple of company-specific issues that should lead to rising percentage growth expectations for ANSS. Last quarter, and for several quarters previously, the company’s growth in the US and in Asia/Pac far outpaced its growth in the EMEA region. The EMEA sales effort was substantially revamped by the current CEO when he arrived about a year ago. The EMEA region secured 7-7 figure deals last quarter. Just as a point of comparison, North America saw 18% growth this past quarter, Asia/Pac saw 11% growth and EMEA saw growth of 5%. Overall, improving EMEA’s growth to the corporate average would add about 200-300 basis points to growth expectations. I think it is reasonable to believe that will happen, particularly in the context of the strong German manufacturing economy, as well as the efforts from the sales reorg in that region.Simulation, as a technology, has been slow to be adopted in the public cloud. It is perhaps the complexity of the solution that has kept it from securing broad acceptance. ANSS does offer a full suite of public cloud solutions, but the company has not seen take-up to the extent seen by many other enterprise software vendors. Will that log-jam break? If it does, will it lead to faster growth? Will it lead to deeper customer engagement? I really can’t handicap any of that, but it is certainly a potential growth tailwind that is in the future rather than a current demand driver.The company does not quite report bookings directly, although a proxy calculation can be made. Overall, the implied proxy number for bookings growth last quarter was 18%. Included in that calculation was the largest revenue transaction in the company’s history with an unspecified customer, which amounted to $45 million over a 3-year span. (The deal had a minimal impact on reported Q3 revenues - $1 million or so, according to the company.) The transaction was with an existing ANSS customer which had enjoyed success with the company’s platform and dramatically expanded the use cases and scope of the solutions it is using from ANSS.Overall, ANSS's backlog + deferred revenues increased by 38% year over year and provides the company with relatively strong visibility for the next couple of quarters. Some of that increase relates to contract duration, which is why many companies do not like forecasting bookings metrics. In the case of ANSS, the CFO reported during the call that long-term deferred revenues rose by more than 100% year on year, suggesting that users, as they renew and determine the longer-term utility of their Ansys solutions, are signing longer-term agreements.While bookings growth does not necessarily translate into revenue growth over any given quarter or two, it does seem as though the company’s goal of achieving sustainable double-digit revenue growth is tracking at or ahead of schedule. While ANSS does not report bookings growth itself and does not forecast the metric, it suggested that it would not reach the level seen in Q3 in the quarter that ended 12/31 - obviously reflecting the likely absence of the outlier mega deal closed in Q3. That said, adding individuals in sales and sales support functions as the company plans seems to be an indication of ANSS's view as to its opportunity set.The company’s Q4 margin guidance is in line with forecasts it has made throughout the course of the year. Because of its sales success, commission expense is likely to be proportionately greater, with many reps achieving targets that allow them to earn commission accelerators. ANSS has also increased its hiring targets in order to provide it with an above-average start to the new year and to promote sales in what it calls “adjacencies.” The company has been expanding its employee headcount by about 3%/quarter since the summer, somewhat uncharacteristically.One investment issue with a company such as this is that it may be too profitable. Software companies typically do not operate at 49% operating margins, although there are other enterprises, such as Checkpoint Software (CHKP), that have operating margins that are even higher than that of ANSS. In the case of Checkpoint, the trade-off has been growth or market share loss. ANSS is attempting to move its growth trajectory to a different level, hence the extra spend.I imagine that not all of the spend initiatives will get done on time, and I suspect that the company’s history in the past several quarters of exceeding quarterly EPS targets will continue. ANSS, at the time of the earnings call, did not project any swings in reported operational performance based on currency fluctuations - but the decline of the dollar against the euro was noticeable in the last half of the quarter. Overall, I think the set-up for Q4 results features a significant number of tailwinds and should lead to another quarter where reported numbers beat expectations.During the course of the conference call, one analyst from a firm recommending the shares tried to get management to update its projections for 2018 and on to 2020. Those are age-old questions on conference calls for all companies, and not terribly surprisingly, the CFO declined to revisit the targets that have been set during the course of the conference call. But the fact is that there is seemingly substantial headroom for ANSS to exceed current First Call consensus estimates for 8% top line growth in this current year. About the most that management was willing to say was that it expected 2018 top line growth to equal or exceed the current level it has forecast for 2017 (about 10%). I expect that the company, regardless of the specifics of its forecast when it reports earnings next month, will be able to exceed 10% growth for all of 2018.ANSS is not a name that has been extensively covered on Seeking Alpha. Other than articles regarding the company’s acquisitions, of which there have been several, the last relatively holistic story dates back to August of 2016. That is most likely a function of the share price performance, which has made it more than a bit difficult for many to consider investing in the shares. In addition, it has not been a company that has greatly interested retail investors, with 102% of the float owned by institutions.Since August of 2016, the shares have appreciated by around 60%, not a great deal above the 49% appreciation of the IGV. Revenue and earnings growth has been at a 10% cadence over that period. On the other hand, as mentioned earlier, CFFO growth has been 22% year to date, and the company attained a 38% increase in the sum of backlog increase and deferred revenue balance - basically a component of a bookings proxy.ANSS is a company whose products are focused on helping designers design products. The key concept for this company is simulation. Basically, the software allows engineers to test systems by simulating fluid flows in a virtual environment. Simulation as a tool has been around for decades now. There are plenty of companies that offer the technology across individual verticals, but ANSS is clearly the leader in evaluating the space. Most of the companies against which ANSS competes are quite small, although Solidworks, which is a subsidiary of Dassault Systemes, is a sizeable vendor with a strong market presence. That said, the simulation solution sold by Solidworks is considered to be basic, and most users do not consider the companies to be real competitors.The company’s products are deployed across a variety of what are called physics, including structural, fluids, electronics and semiconductor power. Most users acquire 3 or more solutions from ANSS. I am obviously not qualified to evaluate ANSS technology compared to that of its competitors. The company maintains that it has the deepest, most accurate, products across all major physics. Judging by the prices it charges, and frankly the level of margins it achieves, that is a claim that is probably accurate. If there were something equivalent, stickiness or not, the company would not be able to maintain the market share it achieved. I have linked here to a couple of market research studies on market size and market share. Most of the studies focus on specific vertical slices, such as CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics). These slices are not huge, but they are dominated by ANSS and are growing between 10% and 14%.Just to mention a use case that might be interesting to some readers - and dare I say easy for me and most readers to comprehend - Emirates Team New Zealand used ANSS technology and a simulation-driven development approach to make engineering and design improvements to its yacht. So far, the yacht is doing well in competitive situations and has won some important competitions. I have linked to a couple of articles about how simulation software has been effective in designing a yacht - obviously, one can extrapolate that accomplishment to the ability to solve many other design/performance problems.These days, the ANSS mantra is what is called Pervasive Simulation. Pervasive Simulation is obviously a marketing concept that the company uses to sell its technology. That said, the solution set is real enough. Even at this time, most designers still do not use simulation as part of their design process. Basically, the concept is based on using simulation earlier in the design process.Companies use the simulation process in order to reflect the performance of products in the real world. Users may add sensors to products being used in the real world and then create a digital twin so they can determine causes of performance deficiency, optimize and schedule preventive maintenance, evaluate different strategies to control products and otherwise work to optimize product performance and balance performance against operating expenses. The Ansys CEO has said that the use of simulation, as part of a holistic IoT strategy, is really the only way to realize the value of digital information as part of a transformation strategy for product design and operation. While I do not purport to be able to evaluate how this is working, clearly a $45 million order from an installed customer is a significant indication that some users are finding Pervasive Simulation a concept that resonates and has a strong value proposition. For those readers who want a more in-depth description of Pervasive Simulation, I have linked to an Ansys blog post that details the concept.The company has recently released an offering it calls Discovery Live. This is something of an industry first that will allow users to make 3D simulation interactive. The product is still in its gestation phase, and it is available for a free download. To an extent, this is an initiative by ANSS to bring the benefits of simulation to what I might describe as “Citizen Users”, i.e., designers as well as engineers, and to drive simulation technology into earlier phases of the industrial design paradigm.I am not trying to learn how to use simulation technology. Many years ago, when I studied economics/econometrics, and this kind of quantitative analysis was in its infancy, I knew something about it - simulations are part of how economists are alleged to make forecasts. But these days, about all I can do is to read about the future as it happens. Discover Live is potentially one of those releases. I can, however, suggest that this kind of a product has the potential to significantly expand the TAM for simulation software. Company management declined to estimate the specific TAM expansion potential of this new product, and it would be more or less a guess at this point, in any event. I have linked here and here for more in-depth commercials from ANSS for those users with a deeper interest in the subject.From a business perspective, Pervasive Simulation is equivalent to a “land and expand” strategy. This company’s new customers simply do not start out buying mega-deals, which are a significant component of expected growth going forward. This is nothing new, but seems to be more of an emphasis at this point than in the past, and of course, the $45 million deal and other large transactions are fruits of that emphasis.I have tried to suggest that arriving at a reasonable valuation is totally a function of whether one believes that some of the growth tailwinds I mentioned in the body of this analysis will come to fruition. On the current First Call consensus forecast, the valuation metrics would make the shares a Hold. One has to step away from the consensus in terms of actual numbers for 2018 and for future growth to make a case to invest in ANSS. I think one should make such a case, and I suspect that the company will modestly increase its expectations for both 2018 and future growth when it provides an update in February during its next conference call.At this point, with 84 million shares outstanding, ANSS has a market capitalization of $12.9 billion. The company has a net cash position of $927 million, which leaves an enterprise value of $12 billion. Based on the consensus revenue forecast for this year, that yields an EV/S of 10.1X. I expect revenues to be higher than the consensus and for estimates of long-term percentage growth to increase substantially over the coming year.Part of the offset to this very high EV/S ratio has been the relatively high margins and cash flow generated by this company. At the moment, the First Call consensus EPS for the current year is $4.23 - although that estimate is biased by including the models of analysts who have not changed their estimates to reflect Q3 results. Those P/E based on the First Call published consensus is 36X, but is really closer to 34.5X based on estimates from those who follow ANSS most carefully. Through 9 months, the company has accrued a GAAP tax rate of 30% and a non-GAAP tax rate of about 32%. Obviously, it will have a lower tax rate in 2018 than is currently being used by the consensus estimates. Using a 24% non-GAAP tax rate and 84 million shares, coupled with non-GAAP operating margins of 46% on revenues of $1.2 billion, yields EPS of about $5/share or a P/E of 30.6X. At that level, and with low teens revenue growth going forward, I think the price targets will ratchet up significantly.As mentioned earlier, the company is guiding to CFFO for 2017 of about $400-425 million. A lower tax rate at the levels indicated above is going to enhance cash flow by approximately $60 million, and the growth in the business should produce another $40 million in free cash flow growth. So the potential free cash flow for 2018 goes to $510 million, more or less, and that is a free cash flow yield of 4.4-4.5%.Generating $500 million of free cash is going to continue to open potential for ANSS to allocate capital in a shareholder-friendly fashion or to make accretive acquisitions. At this point, cash on the balance sheet represents more than 75% of current assets, and the company simply doesn’t need more cash either as a buffer or to operate the business. I would bet on seeing an enhanced share buyback program, which would further reduce the outstanding share count. Cash dividends, while certainly feasible, are probably not terribly likely for a company looking to produce higher growth.ANSS shares have done very little since they appreciated by about 10% in the wake of the last earnings release. They may not do all that much until the next earnings are released, currently scheduled for the last week of February. And it is a braver man than this writer who will forecast how the strong stock market start to this year plays out.I believe, however, that the tailwinds I have described, including a stronger economy, particularly in Germany, higher likely capex in the US, a lower tax rate accrual, and a weaker USD/EUR pair as well as continued strong acceptance of the company’s technologies, will support higher multiples and higher valuations.I think ANSS shares can produce another year of positive alpha."
4086936,101421,2017-07-11T11:33:27-04:00,Engineering simulation software firm ANSYS has acquired Computational Engineering International for an undisclosed sum.CEI has developed a simulation visualization software tool to help enterprises better understand the results of their simulation data.The acquisition will deepen ANSYS' offering to companies by providing its clients with a widely-used visualization tool integrated into its product suite.,"Quick TakeSimulation software company ANSYS (ANSS) has acquired Computational Engineering International for an undisclosed amount.CEI has created EnSight, it’s flagship software that enables users to import computer simulation data and automatically create visualizations that aid in understanding the results.The deal makes perfect sense for ANSYS, as it extends their engineering simulation software with a powerful visualization tool to help enterprises better understand and communicate their data-driven insights.Target CompanyApex, North Carolina-based Computational Engineering International [CEI] was founded in 1994 to develop software that takes data from computer simulations and helps visualize the data for user insight.Management is headed by CEO Anders Grimsrud, who was previously an application engineer at Cray Research before founding CEI.The company’s software is used in numerous industries and boasts a client base of the world’s leading firms.Additionally, the EnSight has expanded to support dozens of data formats used by specific industries and says ‘no other post-processer supports more CFD, MBD and FEA data formats and solver interfaces.’Acquisition Terms and RationaleNeither company disclosed the price or terms of the transaction, though management did state that it would provide ‘additional information’ on its Q2 earnings conference call, likely sometime in August.ANSYS did not file an 8-K on the deal, nor did it state any effect on its financial operations, so it appears that the deal was not material to its financial condition.CEI has 28 employees, but 750 customers worldwide, with many of those customers being large, household names, so ANSYS is no doubt paying more than just a ‘team and technology’ valuation for the deal.Since ANSYS is in the engineering simulation software business, the acquisition of CEI for its simulation visualization tool set would seem an obvious extension of its existing capabilities.As ANSYS president Mark Hindsbo stated in the deal announcement,Both companies have a worldwide client base, so the combination makes sense from a geographical breadth standpoint.The combination also provides the ability to integrate the two company’s customer bases, with the usual cross-selling opportunities that come from a combination.Both companies had previously worked together ‘informally for years,' according to CEI President Anders Grimsrud, so integration risk should be minimal.With the rise of data collection and usage within the enterprise, the ability to quickly visualize that data to facilitate insights and communication between team members becomes paramount.I view the deal as entirely logical, and it should provide ANSYS with a much more robust offering to position itself as the premier engineering simulation software provider.I write about M&A deals, public companies that invest in technology startups and IPOs.

3954766,56112,2016-03-05T10:02:40-05:00,"Weakness overseas, currency issues, and potential spending pullbacks by customers in cyclical industries are all weighing on the near-term outlook for ANSYS.In the longer term, the future is bright: there's a very high likelihood of simulation continuing to gain further penetration, and the company's cloud/UX moves are the right ones.Even after a pullback, shares still trade above my estimate of fair value - but that's not surprising for a high-quality company with a well-supported growth story.If shares take another leg down, growth investors should look at ANSYS with a keen eye.","I'm not one for macro prognostications, but there are a few out there that are a layup. One is that the world will use more rather than less technology with each coming year; another is that incremental improvements in design get more rather than less challenging as the ""low hanging fruit"" has been eliminated. Simulation software vendor ANSYS (NASDAQ:ANSS) is a high-quality company that fits smack in the middle of those two secular trends. Its multiphysics solutions, well-regarded among its historical base of highly knowledgeable researchers, seem like a lock to continue to become more broadly used by engineers, especially since it's making all the right moves (including simplifying the user experience and making a push into elastic cloud provisioning).This story doesn't come at a price, and even with a choppy macro weighing on shares, they still trade at a modest premium to my estimate of fair value. Nonetheless, shares aren't dramatically overvalued, and I do believe the company's long-term outlook is bright, making it a worthwhile watchlist candidate for growth investors.Macro Driving Short-Term Headwinds…While ANSYS has an internal target of double-digit revenue growth that should be achievable most years (for reasons I discuss subsequently), the downside of having a lot of customers in cyclical industries is that when the cycle is down, you will be too. Areas like semiconductors and off-highway are obviously not fantastic, while other markets like automotive are an open question (popular sentiment, whether true or not, is that US SAAR has peaked).The good news is that for ANSYS, ""down"" is relative - they still posted 7% constant-currency revenue growth in 2015 and are looking for over a billion in revenue at the midpoint in 2016. However, looking into 2016, they've noted that volatile markets have had a ""dampening influence on customers' buying cycles."" It seems like their guidance is taking these factors into account, but they've already revised down once, and if the global macro continues to be weak, it wouldn't surprise me to see further reductions.… But Longer Term, There's Sunshine Behind The CloudOn the one hand, SaaS offerings at ANSYS aren't new - under one name or another, they've been offering them for over 15 years. Customer adoption, however, was relatively de minimis. Part of this was technological (the latency/scalability required made on-prem delivery the better option) while part was cultural (if you're Boeing, do you really feel comfortable uploading your next-gen plane's data outside of your firewalls?)The company's commentary on this issue had been quite consistent up until a few years ago, but there has been a marked tone shift recently - the word ""cloud"" is mentioned no less than 47 times in the company's executive summary from last year's Investor Day. While it's still not material to revenues, the launch of ANSYS Enterprise Cloud in May 2015 removes one of the major barriers to adoption - computing power. I've made the case before that HPC and cloud were meant for each other, and simulation is the perfect example of software that not only begs for these capabilities, but will reflexively drive demand for bigger-better-faster cloud-based HPC (creating a virtuous cycle of sorts, similar to the early days of computing power and software functionality.)Make It Beautiful, And Users Will FollowIf there's one thing to be learned from the continuing success of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) despite absurdly high price points, it's that form beats function - perhaps less snidely, a simple user experience trumps a more fundamentally powerful and customizable operating system (iOS vs. Android, OSX vs. Windows). To this end, ANSYS explicitly recognizes that what took it from $50 million to $1 billion will not be what takes it from $1 billion to $2 billion, or $5 billion. It's already solidified its position from a technological standpoint - as a fun, brief reference point for readers who aren't familiar, both Tesla and SpaceX number among its users, and Elon Musk appreciated the company's feedback on his Hyperloop plan.But, there are only so many traditional simulation users - the prototypical customer over the past decade a PhD analyst focused on modeling something specific late in the design process. There are nine engineers in the world for every one of these, and ANSYS' capabilities would be extraordinarily useful to product engineers earlier in the process analyzing things from a systems point of view. The problem, however, is that the learning curve for the software has historically been somewhat steep, and users have been pretty siloed. (Indeed, one of the major conclusions from this 67-page paper on multiphysics was that scientists and mathematicians have historically been so siloed that there isn't even a common language between them.)There are several different ways the company is approaching it, but one of the big ones is ANSYS AIM, which garnered glowing reviews from several users - one called it ""a step change in productivity"" while a commenter on another review quipped ""looks as though it might even be usable by mere mortals.""As with cloud, I'd be careful expecting too much too soon - improving the user experience will likely be an iterative process as they garner a broader set of users and understand what new simulation users need/want. While it may be difficult to monitor their progress from the outside in any quantitative way, the fact that they're thinking about this and taking concrete steps in this direction gives me more confidence in the long-term growth story here.I Think The TAM Gets (Much) Bigger In The Longer TermSpeaking of the long-term growth story, I believe that cloud delivery, combined with the company's newfound focus on ease of use, could potentially drive a TAM expansion that even the company may be partially unaware of. As I referenced in my writeup of niche computational fluid dynamics vendor Exa (NASDAQ:EXA), the history of computing demonstrates that as computing costs decline, applications that might once have been cost-prohibitive suddenly become widespread. Simulation is clearly tracking to this curve from both a time and cost perspective; the company's commentary around substantive declines in time and cost thanks to elastic AWS infrastructure (and perhaps more anecdotally, this post by Strategy VP Sin Min Yap) both demonstrate this. The combination of the UI improvements and flexible cloud provisioning of HPC capacity could enable ANSYS to reach an additional market.I should caution that this will likely not be a near-term trend; the focus right now is clearly on driving strategic 7-figure sales, and the private cloud offering is thus still focused on big customers. Nonetheless, I believe a full multi-tenant public cloud is the next logical evolution - it would not be cannibalistic, as the users I believe the company could target likely do not currently use the product's full set of capabilities (due to a lack of local high-performance computing power). The more powerful (and cheaper) cloud-provisioned HPC gets, the more compelling this value proposition becomes.Cheapness Is RelativeANSYS is not a cheap stock in the absolute sense, and with a high degree of recurring revenue and long-term growth potential that seems well-underpinned, I'd be shocked to see it fall to a level that would make it show up on value screens. Nonetheless, the sluggish macro and currency weakness have kept a bit of a lid on valuation, with the stock trading at just under ~24x forward non-GAAP earnings with plenty of net cash.Excluding amortization but including SBC in my earnings estimates, a 7 to 8% long-term growth rate and flat margins gets me to a fair value in the mid-$70s (including cash on the balance sheet). If you push the long-term growth rate up to 9 or 10% or use a lower discount rate than I do, then you can justify the current share price - but I would caution that given the nature of the company's customers, it won't be a straight line (as the near-term results demonstrate). Bear in mind that margins could also evolve as the mix of offerings shifts somewhat (we have yet to see what impact cloud will have, for example). Between this and the company's clear direction of investment vs. margin expansion, I don't feel comfortable projecting operating leverage, but you may choose to do so.All that said, ANSYS is a high-quality growth story with limited direct competition. Throw in capable management that doesn't seem to have any transformative M&A ambitions, and such companies rarely trade at or below fundamental valuations, and the stock could certainly trade at a higher multiple if/when global macro fears abate (although the reverse is certainly true). If revenue growth continues to disappoint and the stock continues to struggle, it could certainly be worth a look.Wrapping It UpIf ANSYS traded at a market multiple or a small premium thereto, I wouldn't hesitate to buy shares myself - but that seems extremely unlikely. In the meanwhile, investors likely have to have some patience, as there's not much the company can do about major customers feeling cautious as a result of the global economy.These headwinds will not be permanent, though, and ANSYS has a credible path to long-term revenue growth. With strong margins and limited capital investment needs, it's a story that I think investors should do more work on if the stock takes another leg down.Disclaimer: Investing is inherently subjective and this article expresses opinions.

        As the leader in the space, the company has a substantial economic moat protecting its 38% operating margins.
        Capital expenditures are next to nil. Net Income To Free Cash Flow Conversion >100%.
        Rock-solid balance sheet with $850M in cash, no debt. Excess cash returned to shareholders via share repurchases.","ANSYS (NASDAQ:ANSS) is one of those interesting little technology companies that I just love to research, follow, and potentially own. The way the company is structured simply hits all the boxes on my investing checklist. Niche industry with limited competition? Check. Strong economic moat to keep competitors out? Check. Highly profitable with excellent cash flow generation? Check. I always do my research without looking at equity pricing and historical returns if I can, and in this case I wasn't surprised when I finally checked back on the company's ten year returns: 325% versus a 60% return for the S&P 500. Companies like this simply have a tendency to outperform the market over long periods of time, provided you choose your entry point carefully. So is the price right for me to pull the trigger today, as the company sits at all-time highs?Business ThesisAs a general overview, ANSYS develops and markets engineering simulation software. If that sounds vague, it is. This is a function of the broad end market functionality of the product and the vast array of practical uses. For instance, shipbuilders might use ANSYS simulation products to develop a fully digital model of a ship they are constructing. Using the software, those shipbuilders could model pressure and impact from water around the hull, all based on their current design. That model could identify where the highest pressure areas will be on the structure. Using those identified weak points, those builders could then reinforce structural areas that needed additional reinforcement in day-to-day use, which increases longevity and reduces operational risk.At the end of the day, this saves significant money. In the past before simulation became commonplace, products were often over-engineered (driving up build costs unnecessarily) or under-engineered (low quality, short life). Proper simulation allows manufacturers to get things just right, all while minimizing time spent developing a product and long-term costs like warranty repair.What makes ANSYS software unique is its flexibility in addressable broad end market applications (aerospace, automotive, energy, chemical processing, semiconductors, etc.). According to ANSYS, more than 40,00 customers use its products around the world, including 96% of the top 100 industrials on the Fortune 500 list. ANSYS is incredibly common at this point within the industry, and the company's software is taught in thousands of academic institutions worldwide, creating a future stream of engineers that are familiar with the software. Take this job posting from Apple as an example:That deep market penetration and its concentration of use in academia (more than 100,000 downloads by students) firmly entrench the company's products, building a substantial moat around the company's products. Simulation software takes significant time and energy to learn and master, and many of the world's engineers have been using ANSYS products for decades. Most companies simply cannot waste the time and resources to switch products, which is why ANSYS can generate the margins it does.Right now, the future looks bright for this market. Currently, ANSYS holds the crown as the largest player in the Simulation and Analysis market. Rather than grow lazy at the top, the company has been significantly spending on R&D, investing a large portion of revenue towards continuing to advance the suite of products under its umbrella.*ANSYS, 2016 Investor PresentationOf note, you'll see Dassault Systemes here (the maker of ABAQUS referenced in the above Apple job posting). This positioning (and spending) could not have come at a more opportune time, as technology trends (smart products, Internet of Things) drive increased product complexity (built-in electronics and software, cutting edge materials) across many of the company's markets. Overall, organic growth is estimates to be in the 8% range annually over the next five years.Earnings QualityANSYS' sales by industry diversification has already been highlighted, but it is worth pointing out the global footprint in product sales as well:This level of diversification hurt the company in 2015 (foreign exchange challenges contributed significantly to the flat y/y revenue growth, especially Europe), but these concerns should be alleviated headed into coming years. Following the trend of many technology companies, ANSYS continues to transition to a recurring revenue model, choosing to instead derive its revenue from maintenance and lease revenue rather than straight-up product sales. I've been a big fan of this trend; it helps on the forecasting side (78% of 2016 revenue was recurring) and adds some safety cushion (ANSYS has $506M in deferred revenue and backlog at the end of Q1 2016, an all-time high).Revenue has grown at a solid 8% clip annually since 2011, with incremental improvement on the gross margin side. Operating margin has slipped somewhat, but this is largely a function of increased R&D spending, which has nearly doubled from $109M to $169M (11.5% annual growth). This will likely moderate at current levels as the company is now vastly outspending peers, so if ANSYS can grow the top line, it likely will get some leverage on operating margin, a tailwind which has been elusive for years.While R&D spending is heavy, capital expenditures are not. That is simply the nature of the business, and it leads to operational cash flow being significantly more than net income. ANSYS generated $352M in free cash flow in 2015 ($368M op cash flow, $16M capex), all on an incredibly safe balance sheet. At the end of Q2 2016, the company held $844M in cash and cash equivalents with no debt. Capital allocation strategy is standard for a non-dividend paying company: acquisitions, then share repurchases. The company has taken out $637M worth of shares over the past three years (net of stock options), which, while not massive, does show the commitment to reducing share count for shareholder benefit.2016 guidance is for $1B in revenue, non-GAAP EPS of $3.57-3.67 (GAAP $2.95-$3.00/share by my look), free cash flow from $330-350M. This is puts likely 2016 cash flow yield at 4.4% (off enterprise value). Even assuming double-digit free cash flow growth (given 8% organic growth, 2% from margin expansion and market share gains), it would take several years of stellar execution to put the company in my preferred range.This is largely a function of the sharp rally the company has seen in August, with shares up 10% off strong August earnings. I think the market has gotten a little too aggressive on that rally - fair value is likely in the $90/share range given historical valuation, and I'd be more than willing to pick up shares if the company plumbed the lower $80/share area. This would simply be a retest of lows seen in January, or a return to equity pricing that was prevalent through most of 2014. I am deeply intrigued by the company, I just want a better deal. For a company with a similar business, take a look at Aspen Technologies, which is quite similar (tech, insulted market, strong cash flow generation) but still trades cheaper than ANSYS, despite a 35% rally since that prior-linked article.For deep dive research on asymmetric risk/reward plays in the Industrial and Basic Materials sectors, consider investing alongside me and other subscribers within Industrial Insights in order to get cutting-edge information with proven results.This new offering doesn't mean I will be cutting down on quality or my allocated time towards my free offerings on Seeking Alpha.

4003155,102173,2016-08-30T15:44:05-04:00,Ansys had a banner quarter recently and investors reacted enthusiastically to it.This article takes a closer look at the ROIC of Ansys and a peer group that I constructed.In the end we discuss whether Ansys can justify its earnings multiple based on excess returns that it is expected to generate.,"Performance of Ansys in the most recent quarterAnsys (NASDAQ:ANSS) reported an upbeat quarter in its most recent second quarter 2016 earnings. The company is transitioning from a lifetime license-based model to a recurring subscription-based model. This led to strong buying among customers who wanted to take hold of some of the last licenses offered by Ansys. After a stagnant posture for almost 7 months, the stock is up almost 9% after its 2Q16 earnings were declared on 4th of August. However, since the recent surge among customers was a one-time event, Ansys doesn't seem attractive in terms of the pricing multiple that it currently trades at. In this piece, I argue from an excess returns perspective why recent investor enthusiasm on Ansys could be a misplaced bet. I do not disagree with the company's economic moat. I have used the software myself and I find it to be irreplaceable. I'm only questioning whether the company's current multiples are justified.Rationale behind the use of excess returns as justification for premium multiplesCompanies that are able to return excess return over the cost of capital should trade at a richer multiple compared to companies that don't. However, we should also clearly demarcate the returns the company earns from existing investments and those it expects to achieve from future investments. Let's assume that company A currently earns a ROIC or return on invested capital of 25% and a company B has a ROIC of 20%. The cost of capital of both A and B is the same. However, B is expected to return 30% on its invested capital in the next five years and A's ROIC is expected to remain constant. Everything else held constant which company should trade at a premium? It should be B as its investments are creating more value on a per dollar basis compared to A. Another way of putting this in perspective is investors should be willing to pay more per dollar of B's earnings compared to A as B's investments create more value compared to A.Returns on prior invested capitalFor peer group construction I have used S&P Global 1200 companies that are classified in the software industry based on Global Industry Classification Standards. I then filtered it to include companies domiciled in the US. This resulted in a group of 12 companies. The average five-year ROIC of this group was 10.5% and the average trailing price to earnings ratio was 35.1X. Within this group, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) had the best five-year ROIC of 22.7% and is currently trading at a trailing PE of 36.2X. I have used weighted average cost of capital or WACC figures from Bloomberg for each of the 12 companies. Since WACC is by far the most abused figure when it comes to valuation, the caveat of ""garbage in, garbage out"" goes along with this analysis. The average peer group excess returns in 2015 was -0.5% as some companies such as Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) posted negative ROIC due to business model transition from licensing to subscriptions and other company specific factors.The average five-year ROIC of Ansys is 11.3% and the company is currently trading at a trailing PE ratio of 34.1X. The average excess returns of Ansys in the last five years was 0.88%. However, the company's excess returns over last five years have steadily increased from -0.3% in 2011 to 2.2% in 2015. It's interesting to note this was achieved due to declining WACC. The company's ROIC in the last five years has largely remained constant.The problem of uncertaintyThe problem of transitioning to a subscription-based business model is that it brings with itself a period of uncertainty. Ansys has built its software empire based on selling perpetual licenses and collecting maintenance fees for the support provided on these licenses. Transitioning to the Software as a Service or SaaS model is challenging for the reason that revenue growth is slower in the initial years. It takes much longer to break even with respect to revenues generated by licensing sales in the same period. I don't think investors should underestimate this challenge as Ansys is used to generating a bulk of its revenues in the first year of the sale. Even established software vendors such as SAP (NYSE:SAP) have had problems transitioning to SaaS. I don't expect it to be any different for Ansys. The degree of uncertainty or additional risk should warrant a higher discount rate for Ansys until it is reasonably established that the transition could be successful.Currently, the operating margins of Ansys are way ahead of competitors such as Autodesk (ADSK) and PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC). However, as it changes its business model, the company's operating margins are expected to come under pressure as we saw in the case of Autodesk. As operating margins slide, its ROIC by definition will take a hit. Given that the near-term uncertainty should also warrant a higher discount rate, the company might have to contend with weak excess returns at least in the 2-3 year period."

3688316,96566,2015-11-16T12:14:51-05:00,"Ansys operates in a sector with high barriers to entry and good growth prospects.Ansys's underlying business is capital light, allowing management to purse acquisitions and deliver capital returns from free cash flow.Ansys has retreated 8% over the past few weeks offering a decent entry price.","Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) is a market leader in developing engineering simulation software for use in academic research and in industries such as defense, aerospace, electronics and automotives.The investment case for Ansys centers on three pillars that have the potential to drive shareholder value over a medium- to long-term investment horizon:Strong economic moatOwing to the complex nature of the products that Ansys markets the company enjoys a strong moat around the core business. This is evident in the extremely stable and high operating margins, which have averaged above 35% over the period 2009-2015. Furthermore the retention rate of their customers also remains high, with recurring revenue making up 73% of the company's sales for the trailing twelve months ended September 2015. Not only does this signal the stickiness of Ansys' products, but it is also an indication of the high barriers to entry in the overall sector, since potential new entrants need to compete against the highly complex and sophisticated software offerings that Ansys has developed over the past twenty years.To further visualize the extent of Ansys' economic moat the company has operated at a CROCI level (cash return on invested capital) of above 15% for the past four fiscal years, increasing to over 20% for FY2014. In essence the company is now generating $20 in free cash flow for every $100 of capital invested in the business. Not only is the CROCI level consistently above 10%, which can be considered a good sign of the strength of the underlying business, but it is growing which indicates the strength of the management's ability to generate increasing free cash flow.Capital light business to drive shareholder valueThe capital light nature of the underlying business affords the company a large degree of scope to deliver increasing shareholder returns, both by carrying on with their bolt-on acquisition strategy and by their on-going capital return program. Currently the company is averaging between 4-9% of capital spending relative to cash flow, essentially allowing the company up to use up to 95% of operating cash flow to pursue acquisitions and to finance the capital return program - providing sustainable inorganic growth from cash flows without the need to leverage the company's balance sheet. Using figures from Ansys' Q3 results for the three months ended September the company was buying back stock at an annual run rate of approximately 2.5%, with management indicating their intent to continue returning capital to shareholders going forward.Good growth prospectsCurrent trailing twelve month revenue has grown at approximately 9% in constant currency terms, with the company averaging 12.6% compounded revenue growth over the past five years. More importantly though earnings per share and free cash flow per share have increased at a compounded rate of over 16% during the same period, with management guiding for mid-single digit revenue increases and high single to mid double digit percentage increases in earnings per share for FY2016 over FY2015.Over the longer term the computer graphics and simulation software industry is forecast to grow from $23.3bn in 2014 to $32.7bn by 2019 according to Research and Markets. Ansys is well placed to capture a significant portion of that growth due to its current industry leading position.Current value and investment propositionCurrently Ansys is trading at a price to free cash flow (P/FCF) of 23.5 which is broadly in-line with the IT service industry average of 23. Taking into account the roughly $8 of net-cash per share (with no debt on the balance sheet), and Ansys is trading at an enterprise value to free cash flow (EV/FCF) of approximately 21. Given that the share price has retreated by 8% from its high of $97.77 just a few weeks ago, the stock is currently offering a decent long-term entry price.Running a DCF analysis on the stock using the company's estimated and historical cash flow figures, along with the good growth prospects for the overall sector, the stock appears fairly valued to moderately undervalued at the present time indicating little room for error. However, given the overall quality of the company, its large economic moat and strong cash flow metrics the stock offers a large degree of additional upside and stability compared to its peers trading at similar values of P/FCF and EV/FCF."
3011406,63483,2015-03-18T15:19:59-04:00,Significant FX headwinds due to recent strengthening of the dollar.Positive outlook on the global computer graphics market will act as a tailwind.Proprietary software and customer stickiness will maintain profit margins going forward.Continued stream of complementary acquisitions further solidifies the company's position within the industry.DCF model indicates Ansys is fairly valued.,"Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) is a provider of simulation software. Due to the recent strengthening of the dollar, significant FX headwinds are to be expected. Tailwinds include the positive outlook on the global computer graphics market. Thanks to the company's proprietary software and the tendency for customer stickiness, profit margins are expected to be resilient going forward. The company has continued its acquisition spree, targeting companies that offer products that are complementary to those offered by Ansys. This has allowed the company to solidify its position within the industry.Significant FX headwinds due to recent strengthening of the dollarDue to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar as a result of the diverging monetary policies of major central banks as of late, companies with significant non-U.S. operations will continue to experience FX headwinds. In Ansys' 2014 annual report, the company detailed that a 1.6% strengthening of the U.S. dollar as calculated at the end of 2014 resulted in the decrease of revenue by $7.6m. The dollar has appreciated greatly since then, with the U.S. DCI strengthening approximately 10% YTD. Furthermore, the company has mentioned FX challenges in their Q4 2014 earnings call. Thus, I expect the company's top-line growth to be offset by FX translation going forward.Positive outlook on the global computer graphics market will act as a tailwindAccording to research, the global computer graphics market should see a 6.97% CAGR through 2018. Ansys participates in this market by providing simulation software that enable users to analyze designs from inception to validation in an efficient manner. The company has managed to achieve deep market penetration with its software being used by a myriad of users from students to aerospace and defense engineers. Due to the company's incumbent position within the industry, I have little doubt Ansys will be able to continue capitalizing on the growth in the computer graphics market.Proprietary software and customer stickiness will maintain profit marginsThe company's simulation software is proprietary, hence providing a legal barrier to entry, making the company difficult to compete with. In addition, when users utilize the company's software, they get used to its platform and tend to be sticky customers. It would not only be a hassle to switch platform but it will not make sense economically. This will allow Ansys to continue generating recurring revenue and maintain its profit margins.Continued spree of bolt-on acquisitions further solidifies market positionIn recent years, Ansys has made further bolt-on acquisitions. Last year, the company acquired SpaceClaim and Reaction Design. SpaceClaim sells intuitive 3-D modeling software which allows users to model new concepts, which will in turn drive innovation. Reaction Design sells chemistry simulation software, enabling transportation manufacturers and energy companies to achieve their clean tech goals. It is clear that ANSYS is acquiring companies that sell complementary software and integrating that software into the company's Ansys Workbench, opening cross-sell opportunities. Furthermore, these bolt-on acquisitions allow the company to further solidify its market position within the computer graphics industry.ValuationAs seen in the above DCF model, company revenues are projected to grow at growth rates of 3% in earlier years, peaking at 7% in the middle of the projection period and decreasing to 3% at the end of the projection. The subdued growth of 3% in the FY15 can be largely attributed to significant FX headwinds stemming from the strengthening of the dollar. As the company enters FY16 and beyond, I expect cross-sell opportunities stemming from bolt-on acquisitions and industry-wide growth to offset FX headwinds, allowing the company to achieve growth rates closer to the overall industry. EBITDA margins are expected to be maintained at 46% thanks to the company's proprietary software, customer stickiness and incumbency advantage. Ansys currently trades at 16.2x EV/LTM EBITDA. Using this figure, along with a 12% discount rate, the model produces a fair value of approximately $80 for Ansys, indicating that the company is currently trading at a 7.6% premium. With such a relatively small premium to current trading prices, Ansys is more or less fairly valued. My outlook on the company is hence neutral - investors are advised to wait for a pullback before initiating a long position as the company continues to trade near 52-week highs."
3341775,69645,2015-07-21T10:38:14-04:00,"Ansys has run up significantly over the last 10 years and has reached new highs.The company is a leader in a limited market, which is usually a recipe for continued returns.Look into the name during significant downturns in the overall market as it is trading close to fair value.","Here's a question: Name me a mid-cap company with nearly 85% gross margins, a hefty moat and has a 10-year average growth rate of over 20%? There are obviously not that many companies that fulfill this criteria but the company that I will be focusing on today that does fill these characteristics is none other than Ansys Inc, (NYSE: ANSS).Ansys is a leader in engineering modulation and simulation software, an oligopolistic market, and the overall bull thesis is well laid out by Sergio Heiber and Lester Goh. However, despite the incredible run up in the stock over the last few years, I believe the stock still has significant upside.Comparatively speaking, ANSS is cheaper than its main rival Dassault Systems SA. The company's price/book and price/cash flow are both lower than Dassault's (OTCPK:DASTY) while sporting operating margins of near 37% versus Dassault's 18.9%. The company has grown at a faster rate than Dassualt over the last three years and has higher ROIC and ROE as well. Another rival, Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), also sports a higher price/book and has 1/10th the operating margins. However, given the large moat ANSS has in this space (due to a number of variables such as complexity of software, engineering talent depth, patent base, switching costs, breadth of service), the main measure that I like to use when analyzing ANSS' future is free cash flow to sales. Using this metric (along with other information) provides a better understanding of ANSS' potential growth prospects since more organic cash can be generated from stable top line sales growth (expected high single digits to low double digits for the next few years) fueling acquisitions and R&D investment. The higher the ratio, the more cash generated from sales. Looking at ANSS, we see the free cash/sales of 36.46% for the trailing twelve months vs. 19.58% for Autodesk and 21.80% for Dassault.Companies like Ansys want to continue to protect their moat and given the knowledge-centric nature of its business, acquisitions will be a natural part of their business model in addition to creating and developing superior technology. Looking at Figure 1, we see the company somewhat undervalued, but the recent run up and high P/E ratio does put the company on the more ""fair value"" end.Figure 1There are obvious headwinds the company faces such as rising interest rates which will affect valuation as well as growth in the competition but the major concern for investors should be their EBITDA growth. This has been growing only single digits which is not ideal for a company like Ansys trying to attack new markets and increase free cash flow. It would be nice to see this number rise over time especially with the premium most investors will have to pay for the company's shares.Despite these headwinds, investors should consider Ansys as it is a quality company with strong long-term metrics. This is usually a recipe for outperformance. However, interested investors should be cautious and wait for significant dips before getting into the name."
3249375,76425,2015-06-10T10:49:20-04:00,Ansys has been a steady growth stock.Ansys has predictable earnings and a game plan that points to continued growth.Ansys is in a high growth sector that's under penetrated.,"Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) globally markets and engineers simulation software and technologies used across a broad spectrum of industries. The company's products enable customers to test and improve product design without building prototypes, speeding entry into the marketplace and providing cost savings.My investment thesis on ANSS is that the company has developed a business model that has a high barrier to entry and that the company will continue to thrive in an industry with high growth prospects because of its customer diversification and customer retention success.Research and Markets forecasts that the computer graphics market will grow from $23.33 billion in 2014 to $32.68 billion by 2019, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate of 6.97% during the forecast period. ANSS has been very successful in capturing its share of this market, providing solutions to over 40,000 customers throughout the world. The company has created a high moat and made itself unique due to the complexity of its products. Illustrative of the sophistication involved, ANSS employs over 700 PhDs.The company has fueled its growth on a consistent basis by being well diversified across geographical areas and many industries and by relying on licensing and recurring revenue income streams. For the recently completed 2015 first quarter, U.S. sales were 39% of the total, Europe 32% and Asia was 29%. Electronics were 18% of sales while automotive and semiconductor sales were each 14% of the total. ANSS other customers were in the aerospace and defense, construction, consumer products. academic, energy, bio-med and industrial equipment industries. Recurring revenue represented about 76% of the total revenue so far this fiscal year. ANSS has grown revenues by continuously adding new customers and by entering into multiple deals with existing customers. ANSS retains its customer base by using multi year contracts and wins loyalty because transferring to a competitor would require that the customer obtain and learn a new and complex software system.Notable comments from 2015 1Q earnings report: ""Our perpetual and lease license revenues each grew 5% in constant currency, while our maintenance revenue grew 13% in constant currency. Both lease licenses and maintenance contributed to our recurring revenue base continuing to remain strong at 76% of revenue for the quarter. There was continued progress in enterprise portfolio sales efforts, cross-selling and customer engagement activities that contributed to building a record deferred revenue and backlog balance of $477.5 million at March 31, 2015, as well as the overall sales pipeline for Q2 2015 and beyond.""ANSS revenue has grown 13 fold over the past 15 years at industry leading margins.ANSS data by YChartsIt is estimated that the simulation market penetration will grow from its current rate of 10% to about 30% over the next five years. ANSS is primed to continue serving many different industries. In the U.S., loosening of the defense budget will result in opportunities in the aerospace and military sectors. Increased requirements for better fuel mileage will continue to drive automotive sales and the growing Internet of Things trend will continue support growth in the high tech sector. In Europe, ANSS has been very actively involved in the academic sector servicing colleges and universities as well as is the automobile sector serving European companies in their interest in capturing international sales. ANSS also has been benefiting from opportunities in Asian infrastructure growth.There are many companies that are involved in the simulation market such as the large software companies Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), IBM (NYSE:IBM), but they are not pure plays. Simulations Plus (NASDAQ:SLP) is a competitor but it concentrates mostly in the drug development sector. Dassault Systemes SA (OTCPK:DASTY) and Exa Corporation (NASDAQ:EXA) are two publicly traded competitors that are pure plays in the simulation market.ANSS has better margins than its direct competitors and sells at a lower forward PE.ANSS Profit Margin (Annual) data by YChartsANSS PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsANSS valuation is somewhat lofty. The forward PE is 23. Analysts are forecasting growth over the next five years to be about 9% resulting in a PEG of 3. Despite the high valuation, ANSS remains attractive. There's a history of good management and success and a well executed game plan. The company's recurring revenue model provides a reliable and predictable income stream. There's almost $9 per share in the till and no debt. ANSS is and has been very actively undergoing a share buyback program. Based on the business plan and demand for its product, ANSS is likely to continue gaining new business and retain its remarkable margins for the foreseeable future.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3172926,63483,2015-05-12T05:33:52-04:00,"Weak 1Q performance is not what it seems.Outlook remains intact, performance should accelerate in upcoming quarters on a constant-currency basis.Forex headwinds will continue to adversely impact operating results going forward.Ansys remains fairly valued.","Earnings ReviewAnsys (NASDAQ:ANSS) recently reported first quarter operating results for FY15. The company's performance was weak at first sight, but further digging reveals that this weak 1Q performance is not what it seems. ANSS's top-line grew 1% y/y to $217m from $215m, while GAAP EPS grew 2% from $0.60 to $0.61 over the same period. In terms of analyst estimates, the company performed in-line with expectations, reporting non-GAAP EPS of $0.77.Weak 1Q performance is not what it seemsIn a prior article on ANSS, I warned investors that the company would face significant headwinds of the currency variety in upcoming quarters. These headwinds can be attributed to the recent strengthening of the USD vis-à-vis other major currencies. Considering ANSS's global presence, the company was sure to experience a material drag on its operating results. Indeed, excluding the impact of FX, the company would have grown its top-line by 8% y/y, equating to a 7% currency headwind. One can hence conclude that the demand for the company's products, primarily its ANSYS software, remains resilient. The company recently released ANSYS 16.0 during its first quarter, which should prompt a refresh cycle.Outlook remains intact, performance should accelerate in upcoming quarters on a constant-currency basisOn a geographic basis, the company saw decent growth y/y in its North American and APAC segments, with the former jumping 11% and the latter rising 9% during the quarter, on a constant-currency basis. This strong demand should continue into the second quarter as there have been no further developments that would adversely affect the company's growth since my last article. Although the company secured only 22 orders valued above a million, compared to 32 in the prior period, these tough 1Q comps were primarily due to deal timing. Furthermore, despite a lower absolute number of deals, management reported that the value of deals were up 26% y/y.Europe performed relatively poor compared to the other geographic segments, increasing a mere 5% on a constant currency basis. However, this segment's performance should accelerate in upcoming quarters as the company continues building up sales capacity. Management has highlighted that sales capacity is one factor limiting their growth, and they are clearly taking steps to realize further growth. On a net basis, headcount increased by 35, the majority of which were added to the sales force. As a reference, the company's sales force as of 4Q 2014 numbered 1,300 employees. Thus, expect the European segment to pick up in the near-term, while North America and APAC continue growing at a decent clip.Forex headwinds will continue to adversely impact operating results going forwardEarlier in the article, I mentioned the company suffered a huge hit to its top-line due to currency headwinds. These headwinds remain present going into 2Q, and largely stem from the Fed's diverging monetary policy stance relative to its central banking peers. During recent FOMC meetings, the Fed has made its intention to raise rates very clear, the only uncertain factor being when. Most are of the opinion that this would occur by late-2015, and this sentiment is reflected in the currency markets, as buyers drove the greenback to greater levels, resulting in rapid appreciation. Their theory is simple - when rates rise, yields should rise in tandem.Thus, although the dollar currency index has fallen slightly, it remains at elevated levels, according to CNBC data. As investors continue to anticipate a rate hike, demand for the greenback should continue to be strong, driving the index higher. ANSS will clearly be a victim, due to its significant international exposure. Going into the second quarter, I expect a top-line FX hit in the range of the high single-digits. However, the key figure to watch would be constant-currency growth, as they reflect a clearer picture of the demand for the company's offerings.ValuationAs seen above, my assumptions for ANSS remain unchanged from my prior article on the stock. Most of what I anticipated (decent constant-currency growth, FX-related weakness, flat margins) turned out to be reality. Thus, I remain neutral on ANSS, largely due to the fact that it is currently fairly valued.Do not misunderstand, ANSS is a great business - the ANSYS platform is proprietary, customer switching costs and stickiness are extremely high due to the software being deeply embedded within customer workflows. Such great qualitative factors have also shown in the company's fundamentals, as the company continues to reap fabled EBITDA margins in the 46% range year after year.Due to its defensive end-market exposure, ANSS is sure to trade at a steep multiple. Hence, I opine that investors should initiate long positions on the company at every buying opportunity where the stock significantly pulls back, in order to secure an appropriate margin of safety. If one ponders over the type of businesses that they should own over the long-term, they are sure to conclude that paying up for a business with defensive demand drivers is ideal as such a business would perform well in all economic environments. At current prices, ANSS is unattractive. Buy on dips."
2935256,63893,2015-02-21T10:20:58-05:00,"Ansys is the industry leader in computer-based simulation software, which as an industry should see double-digit growth rates from increased industrial utilization over the next decade or so.
        The company benefits from significant switching costs associated with using its software, and competitors would be hard-pressed to replicate the company's software portfolio or other intangible assets.
        Though benefiting from both industry growth and an economic moat, I am wary of shares at the moment, seeing as how they bake in a bull-case scenario.","Investment Thesis:Continued rapid uptake of engineering simulation software should drive double-digit industry-wide growth over the better part of the next decade, and Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) is perfectly positioned to reap the benefits. The company's competitive positioning is strengthened by significant switching costs imposed by the complexity of its software, as well as significant intangible assets and high barriers to entry driven by industry complexity and deep knowledge base of its research arm. The company has a long runway for growth, as even its installed user base sees low single-digit penetration, and additional dimensions for growth in increased utilization of multi-physics simulation capabilities should further add to growth potential. However, the shares rarely trade at a discount, and currently seem to bake in the most favorable scenarios for the company. With the stock fully valued, I eagerly await any drop in the stock to the mid-$70's to initiate a position.Company Overview:Ansys develops and markets engineering simulation software and services, which are used by engineers, designers, researchers, and academic institutions for a variety of applications, including aerospace, biomedical fields, and energy. The company's principal software packages provide a platform to allow engineers and other researchers to analyze designs through computer simulations, helping them avoid unnecessary costs from product failures by testing for failures in a virtual environment. Ansys' software covers all aspects of product design, from conceptualization to finalization and validation.Ansys' flagship Workbench software is the framework upon which the rest of the company's systems are built. The software allows users to easily put together simulations using a simultaneous variety of complex physics engines (""multiphysics analyses""), and update the project easily using the generated data. Product suites permit additional functionality, from group collaboration on shared projects and audit trails, direct interfaces with CAD programs, and automated meshing of physical models into digital forms. Structure simulation reduces the need for physical prototyping by simulating a variety of scenarios and forms, including high acuity events (short-duration, high-strain) like fractures or material failures that would be too complex and/or expensive to study experimentally using physical models. Similarly, fluid and electronics simulation software packages streamline companies' product design cycles by enabling them to quickly and cheaply simulate operating conditions, sometimes with industry-specific modifications, and the company even offers products that aim to simulate entire multi-modality systems leveraging individual modeling capabilities in a unified environment. These latter products are inherently more complex by orders of magnitude, as they involve multi-physics approaches to emulate real-world conditions, coupling the interactions between multitudes of discrete processes with their own set of behaviors.The company uses a continuous, iterative approach to upgrade its product offerings, building in new capabilities through its additional product suites that build upon existing technologies. As a direct result, Ansys' R&D costs are moderately high by software standards, running around 15-17% percent of revenues (for reference, R&D costs for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) are generally in the 12-13% range), though not as high as those of some peers (Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) have R&D margins of 19% and 24% in general, respectively). Sales are accomplished through independent channels as well as an internal sales arm; Ansys certifies its channel partners to offer training to new users and provide technical support, as well as expand installations within the existing installed base. The company has strategic partnerships with CAD vendors like Autodesk and Dassault (to help ensure smooth transition of electronic data models from CAD software to Workbench), electronics design and layout software providers like Cadence and Mentor Graphics (to permit a smooth interface between EDA packages), and computer hardware suppliers like Intel and IBM (critical to ensuring the company's high-demand software can run on the latest, greatest hardware). The company's long-term competitive position is also supported by serial acquisitions, which have historically served to provide complementary capabilities to its core software package:Source: Self-produced; data from Company 10-K's.Industry Trends and Economic Moat:As hardware capabilities continue to advance and as corporations around the world look to cut costs and minimize time-to-market for their products, simulation software is becoming increasingly important. Simulation software has become increasingly popular (and is set to become even more popular) amongst large companies looking to reduce the impact of R&D on their own bottom lines. Indeed, Ansys claims 96 out of the top 100 industrial companies in the world as customers, and the company is by far the industry leader in engineering simulation software, with a market share estimated anywhere from 60-70%, with the rest of the market divided amongst dozens of small, privately held companies. The simulation software market is set to grow at an estimated 11-12% per year due to increased utilization, and Ansys, as the market leader, is set to benefit directly as a result. The company itself estimates an addressable market for simulation software in the $20 billion range in 7 years' time, as even within existing accounts the company sees only about 5% of all engineers using its software, and even then, only for a fraction of the total capability. An growing user base that in turn leverages more of Workbench's multiphysics capabilities to build more realistic simulations is key to the company's long-term strategy, and the increasing depth and intensity of the usage should help ensure a double-digit growth rate for years to come.Moreover, users of Ansys' software tend to be sticky, as computer simulation software imposes significant switching costs. Simulation software packages are difficult to learn, and academic engineering programs often train on only a few platforms, which the students then tend to use later on in professional life as training on alternate software packages is costly and time-consuming. These switching costs are reflected in the company's extremely high license renewal rates, which are typically in the high 90's. Besides switching costs, potential competitors face high barriers to entry. Open-source software programs do not generally have the extensive hardware and software compatibility and capabilities as Ansys' Workbench (though their capabilities are growing), and commercial competitors are hard-pressed to develop de novo Ansys' unique multiphysics operating environment or match the company's existing installed base. Moreover, Ansys benefits from significant intangible assets, as its over 900 employees in its development arm tend to hold advanced (often post-doctorate) degrees and extensive industry experience; replicating Ansys' knowledge base and software portfolio would be profoundly difficult.Because of the switching costs associated with the use of its complex software, the high barriers to entry associated with the industry, and the company's significant intangible assets, I believe Ansys has developed at least a narrow economic moat. The company appears well positioned to take advantage of double-digit industry growth over the next several years, and I feel comfortable forecasting top-line growth in the low-teens in my valuation model.Recent Operating Performance and Company Trends:In a significant part due to the high recurrence rate of its revenue stream, Ansys has been a remarkably steady performer over the past decade. Steady, double-digit top-line growth has been accompanied by mild operating margin expansion, and EPS have grown at torrid pace. (It is notable that the stock price has largely kept up, and that the company rarely trades at a discount.)[Author's note: All images are self-produced. 10-year financial data is gathered from Morningstar.]Operating efficiencies have generally been stable. Despite the company's steady diet of acquisitions, intangibles on the balance sheet have been falling, and the company's low cash conversion cycle enables it to be highly liquid.Gross and operating margins have held steady, as falling SGA costs have been somewhat offset by rising levels of investment in R&D.Returns on invested capital have generally outweighed cost of capital (and are improving from a nadir in 2006), adding quantitative support to the notion that the company has an economic moat.Recent operating performance has suggested these trends remain strongly intact, though some topline weakness is visible relative to prior years. (It should be noted that the company's best growth is typically seen in the fourth quarter, with weakness in the summer months, due to seasonal purchasing and budgeting patterns.) Net margins are strongly intact, though, and double-digit EPS growth looks to be still in play.The balance sheet remains very solid, leaving the company in strong position to continue pursuing its acquisition strategy and ensure continued industry consolidation, which should further drive its economic moat. Valuation:I estimate a fair value for Ansys at $81 per share. I apply an averaged scenario analysis to a discounted cash flow model and historical valuation model to achieve my result. In my base scenario ($81, 60%), the company's sees mid-teens top-line growth and operating margin expansion of roughly 100 BPS to drive mid-teens EPS growth, as the company's plan to expand client user penetration, density, and intensity coincide with continued double-digit industry growth. In this scenario, open-source software begins to play a more pronounced role in a few years' time, weighing on both margins and revenue growth in the back half of the forecast. In the bear case scenario ($68, 25%), the company's efforts to drive additional users in its existing installed base are unsuccessful, and open-source and private competitors' software packages make inroads into the market, and the company's top-line growth is limited to an industry-wide 11-12%. Margins are eroded due to competitive pressures to the tune of 100 BPS, and EPS growth drops to the mid single digits. In the bull case scenario ($96, 15%), robust user uptake is coupled with significant improvements in user intensity and depth, in turn driving margin expansion of over 200 BPS, with EPS growth in the high-teens. A historical valuation model values the company at roughly $85. My fair value estimate implies a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23 times my 2015 EPS estimate and an EV/EBITDA ratio of 17 times. With shares trading in the mid-80's as of this writing, I view the shares as fully valued to mildly overvalued.Risks:Despite Ansys' significant intangible assets and wide user base, large firms, like Autodesk, already offer CAD programs that could easily incorporate (and already do, to some extent) simulation capabilities. These programs themselves have large installed user bases with the same dynamics (switching costs, barriers to entry) that benefit Ansys, and a move by these companies in this direction would certainly dry up Ansys' economic moat. Despite high renewal rates, Ansys' end customers are leveraged to general conditions for industrial companies, who in times of distress may turn to less costly offerings, such as open-source software, which itself is growing more and more capable. Currency exchange risk remains a concern for any company operating in overseas markets, and a strengthening dollar could weigh upon both top- and bottom-line growth.Management:CEO James E. Cashman III has been with Ansys since 1999 and has served as CEO since 2000. He has extensive experience in the engineering software industry, having worked in various capacities in the industry since the 1970's. Under his leadership, Ansys has seen its market share climb to a dominant 60-70%, and investors have been rewarded with stock gains of over 350% over the past decade, weathering the financial crisis of 2009 with aplomb. Acquisitions have generally been of the bolt-on variety, expanding the company's software capabilities in measured ways, while removing competitors from the playing field, and the company's continued liquidity ensures that Ansys has plenty of ammunition to continue its strategy. Board Chairman Peter Smith was a former CEO of the company, and similarly has a vast amount of experience in the CAD/CAM industries, having worked up from the engineering software business. CEO and Board Chairman roles are separated, which I always prefer. On the downside, though CEO compensation appears to be fair, Mr. Cashman does sit on the compensation committee, and while independent directors all hold a fair share of stock, their overall percentage of the company owned is rather miniscule, with each holding less than 1%. Overall, I view the company management favorably. The company does not pay a dividend, preferring to retain earnings for reinvestment, which is understandable given Ansys' acquisition strategy and research and development costs as well as the growth state of the industry in general.Conclusion:There is much to like about Ansys, which I think should be able to generate high double-digit total returns over the next few years, or at least single-digit total returns even if things should go ill. The company benefits from a significant economic moat, and operates in an industry that should see double-digit growth rates for at least the better part of the coming decade, which would drive double-digit growth rates for Ansys even if the company were simply to run in place. Operating efficiencies are well managed and the company's acquisition strategy seems reasonable, and management overall (less the small amount of insider ownership) seems highly capable and aligned with shareholder interests. But with shares basically baking in a bullish scenario at the moment, I find that the company is now fully valued, and would prefer a greater margin of safety before buying in, preferably in the mid to low $70's."

More recently, the stock is trading down 15% YTD, providing a buying opportunity for this company with a history of success. Although shares stalled towards the end of 2013, and in 2014 have been down, it hasn't been in line with earnings. Earnings reports for the past four quarters have all met or exceeded expectations, and because of the company's healthy financials, I expect these results to continue in Q2 2014 and beyond.Since 2009 sales have increased steadily, and the company is projecting sales growth over 10% for 2014.The same goes for net income and EBIDTA. Source: MarketWatchIn 2009, the company had $198.32M of long-term debt, which was reduced to $127.56M in 2010, $53.15M in 2011, and since 2012, the company has run with zero debt on its balance sheet.Both operating and net profit margins are outstanding, coming in at 37.37% and 28.48% for 2013 and 36.73% and 26.27% for Q1 2014, respectively, handily beating competitors such as AutoDesk (ADSK), Dassauult (DASTY) and Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), all while maintaining a lower P/E ratio, having zero debt, consistent free cash flows, and significant growth.Free cash flow has grown well over time, from $165.38M in 2009 to $304.14M in 2013, representing a year-over-year growth rate of 83.9%. Free cash flow in Q1 2014 was $127.55M.Per the company's 10K:The company's strategy for growth is through acquisitions, and as ANSS sees increases in demand for its products, this strategy will increase its already strong global presence over time and provide value for shareholders. In 2011, ANSS acquired Apache Design Inc. for $314M, whose software allows users to maximize efficiency in electronics design. In 2012, Esterel was acquired for $58.2M, allowing the company to design, simulate, and automatically produce software itself. Applications range from aircraft, to energy systems and medical devices -- any industrial product with a CPU. In April 2013, Evolutionary Engineering AG, a provider of optimization technology for composites, was purchased for $8.1M. On January 3, 2014, Reaction Design was purchased for $19M. The provider of chemistry solutions in combination with ANSYS' computational fluid dynamics solutions will provide some of the best simulation tools on the market. Most recently in May, SpaceClaim, a 3D modeling software company, was purchased for $85M. These complementary companies have helped ANSYS to grow by both expanding its range of products and extending applications to new fields, as well as by using ANSYS's existing global scale to grow the acquired products itself.The company currently trades at a P/E of 28.12 and EPS of 2.64, which has shown steady increases year over year since 2009. Although a P/E of 28.12 is relatively high given the S&P average of 19.56, the company is still undervalued given its growth and potential growth catalysts. Additionally, management has stated that it intends to repurchase more stock in 2014, as it has in both 2012 and 2013. Since late 2013 the share price has stalled, but P/E has dropped significantly from its high, providing an opportunity for investors to pick up shares.Source: YCharts )Greg Satell of Forbes wrote an article titled, ""Why the Future of Innovation is Simulation"", which highlights the various benefits to simulations in an increasingly engineered world. The Institute for the Future also believes simulation and virtuality will be crucial in coming years. As the world we live in is dominated more and more each day by machines, and as the ""Internet of Things"" is looming, ANSS has given itself a tremendous opportunity for success. The market for simulation software is growing rapidly, and ANSYS' success thus far has allowed it to acquire complementing companies that grow its brand. I expect that ANSYS will continue on this path. Additionally, its strong free cash flow, zero debt, and high margins have positioned it well to capture a greater portion of the growing market for simulation software, and investors will see greater returns for it.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

(NASDAQ:ANSS) develops and globally markets engineering simulation software and services widely used by engineers, designers, researchers and students across a spectrum of industries and academia, including aerospace, automotive, manufacturing, electronics, biomedical, energy and defense. Its customers include 96 of the top Fortune 500 industrials.Recent Performance/EventsThe company's stock has recently suffered a sell-off after the acquisition of Reaction Design (a developer and seller of chemistry solution and simulation software) and the last earnings call. Here are some of the highlights of the company's performance in the last quarter of FY 2013.Source: Q4 2013 Earnings TranscriptOpportunityANSS PE Ratio (TTM)As seen in the chart above, the recent sell-off has caused the stock's PE ratio to slump to a cyclical low of ~28 which represents the perfect buying opportunity for investors.The main reason for the recent decline in share price in my view is the unjustified disappointment with the company's numbers for Q1 numbers. Ansys reported Q4 EPS of $0.96 versus a consensus of $0.86, which is almost a 12% positive surprise. However, revenue came in slightly shy of the consensus at $236 million vs. $237.84 million. However, this is an extremely minor issue, and if anything these results indicate the robust growth that the company has been experiencing for the last 5 years.Also, Ansys issued a non-GAAP guidance of $0.73-$0.76 for its Q1 2014 EPS versus the consensus of $0.76 and non-GAAP revenue of $210.5-219.0 million versus consensus of $217.84 million. It estimates FY 2014's revenue to be $935-$966 million versus consensus of $950.3 million. It has to be noted here that the company has an incredible track record in meeting expectations as illustrated in the following chart.Source: Q4 2013 Earnings Call Transcript (link above)Source: Past Earnings Transcripts and 10-KsThus, it is reasonable to estimate a revenue of ~$935 million (lower range of guidance) for the current fiscal year which translates to a potential year-over-year revenue growth rate of 8.6%.Positive Factors/CatalystsLow Debt, High Cash FlowThe company has an extremely healthy balance sheet with a high cash to debt ratio. What is even more notable is that the company financed all its recent acquisitions with existing cash reserves and did not have to dilute ownership or take on more debt.ANSS Cash Ratio (Annual)As seen above, the company's cash ratio has increased every year for the last 4 years with the exception of 2011 due to the Apache acquisition. In the recent earnings call, the company's management has emphasized that it intends to not only increase top-line growth through acquisitions but organically as well.Strategic AcquisitionsThe amount of cash spent on acquisitions in the last 5 years has been ~$400 million with the largest acquisition being Apache Design Solutions in June 2011 for a whopping $314 million. The latest acquisition was Reaction Design which was acquired just 2 months ago for $19 million.Recent acquisitions have strengthened Ansys' product portfolio. Both Apache (acquired in Aug 2011) and Esterel (acquired in Aug 2012) fit perfectly with Ansys' criteria. Both have outstanding technology that meshes with Ansys' product direction of end-to-end system simulation. Both have customer bases that complement Ansys and provide cross-selling opportunities.Since acquiring Apache, which focuses on power management for semiconductors and chips for mobile devices, Apache's revenues and margins have both exceeded expectations. Esterel, a leader in embedded software simulation, has solutions now being adopted in other industries that rely on certified embedded software, such as the automotive industry.The latest acquisition, Reaction Design, which uses its chemistry simulation software to help transportation and energy companies develop clean technologies, will supplement Ansys' computational fluid dynamics solutions to create a product unmatched in its class. All these acquisitions further strengthen Ansys' product portfolio helping to accelerate Ansys' growth. This shows that Ansys enjoys a persistently high free cash flow which it uses to make strategic acquisitions.Simulation/Virtual Prototyping Market Size Growing at Double DigitsThis is perhaps the most exciting factor contributing to Ansys' growth rates. At the most recent Investor's Day in Feb 2014, management estimated the simulation industry to grow to $20 billion in the next 5-7 years. A valid question to ask is, if the industry is indeed that large, then why hasn't it grown to that levels yet?There are multiple reasons for this, the first being a tremendous growth in computing power in the last 5 years and in near future due to increase in parallel computing trends. Simulation is a very computationally intensive task and the recent trends in computing make Ansys poised to reach new heights. A major barrier for companies desiring to adopt simulation based prototyping was the traditional IT infrastructure. In the past, if a company wanted to purchase simulation software, it had to do an in-house procurement for a machine that could run such computationally intensive software. With high computing power easily available in a standard 16 core machine, these concerns have been largely alleviated.ANSS Operating Revenue (TTM)The above chart shows various companies in the simulation industry having increased revenues for the past 10 years. Notably, Ansys is the smallest of them in terms of revenue but it is also clearly the fastest growing by far. The figure also illustrates the fact that there is an upwards macro trend in this industry given the increase in revenues that all players in the industry are enjoying. It is also worth noting that most companies enjoyed increases in revenue even during recessions (shaded area).Apart from benefiting from a general growth in the market size, the company has also taken advantage of certain market trends to provide unique solutions to its clients.Multiphysics CapabilitiesAs companies design increasingly complex smart products, they want to engage in multiphysics simulation and simulations of entire systems rather than single physics simulations. Notably, only 1/3 of customers have multiphysics capabilities; however, 2/3 of its customers have cross-functional design teams (structural engineers working with thermal engineers etc.) which would greatly benefit upgrading Ansys software capable of multiphysics simulation. An example of a design process needing multiphysics simulation would be in automotive design where in wind tunnel testing, there are structural elements as well as elements of fluid dynamics.Source: 2014 Investor Day (Video)High Performance Computing LeaderAnsys has had a long-term relationship with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the leader in GPUs, to ensure that it stays ahead in providing the best high performance computing solutions for its clients. 80% of Anysys' customers have HPC infrastructure; however, less than 10% actually make use of their HPC infrastructure. As multiphysics and simultaneous design points get adopted, the need for HPC will only increase. With engineers needing to scale up simulations dramatically on a global basis and tap into the cloud for extra capacity, the increasingly complex environment plays to Ansys' strengths. For example, in fluid dynamics, Ansys' closest competitor can scale up into a few hundred cores at 90% efficiency whereas Ansys' products can scale into 3000 cores at 90% efficiency. Ansys' pricing model for HPC is based on the marginal benefit a customer receives for running the additional analyses/simulations.Sources: 2014 Investor Day (Video Link Above), 2013 Investor Day SummaryEstimating Fair Value/UpsideANSS Profit Margin (Annual)As mentioned before, a reasonable estimate for this fiscal year's revenue is $935 million and profit margins for Ansys can be reasonably estimated at 28.5% based on the chart above which brings net earnings to $266.475 million. Since the company plans to repurchase 3 million shares this year, the number of outstanding shares would remain constant (after accounting for dilution) at about 92.54 million, bringing EPS to $2.879. Under the conservative assumption that the Ansys' P/E ratio remains at this cyclical low of 28.5, fair value for the underlying security would be $82. Assuming a more optimistic P/E of 35 would imply a fair value of $100. This represents an upside of ~11% and ~35%, respectively.Disclosure: I am long ANSS.

Non-GAAP earnings (excluding non cash stock option and acquired intangible expenses) advanced 29% to $.66 a share. Revenues climbed 27% to $177.9 million. Ansys completed its purchase of Apache in August. That unit was consolidated for two months. Excluding that contribution, organic growth was 20% year over year. Apache is a leading provider of engineering simulation software for power management applications, like smartphones and tablet computers. Its revenues are virtually all derived from annual subscription licenses. That pricing scheme has become more popular among Ansys' other product lines, too. Recurring revenues amounted to 70% of the total in Q3. The renewal rate topped 95%. A substantial, though undisclosed amount of revenue was generated by existing customers that expanded their relationship with the company. Ansys already has penetrated most of the Fortune 100. But it still has plenty of opportunity to expand by selling its software to additional business units.Ansys said backlog remained robust despite the questionable economy. Fourth quarter performance is likely to be excellent, fueled by the Apache transaction and a growing proportion of recurring revenues. Demand is continuing to rise in huge industries including automobile manufacturing, electronics, and energy production. Geographic strength is stable as well. Demand for engineering simulation technology is poised to keep growing well into the decade. Competition is compelling companies to invent products with original features, lower costs, and greater reliability. It also is exerting pressure on turnaround time. The software itself is improving with the help of academic research and internal efforts. A bigger factor though, is the ongoing improvement in parallel processing. Strings of high power computers now work together on extremely complex problems, sharing intermediate solutions as they go along, and also updating common databases. Instead of working through problems in a linear manner it's become increasingly feasible to break them down into separate parts and arrive at ""go -no go"" decision points more rapidly. Ansys also has improved user interfaces so problems can be set up quicker and more accurately. The trend away from physical testing to computer simulation is likely to continue. Ansys faces competition in several niche markets. But the company is unrivaled in its overall breadth. Small users may select a competitor for particular applications. Large companies with more extensive requirements probably will continue to standardize on Ansys.Solid gains are likely in 2012. We estimate sales will increase 19% to $825 million. Earnings could rise 14% to $2.90 a share. Our outlook assumes a relatively dismal economic scenario. Margins probably will finish higher if the environment is livelier. Order growth could moderate if conditions weaken. But a solid performance is anticipated nonetheless. Ansys' customer base is likely to emphasize simulation if their own businesses soften, as a tool for enhancing profitability and market share. They also will have the money to pay. Longer term, internally generated growth of 10%-20% appears sustainable. Ansys throws off substantial amounts of cash flow which should enable it to make further acquisitions without dilution.Click to enlarge:Disclosure: I am long ANSS."

790181,25084,2012-08-08T11:06:30-04:00,,"Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) reported excellent on target Q2 results. The company is the leading provider of engineering simulation software systems. Competition is provided by niche participants with specialties in narrow areas. Ansys is the industry's only broad based supplier. As a result, it has extensive relationships with large corporations, spanning all geographic markets. Margins are high due to the lack of direct competition. They also benefit from the high rate of return the software delivers, which allows Ansys to charge high prices and collect additional fees for upgrades and consulting services. Customers buy the packages either as perpetual licenses, which involve upfront fess and a 20% annual maintenance charge for upgrades; or as annual licenses, where they pay approximately 40% of the perpetual amount every year. Revenues currently break down 40% annual licenses, 30% perpetual licenses, and 30% maintenance.March quarter results revealed a shift from perpetual to annual licenses. That affected near-term revenue and income. Ansys also experienced a handful of order delays, impacting reported results further. The pendulum swung in the opposite direction in the June period. Perpetual deals bounced back to normal levels and orders closed on time. Performance benefited further from a pick-up in large (over $1.0 million) contracts (19 versus 8 the year before). Revenues improved 20% to $195.0 million as a result. Non-GAAP earnings rose 16% to $.72 a share. Part of the revenue improvement stemmed from an acquisition that was completed in 2012. Organic growth was 10%.Wall Street estimates were lifted following the strong showing. That enthusiasm probably was misplaced. Sales cycles have grown longer due to the economic slowdown. And the shift back and forth between perpetual and annual new business is likely to continue. Our full-year estimates are unchanged. Income appears on track to rise 13% to $2.85 a share. Next year $3.25 a share (+14%) remains a realistic target.The long-term outlook remains bright. Existing customers are likely to expand the number of engineers with access to the technology. Europe's largest airplane maker, EADS, recently announced a broad-based expansion, for example. Ansys is developing the mid-sized business market more thoroughly as well. Penetration of emerging geographies promises additional leverage. And the company earns so much money, per share results are certain to be amplified by share repurchases and acquisitions. Moreover, organic growth is likely to be maintained in the 10%-15% range, providing an ongoing tailwind.Engineering simulation technology remains in an early stage of development. Ansys has the potential to keep growing at above-average rates into the next decade. In 2-3 years, earnings could attain $4.25 a share. Applying a P/E multiple of 30x to those earnings -- realistic in light of the company's dominant market share, fantastic profitability, and the industry's open ended growth potential -- suggests a target price of $125 a share, potential appreciation of 90% from the current quote.Disclosure: I am long ANSS."

So it is fair to wonder whether this exciting new software release for ANSYS signals a temporary top in the stock. ANSS 3-yr chart:  ANSYS Version 10 was released on June 2, 2005. Turning to the stock chart, we see no evidence that the release had much of a short-term impact. The stock had been steadily climbing in advance of the release, but continued the steady climb after the release as well."
2210123,20630,2014-05-12T01:55:28-04:00,"Simulation software will drive technological innovation in many industries, including aerospace, automotive, manufacturing, electronics, biomedical, energy, and defense.Employing hundreds of highly skilled professionals such as engineers, physicists, and mathematicians, ANSS is projecting double-digit revenue growth in 2014.The U.S. is the company's largest market, but the revenue stream is geographically diversified with two-thirds of sales generated abroad.","Suppose you are an engineer and you are trying to design a new product. You might begin by creating a prototype. Chances are there will be some problems with the prototype and it won't work as expected. You would fix these problems in the next version of the prototype and test it again. If the product is very complicated, it could take several iterations before you get everything right and the final version is ready to go to market.This process can be extremely troublesome if the product includes electronic components. These components create electromagnetic waves that may interact with one another in undesirable ways. As a result, what looks great on a blueprint may end up being inoperable.These days, instead of building prototypes, design engineers rely on simulation software. The software allows them to create the product in virtual form on a computer. More importantly, the software allows the engineers to test the product by simulating how it will actually work in the real world. For example, if the product in question is a cellphone, the software can simulate how all of the electromagnetic waves from the electronic components would interact with one another. If the product is a Ferrari race car, the software can simulate all of the forces the car would experience at various speeds.Simulation software dramatically reduces the amount of time it takes to bring a product from concept to market and, as a result, it reduces the overall cost as well. Of course, the software must be reliable and error free, which is where ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANSS) excels. The company specializes in creating and marketing high quality simulation software. ANSYS relies on a highly skilled workforce that includes engineers, physicists, chemists, and mathematicians. The company has grown tremendously ever since it was founded more than four decades ago.ANSYS produces dozens of products that have a variety of technical applications. For example, engineers use the company's electronics simulation software to design robust and power-efficient integrated circuits, printed-circuit boards, communication infrastructures, and electromechanical systems. The company's computational fluid dynamics simulation software allows engineers to predict the impact of fluid flows on their products. HFSS software simulates three dimensional full-wave electromagnetic fields. This software is critical to engineers who are designing high-frequency and high-speed electronic components.ANSYS makes significant investments in research and development in order to create and market advanced products demanded by various industries. In fact, R&D expenditures averaged 17% of revenues during the past three years (see 2013 Form 10-K pages 5 and 55). The company focuses on ongoing development and innovation of new technologies to increase productivity and to provide engineering simulation solutions that customers can integrate into their product lifecycle management systems. Product development efforts focus on extensions of the full product line with new functional modules, further integration with computer aided design (CAD), electronic CAD, and product lifecycle management. The company's products run on widely used engineering platforms and operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and UNIX workstations.ANSYS distributes and supports its products through a global network of independent channel partners, as well as through its own direct sales force. Independent channel partners were responsible for about one quarter of total sales in each of the past three years (see 2013 Form 10-K pages 6, 26, and 30).The company has been an active acquirer, which is why it also carries a relatively large amount of goodwill on its balance sheet. According to the company's latest Form 10-Q filing (page 3), goodwill and intangible assets amount to $1.5 billion. In comparison, stockholders' equity is $2.2 billion. In recent years, however, acquisitions have been relatively small (see 2013 Form 10-K page 9). The most recent acquisition closed on May 1 when ANSYS bought SpeedClaim Corp., a 3-D modeling software provider, for $85 million. ANSYS also acquired Reaction Design, a developer of chemistry simulation software in January for $19 million, and Esterel Technologies, a provider of embedded software simulation solutions, in August 2012 for $58 million. A much larger acquisition occurred in August 2011 when ANSYS purchased Apache Design for $314 million. Apache Design is a simulation software provider for advanced, low-power solutions for electronics.ANSYS has a large number of customers; however, no single direct sales customer accounted for more than 5% of the company's total revenues in 2013. While ANSYS gets more revenues from U.S. customers than from any other region of the world, U.S. revenues amounted to just one-third of the total in 2013 (see 2013 Form 10-K page 78). Other important geographic markets include Japan (13%) and Germany (11%). All other European countries generated 23% of revenues, while other international markets generated 19% of revenues.Looking toward the future, strategic acquisitions will remain a top priority for the company (see Q1 2014 Investor Presentation, page 20); however, management is also projecting double-digit organic revenue growth for 2014. This would imply accelerating growth as GAAP revenues were up 7.9% in 2013 and 8.9% during Q1 2014. On a non-GAAP basis, management is projecting revenues of $939-969 million for 2014 and earnings of $3.25-3.37 per share.Of course, there are a number of investment risks to be concerned about. In particular, the company's business depends on the health of its customers' businesses as well as on the health of the overall global economy. While global economic conditions have improved slowly ever since the end of the financial crisis that began in 2008, there is always the possibility that economies could slip back into recession and reverse the gains made in recent periods.Furthermore, because approximately two-thirds of the company's revenues are generated abroad, ANSYS is exposed to all kinds of international risks, including unfavorable political climates and unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates.In addition, the company operates in an industry characterized by rapidly changing technologies and new product introductions. While ANSYS develops industry-leading software, competitors might come out with new products that could make the company's products obsolete. And while the company is very careful about quality control, there is always the possibility that its highly technical and sophisticated software could contain coding errors or flaws, resulting in returns and loss of sales.Using traditional price multiples, it is hard to argue that the shares are cheap. In fact, the stock has quadrupled in price since its 2009 low. Still, the shares are not unreasonably priced for a high-growth company. Furthermore, management is likely to support the stock price with share repurchases. In fact, management repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock in 2013 at an average price of $77.73 per share. That's on top of the 1.5 million shares it repurchased in 2012 at an average price of $63.65 per share. The board of directors recently replenished the company's share repurchase plan to three million shares of common stock and management stated its commitment to buy back more shares this calendar year.Undoubtedly, a growing number of businesses will come to rely on simulation software to help them develop all kinds of new and innovative products. This is especially true for companies that are working in highly technical fields that involve complicated electronics, or products that have to interact with the forces produced by fluids or winds. Because ANSYS is one of the leading companies in the simulation software industry, it is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this growing market. The company already has more than 40,000 customers all over the world, including virtually all of the top 100 industrial companies in the Fortune 500; yet there is still plenty of room to grow.Disclosure: I am long ANSS.

19800,20171,2006-11-02T16:04:40-05:00,,"Back in April we called Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) ""a neat little company,"" a leading provider of simulation software for engineers. It is able to model the physical forces that products will be exposed to. Not very long ago this technology was limited to a few high-level engineers with highly sophisticated computers. It is increasingly becoming usable by every designer with a recent model workstation, which offers a wide new market for Ansys and the ability to streamline workloads for Ansys’ customers. Then in May we did a complete fundamental workup, concluding: That was a good call, as the chart below illustrates. Unfortunately, we seem to have fallen asleep at the wheel since there were no further posts. Which is too bad, given today’s news: (15 minutes before close, they're still up a healthy 12.24%). ANSS 6-month chart:  Where were we in July, anyway? We’ll try to pay more attention next time."
10237,20171,2006-05-08T15:22:02-04:00,,"Software companies have unique characteristics that help investors spot potential positive or negative trends earlier than is possible for many other types of companies. Two of these characteristics are license revenue and deferred revenue. If these two line items are growing at a faster rate than overall sales the implications are generally positive for the company. If they are growing at a slower rate, investors may want to inquire further before making an investment decision. Here's why.
Software companies typically generate (at least) two types of income streams. License revenue is earned when the company provides the software itself. This gives the customer the right to use the software. Frequently customers also pay for maintenance and support, which could include updates, training and other support. It follows that the more computers a company’s software is installed on, the more need there will be for maintenance and support. So trends in licensing revenue can be an early indicator for the direction of future maintenance revenue. Software maker ANSYS (NASDAQ:ANSS) offers the following elaboration on page 22 of its recently filed 10Q:
The second indicator software companies have is deferred revenue, which is accrued when a customer pays for a service but does not get recognized as revenue until a later date. The reason for the delay in recognizing the revenue is that the service has not been fully provided. Consider antivirus software. Usually the customer pays a fee to receive not only the initial software package but also one or more year’s worth of updates that will protect against newly developed viruses. If the company is obligated to provide these updates it books a portion of the money received as deferred revenue, and recognizes it on the income statement on a pro rata basis as the support period elapses. Since today’s deferred revenue is tomorrow’s revenue, the deferred revenue line can be a useful indicator of future trends in revenue."
10238,20171,2006-05-08T15:42:00-04:00,,"ANSYS, Inc. (NASDAQ: ANSS) is a fast growing software maker with generally strong fundamentals. Although adjustments to normalize EPS would result in a $0.02-$0.03 reduction to Q106 EPS, the company beat estimates in the quarter by $0.07, rendering the normalizations somewhat moot. The strong fundamentals appear well recognized, as consensus estimates for revenue and EPS are higher than management guidance, which may justify a cautious approach toward building positions.
Income statement analysis
Sales growth - sales grew 22.5 per cent sequentially (and 22.3 per cent year/year) in the first quarter. Growth was strongest in the US and grew in all territories with the exception of Japan. On page 22 of the 10Q, the company notes:
With respect to revenue, on average, for the first quarter of 2006, the U.S. Dollar was approximately 6.8% stronger, when measured against the Company’s primary foreign currencies, than for the first quarter of 2005. The U.S. Dollar strengthened against the British Pound, the Japanese Yen, the Indian Rupee and the Euro, while it weakened against the Canadian Dollar. The overall strengthening resulted in decreased revenue and operating income during the 2006 first quarter, as compared with the corresponding 2005 first quarter, of approximately $1.1 million and $600,000, respectively.
As we have discussed before, it is important to realize the impact of foreign currency and separate it from any underlying sales trends. In this case, currency is hurting and a weaker dollar would boost revenue even more.
On page 22, the company also notes a potential sign that the revenue growth was not sustainable:
The increase in revenue is primarily due to the following reasons:
•  newly generated software license revenue of $6.3 million, including $3.3 million related to an order with a long-standing major customer
Such one-time large sales may not happen regularly. Given that it accounted for half of the increase in license revenue it is something to understand.
Sales quality
Seasonality – there is no apparent seasonality to revenues, but a look at past trading patterns suggests a high propensity for the stock to sell off in January. Investors considering selling should do so near year-end, and those considering a late-year buy may wish to wait until January.
Earnings quality
Balance sheet analysis
Cash flow analysis
Operating cash flow and net income trends – although net income was up by more than $3 million compared to the year-ago quarter, cash from operations declined by almost $3 million.
Of the $6 million change in the relative balance, $2 million is due to the change in accounting for the excess tax benefit from stock options, which is now included in financing rather than operating cash flows. The remainder is due to increased working capital, which appears reasonable given the dramatic increase in sales levels compared to the year-ago period. Although the cash-flow to net income relationship should be monitored closely over the next couple of quarters to see if the balance is restored, it does not seem cause for major concern at this time.
Free cash flow and net income trends – Free cash flow will be limited in 2006, particularly if the Fluent acquisition is considered as an alternative form of capex.
